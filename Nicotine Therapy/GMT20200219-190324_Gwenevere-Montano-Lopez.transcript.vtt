20
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Me too, me too. So let's talk about what the last sort of 24 hours have been like for you. You were going to go to the gym. Oh, what did you notice that was kind of different about your thinking maybe

21
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.540
Matthew Montano: I'm

22
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.600
Matthew Montano: What's different about my team came

23
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Just now I forcing that you don't have to do that, let me ask a different question for you.

24
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.240
Matthew Montano: Okay.

25
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you like about yesterday.

26
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.690
Matthew Montano: I feel like

27
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.180
Matthew Montano: I'm on a healing journey, a healing journey now. Oh.

28
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Starting okay

29
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in the rumination what if, what if, what if it's your you're feeling like you're healing.

30
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.780
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I'm, I'm feeling like I'm ready to go with the flow and

31
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:37.020
Matthew Montano: You know, okay, but let let's do it the way it's both supposed to be done. Okay. Okay.

32
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And just so you know, Matthew. That takes a lot of trust to trust and another person.

33
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It to trust in me to trust in the therapeutic process.

34
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you had big moments where people weren't there.

35
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: when you needed them so it doesn't surprise me that there's been a sort of, let's keep it. Let's keep it light, we don't need to talk about that. Let's talk about want ba ba.

36
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But none of that surprises me. It makes sense that you would do that, but I'm excited that you're interested in. Let me in a little bit more

37
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.010
Matthew Montano: Yeah, for sure.

38
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, and then you only have to be Matt, you don't have to be therapist to then you only need to do one thing.

39
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.210
Yeah.

40
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you might have to also be empty. Sometimes

41
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.470
Matthew Montano: Yeah, yeah, there you go.

42
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, oh alright so what you know there's not always a lot a lot of time to process when we left off. We left with a lot of the aspect that was you know you're giving yourself permission to feel

43
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I think safe enough to cry. And that's the second time you've told me, I'm not used to this crime that was a no go zone in my indoctrination as a young person, you just don't do it.

44
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like for you to cry.

45
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:27.390
Matthew Montano: I even after we got off the video I was kept crying for a little bit, but it after word. It was like a huge relief.

46
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:42.600
Matthew Montano: A huge relief. It just felt like, you know, just like just a relief because when I'm when I'm tense when I'm stressed when I'm having a bad day.

47
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.170
Matthew Montano: I don't ever cry ever

48
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, get a little, a little release a little hormonal relief when we, when we, when we cry.

49
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.800
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah yeah

50
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.860
Matthew Montano: Well, I know a lot of criers and

51
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.250
Matthew Montano: They say

52
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.850
Matthew Montano: I'm not gonna bring up the new ones name.

53
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.210
Matthew Montano: Cuz I'm trying to the rocket took off. You know, I'm gonna bring up that person anymore but

54
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.050
Matthew Montano: But a

55
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: crier. So you have an opinion you formulated an opinion about criers. What is it,

56
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.270
Matthew Montano: That they cry, they get it out and they they feel better afterwards.

57
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.410
Matthew Montano: And me holding stuff in just

58
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.770
Matthew Montano: builds and builds and builds and then it becomes an outburst. Right. Yeah.

59
00:05:43.980 --> 00:06:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So for a lot of people. And then let's dip into doing some of the techniques together just to process a little bit more around this crying for some people, the unconscious belief is I have so much stored up inside if I dip into that pool.

60
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll overwhelming. So I won't defend at all.

61
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So that oftentimes the the undercurrent of why there's avoidance and not wanting to do it. It's not only the conditioning of childhood, but now it's like well now it's too late now. I done waited so long. It's just going to be too much. So if you ever find yourself with that.

62
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to remind you that you cried.

63
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And they talked and you cry and you talked, and you went to the gym yesterday.

64
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.530
Matthew Montano: Yeah, right. Um,

65
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah we wait and you went to the gym.

66
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You did your life. It did not overwhelm you.

67
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay not history happened you touched it. You touched that sorrow.

68
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were okay you are okay. You're here to talk about it.

69
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I want you to remember

70
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:03.780
Matthew Montano: It. Yeah.

71
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Ultimately, it's okay, you're okay.

72
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.550
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

73
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me do a little bit of nosing around into our other know here.

74
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Jason 19

75
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.990
Matthew Montano: And

76
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. Just, just want to, I like to start with really sort of basic human function stuff.

77
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Like to know if there was any alcohol consumption any use of the Suboxone over or under, over the last 24 hours.

78
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:49.140
Matthew Montano: Last night after I went to the gym with my buddy. We did go have a couple drinks at Applebee's

79
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

80
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.830
Matthew Montano: What did had dinner and a couple of drinks.

81
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of drinks.

82
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.110
Matthew Montano: I'm not big on beers. So I had a couple of jack and cokes.

83
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: To three or four

84
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.730
Matthew Montano: Three. Okay.

85
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how you tended to want to minimize a little bit with me. Just pay attention to it. Okay.

86
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that you don't have to go negative. Just pay attention to it. Everybody does the same thing.

87
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:27.210
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

88
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple or when he asked a little further to is usually it's twice as much typically it's twice as much. It's okay. Since, right. So, um, did you get a buzz.

89
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.260
Matthew Montano: Little, little, I would say a buzz. Yeah, a bus. I wasn't wasted.

90
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.270
Okay.

91
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you want to keep drinking

92
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.170
Matthew Montano: No, actually, my friend.

93
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:08.820
Matthew Montano: And he's he's not a big drinker, neither he, he had the he works at five o'clock in the morning he works for this has a real good job. He wanted to keep drinking and I kind of

94
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:20.820
Matthew Montano: He we afterward. We came to my house and I was like, maybe it's time for I kind of sent. I was like, Bro, you're, you're drinking, it's time for you to get an Uber and go home.

95
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, interesting. So something else could it happen. Hmm.

96
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.510
Matthew Montano: Something else could happen.

97
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It could happen.

98
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.960
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

99
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me how your I'm on the road to healing matches and later on how it doesn't match how you did last night. So let's go with how it matches. I'm on the road to healing. Tell me some ways that you make sure that you contributed to your healing. What did you do

100
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:54.810
Matthew Montano: Yesterday,

101
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.260
Matthew Montano: I went to the gym.

102
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.960
Matthew Montano: I

103
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.940

Matthew Montano: Visit I went to my dad's house visited with him for a while.

105
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:26.670
Matthew Montano: And, um, and then the going to Applebee's thing was more about just having a nice little mill and having a

106
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.850
Matthew Montano: Little reward after the gym.

107
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a part of the healing or is that in the others other screen here of things that are not supportive of this journey.

108
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We can let's decide later. Let's come back to that one. Yeah, we got Jim. We've got laundry went to Dad's house. Those are definitely part of your healing. Right.

109
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.810
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I've been keeping my house really clean. Okay.

110
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:13.590
Matthew Montano: You know, when people are in Fairbanks their houses get really my get really, really nasty or really cluttered mind just I'm keeping everything clean and, you know, happy environment. Happy environment.

111
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: If you weren't on a journey of healing. How might last night have gone

112
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.240
Matthew Montano: I would have got in wasted.

113
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:36.480
Matthew Montano: I would have said a my friend actually asked me if I could find cocaine last night and I told him no, we're not doing that.

114
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked you to do keep keep kick on what else did you do

115

Matthew Montano: Uh, he said, Let's go get some more beer. I said, No, we're just IT WAS JUST I WAS JUST planning on having those few drinks at Applebee's

116
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.830
Matthew Montano: And

117
00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:06.270
Matthew Montano: Then he was he just kept persistently asking to get cocaine and I kept telling them. No, no, no, no.

118
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.590
Okay.

119
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:23.370
Matthew Montano: And I was like, and I was like, dude, you it's it's one o'clock in them. It's one almost one o'clock in the morning, you got to work at five, you don't be stupid and he's a really smart guy, you know, so

120
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's let's down that one. The train of direction you're going right now that's not on a stick with what you did can't control what they do smart not smart. Whatever. This is what you did. You did.

121
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you have hooked up with him also

122
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.840
Matthew Montano: No, he's as he's as straight as an arrow.

123
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so

Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see what it was.

126
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you prioritize

127
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Ahead of pleasing this guy.

128
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Making him like you whatever impression management is involved in going with. Let's go get coke. Let's go get

129
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasted all more beer. What did you instead prioritize. Let's name it once you prioritize

130
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.090
Matthew Montano: My recovery.

131
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember the thought you had

132
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.910
Matthew Montano: I was thinking about the session, we had yesterday.

133
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What about it.

134
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.810
Matthew Montano: I thought that was

135
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.420
Matthew Montano: That's what I need, in my life.

136
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.150
Matthew Montano: to hash out those things that I still hold inside of me.

137
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.960
Matthew Montano: That are holding me back from being who I really want to be

138
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there a part of what happened in that exercise yesterday in that room right

139
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That

140
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is getting close to your getting the actual need yet versus alcohol, cocaine,

141
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of sex, whatever else. Is it possible that you may have been addressing an underlying need the actual need

142
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we getting close.

143
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.750
Matthew Montano: Yes.

144
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cool.

145
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me see.

146
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.700
What did we do I get into that room. Take a peek at it.

147
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, we didn't finish it. So let's let's keep working this again this room. We got about

148
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How we see how far we get really my mom was a good mom for a long time and he did her, she could understand. I really wanted my mom to be there after she got to forsman Oh, they were closer together auchi

149
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: French vacation brother got the better years

150
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: They had more of a connection.

151
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Fostering kids and then seeing that girl pool. He really put yourself through a wringer in this one.

152
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're like brother mother foster girl, ouch, ouch. Zing zing zing. Okay, I got you. So we're about

153
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, maybe a fourth of the way through this, because there's big pieces of this that I'd like to get through with you.

154
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna like the outcome. Just remember that.

155
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: The goal of this anchor room the destination is it has everything you need in it.

156
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's there for you imagery as an actual skill. It's a coping skill that you can go to this place in the future. Plenty of people do it becomes almost as useful and important as the breathing that they can go in there.

157
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And work out whatever

158
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean.

159
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.670
Matthew Montano: Because we

160
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So much better when we're feeling safe when we have all our needs met. We can problem solve a whole lot better. We can identify. Well, what am I really want right now I need to work this out.

161
00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe my dad isn't around maybe I don't have someone to reach out to as a friend and I can't schedule anything with my therapist. I've just got me.

162
00:16:53.610 --> 00:17:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you can go to this space. So I want to continue to develop it, it has been so useful to so many people. And I want it available to you.

163
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:03.600
Matthew Montano: So,

164
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get back into it. Okay, I'm gonna bring it down a little bit, doesn't mean you do the same thing you might, it might be a completely different experience. But the big invitation. The overarching experience is the MP was about 13 and

165
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: In a sense, it began with, I need help.

166
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I need help. And so just kind of bringing you there. Maybe I would invite you to close your eyes and give yourself this chance to kind of

167
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Tuning less to what you see

168
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.170
Matthew Montano: And

169
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: More into how you feel.

170
00:17:44.460 --> 00:18:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a part of our brain called the insula, which allows you to look inward and know how you're feeling inside. It's amazing. This is a separate part of the brain and knows how to do that. Okay, it's not taking in new information out here what whatever your looks like.

171
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's how is Matt feeling lousy

172
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So to the degree that you're comfortable you can open and close your eyes as you need to look back to H

173
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Developing this room and some of the pieces that we noticed our it's nicely nicely decorated and it's a bright warm summer day, you can kind of see through the window, the clouds. Right.

174
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see windows open and you notice on your skin little cool breeze coming in.

175
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.710
Right.

176
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:42.060
Now,

177
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything that you're facing this day.

178
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got everything you need in there.

179
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever issue you're facing this day.

180
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You have everything you need.

181
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to continue to scan this room, and I'd like you to look around and give yourself permission to notice what new things come up. Keep looking around this room.

182
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And once you just see if there is anything on the walls, there's any other furniture items. And then we're going to take a look at the door, if that's how you got there just ticket, nice and slow. Kind of look around.

183
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you get to Rome. Do you know

184
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Any catch uncensored your first response. There's no wrong way to do this activity.

185
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.700
Matthew Montano: I would say my mom took me into the room. There we go.

186
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And if she's still there.

187
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.890
Matthew Montano: She is she's still there. Yeah. If yeah

188
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If that changes, that's fine too. Again, no wrong way to do this. You just need to do this Uncensored, you have a big piece of a people pleaser piece of it that we got to be really mindful of. You don't want to do that. You don't want to be the good client.

189
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.930
Matthew Montano: Yeah, oh yeah, I know I tried put try and put on good Facebook.

190
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to. I want you to be my worst, most difficult. OK.

191
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.770
Matthew Montano: OK.

192
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.050
Matthew Montano: OK.

193
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do, but I don't like the conscious, deliberate stuff, but hopefully gives you permission to oh I just saw this and no one doesn't want to hear that. No, I do.

194
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I do. I just felt sick to my stomach. I do want to know.

195
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And just

196
00:20:51.180 --> 00:21:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you are moving you're moving around. And there's this sort of still this energy moving. We're still an energy. Right. I want to know about those things. There's no wrong way, whatever's coming up for you. That's what I'm interested in.

197
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go there again.

198
00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: There is this this 13 year old and mom knew what to do. And she brought you in there.

199
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back there and and really let's now pay attention to another sense

200
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's really old we we creatures. We've been using our sense of smell, for a long time.

201
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole separate part of the brain is to process what we smell.

202
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can notice what MP notices in there. What's the smell in our room.

203
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.390
Matthew Montano: I used to like the

204
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.390
Matthew Montano: Smell of her purse.

205
00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: just noticed that

206
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You present with it. Isn't it amazing being all that you can summon that back into your awareness.

207
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that something. There it is.

208
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes with it comes other sensations other emotions. Other thoughts, what's coming up for you.

209
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.730
Matthew Montano: It's making me emotional you

210
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.310
Yeah, okay.

211
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a strong one for us that sense of smell.

212
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I can trigger a very large network memories and experiences.

213
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's emotional. What would you, what would you label the emotion that you're feeling right now, do you think that is

214
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:05.820
Matthew Montano: Like a sense of loss like I didn't get something that

215
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:07.830
Matthew Montano: I deserved.

216
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a longing.

217
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a like.

218
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: A wanting it. It's still not here. I'm still longing for it and I deserved it. Right.

219
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.520
Matthew Montano: Codes are filling of

220
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.220
Matthew Montano: I don't think I'll be able to

221
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.170
Matthew Montano: That what that isn't there anymore. My mom's a different person now.

222
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and it's not available to you anymore that window has passed his clothes, you don't get to have it.

223
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:53.220
Matthew Montano: Yeah, and I can come from myself with, you know, I have

224
00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:02.010
Matthew Montano: Like I'm really close to my had to choose, almost like a she's become more of a mother figure to me what I need advice.

225
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:03.630
Matthew Montano: No.

226
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.470
Okay.

227
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear you my word that's stay here with me. Let's go back in. We've got more work to do. And now, okay.

228
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So the amazing thing about this room.

229
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the longing doesn't

230
00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We get to have exactly what we want in here.

231
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to have what you want. So with that smell comes exactly mom knowing just what to do. Can you picture she knows just what to do to take care of you in your longing.

232
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you see her doing what is she noted to

233
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:51.600
Matthew Montano: Just listen and embrace me

234
00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So, picture it see her eyes, recognizing your pain and your, your need.

235
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: To really be heard and embraced. She knows just what to do.

236
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the smell as she's there embracing you

237
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how it feels.

238
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: They're

239
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There.

240
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing how to do that. She knows what to do. You don't even have to ask her.

241
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to

242
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Find out if her embrace is honest if it's conditional if she has some if fans or she genuinely listening and embracing you

243
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.830
Matthew Montano: I feel like

244
00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:09.510
Matthew Montano: She's genuine, but she did know she does, she didn't know how she didn't understand what else boy.

245
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's add to it. That's so smart, hold on to that I want you to tune into the body, not one that is called a dissonance. You can tell

246
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something missing. So pay attention to your body. See what parties activated right now which one is saying there's something still off about what's happening with mom, she doesn't know how to do this.

247
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.060
Okay.

248
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.730

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Really doesn't know what to do. That was coming from, from one of your right. She doesn't know what to do. It would have been nice if she did your mom, your mom didn't know what to do. So let's take that that truth.

255
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like you. I know it may seem foreign but I want you to turn and really attuned to your own body.

256
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Builders. Those are usually pretty good communicators.

257
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Party.

258
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.030

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.280
Matthew Montano: They're not. They're not tense right now.

261
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's happening.

262
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.610
Matthew Montano: I guess, cuz

263
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:22.230
Matthew Montano: I'm crying. Well, I guess, but the the tensing of the shoulders of the tensing of the neck and the back. The sweaty palms is a when I'm holding stuff it

264
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so go let's go to the tears, close your eyes like we want to get in this room. We want to get this constructed for you.

265
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So go there.

266
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And now we're going to tune into the tears the tears are now informing what needs to happen. Yes.

267
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There's an awareness that mom doesn't really know what to do.

268
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna, we're going to address that now.

269
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is may seem silly, but I'd like you to give a voice to those tears.

270
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: To imagine if it isn't your mom. Maybe it's someone else it can be anybody allow that first

271
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Response

272
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: To emerge. There's going to be someone some resource that knows how to teach your mom how to take care of you. Who knows how to teach mom just what you need. She needs to know from someone how to really listen

273
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And embrace

274
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.270

Gwenevere Abriel: To see appear. How can we make that resource available.

278
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.290
Matthew Montano: I remember

279
00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:02.160
Matthew Montano: One time hearing them arguing and my dad telling my mom.

280
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:13.800
Matthew Montano: You're not being there for Matt right now. I'm having to be play the role of his mother and his father.

281
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:21.540
Matthew Montano: When she was going through a lot of print depression and stuff. I remember hearing them arguing in

282
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.310
Matthew Montano: Order to

283
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to that.

284
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a memory. And what I'd like you to do.

285
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Is without a mixture

286
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Of feelings and thoughts. Let's scan. One more time. You didn't do did nothing wrong. Now you did it beautifully. You did it beautifully stay there. Again, let's go back to this room may not be ready to have dad just yet.

287
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Back in there. My eyes are closed. I'm not staring at you.

288
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It might just be the quality of dad.

289
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Might just something he has the knowledge, take out a little twisted up having heard something through the door. So it's not as pure

290
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And simple as it was, had you not heard that through the door. So I don't want to go to that one just yet. So there's a quality, though the dead has as a nurturer

291
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Who else can we summon in to this space. They can teach mom.

295
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: First for this to happen organically. Your mom needs to know how to do what she needs to learn

296
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And so

422
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.100
Matthew Montano: That's why.

423
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.250
Matthew Montano: That's why you do this.

424
00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are really hard things to hear because I think there's

425
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there's a lot of truth to it really hard to hear it's it's ugly and it's hard to hear.

426
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.110
Matthew Montano: And she would um

427
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.480
Matthew Montano: I would never say that to somebody who I had a

428
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:31.950
Matthew Montano: You know who hadn't hurt me so much right there wasn't so much emotion evolve, but but like my mom when I went to would go visit her would start the conversation with

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.600
Matthew Montano: am angry, angry.

434
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:57.660
Matthew Montano: I said, that's my, my dad. My dad was been there for me. Way more than you've ever been there for me so

435
00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep telling me that keep telling me you

436
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:09.600
Matthew Montano: Don't, don't. I came to visit you. I came here, I don't have to come here and visit you. I don't have to be there.

437
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:29.280
Matthew Montano: My brother and his wife and your three nieces have separated themselves from you. You have no one and all I do when I come to visit you is you talk about my dad you talk about his wife, you talk about my brother, you talk about his wife.

438
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: One more time. What are you going to do

439
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:33.840
Matthew Montano: If what

440
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm negative again. What are you going to do

441
00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:41.220
Matthew Montano: I'm not not coming back. I'm not coming back to visit you.

442
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it feel like to say that

443
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:46.230
If

444
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:51.510
Matthew Montano: It feels good. It feels like I'm taking a stand.

445
00:47:55.890 --> 00:48:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm in my alcoholism and of course with addiction comes a lot of selfishness it addiction doesn't care about their children. It just doesn't

446
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It just only cares about

447
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Escape from shame when you get out of there, not wanting to feel certainly doesn't care.

448
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:25.410
Matthew Montano: It's funny because my mom nurtured me loved me.

449
00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:38.400
Matthew Montano: So much was worse, she still loves me. She adores me. She just we don't we don't. It's just too much, too much of a tweet too much clashing

450
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.120
Matthew Montano: But it lasted up until I was about

451
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:49.830
Matthew Montano: Low 1415 years old that there's just a complete disconnect

452
00:48:53.610 --> 00:49:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll shift down in this role play a little bit. And let's do some processing with a little bit of time today went by really fast. Am I right.

453
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:01.470
Yeah.

454
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.950
Matthew Montano: Yes, he does. Yeah.

455
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So go in

456
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And reflect about what is important, what's valuable about this experience for you today. Take it nice and easy.

457
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.330
Matthew Montano: Relief

458
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.370
Relief

459
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It does take time.

460
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't rush it. You don't take, we don't know.

461
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What got start

Matthew Montano: Yeah, I'm sorry. Reach for relief.

464
00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice what happened.

465
00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Interpersonal least. So notice how I was or wasn't there for you. Just notice what did it feel like to tell me about your feelings, your experience with another human who didn't make it about herself. What was that like

466
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.600
Matthew Montano: When you're playing my mom.

467
00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:34.050

Matthew Montano: It felt good.

472
00:50:49.740 --> 00:51:07.020
Matthew Montano: Because she wasn't coming back, cuz she would automatically be my mom can get ugly. She'd say, oh, if, if I say don't talk about my dad like that. She'd say, oh fuck your dad, he, he did this or that. It's hot. It's awful. The thing.

473
00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:08.070
Very

474
00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.020
Matthew Montano: Very ugly. Yeah.

475
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to be around that.

476
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.490

481
00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're asking my advice. I will give you my opinion, but I don't know what's right for you notice but but reflect on your own truth.

482
00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:57.690

491
00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:48.330
Matthew Montano: The way he put it, but it's it's the truth. That's the truth.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:17.910

Gwenevere Abriel: helium balloon and send it off and give it to her, don't know what you're going to do with it. But let's get it written. Let's get it written down what's left in this anger and resentment.

522
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:45.630

523
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This way it can land on the paper when we visit the room. Something else might happen in there. Once that anger gets written on the paper. Okay. Can you do that, can you leave here and just kind of scribble down some some leftover thoughts.

539
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:50.100
Joshua Lopez: One. One of the guys. He was work that he worked with in the same department for a long time, had to give me as an so training safety observation training.

541
00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:07.620
Joshua Lopez: That they don't just put anybody there that you know only people that they feel happy about and can handle it so that that made me feel real good. Um,

Joshua Lopez: It but you know i'll be off every other Monday, so that all not contradict the group will have days off during the week, which I can always schedule individuals with you and my schedule is printed out for the entire year. So

544
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:47.790
Joshua Lopez: You know, it'll make it easy to communicate with you. But yeah, I love that job. It's very awesome in very satisfying being there.

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, I'm saying that. Yeah, the connection went a little bad

548
01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to say that you sound so so much more energized.

549
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.570

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I guess we lost connection to bad dog on it.

552
01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:28.830
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, and then also I moved out of my parents house which

553
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you move out.

554
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:43.350
Joshua Lopez: Two weeks ago, they, they were just giving me so much more stress and things like, you know, it just

555
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:49.500
Joshua Lopez: It was real negative to be around them. It just they're making life harder.

556
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.620
Joshua Lopez: So I finally just we got into it. I grabbed my stuff and I left.

557
01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:04.410
Joshua Lopez: Last week was kind of a rough go because I found a place like an extended stay hotel. It was really rough

558
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:21.840
Joshua Lopez: Wasn't the greatest place to be. This week, however, I found a decent place. It's like a studio. It's not permanent. But it's definitely something I could be out for the next couple of months, how I find a better situation, but it's it's it's fairly nice

559
01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:32.370
Joshua Lopez: You know, I've went and got me COMFORTER SETS pillows, like, you know, just stuff that you need when you move into a place which felt really really good it felt

560
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.810
Joshua Lopez: You know,

561
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:44.550
Joshua Lopez: Gratifying I guess is the word. Awesome. And it's, it's definitely different. It did help me my confidence grew up a bit.

562
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I was gonna ask about you've

563
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.410
Joshua Lopez: Got a goal. And I had to turn off the video because this

564
01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.030
Joshua Lopez: Internet here is not this

565
01:01:51.330 --> 01:02:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm glad you said that because one of your goals is increased self confidence. So as you were shopping and realizing right you have this this predictable income coming in.

566
01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what the thought was, as you were shopping

567
01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:11.070
Joshua Lopez: Net

568
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: On gone it

569
01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.420
Joshua Lopez: I do apologize this internet is bad.

570
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So what were you thinking when you were shopping. Let me hear some of your thoughts about yourself that really represent this this renewed confidence.

571
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.590
Joshua Lopez: Um, it just

572
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:35.040
Joshua Lopez: Kind of starting to feel like myself again.

573
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:45.150
Joshua Lopez: Of course my daughter went with me. So she was helping me pick stuff out and you know she she was excited to help me decorate it

574
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.980
Joshua Lopez: You know it did feel it did feel gratifying. It felt like

575
01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.680
Joshua Lopez: It's a new chapter of my life.

576
01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:59.880
Joshua Lopez: My parents. I didn't feel like that. I just felt like I was stuck. I felt like I was not going forward.

577
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:11.430
Joshua Lopez: But I do feel I do feel like I'm actually going forward. It's a bit scary, but the same time it's like it's happening. You know, I'm kind of just living in that moment.

578
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:25.440
Joshua Lopez: Having a good job really helps you know it's not the first time in my life I feel like I don't just have a job actually have a career, something I can retire in you know it's an awesome place to be. Definitely.

579
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it

580
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:29.550
Yeah.

581
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Man is this long overdue.

582
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.440
Yeah.

583
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, now that new chapter begins right you know away from your family that's super smart, but thank goodness they were there while you kind of work through this this period of time.

584
01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you have a, you know, you have this career developing and you're in a place. I'm assuming it's like a month to month kind of least

585
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:04.770
Joshua Lopez: Um, it is, but it's more weekly. It's a bit expensive but

586
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:15.450
Joshua Lopez: I working to build my credit to get an actual place and the time being. This is a place that allows me to be here without going credit

587
01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:22.620
Joshua Lopez: So that's a bit pricey, but it's kind of what I have to do, you know, okay.

588
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine. So, do you know what your score is have you actually like gone on a Credit Karma credit score whatever and checked it out or or kind of found out with these three there's three bureaus that check your credit you know what it is, these days.

589
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:52.200
Joshua Lopez: I do not, I was looking at rent to own houses and they connected me to some law firm to help rebuild my credit and they did like a

590
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.450
Joshua Lopez: Summary and it didn't sound like it was good.

591
01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:10.500
Joshua Lopez: So I'm going to be working with with them to rebuild my credit. I didn't give them permission to pull it yet because it was going to cost money. And at that time I didn't have the money to do there.

592
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Are free places. I mean, you obviously

593
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But there are places I know credit

594
01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Karma. I've certainly pulled mine from there just to take a peek.

595
01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:24.540
Okay.

596
01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.310
Joshua Lopez: That

597
01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.380
Should see

598
01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.770
The credit report.

599
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.150
See

600
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Says credit report all three bureaus that one's 10 bucks. That's pretty cheap. If you can get all three. That's better. Credit Karma my record, trying to remember if they do all three bureaus.

601
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I get my free credit score.

602
01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is all news to you this this concept that there are places that you can get it for free.

603
01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:15.150
Joshua Lopez: I'm not really I just a thing in the years that I knew my credit was bad that I just kind of like scared to look at it.

604
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:24.120
Joshua Lopez: But it's, it's, you know, I'm learning now to deal with these problems to hit them head on.

605
01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:37.350
Joshua Lopez: So I'll definitely be looking at it. I will. I know like this situation. I mean, living at where I'm at. It's not permanent. And in order to move forward. I do. Got to address my credit

606
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:45.420
Joshua Lopez: And that's something that I will be tackling for sure. I'm not going to put it off anymore. I'm not going to be there.

607
01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:46.920
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, me too.

608
01:06:48.660 --> 01:07:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sometimes it's people have stolen your name and if you're not paying attention to it. They can be running credit cards, and they can be damaging your credit to. So even if you put aside.

609
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you've done some work. I hope around shame and you said, Okay, that's not an option. I just need to go do the next

610
01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Solution. What do I need to do. Okay, and you did and you found this this organization that works with an attorney.

611
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But there are some things that you can be doing yourself, which is pulling your own score you can. There's letters that you can write yourself and send them to a bureau and you can advocate for yourself and say this isn't me

612
01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you can call lenders yourself and say, I'd like to set up a payment plan so that I can pay this debt down

613
01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: your right foot, you know, you're avoiding it doesn't help anything but you sound like you're starting to get more confident, my, my only concern was

614
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: When I heard the word attorney. I got, like, well, they're expensive.

615
01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All of a sudden I got like

616
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, that might be a good thing to pay for. We

617
01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead.

618
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:12.960
Joshua Lopez: And that's one of the reasons why I stopped them when they did the summary. They're like, oh, for $5 you know

619
01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:29.100
Joshua Lopez: will pull your credit and then you'll be charged X amount of dollars, monthly, and I was like, whoa, wait, pump the brakes. I'm if I could afford to pay you guys that monthly I would rather put that towards bills. So I put that I told him you know I stopped him right there.

620
01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.500
Joshua Lopez: And I, you know, I was like, if it's something I want to do. I will contact you guys

621
01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:48.360
Joshua Lopez: But, uh, I want to explore my other options and talking with you. It sounds like there's a lot. I can do myself without involving them. So I definitely did not make any commitments to them. I just you know i i agree with you.

622
01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:58.440
Joshua Lopez: It was pretty expensive. And I'm like, you know, I, I, not in a position to add more debt or more deals to myself right now.

623
01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

624
01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just this is literally me just going on the internet took me two seconds. So how do I get a free credit report. Well, that's what you want is you want to see you want to look in trans union.

625
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Equifax and I forget, I forget the third one, they may only do two I'm transit Equifax, there's, there's one more. So, this one looks like you get it free. But you don't get all three. See how it says Credit Karma offers free credit reports for two of the major credit bureaus.

626
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's pretty common.

627
01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That there's what I've noticed is they'll be a report that's consistent with

628
01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Two of them, but the third one like it'd be like a student loan that that only that one goes to this third one, this won't give you the full picture, but it will give you what you need is some to get past of fear. You got to get past right

629
01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:57.450
Joshua Lopez: Before

630
01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I get past this first fertile. So it's a it's free. You create an account you sit here and you just create an account only takes a couple minutes you we pull your credit report from these two unions, the credit

631
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Trans union and Equifax and highlight important items to make the reports easier to understand your course can be updated weekly. You can check on as often as you want. We also show your credit scores from these two

632
01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Locations, along with a breakdown of factors that can impact it we show you offers that could save you money like lower interest rates, blah, blah, blah. So ignore that stuff.

633
01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If you take an offer from one of our advertising partners, they make money. So they're trying right they're offering something for free. They do.

634
01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: They're trying to make this available to us, but they are hoping that maybe you'll, you know, they'll make some money by you taking on these other things. But you don't have to. So if you don't see any offers you like, no worries. Credit Karma will always be free.

635
01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

636
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So you read through

637
01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Find out what's in there for you just to get past this big scary hurdle.

638
01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: There's that and then

639
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What did I just said.

640
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:12.060
Three.

641
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.610
Years ago.

642
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:25.290
Joshua Lopez: And I think the sooner I do this the better of course but um when they get that summary there was something that popped up on there that I

643
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:36.900
Joshua Lopez: Pretty sure isn't me I'm like you said, people can can get you like that. They, they were saying that I went into collection with PNM which is the electrical company out here.

644
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:57.540
Joshua Lopez: Okay, January 2020 and I have not had PNM under my name in years. So the fact that I went into collection with them, January 2020 and I send out some some red flags, like, wait, you know, I don't, I don't have anything under my name through PNM I haven't for years now.

645
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I definitely. So that's where Joshua, you'd be calling. Let's say you saw that under experience that was the third name by the way, let's say you call you can call experience directly. And you can say, how do I challenge this

646
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: They they're used to it all day long. They're used to it. So there's a special, special form and you refute it. And you say, That's not me.

647
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can show you my bills coming from PNM and it was over here. See, this is what was going on. This is fraudulent, how do I prove this, what do I do, I would like over time to have this removed from my my history.

648
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you get what you do is

649
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You get all three of these numbers and you start hacking away at it.

650
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:41.280
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

651
01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And obviously, right, you're very careful with once you get into a lease that's that's exciting because that means now you're building this credit history.

652
01:12:52.680 --> 01:13:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's also these little credit cards that you can get for 100 300 and you can say, hey, look, I have this history. I've been paying this off. So as soon as you know

653
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I can. I'll put money like oh my groceries. I know I have the money for groceries or you haven't budgeted I'll pay that month after month after month full payment full payment full payment, you're already buying groceries. Might as well. And now you're building your credit history again.

654
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:19.590
Joshua Lopez: Okay.

655
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's ironic that you have to be in debt to show people that you have good credit

656
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:26.100
Joshua Lopez: You got to put

657
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: In debt. It's just this cookie thing I know for my family. I've said, Listen, let's get you a little credit card.

658
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't go nuts. But then you pay it off. You don't use it for, you know, getting everything you want. You just use it as if it was cash and then you pay it immediately, then that shows. Hey, I am trustworthy and I'm a good credit risk.

659
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.020
Joshua Lopez: So doesn't that that

660
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:59.850
Joshua Lopez: And that makes a lot of sense out of friend do that when we were younger, he, you know, didn't have a lot of out growing up. And one of the ways he built his credit is

661
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:10.320
Joshua Lopez: He would use his credit card, even though he had cash to buy something he would use the credit card and then a week later pay off whatever he used his credit card on

662
01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:19.290
Joshua Lopez: And that's kind of how he was able to purchase a car. Later on, how he was able to you know me, I had good credit at one time I had great credit

663
01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:40.020
Joshua Lopez: But over the years, especially in the peak of my addiction lost the house lost the truck lost. You know what I mean. I kind of sabotage my credit. So now that I'm in the peak of recovery. I think it just makes sense to rebuild. You know, it's time to rebuild definitely overdo.

664
01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It let's get, let's get honest about this. So I just did something I just brought something up in front of you. Just, just notice how distressing. It was, what did you notice when I brought that up in front of you.

665
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:55.890
Joshua Lopez: What's that the

666
01:14:57.630 --> 01:14:59.460
Joshua Lopez: Credit Karma. Yeah.

667
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:07.110
Joshua Lopez: I felt like you're giving me valuable advice. I did feel like

668
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:29.580
Joshua Lopez: I can formulate a game plan based on this. I'm not as lost as I was not as, you know, I was a bit more scared before talking to you about it because I was thinking maybe I do have to call that law firm to help me. But talking to you. I feel more confident that there's things I can do myself.

669
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.830
Joshua Lopez: For definitely definitely good feeling. Definitely.

670
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So good when you first saw it was, was there an initial distress emotion when you first saw it.

671
01:15:47.700 --> 01:16:01.050
Joshua Lopez: Um, I know wouldn't see your was great. Oh, but more of a sense of hope. I guess you could say, like, okay, I feel more like I said, I feel more confident doing it.

672
01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:10.110
Joshua Lopez: On my own, rather than needing some expensive law firm to help me. You know, I could afford that law firm and I wouldn't be in debt right now.

673
01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And so that was my concern to

674
01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's shift gears a little bit, you've got a little bit of a game plan.

675
01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Joshua, you don't know what you don't know. There are a lot of people out there that have useful bits of information. There are people that you work with. There are people that

676
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Are going through, or maybe just a few steps ahead of you that can give you even more confidence and say, and I did this and I did this and I did this.

677
01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So just notice if Shane's there, you won't have that conversation with people.

678
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Be real careful because you might be missing out on conversations and resources that you'll rob yourself of

679
01:16:55.110 --> 01:17:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok let's continue just reviewing just want to spend a minute. Let me just come over here, your original goal was big goal say

680
01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: At about

681
01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: By about a bit a bit of two

682
01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:12.000
Or

683
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Between February 10 and 24 which is kind of where we are. You are going to be at. And I know you have this no expense. I get that. But let's just, we're just looking at numbers.

684
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You are going to be at 1681 next Tuesday next Monday. Um, where are you at, let's because we got to kind of deal with the fact that you have this this place you're paying for

685
01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:44.910
Joshua Lopez: I'm in all honesty, I am not. I haven't saved anything

686
01:17:46.020 --> 01:18:01.830
Joshua Lopez: The first week I moved out. I'd given my mom rent money and I just turned on the internet. So that was over $200 and then the very same day, we got into a fight and I left and I had to spend like 300 and some to stay somewhere else.

687
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:06.060
Joshua Lopez: And I had to eat and put gas so that left me broke

688
01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:07.380
Joshua Lopez: This week I found

689
01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:08.760
This place.

690
01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:14.730
Joshua Lopez: Which was like I said, it's pretty pricey. It's like 200 and some are we

691
01:18:16.050 --> 01:18:16.560
Joshua Lopez: Going

692
01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the some

693
01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:22.020
Joshua Lopez: It's to 80 to 85 I believe

694
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:44.970
Joshua Lopez: Then, not having a comforter not having pillows basically not having any thing. I spent about $300 at Walmart buying you know brooms rakes towels comforter pillows, you know, necessities to live dishes, pots, pans. Plus I bought a little bit of food.

695
01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:59.790
Joshua Lopez: So again, I left myself not completely broke. I left myself with enough gas money for the week. Tomorrow I get paid. Again, so I won't have nearly as much expenses, but there's still a couple of things I need to get and I

696
01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I noticed. Now you can discard this this information or use it up to you. But part of the enjoying it was doing this with your daughter. Right.

697
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that part of the enjoyment, was that you were with her and she was helping you shop.

698
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:19.440
Joshua Lopez: Yes. Okay.

699
01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't want to minimize that part. But there is there's places like

700
01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A Salvation Army there's places that you can be maybe getting some things that aren't going to be as expensive or like on marketplace on Facebook. They have this thing called marketplace or something similar to a Craigslist. It's kind of scary but

701
01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice there are other ways. Now that you know you got the secondary gain of being able to shop with your daughter, which is really special, you know,

702
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't put a price on that.

703
01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But there are other ways that you can you can take a close look at maybe a little more thrift, if you needed to. If that's not in your window of option, then that's fine too. I'm just letting you know that sometimes you can get even better quality, but they have been formerly owned

704
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:21.360
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I mean, for the most part, I don't need too much more I need like a toaster.

705
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:34.080
Joshua Lopez: A mop, um, you know, I did save as much as I possibly could. When I bought a coffee pot. You know, I bought a $10 coffee pot. You know, I didn't, didn't go for the bells and whistles. I went with the cheapest one I could find.

706
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:42.810
Joshua Lopez: And I did that with a lot of this stuff. I bought it was the cheapest room. I could find the cheapest desk. Can you know what I mean, it was

707
01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:51.900
Joshua Lopez: A It was more, you know, I didn't want to spend this stuff, but I talked with my brother, and he's like, Don't think about it as wasting money or

708
01:20:52.320 --> 01:21:07.200
Joshua Lopez: Stuff like that. Is this stuff that you needed. Anyway, you need that stuff, you know, to mean pillows. I needed trash can, you know, just little stuff like that. I'm kind of excited though this week. I don't have to spend as much for the first

709
01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What's left, you have a toaster.

710
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.060
Joshua Lopez: When older

711
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:19.080
Joshua Lopez: I need like a mop or one of those Swiffer those slippers. I think are probably better because it's wood floors.

712
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:36.330
Joshua Lopez: And I know mopping wood floors isn't ideal. You can work the wood or you know what I mean, it's probably going to get a Swiffer toaster. I would like a better shower curtain, the shower curtain that here didn't look like it was clean.

713
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:54.360
Joshua Lopez: I do want a shower curtain. Yeah, it's just wasn't in the budget last week there was, you know, everything started adding up and I was like, wow, I need. I do need gas for the week can't leave myself without gas because then I won't be able to afford anything after that, you know,

714
01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:05.310
Joshua Lopez: So just probably like three things and then groceries. I definitely I bought a lot of snacks and food for when my kids come and stay with me.

715
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:20.610
Joshua Lopez: But I didn't buy like actual like dinner stuff because I didn't have the utensils and stuff but I bought those just a couple of days ago. So when I get paid tomorrow by like actual stuff. I can make dinner with

716
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:31.770
Joshua Lopez: No more eating out. It's disgusting. I've been eating out for like two weeks because in have a, you know, I didn't have the, the, the tools to cook with, you know,

717
01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:38.910
Joshua Lopez: Go. Yeah, so maybe some spices pepper, salt, stuff like that.

718
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Things that you can continue to to use, not just one time use to

719
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.960
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, and

720
01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:57.810
Joshua Lopez: It's starting all over basically from square one. So, and you wouldn't be cheap but you know it's it is what it is.

721
01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so let's see we got two to 85 a week.

722
01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And what is the what's going to be coming in. I forget what you told me every two weeks.

723
01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:26.520
Joshua Lopez: Okay, so I I finally figured out how it works over there. So one week and I don't know the number like the deck bound. I'll be making because my first two paychecks were orientation hours.

724
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:41.190
Joshua Lopez: Which are going to change net now that I'm on my regular schedule. So one week is my short week I will have 37 and a half hours at 1850 an hour and then the following week I will have 50 hours.

725
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:47.880
Joshua Lopez: 1850 and then of course 10 hours of time and a half. So,

726
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.400
Joshua Lopez: I did the numbers a

727
01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:56.430
Joshua Lopez: week and a half ago, I want to say, but I don't remember off the top of my head. Oh.

728
01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I

729
01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: See 37 times 10.50 that's the 64 men not 50 times 2.50 925. And I don't know about the time and a half. I don't know what time and a half means your

730
01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.360
Time and a half.

731
01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.170
Joshua Lopez: So basically, so 40 hours of that will be 1850 than

732
01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:26.370
Joshua Lopez: 10 hours will be

733
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:34.620
Joshua Lopez: So half of 1850 would be 925 so it'd be 2775 for 10 hours.

734
01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: In addition to the

735
01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:47.880
Joshua Lopez: I know know if so, so basically the week that I have 50 hours would be 40 times 1850 man.

736
01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:49.380
Joshua Lopez: I see it down times

737
01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:51.390
Joshua Lopez: 2775 yeah

738
01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I got it. Now, hold on, let me just see what happens with that. Instead, it's 925 years off, let me do that again we go 40 times at

739
01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:04.140
740 and then we've got

740
01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:15.930
10 just move the decimal point on that one.

741
01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a people person, not a math person, yo.

742
01:25:26.970 --> 01:25:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, I'm like, Boy, that looks familiar.

743
01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Point five zero you okay so 17 basically 1700 minus some taxes.

744
01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

745
01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

746
01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty quickly you're, you're going to be able to

747
01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see something you said on to 24 this might come in.

748
01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.080
Joshua Lopez: Or

749
01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: February 24 that you're saying you're going to get the 1700

750
01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:11.610
Joshua Lopez: Um, no. Because like tomorrow, I'll get paid for my short week and then

Joshua Lopez: I'll get paid for my the long week

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you get about six 684

754
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: On to 24 and then the following week is

755
01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.030
Wow.

756
01:26:31.290 --> 01:26:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I think that's the 31st. Right.

757
01:26:34.170 --> 01:26:38.160
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, well it's tomorrow the 24th now.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.520
Joshua Lopez: Thursday every Thursday. Yes, ma'am.

765
01:26:59.850 --> 01:27:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. Alright, so here we go. You're going to have fixated for tomorrow and you'll have

766
01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I don't know what that is. Do some four zero close. Let's just say 270 7000 basically have 1000

767
01:27:18.330 --> 01:27:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And then about 1000

768
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.500
Joshua Lopez: Okay, sorry about that. It muted you. The incoming call

769
01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:42.960
Joshua Lopez: That stupid law firm, even though I've told them, I'm not working with them and tell them ready. They keep calling and I've got to a point where told him I'm not working with them period and yeah

770
01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you left the door open before

771
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

772
01:27:50.370 --> 01:27:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

773
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The

774
01:27:55.110 --> 01:28:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The stuff that's going to prevent you from getting what you want, which is this apartment.

775
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it sounds like this to 85

776
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Rent.

777
01:28:14.490 --> 01:28:15.870
Joshua Lopez: Is about 1100 a

778
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:18.750
Joshua Lopez: Month five nights a week. So that's pretty pricey.

779
01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's 1140 a month. Right, so it will grab up a lot of it. So it sounds like the sooner you can save, which means, what would it be like for you to not do expensive play with your kids.

780
01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Do. Are you ready for that, will it feel like you're depriving them. You know what I'm trying to say, like, I don't know if that's where your heart string gets pulled because I think it has in the past.

781
01:28:47.190 --> 01:28:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's felt good to give to them, right.

782
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And so where's the biggest vulnerability for you have where money will not get saved over the next month.

783
01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:18.750
Joshua Lopez: Um, my, my concern is, you know, looking into the whole credit thing, um, you know, how much is that going to start taking away from the, you know, I already have to 85 coming out weekly and then whatever I find out and discover with

784
01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:32.010
Joshua Lopez: The debt that I owe you know I did talk about my student loan with with somebody and I'm trying to get ahold of them that was only going to be like five bucks a month for a year. That's not a big expense. But like anything.

785
01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Why didn't you tell me that that's a huge step you took

786
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:51.150
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, it's just I spoke with them a while back. And when I got my new phone. I've had a kind of played like phone tag with them. So I've had a hard time getting ahold of them, but I'm definitely

787
01:29:51.900 --> 01:30:05.640
Joshua Lopez: Trying to get ahold of them to get that situated because that it'll take me according to the person I spoke with it'll take me out of collections, which will appear on my credit that are not in collections with them, which would really help out at the at the moment.

788
01:30:06.810 --> 01:30:14.160
Joshua Lopez: So I'm definitely trying to do that and then whatever else. I figure out. I'm hoping it's similar where I won't have to pay a lot

789
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:18.480
Joshua Lopez: But other than that, I mean I do feel

790
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:32.070
Joshua Lopez: Bit vulnerable when it does come to my kiddos because, you know, try to give them stuff but I definitely know that they eat they understand, you know,

791
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:40.320
Joshua Lopez: If I can't get them something they're there, they're not the type of kids who will try to give me a guilt trip or you know what I mean.

792
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I do. I know I can do it.

793
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But Joshua that it's never been them. IT'S BEEN YOU NOTICE HOW YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU GO TO YOU HAVE THIS SPACE AND

794
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The tricky bit is this

795
01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're going to need for a place that ironically, you're going to now have a place to play with them and hang out with them and have they'll have their, you know, least they'll be a separate I think room because you were going to try to get a two bedroom.

796
01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You only need to wait a little while me to postpone it a little bit. So I already heard that. But what can you do with them. That's fun.

797
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you can redirect having that fresh on your lips and ready to go. Things you can say redirect them to find that's free. What can you do. Oh.

798
01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:33.240
Joshua Lopez: Whoa. One of the things we've been doing just hanging out here.

799
01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:42.120
Joshua Lopez: The nice part is, I'm not paying for internet we. It's not the greatest Internet, but the I got him Hulu, which is only five bucks a month.

800
01:31:43.890 --> 01:31:51.420
Joshua Lopez: And they've been enjoying that the my son plays a video game. Like, you know. So we've just been staying home. We haven't been going out a lot.

801
01:31:54.630 --> 01:32:12.690
Joshua Lopez: So, I mean, we haven't really been doing a lot of anything which kind of become the norm. I think we're just going to be enjoying having our own space for a while, you know, we're out my parents. I didn't really enjoy them the way I used to enjoy them. So just hanging out. I mean,

802
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:15.300
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

803
01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:17.430
Joshua Lopez: We'll just

804
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Spend some time brainstorming some activities. Once it comes down.

805
01:32:23.130 --> 01:32:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the kids will probably get some antsy I'm bored stuff coming up. So just kind of have some ideas of what you're going to want to do with them.

806
01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the first thing is right, we can just either go out to eat or go spend money. So just, just be mindful that there are some activities that you can be doing in the home that can be fun.

807
01:32:44.190 --> 01:33:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me touch base on a couple other things, um, you mentioned, I need to find something to pour myself into. That was one of your goals. I will put on 15 pounds of by eating regularly and taking supplements.

808
01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How you doing on that.

809
01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:10.230
Joshua Lopez: I was doing really good actually got up to five pounds.

810
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:15.180
Joshua Lopez: But the last month I haven't worked out.

811
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:25.590
Joshua Lopez: Mainly when I started orientation that was five days a week and I was like well once my two weeks of orientation are done. I'm going to go right back to it and then

812
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:36.840
Joshua Lopez: Everything happened where I moved out of my parents house. Everything was kind of sporadic unstable. I went. Another week without it. And then this week, so I

813
01:33:37.650 --> 01:33:43.110
Joshua Lopez: I am going to get back into it. However, the supplements are like an expense that I kind of

814
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:52.560
Joshua Lopez: Don't want to spend right now, just try trying to save. So I'll probably still eat right still eat regularly maybe cut the supplements out and

815
01:33:52.950 --> 01:34:09.240
Joshua Lopez: Find a Planet Fitness in this area that I can go to on my days off, just because I'm in a new area. I don't really know this area that well. So I definitely will be back on track. I just everything that happened, it's kind of been

816
01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.380
Joshua Lopez: pushed aside, but it's definitely not something that I'm forgetting.

817
01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:16.800
Joshua Lopez: I definitely still want again got 15 pounds.

818
01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:19.770
Joshua Lopez: You know,

819
01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:24.630
Joshua Lopez: More about a confidence thing. I think I'll feel more confident

820
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Next one, improve my relationship with people at home. So what do we want to write about that goal.

821
01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:37.380
Joshua Lopez: Um, that didn't happen.

822
01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:44.640
Joshua Lopez: I did make the effort to, you know, try to let things

823
01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:57.060
Joshua Lopez: Roll and try to, you know, bite my tongue in certain situations, but they just kept pushing my buttons, and I, I made a decision and

824
01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:08.460
Joshua Lopez: Thomas that I don't regret my decision for leaving. I don't regret my decision for having said some of the stuff I said I really don't feel like apologetic for it.

825
01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, it is common for you to glaze over. And we're glazing. Now let's not do that. Let's get specific. We've got a little bit of time. I want to hear what they said that pushed your button. Want to hear. Want to know. You want to know what it was a family of origin. This matters.

826
01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:30.540
Joshua Lopez: A lot

827
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:41.790
Joshua Lopez: It was kinda like a weekly thing if my son. Coughs I you know you got to take them to the doctor and I didn't take them to the doctor several times but

828
01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:55.980
Joshua Lopez: Now, my mom would be like dramatic and kind of overreacting on a lot of it and then it would come down to you don't care about your kids. You don't, you know, and I that really would, that would really push my buttons.

829
01:35:56.790 --> 01:36:04.800
Joshua Lopez: Because I love my kids and I care for my kids. Very much so. So when she would say stuff like that. It was like, ah, and then

830
01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:09.690
Joshua Lopez: They were kind of sticking their nose in my business where

831
01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.750
Joshua Lopez: With Jacqueline my baby mom.

832
01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:35.760
Joshua Lopez: So they were you know sticking their nose in there and then they brought in a third party and you know kind of reading my business out there and agitated me but I let it slide but then they kind of overstep their bounds. The they called See ya. If d on her, which to me was uncalled for.

833
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, wow.

834
01:36:38.670 --> 01:36:39.150
Oh, and

835
01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:42.960
Joshua Lopez: I told them you know whatever they were

836
01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:46.410
Joshua Lopez: had problems with I was addressing with her.

837
01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:50.880
Joshua Lopez: And that was also causing a lot of tension in my relationship with her.

838
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The, you know, they

839
01:36:55.410 --> 01:37:06.450
Joshua Lopez: It just, yeah. And I finally just that day I had enough. I really just, I, I honestly felt exhausted with them emotionally. It just was exhausting to deal with them.

840
01:37:08.190 --> 01:37:27.060
Joshua Lopez: You know, if every other week it was something else. I didn't care about Isaias or actions shut down. I need to do something about it because she's shutting down and honestly I think my daughter was like that around them, because she saw the way they were abstaining me

841
01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

842
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:35.400
Joshua Lopez: So she kind of was shutting down towards them into them. It was like, Oh, something's wrong. Something's going on at her mom's

843
01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:53.460
Joshua Lopez: You know, because she shutting down and it's now that we've been away from them for two weeks I my daughter, smiling. My daughter's opened up my daughters, you know, but to them. They right away, jumped to the conclusion that something really significantly bad was happening.

844
01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.770
Joshua Lopez: You know, and that was in every situation. JOSH, WHAT

845
01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm number one, I just want to know when that call to see if it happened when was that

846
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:15.930
Joshua Lopez: I was Friday I happened on a Friday. Two weeks ago, so like this Friday would be I believe this Friday would make it two weeks.

847
01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:26.220
Joshua Lopez: Because I moved out that that night when I got off of work. I was so excited I finished my orientation. I got home and that shit storm happen.

848
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:36.240
Joshua Lopez: And that's when I finally just had it. I left, I spent a week at another place, and I'm spending a week at this place. So I would say it'll be two weeks on Friday.

849
01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What what I heard you say is my parents called

850
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: On Jacqueline that was too much and you left

851
01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:53.040
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I mean that in of course every, every other thing that they had been doing

852
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:56.280
Joshua Lopez: You know, saying, I don't care about my kids.

853
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You left that night.

854
01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Got it. Yeah, I agree. That is huge. It's one thing to say, well, I would take my son to the doctor so and so I would do this, but that that's

855
01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That is an and I don't know. Have you been able to tell anybody else about how profound an impact that can happen. I mean, kids are separated from their children. This is a huge thing that happened.

856
01:39:27.150 --> 01:39:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been anybody else.

857
01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:45.750
Joshua Lopez: No, I haven't. I mean, living by myself. I really don't talk to. I really don't talk to too many people outside. I didn't talk to my, my friend, who, you know, also happens to be my barber.

858
01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:55.980
Joshua Lopez: And talk to him with a little bit about it and even he was kind of like, wow, you know what I mean. And that wasn't the only thing we thought about that day.

859
01:39:57.150 --> 01:40:06.060
Joshua Lopez: You know, I just got my first paycheck and my mom, knowing that I was making more money here than it was Walmart. She raised rent on me and

860
01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:15.360
Joshua Lopez: You know, I gave her what she asked. She wanted 150 every week, which kind of a lot, you know, and that comes out to

861
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:25.590
Joshua Lopez: You know, I had borrowed some gas money from her. And she was like, are you still only money like, Mom, I just got my first paycheck. I will pay you next week.

862
01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:42.780
Joshua Lopez: 150 plus what I owe you. I just have some other stuff that I need to pay my first paycheck and she just kind of started going off on me on that we started arguing about that. And then that's when I asked her, like, did you do this. Did you call see why he and

863
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:46.140
Joshua Lopez: She real like

864
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:56.610
Joshua Lopez: proudly said, Of course I did. If you're not going to take care of the situation. If you're not going to care for your kids, I'm going to do it okay left when I

865
01:40:56.970 --> 01:41:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so Joshua. Look at the irony of this right

866
01:41:01.710 --> 01:41:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: This is mom that could be caring for her own kid you

867
01:41:07.890 --> 01:41:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

868
01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you're going to call out someone else.

869
01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that is crazy, making

870
01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:30.180
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, and that's kind of what my friend when he was cutting my hair said he's like you know your your your mom instead of helping you out and trying to get your own place. She raised the rent on you, you know, is like

871
01:41:31.650 --> 01:41:45.450
Joshua Lopez: You know, in three weeks. You could have saved what you needed to to get out of there. But yet she raised it on you. He's like, it's almost like she doesn't want you to leave. You know, I don't know. He

872
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:49.830
Joshua Lopez: Yeah I did see that underneath just

873
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So the reason the reason why I'm highlighting it is because

874
01:41:55.170 --> 01:42:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I've long known you longer being the man doesn't say anything. And it's still a bit habitual I'm glad you talked with your friend, but it is your first I think reaction to not talk about it.

875
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I would have liked to have known this thing was going on, a lot, a lot sooner.

876
01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That is massive. That's like you'll

877
01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.200
Probably never forget.

878
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:38.880
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I think, a part of it is we hadn't met since that had happened, and then I did mention it a little bit. I didn't go into much detail. It was kind of like you give me some non. How was it non confrontational. Like, I know you want what's best for me.

879
01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.910
Joshua Lopez: You know, to kind of battle them off without already into a fight.

880
01:42:46.350 --> 01:43:03.480
Joshua Lopez: But I mean, that wasn't on you. I didn't give you the full scoop on what was going on, you know, probably should have given you more detail about it as it was pretty, pretty much a weekly thing with them. It was every other week, or every week it was something else.

881
01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:06.630
Joshua Lopez: And it got it got to be to

882
01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Joshua you miss out when you don't give specifics you miss out on getting the support you need.

883
01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I might miss judge and I'm thinking, the skill is just, we just got to tolerate a nuisance know there was a really significant thing going on there was there's almost this failure.

884
01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your parent to like this could have been a repairing moment she could have, like, maybe there were failures, you know, in childhood or something, she could have been I'm

885
01:43:39.210 --> 01:43:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, my ears are bugging me she could have had this as a moment to repair and heal with you and didn't

886
01:43:47.730 --> 01:44:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I would if I want the details the details, make the difference because it could be something that parents doing this rewarding and I definitely want details. I want to hear it. I want to know.

887
01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I'm going to want to know the next time, I'm going to want to know how on earth do you come back. How do you you and Jacqueline navigate this now that this event has happened and and what was going on with with your kids and

888
01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And there was so much going on for you and you were doing it in a lot of ways alone. Yeah.

889
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Your register.

890
01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: For tolerance. What you put up with on your own is so high you don't reach out

891
01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no one telling you, dude. That's crazy. That's bat shit crazy

892
01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's unacceptable. No, and I think he more than more of the hairdresser's, the more friends, the more therapy. The more people in group, the more you're hearing other people

893
01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The more you get to bounce out bounce off. Oh my gosh. For real. That's what people are doing. That's good. You need to be hearing what other people kind of thing to not to change your mind. You do your thing. But just to register what normal is because your tolerance for emotional like

894
01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Neglect is really high.

895
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You understand

896
01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:29.730
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I do.

897
01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:37.290
Joshua Lopez: It was honestly it was exhausting being there. Um, it was exhausting.

898
01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, you're out you're

899
01:45:40.890 --> 01:45:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Out. Yeah. And there we go, got it. You got money coming in. Good things are happening. And yes, you're using logic, of course, you're going to not pay for supplements.

900
01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean, of course, that goes out the window. Absolutely. And so my only invitation over this coming week or so is to really hone in

901
01:45:58.530 --> 01:46:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: On not only the search on on, you know, you know, affordable sort of checking in on credit score get those numbers, getting a hold of that student loan saving money but but you your time with your, with your children is really important. It's little things like having

902
01:46:17.670 --> 01:46:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Some little games that you can be doing inside the house little fun things that you can be doing, there's

903
01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun stuff you can do. I'm a fan. I always have a balloon handy if it's board. I just keep it in the air, or I like charades. You know, those are my go tues but you're going to have some cultivating things that you can do to interact, get our little eyes off of video games where we can interact

904
01:46:43.050 --> 01:46:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can connect with your kids.

905
01:46:45.930 --> 01:46:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: In a really meaningful way. You know,

906
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.370
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, definitely.

907
01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:52.320
Um,

908
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:55.440
Joshua Lopez: One of the things

909
01:46:57.090 --> 01:46:58.740
Joshua Lopez: Last week I was pretty down

910
01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:03.270
Joshua Lopez: The place I was saying, it was really just

911
01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:15.180
Joshua Lopez: really shitty and my daughter just lit up my day. She was like, Dad. And he says, a place to stay, and I'm super excited to be here with you. It's like we're on a

912
01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:16.590
Little adventure together.

913
01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:27.000
Joshua Lopez: It like rushed it like it made me feel good, but even talking about it. Now I got choked up like she's just so awesome.

914
01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:31.290
Joshua Lopez: To be like my little rock lee, lee

915
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.340
Joshua Lopez: Okay.

916
01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice I mean I'm no I'm tearing up

917
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: She's amazing.

918
01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And got to be doing this with me and with other adults, so that she she doesn't have to be so intuitive.

919
01:47:54.690 --> 01:48:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. You don't want. It's beautiful, it's a balance is constant. I'm glad she's this sensitive attune person who's not a materialistic and that's amazing you're raising beautiful children.

920
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've got, I don't know how you're doing around that if you're able to say, yeah, this is basically you know this is a crappy place we won't stay here long

921
01:48:16.710 --> 01:48:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're amazing daughter you that's really cool. That's very generous of you to to not equate my value and our value with this crummy place.

922
01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it's talking about what did you see with grandma and grandpa. You know, it's not here, you know we we are their therapists, as parents,

923
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can't do that when it's so emotional and our kids are doing these things right there so generous, but she may need a place to be able to kind of talk about what that was like and not go crazy too because

924
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:53.190

927
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:31.140
Joshua Lopez: I tried to hold it together in front of them. I really do. When she told me that I wanted to tear up. I wanted to be emotional, but I like swallowed it held it in

928
01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:36.510
Joshua Lopez: Of course, when they got picked up. I kinda did hit me.

01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how once you said what your daughter said right all that flooded in it's my daughter's amazing is one thing, but for you to say out loud, what she did is a whole other experience. It's like, holy crap. Okay, so let's get, let's be specific. It'll. It'll feel it will feel better.

01:53:56.010 --> 01:53:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't tell you.

974
01:53:58.290 --> 01:53:58.740

983
01:54:46.620 --> 01:55:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If what's going on. If you're doing what you kind of tend to do which is you kind of minimize the intensity of things. Sometimes if what's going on with you and Jacqueline is like putting you to the edge, then let's meet sooner. Let's meet every week. Okay.

984
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this

985

987
01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:18.750
Joshua Lopez: Because it's a little sooner. Is that what are we today. We are the 19th, if I'm correct. So

988
01:55:21.450 --> 01:55:25.170
Joshua Lopez: So that's not next week. Right. That's the following week

989
01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. It is next week 2428 is next week. If you want to meet, then that's groovy, if not the following one is March 2 through six second

990
01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:37.170
Three.

991
01:55:38.310 --> 01:56:02.670
Joshua Lopez: I probably would like the the 24 to 28% of things. So next week, I will be off, Monday, Tuesday, so let's see. So Friday or Thursday the 20th, 21st Saturday the 22nd, 23rd, so I'll be off Monday the 24th will be off the 25th. I'll be working the 2627 and then I'll be off on the 28

992
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:04.080

994
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.460

995
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:12.480

01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Will meet on February 28 at one o'clock and just sort of, you know, have in mind that we won't need to do any of the treatment goal reviews, we can really zero in on whatever is going on with Jacqueline, we can also focus

1002
01:56:52.860 --> 01:57:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: On some some sort of deeper therapeutic techniques, but really identify something that you want from from the session. And then let's make it happen. Okay.
