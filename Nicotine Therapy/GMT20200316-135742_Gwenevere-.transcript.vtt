00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.690
Alicia Noedel: Mean when

2
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.010
Alicia Noedel: Good morning. Sorry. Everyone's asleep. So I had to sit up. So we're to do my little meeting.

3
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just fine. Listen. Everybody's got their kids at home, and it's just a real real scramble for everyone. So, don't, don't feel bad if you know you need to go out and take care of your baby to okay I completely understand

4
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole planets in a frenzy over this situation so

5
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do have a couple of things I want to do unless you have something really pressing right now.

6
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.730
Alicia Noedel: No, we're good. I just had to come into the sunroom and get a little pillow to sit down.

7
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, alright, cool, and I would like to

8
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Know the sunroom that you're in. Is there any chance you have any way to, I don't know if you have anything nearby to kind of prop me up so that this device is sitting, sitting somewhere. Take a look around. There's no rush on it.

9
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be leaned up against.

10
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.000
Would be

11
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.870
Alicia Noedel: Things I can put on the bench.

12
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.260
Alicia Noedel: Let's see if that works.

13
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's nice.

14
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I would say just down the line. Continue. And I remind everyone, every time I meet until we get, get it all figured out.

15
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to want it build it up eventually. So that you and I can see each other I die today. This is beautiful, though, so thank you for creating that

16
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to talk to you about where we left off last week I had invited maybe taking some of that imagery

17
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your resource figures and maybe when you were doing the belly breathing, maybe starting to think about those figures, it's, it's always okay if everything was forgotten, that's okay to just want to check in and see if we're able to do that, or even remember it.

18
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.650
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, the, the belly breathing has been helping me a lot more than the imagery

19
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.430
Uh huh.

20
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.240
Alicia Noedel: Just because that's more of like an instant.

21
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.010
Alicia Noedel: You know when I'm in a weird headspace, you know, it helps right away.

22
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.690
That's right. It does.

23
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But let me understand educate me a little bit more, maybe tell me a little story just even a little one where you you thought, Oh, I remember these images. And then what happened.

24
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.670
Alicia Noedel: Um,

25
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.390
Alicia Noedel: Is the other day when I found out that I'm

26
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.030
Alicia Noedel: The coven

27
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.460
Alicia Noedel: started spreading into Mexico.

28
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:39.450
Alicia Noedel: And so I started getting really because it is already something I've been very afraid of just with my daughter and my mother being ill and everything.

29
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.460
Alicia Noedel: Um, so I i've been worrying about it a lot, actually. I've been having a lot of panic attacks about it.

30
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.650
Alicia Noedel: And

31
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.770
Alicia Noedel: I don't know it. The imagery didn't really help in that situation.

32
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So wait, let me just see. I gotta get educated here. So we have I was worried and then tell me what you did. So I'm worried. I have been for some time.

33
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.580
Alicia Noedel: I isolated myself. I went in. I sat in a room by myself.

34
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.120
Alicia Noedel: And so that I wouldn't because when I get anxious I get frustrated and I take it out and everybody around me.

35
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: In what way, how do you what I would call act out

36
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you own.

37
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:34.800
Alicia Noedel: Just like I get frustrated with everybody. Like if they're talking to me and they're asking the questions. And there you know I get like very, you know, quick to like

38
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.170
Alicia Noedel: Be bugged by them.

39
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually doing saying moving

40
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:59.910
Alicia Noedel: I mean, just having like just being passive aggressive. Honestly, it's not like I'm like being crazy with anybody. It's just like attitude and then I try and so I isolated myself. I went and I sat in my room with my little girl because, you know, I can never be mad at her.

41
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.550
Alicia Noedel: And I just did my breathing and I was thinking about the imagery

42
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.070
Alicia Noedel: And honestly, the breathing helped before the imagery did so.

43
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. So

44
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm getting into some real specific such, but I want to check on another level. You didn't do anything wrong. The reason why I'm pressing for these specifics is to see what

45
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got in the way. So,

46
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.260
Alicia Noedel: Great.

47
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: See it as a wrong or right. It's really just, just see what comes up for you. So I'm I am noticing some general generality.

48
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I get into real specifics. Because what you call mad or angry or passive aggressive

49
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.470
Alicia Noedel: Mean anything right.

50
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything and and what if it's helpful to hear someone else's perspective, if you just never know. And I like to really know. Are people

51
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually more hostile aggressive than they realize or maybe they're really not actually and they may benefit from hearing someone else and that's why I was asking with wording. Oh, I know what passive aggressive is and I know it irritation is in my world.

52
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.120
Alicia Noedel: But in yours.

53
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like it's, there's some behaviors that you do that you don't like. So you isolate it

54
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Now when you're in a stress response you call it a panic, you go you isolated you brought the baby and you did the breathing. Yes, of course. That's why I taught that Russia. First thing I teach because it's amazing.

55
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I'm wanting to get at. We can pick up maybe what what the mad angry passive aggressive stuff isn't a second but what I'm trying to really figure out is

56
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the thought, what's the fear thought around the virus.

57
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.850
Alicia Noedel: I'm

58
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.100
Alicia Noedel: It coming into my house and it really it really feels like

59
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:08.520
Alicia Noedel: Like a home invasion. You know what I mean, like, like they're coming through the vents and there's nothing you can do about it. And there's no way you can, you know, protect your family because it's going to happen regardless

60
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:20.220
Alicia Noedel: I'm scared that someone that I love is going to get sick. You know, I have a group. My fiance has a great grandma that I love very much that she's very old.

61
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:33.660
Alicia Noedel: Okay and I'm just scared that you know my baby. My, my, my man who goes out every day, you know, and has to work at a hotel where there's people traveling from all over the place.

62
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little bit of cognitive, behavioral, it's not what my current my my plan was. But let's say it's hard to resist that.

63
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, what does the worrying do to protect your man and

64
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing. Okay. All right. So you have a rational mind. Right. They can say

65
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, and yet there. Does it keeps going defaulting to to a fear thought right

66
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're scared and it feels like it's a home invasion. Because you said it coming in as if it's it's going to come in.

67
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.280
Alicia Noedel: Fields. Yeah, yeah.

68
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:14.850
Yeah.

69
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What about anything that you can do. So the things that we can do. Are any of those

70
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Being not

71
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.790
Alicia Noedel: Oh, I've been extremely cautious.

72
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.350
Alicia Noedel: Okay, cautious.

73
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:35.760
Alicia Noedel: hausa I'm constantly washing my hands. We got enough food to quarantine ourselves for a little while.

74
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:50.520
Alicia Noedel: I have I made my own hand sanitizer, because the store sold out. I had to go to the store like three different times, because there was no milk, no nothing. Every time it with. There's no formula for my daughter, but oh

75
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.580
Alicia Noedel: Okay, we're just trying to get everything we need.

76
00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And but that doesn't prevent much it's the coming in. That's the concern. So you're handling once it's in, but the coming in part. That's what I'm wondering about, so your man's over at a hotel. Work, work, work, work. Any, any recommendations suggestions out there around mentioned protection.

77
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:26.070
Alicia Noedel: Um, I mean he works in the kitchen of the bar. So the only way that he could, you know, really be affected as if one of his co workers.

78
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:41.580
Alicia Noedel: gets sick, or like a plate comes back from the, from the dining room into the kitchen and you know someone touches it, and then someone said something else, you know, and then someone, such as anything else. And then he touches that same thing

79
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I guess what I'm getting at is, I'm hearing you taking precaution, but do you feel confident that he is

80
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.180
Alicia Noedel: Yes.

81
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you do. Okay.

82
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so he is doing.

83
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.890
Alicia Noedel: He's taking it just as serious as I am, because we don't want our doctor to get sick.

84
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.730
And so what are those precautions. He's taking

85
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:16.470
Alicia Noedel: Um, he takes his hand sanitizer with him everywhere. And he's staying like away from close contact with people.

86
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.760
Alicia Noedel: You know, we haven't been out in forever.

87
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.960
Alicia Noedel: Okay, we're not going any public places or anything like that.

88
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So, reduce contact and the hand sanitizer.

89
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not, it's that handwashing

90
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:45.630
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. Oh, constantly. We just got our sink fix. I'm in our bathroom. And so it's a lot easier now because it's so much closer. Okay.

91
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.590
Alicia Noedel: But I don't think I'm being irrational.

92
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.730
Alicia Noedel: Like it's scary, right.

93
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Yeah.

94
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When Oh so you cute, cute in into the word irrational. Right.

95
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: The

96
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What I said was

97
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have a rational thought that is

98
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: By worrying about it doesn't actually preserve anyone safety.

99
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.230
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

100
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: One thing it does do and that's the job of the brain. It's at least certain parts of it anyway. Certainly the limbic system is to keep you safe.

101
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But it can have an overreaction and it does, it doesn't include the stuff up there in the frontal lobe. So yes, it's true there there are concerns going on.

102
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But just worrying isn't going to put you at your best. You're not going to be the best problem solver. You're not going to think of some cool things. So just include that it doesn't put us at our best functioning brain.

103
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's going to be an automatic. One is to say where it were to perceive threat.

104
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.020
Alicia Noedel: I've been feeling a lot more

105
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:09.780
Alicia Noedel: calm about it. Just because I have been implementing you know the coping mechanisms and everything that you've showed me

106
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Recently like as in cuz

107
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Help me, I'm hearing panic attack and recently.

108
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.210
Alicia Noedel: I was I was I'm I'm

109
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.240
Alicia Noedel: not as scared as I was when it first hit the US.

110
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.570
Alicia Noedel: Okay, because the fatality rate and like the way that it's spreading here in New Mexico, because I know you don't live here.

111
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:40.170
Alicia Noedel: Um, the way that it's spreading here. It's not spreading the way it would spread in a big city.

112
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.010
Alicia Noedel: So it's not as scary.

113
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.000
Okay.

114
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.200
Alicia Noedel: But it's, it's still, you know, yeah.

115
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.580
Okay.

116
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've done everything that you can

117
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.250
Yeah.

118
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And if there's something else that you think of write it down. You don't have to hold it in your head. Let's write it down. Just let your brain say okay, we already wrote it down. We can take action if we have resources. This is what I'll do, right, that can be

119
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.560
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

120
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I wanted to spend a little bit of time. Um, oh wait no, you know, let's get into that imagery for a second because it's neat that you said

121
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: can't protect right that it's gonna it's some. It's a kind of come into the home and one of the images has to do with a protected figure

122
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just, I just wonder if part of the problem that you're protected figure is Scooby Doo.

123
00:13:47.280 --> 00:14:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, in and of itself. Nothing wrong with that totally full because it's kind of cute right we get a giggle out of it, too, which is we're going to remember things better. We're going to absorb it when we're when we're not disgusted by something

124
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:16.020
Alicia Noedel: Why that came straight from my childhood. That's why does the first thing I thought of. But I also think that I'm having a problem with that because, um, you know, we do have a lot of cowardly qualities to him.

125
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:28.980
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, but I mean he always ran away when when, you know, things got sick so MIT, a good idea because I knew that's what you were gonna say it might be a good idea for me to try and take another

126
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's revisit it figure. So why don't all do some brainstorm.

127
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why talking about this is important, right, we get to find out in real time, because for some people it can really work.

128
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Because remember, all we need to do is shift the, the neural network that we're in. We're in a in a fear response. We can just shifted focus here. Spend our energy in a different part of the brain.

129
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we can have a lowered heart rate calmer breathing so

130
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just think let's start with what you do, like, though, and then I did. If we have time, I'd really like to also cultivate a couple more pieces of imagery and this is all to develop down the line, possibly doing some of the MTR work.

131
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.130
If you're ready. Well, we, we have lots to talk about before that.

132
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Scooby Doo. The part that you do like

133
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that feels protective what what what attributes. Does he have it seems

134
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.180
Alicia Noedel: Um, I feel like

135
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:40.710
Alicia Noedel: Because he's a dog, you know, dogs are usually very loyal to their owners and protective of their owners.

136
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember he would make a little sound if if the, if he heard something. Maybe there was, he can alert people quicker than other people because of his acute hearing something like that.

137
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:57.930
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, but he was, he would over exaggerate. So they want to know, okay.

138
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got some problems with it. We've got the loyalty though that's not in question right but but the dissonance and that's a fun word you'll see it all over. Once you get what it is is that there is an opposing a lot of opposing information there's cowardly, there's

139
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. He ran away.

140
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.540
Alicia Noedel: Not just strength.

141
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And remember, these are the ideal. So we want to give ourselves permission, because we're in a distress state to really kind of flip the switch and go to the opposite. We're in a fear response. We want to feel love safety, we want to feel those things right away.

142
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just see what we do like is the loyalty, like the loyalty. So let's give, give yourself a chance to to just have a all say some things and you just see where your mind goes

143
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I mentioned some of those those figures from movies, whether it was the hall or the Iron Man.

144
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We've also got TV shows where you can see someone. Oh, so there's a show out there. I don't know if I'll be able to remember I'm kind of like this. I think it's called Outlander.

145
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you ever see that

146
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. And you won't get it. But there's particular. So I'm going to talk and you see what comes up, there's a particular character in there who

147
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: very loyal.

148
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't really match the some of the social norms of of this era, but his simple, clear definitive perspective on keeping

149
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: People a vulnerability safe is very sharp, he, he just does it. He, he protects protects protects protects and it's throughout many, many scenes and he puts us on life in danger.

150
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And

151
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.670
I'm just trying to

152
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm big lay on the bluff Lori's

153
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:21.060
Alicia Noedel: Usually the mayor in or movies aren't really the right you know people to think about, but the first person I thought about when he said that was

154
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.780
Alicia Noedel: Clary Starling.

155
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.210
Alicia Noedel: Oh, silence of the land.

156
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so she okay describe the quality she like about Clarice

157
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.430
Alicia Noedel: Um, she

158
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.310
Alicia Noedel: Protected protective

159
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:46.770
Alicia Noedel: Of victims people that have been victimized victimized. Got it, got it, got it.

160
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.220
Alicia Noedel: She's very witty and smart.

161
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:51.780
Okay.

162
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, hottest wit help protect a victim.

163
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.640
Alicia Noedel: So hard to explain things in my head.

164
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, and now the hypothesis. I'm operating on under here is you were missing this right so

165
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to develop so

166
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not like I can't get that that having the ability to negotiate verbally, because I'm intelligent, I can navigate it and enter personally risky thing by using wit and charm sound like I can't get that I could see that that would be useful in her personally

167
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a lot if you got to really kind of come at it at an angle with that. But the clear

168
00:19:47.910 --> 00:20:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Mama Bear behavior is is difficult for you to get to. I'm noticing. It's really hard to get to. Why don't you go to yourself for just a moment because the image might end up being you.

169
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:07.380
Alicia Noedel: I take care of everyone, I'm very protective of everybody. My, my boyfriend is just telling me.

170
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:15.000
Alicia Noedel: Because I was like, I don't know where I'm going to do my meeting, maybe I'm going to go out to the car because everyone is asleep, and it's we have like an open

171
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:24.690
Alicia Noedel: Floor Plan in my house. So like to hear a pin drop in like across the room. Right. And so I was like well just go sit in the car.

172
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:35.430
Alicia Noedel: Or in the sunroom and he's like, well, you're very considerate of everybody you know you're thinking about everybody else and you know I do. I'm very protective of my family.

173
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me how

174
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.380
Alicia Noedel: I, I don't

175
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:52.020
Alicia Noedel: want anything to happen. Anybody and I try and make sure that everybody's okay and has everything they need. I'll never let anybody go without anything and never want anyone to be hungry.

176
00:20:53.340 --> 00:21:00.900
Alicia Noedel: I'll make sure that you have, you know, if you need my last dollar more than me. I'll give it to you. Okay, that's some

177
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.010
Alicia Noedel: That's dipping a little bit to

178
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.240
Alicia Noedel: See, here's a good example. Yeah.

179
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:22.770
Alicia Noedel: There was a incident, a while back on me might be. We're living in a very unstable, please. Okay. And the person that we're living with pulled out a gun on him and I stood in front of him.

180
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:31.560
Alicia Noedel: And I grabbed the gun and I, you know, pretty much tried to tackle the guy who was trying to do it.

181
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.820
Alicia Noedel: And I got to the ground. You know, I would die from

182
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.550
Alicia Noedel: Any circumstance.

183
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And this was

184
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Just it's hard for me column guy, man. What's his name.

185
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: In your sweetheart, your husband. I don't remember whether people

186
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.080
Alicia Noedel: Oh my, my, my baby. His name is walking. Okay.

187
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you stood in front of a gun to with Joaquin on the other side.

188
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right

189
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.280
Yes.

190
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And did you have to think about whether to do that for long.

191
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:19.320
Alicia Noedel: No, no, it was instant right now.

192
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.920
Alicia Noedel: You know, he tried to move me and he didn't want that it was

193
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:23.640
Instant

194
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So sit with that for a minute. That's what I'm trying to get you to. So turns out you don't have to reach outside for an image, you already have it inside. And I want you to really understand

195
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That that instinct isn't going anywhere.

196
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: This is so old this instinct. That's why it's from that reptilian part of the brain. It's not going anywhere. I could try and talk in this way we can do exercise. That way we can do all kinds of psychological mumbo jumbo.

197
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not going anywhere.

198
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that was actual danger and you instinctively responded to it, the stuff you're doing right now is perceived threat, you're looking around, there's, I knew when you look around. Now there's actually no danger.

199
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.190
Right.

200
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You can trust in that instinct of these. Yeah.

201
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is where the the cognitive part comes in.

202
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is actually a task to say thank you. You've kept me safe all that worry those worry thoughts, there's going to be an invasion. Right.

203
00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I

204
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.230
Alicia Noedel: Religious make it worse. Doesn't make anything in

205
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.060
Alicia Noedel: Here doesn't help anything

206
00:23:51.810 --> 00:24:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's the doesn't. What I'm trying to put in place. Affirmative. So here's what it is that's what it's not want what it is, there is

207
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Safety

208
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: My kids, fine. He's fine. She's fine. No danger. That was me, perceiving something going into the future hypothesizing about it and look at my notes. I've done everything I can.

209
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm going to add to it. I'll update CDC or news once a day, I'll write that down. Now that's off my list.

210
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: My brain works better, faster, stronger when all of the parts of the brain are working together, including that instinct, but that that threat response that threat response to an actual danger.

211
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's going to be there for you in the future. You don't have to be thinking about it, it's going to be there, you can relax and that's it. I can relax and have

212
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: faith in myself.

213
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Trust in myself. I will

214
00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Take action and protect the things I love you have lived experience. Very few people have it quite that sharp. You're you've got it.

215
00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And no, you don't think you just act, you're going to do it again. You're gonna you're going to do that. You don't have to think about it for it to be there.

216
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm saying it over and over and kind of really sitting with it because this was something that wasn't really readily available when you start to get scared. Remember you have you you will solve the problem, you will

217
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

218
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that.

219
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that it's you.

220
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Ultimately that's what this this imagery is doing anyway, right, that's kind of what the trick is

221
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all about you when we see in others. The things we admire. Right. We also acknowledge and recognize them in ourselves too.

222
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So all right, now the pieces about self sacrifice on an ongoing basis and that and that that part. I'm not going to include in here, what I want to include is just the part about instinctual.

223
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: perceived danger took action. Just that that is just that's the part that's protection, psychological, physical protective quality God

224
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to

225
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.140
Alicia Noedel: I know close. I want to take a look at

226
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What's, what's the feeling you got right now. What's going on for you.

227
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:49.200
Alicia Noedel: I'm just like, I, I know that it's silly because I know that there isn't anything, you know, immediate danger anything and I am sick and tired of being scared and being worried about things.

228
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.480
Alicia Noedel: And

229
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.010
Alicia Noedel: I just made me feel better. You know about it.

230
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.710
Alicia Noedel: And because I do have the power to protect my family. I'm not helpless. No.

231
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's been at least up

232
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.530
Alicia Noedel: This feels

233
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, thank you for sharing that. So this dialed up this this intense feeling you just had my guess is

234
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This is

235
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This is connected to many, many, many, many, many, many, many

236
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.440
Alicia Noedel: Incidences in

237
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life of significant vulnerability and feeling like groundless. Okay, so just be compassionate about what you're going through that I do believe I have

238
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.010
Alicia Noedel: Faith.

239
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If you stick with this psychotherapy, the little steps that we're doing, even today, I believe that if you can do these

240
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: desensitization processes and integration, your response to the meaning of what vulnerability is or read or things like that will change. So just hang in there for it. Okay, we're just starting

241
00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:57.870
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

242
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're very receptive to the psychotherapy, so I

243
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Think this is going to have a positive outcome we relate to

244
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do it. Let's do a couple more.

245
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's two more things I'd like to do and that is I want to develop a container. If you ever heard anybody say oh I'm compartmentalizing that I'm not thinking about that right now. You ever heard anybody say that

246
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.920
Alicia Noedel: In a way.

247
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

248
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.860
Alicia Noedel: It was the new

249
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.790
Alicia Noedel: sequel to The Shining with Dr Seeley. I don't know if you like horror movies or not. The doctor sleep really

250
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.550
Alicia Noedel: He has this really cool imagery in his head about

251
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:51.300
Alicia Noedel: The like malevolent ghosts from the hotel coming back to, you know, try and feed off of his you know energy

252
00:28:51.960 --> 00:29:08.040
Alicia Noedel: And he comes up with this way to look at a box. It's a little tiny lock box and is able to, you know, imagine them going into this box and being locked in it and they go away forever. You know, and that's what I thought about

253
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.780
Alicia Noedel: That greatly. Yeah.

254
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on to that. And now let's see if it works. So the instructions for developing an emotional container. Are these. Now remember, this is metaphor. So it can be whatever. All right, but the instructions. So just this

255
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the container be big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff that they're being locked, which you kind of already said, and this is the piece that can go a couple of different directions that the stuff will want to stay

256
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: In there, what's in there that they'll stay in here. Now I get lots of different response to that. Remember, there's no wrong way to do this. It's just what comes up for you with those invitations.

257
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:06.360
Alicia Noedel: May innocence and all the things that were taken away from me and all the things that were

258
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:15.450
Alicia Noedel: What people fed off and what people disregarded and what it felt like everyone was after for me.

259
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're sharing the things that you would want in the box. Is that what you're saying.

260
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:32.820
Alicia Noedel: I guess my my weekend quote my, my, you know, my vulnerable qualities

261
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.220
Alicia Noedel: And things that

262
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:42.360
Alicia Noedel: That made me susceptible to abuse. Okay.

263
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:49.200
Alicia Noedel: Because that's what that's what made people who, you know, were

264
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.320
Alicia Noedel: Wanting to, you know, take advantage of me were so

265
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:02.910
Alicia Noedel: I wouldn't say attracted, but like, so I'm

266
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:14.280
Alicia Noedel: Quick to do it to me because, you know, they knew that I would that that's what you know they can get out of me that that was the reason why

267
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.420
Alicia Noedel: I don't know if I'm explaining it that way.

268
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing, you're doing a beautiful job. I want to let you know that I've heard you. Okay. So what just came up for you when I was talking about an emotional container. It sounds like there's a

269
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: An attribute about yourself that you you don't want anymore. You don't want to be right all of this.

270
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.910
Alicia Noedel: A victim. I don't want to be a victim anymore. Yeah, I got you.

271
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's put this over here for just a moment.

272
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a very precise.

273
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Little task and we're almost there. Remember how when, as soon as I said box, you had one it was small and all of this. What was this stuff.

274
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That we get sucked into the box. Right. This was, What's all this stuff that got sucked in locked and it stayed put in there. What was the stuff that gets sucked in.

275
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.890
Alicia Noedel: pain. Pain. Okay, now

276
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Describe the box, the way you want it, it's going to be a container that you and I will visit

277
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.460
Alicia Noedel: And all vault.

278
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.890
Alicia Noedel: And I thought about. Yeah, well,

279
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.750
Alicia Noedel: I big bank vault.

280
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

281
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.230
Alicia Noedel: A lot of things getting past eventful

282
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what kind of a locking system, you got on there.

283
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

284
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:39.570
Alicia Noedel: Anyone, is it coaching dial with the big tire iron looking spin thing.

285
00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. Yeah. Messenger.

286
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, got it. And then we have the dial dial code. Okay.

287
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm big like the size of

288
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.540
Like in a

289
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:06.180
Alicia Noedel: While what, what would that be like seven like the size of a, like a big bathroom.

290
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, size of the bathroom. Okay, now what comes up for you when I say that the stuff will either want to stay in there. If you can't think of any reason why this stuff would stay

291
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be something in there that that stuff would want to stay

292
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Then just the locking system can do the trick. If it's a good enough locked in that stuff will stay in there, whatever, what comes up for you when I say that.

293
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the thing. If I put vulnerability in there. It does. It means it's just getting fed on by this ugliness that you might put in there, it's just getting like Holden and re victimized. So I'm not thrilled with putting in a sense in that box, if that makes sense.

294
00:33:54.450 --> 00:34:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I, but I did hear you. I heard it as just this does a very particular thing like at the end of the session

295
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I might bring up

296
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Big emotions for you. You know, they might get activated and we're like, oh no, we've only got 10 minutes, you know, okay.

297
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.290
Alicia Noedel: Let's rock it up.

298
00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it in the box, baby.

299
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah but but the metaphor can work because you can picture. We'll do it together. Like, how is it going to get in there and is it. Can you hear it.

300
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: In their house. The body feel now, and then you and I, if you want to. We can open it together. Some people give me the code. So you know what I mean, like we can play. It's all play right it's all just we want to get there. But let's do this in a way that's palatable. We don't want more pain.

301
00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't want to leave you for the rest of the day with all of this activation. So its intention is to say, okay, you're feeling some sadness or maybe it's self-reproach or shame or something.

302
00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's see if we can put it in the container and then the next metaphor. I'm going to do with you as a distancing metaphor for some people, not only did they put it in a container. They send it away. So we're going to do that one next.

303
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, we have, we'll just go with this. Would you say this locking system is good enough to keep whatever it is we put in there.

304
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:21.570
Put

305
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: won't leak out come out.

306
00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.630
Alicia Noedel: Like to think so yeah

307
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll find out.

308
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Very nice. So the second one. I'm very much like this and you may end up using this in different ways, in your life, for example, I'll use in real time, what you're doing.

309
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This virus is going to sneak in through the window. It's going to sneak on someone's back of a hand and it'll invade in my home, and there's nothing I can do that a negative thought

310
00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Distancing metaphor. So here I am on the river bank and I have myself that if there's actual danger I will problem solve it and I have

311
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This sense of nurturing in my awareness of poetry and really being empowered with self growth and development as I sit here as I see this brilliance in this code. I know it in myself and I'm here on the riverbank and I'm aware of.

312
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you know, sort of that that quality and also being surrounded by two pockets. There's no, there's no self doubt there's confidence and assertive and of course right this this wisdom of self sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

313
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I sit here on the river and it makes sense now.

314
00:36:51.510 --> 00:37:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To take this negative perceived thought there's some danger in front of me right now. I can be in a relaxed body. You can have a relaxed mine and I can put that on a leaf.

315
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And slowly. I can see it sort of moving and rocking just a little bit as the water bumps it around and I can see it and I watch it me here on the river with my protective qualities here watching that and then I can't see it anymore.

316
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just left here.

317
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling good feeling safe.

318
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.320
Alicia Noedel: Feeling nurtured.

319
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:29.760
And wise.

320
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an example. We got lots of we got spaceship that takes off. We've got a terrain that goes by quickly click and gets further away for some people it's a car and it's they you know that that

321
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing goes to pass them and they just look in the rearview mirror and they can see getting further away, some people some balloon it

322
00:37:50.340 --> 00:38:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: drifts off out into the atmosphere. Someone said a shooting star and just went through so fast you know sailboat. So lots of ways to distance, but it has to be a thing that is a process. It's moves a way what comes up for you.

323
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.440
Alicia Noedel: Um,

324
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.490
Alicia Noedel: When you head up north from my

325
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:26.250
Alicia Noedel: City like towards Colorado. There's a bridge going from here to house, and it's a gorge an instant huge drop

326
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:32.940
Alicia Noedel: Like a very, very high bridge to all the way down to the Rio Grande River.

327
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.250
Alicia Noedel: That's what I think about dropping it from the top of the garbage.

328
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.570
Okay.

329
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And it keeps going, though, right.

330
00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Keeps Yeah, or it gets submerged in like you

331
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.820
Alicia Noedel: Know water.

332
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.570
Alicia Noedel: hits the water keeps going down the river.

333
00:38:55.590 --> 00:39:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so dropping off nickname that gorge. If you know it.

334
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:08.250
Alicia Noedel: I did the Taos out to us. I believe Gorge Bridge. I got it.

335
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Will you'll know from that that term, you'll know exactly. Okay.

336
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.010
All right.

337
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And is there bubbly water at the bottom, or is this like

338
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:19.680
Alicia Noedel: rapids. People go

339
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:24.930
Alicia Noedel: With their boats on it and stuff, the whitewater rapids like

340
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.900
Alicia Noedel: That's beautiful.

341
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.520
Mm hmm. Yep.

342
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

343
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

344
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

345
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And you would just drop it.

346
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.360
Okay, people texting me

347
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:57.420
Let me just see what else we got the imagery

348
00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.260
Okay.

349
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So that thing you mentioned earlier and I can give it if you want. We might be getting close to this word have a

350
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundary and assertiveness, when you were talking about. I'm a victim. I don't want to be a victim. Right. I don't want that.

351
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a single step.

352
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just be compassionate that you've developed things like self sacrifice putting others first

353
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: commendation all of those things that you kind of touched on a little bit earlier that you're trying to say it almost made it possible for me to be victimized. Right. I think I heard that right. You're

354
00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.020
Alicia Noedel: Their wallet is that I wouldn't want to get rid of either

355
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.120
Alicia Noedel: So that's why it's kinda you know like

356
00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I know they're lovely. They're great socialized things we we we look generous and maybe we enjoy the generosity.

357
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:09.030
Alicia Noedel: But the exact qualities have hurt me in the past to, you know, because people do take advantage of me.

358
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is where the word boundary comes in and you're going to hear a lot about it.

359
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you have any kind of negative opinion about this word boundary. I invite you to rethink it. It is amazing when you really get it.

360
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to pull up the list and screenshot it it's most of us spend the rest of our lives, working on these things. This is not something that happens just like that.

361
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

362
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Have compassion you developed your style of surviving in an environment that at times had scarcity okay you developed it

363
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were smart to do it because you survived, you're here today. We don't want to get rid of everything just want to say that may have been a solution of a 10 year old.

364
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Still a really viable solution, just not all the time.

365
00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Other things are important to not just placing others not just being not an inconvenience to anyone that great those things I we are you matter what you need. What you want matters.

366
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: As much as lucky.

367
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: As much as mine, as much as your daughters, and this is not habit for you.

368
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It's more habitual that self sacrifice has been what has kept you alive and it's going to be really uncomfortable to do anything but that.

369
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The easy way is passive aggression, by the way, if that's been a style of yours because it's not assertive.

370
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:52.470
Alicia Noedel: That's all. Everything that I've learned. You know, like people around me. It's not, you know,

371
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Many other great don't get rid of them. Sometimes stay. Keep them.

372
00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.630
Alicia Noedel: In a passive aggressiveness, though you know even bad qualities

373
00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So what we all do it. That's how I know what I'm talking about right now.

374
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's okay. It's just one tool just might not be for every situation. So we're just going to get some more. That's all. Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit about just the basics about boundaries are. Are these

375
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.760
Guys have enough

376
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just send them a text. I don't know quite what the problem is, I need help I can get, never had to reset my phone.

377
00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:35.370
I

378
00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:37.860
Can't. Okay.

379
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So two things in general there's a really general and you know humans aren't one or the other word gray. We're in the middle, but just to kind of get some terms boundaries tend to be

380
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Too porous. Um, let's say we have a screen here, right. This is the boundary

381
00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Think it's like a property boundary. There's a fence right well in our psyche, there's space between me and you.

382
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people, the screen is like this big gaping holes for someone's opinion to get through.

383
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Criticism

384
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Manipulation.

385
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotional hijacking

386
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: gaslighting can go over that another time.

387
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: stuff can get through really easily. But if we just

388
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Do this, how nothing gets through you.

389
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Are not having connection with people you might be perceived as cold as emotionally unavailable.

390
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: This is too much. This is too little. We just want that little bit

391
00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's my fingers. That's not real. So, how we recognize that is through

392
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to the body. And what do I need, what do I want these are the skills, I'ma say a fast, but these are some of the things that over the months that we work together, you're going to really understand

393
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to notice how you feel you're going to be able to name it, you're going to go to positive self talk if I'm worth it just going to be a little weird. Maybe, like, why am I

394
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll see how you do there. And then you're going to possibly if you want to communicate it not passively. It would look like this.

395
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel overwhelmed.

396
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking on this additional fill in the blank.

397
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you wait to see what your environment says environment says, I don't care. Well now you know you didn't know that before you didn't know because you were always

398
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: keeping yourself overwhelmed. You didn't have to find out that this object doesn't care or I feel overwhelmed.

399
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And your environment says oh really, cuz you've never said that before. How can I help and they care. This is risky because of notice how I said the environment may say working out.

400
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one reason why we don't say it directly. We Don't Talk directly about I'm feeling scared because people may say, I don't care.

401
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:31.620
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

402
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So we do this passive aggressive thing and we kind of we just keep sacrificing sacrificing

403
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.720
Alicia Noedel: We look just like I assume that they know

404
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:58.260
Alicia Noedel: That you know no one's going to like understand like the full magnitude of how I'm feeling. You know, like they get under exaggerate it woke me up. So I, I already expect that from people when I before I even know, try and I think that's what I need to work on.

405
00:46:59.700 --> 00:46:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

406
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:06.480
Alicia Noedel: It's like not being so you know quick to be they don't, you're not gonna care anyway so why am I going to say it, you know.

407
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we got to find out in real time, they may just care. And so maybe you

408
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be under estimating some of the people in your life capability to contain and hold those feelings that you have

409
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.730
I want to see if I can find something for us here.

410
00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:32.250
Alicia Noedel: I'm gonna have to check on my daughter real quick. I've heard her like yelling for like 30 minutes. I don't know if she's having a hard time using the bathroom.

411
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.360
Alicia Noedel: Sorry. Good.

412
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how's she doing

413
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:15.780
Alicia Noedel: She's being fussy. She doesn't want to sit down, she wants him to just hold her standing up and so she's getting mad.

414
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.060
Alicia Noedel: I screenshot of that already. Okay.

415
00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:25.080
Perfect.

416
00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

417
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.550
Alicia Noedel: It's cold in here.

418
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to get another layer.

419
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.150
Alicia Noedel: No, it's okay. I should have started a fire.

420
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.490
Alicia Noedel: We have a little fireplace.

421
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So we, we've got a little bit of time we can at least look at a couple of these. I'm gonna let me just pick one. That's a real

422
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I read type this elsewhere. And it's numbered, but this is its original little screenshot. I took at one point. Yeah.

423
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, these are so good.

424
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at the healthy bounce healthy boundaries over here because a lot of times people will say, this is what it constitutes a a porous unhealthy boundary. Actually, they do both.

425
00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually you can see passive aggressive right in your. Let's go to number three. Third one and you expect reciprocity means given take in a relationship you share responsibility and power.

426
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Decision making, things like that. Just because someone makes the money doesn't mean they hold all the power

427
00:49:48.750 --> 00:50:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: They're still shared responsibility. So that's a healthy approach and unhealthy boundary would be you have no balance of power responsibility relationships, you tend to be either overly responsible and controlling or passive independent

428
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This can this can come up right that you're going to probably notice yourself in here, here and there.

429
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Its intention is not to wipe you out or feel sad. I mean, you may feel those things. But it's to say this is so common so prolific

430
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That that when people look at these everyone I've ever talked to his said, I'm in there. I can see that I'm going to work on that and and if there's just something about having it written out in such such VERY SIMPLE SENTENCES so distinct

431
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.370
Okay.

432
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at this first one you can say no or yes and you are okay when others say no to you.

433
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.370
Alicia Noedel: Ah,

434
00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:52.920
Alicia Noedel: Hard on hellner

435
00:50:53.130 --> 00:51:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, look at how powerful this is, I mean they it's like they strip us there with the psychology. You can't say no because you're afraid of rejection and abandonment that cuts through all it right there.

436
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't it

437
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. But you're not alone. This is remember I was saying early you cultivated a sense of probably self sacrifice.

438
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because it meant that the little bit of attention that you are getting it wouldn't leave you. Okay, but that might not fit your current resource right now that might not be. You could actually I'm guessing afford to say your nose more clearly and not lose

439
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The people that you love.

440
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But you'll have to teach me that, because I don't know your relationships. Yet I only know your history said has been quite challenging.

441
00:51:55.590 --> 00:52:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a strong sense of identity. There's number two and you respect yourself. So if we spent time. And I said, I want to hear a whole list of things that that describe you, you know,

442
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know some things about your protective

443
00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right kind, generous, definitely. You are self sacrificing okay but do you respect yourself.

444
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.030
Alicia Noedel: Never given any thought to it.

445
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So you see how they're right next to each other, though, we're saying these things all i this is who I am. Do you love that.

446
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, or

447
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a mixed feeling like I do it because I have to, or is this who I really, really, really, really, really, really am.

448
00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so look over here on the right, your identity, the unhealthy boundary. Again, those are the porous ones right your identity or overly rigid your identity consists of what you think others want you to be

449
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are a chameleon. Now of course this is we're just putting it in very definitive terms, it's just a point of departure, do I relate to this don't relate to this.

450
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.530
Alicia Noedel: Yes, I do.

451
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

452
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.390
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. Good, at least in the past I've had to

453
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:29.280
Alicia Noedel: That way.

454
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing more and more you're starting to say some of your nose. You're starting to

455
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:41.940
Alicia Noedel: I read all of them. And I can agree to a certain extent, to all of them to unhealthy boundaries.

456
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.210
Alicia Noedel: That makes me sad.

457
00:53:49.770 --> 00:54:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the one down here. Let me count this 112345678 it's the eighth one where it says you ignore your inner voice and allow others expectations to define your potential

458
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that one.

459
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:08.190
Alicia Noedel: It's over the way

460
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:10.440
Alicia Noedel: That

461
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the one.

462
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm going to be spending a lot of time, encouraging.

463
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: inner awareness, whether it's the body, it's your emotion will. Well, how did you feel well. And that's real. It's not dependent on whether someone sees it feels it agrees.

464
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If you felt it.

465
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I need to know. That's real. Now what meaning you make of it because notice we've played a little bit today with fear and anxiety.

466
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to have them. It's automatic and brains like

467
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, she say she say she said she say fish, you say, fish, you say there's parts of our brain right

468
00:54:52.410 --> 00:55:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That. That's all it does. But that's only one part. That's why we did also all these other cool parts. So then you go up here to the frontal lobe and you say okay, thanks for sharing. Thank you for keeping me alive, but did

469
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fine, there's actually no danger. Right now I've got these other things to do, thinking about it and worrying about it.

470
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: The worrying actually doesn't do anything. It's sapping my energy, making the irritable with the people I love. Like what, now this virus has invaded this house, and it's not even here.

471
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

472
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'll write it down. And thank you for sharing. You've kept me alive, but right now.

473
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to turn my attention to things that I enjoy

474
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because then you lose twice. The other way to spend all that being scared and sad and irritable and then you get the infection.

475
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not or then might get both. He was miserable and you get it, or you could just enjoy your

476
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Work your prevention plan brains going to keep running here and there, it's going to automatically come up and get you get you all riled up, it's going to do that.

477
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's there for you. You can trust. It's going to get a little worried, just write it down, okay, don't worry about, you know, later I wrote you down.

478
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll make sure I make this or I'll clean this okay or anything it down. But spending time over and over and over. It's saps a life out. Yeah, yeah.

479
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.430
Alicia Noedel: Maybe most people anyway.

480
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.370
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I've been feeling like I felt like very

481
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:28.380
Alicia Noedel: Low energy

482
00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:35.580
Alicia Noedel: And like, not wanting to do anything. You know, that's not how I want to be.

483
00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And Elise, you're right. Now, this whole planet is we're all in this together.

484
00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And when I mean

485
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:47.700
Alicia Noedel: I'm sure I'm not the only person who can make this by

486
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:51.000
Alicia Noedel: Sure, there's a lot more people that are scared.

487
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're all talking about it. Everybody's we're all starting our day talking about it, talking about, okay, you're not

488
00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:03.420
Alicia Noedel: sick of hearing about it to, you know, I'm so tired of it. I wish you would just happen. So they were just

489
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.520
Alicia Noedel: You know, be over with, you know,

490
00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:07.560
Alicia Noedel: I'm tired of it.

491
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:15.360
Alicia Noedel: And it hasn't even, you know, hit us up the way it takes like a lot of other people really hard. You know, it's very sad, but

492
00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.310
Alicia Noedel: I don't know, it's just so, so

493
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like for you to write down the actions that you can take. Write them down on the list, get them out of your head.

494
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you have the thoughts after that.

495
00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Use the imagery

496
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And just drop it into the gorge just drop it.

497
00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.280
Alicia Noedel: Okay. Your

498
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Brains going to bring it up again. Then you go look at your list and you say,

499
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it listed right here. Now, you either take action and you go do those things or don't bother putting them on the list, you don't think you're going to actually post things

500
00:57:53.730 --> 00:58:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to drive the CDC and pick it or you know i mean supposed to do. So that's it. You see, or you could do what you just did two seconds ago images which you've been doing

501
00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to get it over with her to get the invasion. No, I don't think that's what you really

502
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want the interpretation that pain, distress of this worrying. It's so do these things instead

503
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't really want that.

504
00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:34.260
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, no, I don't. But you know, I just don't want to think about it anywhere. I was literally going to get on here and ask you to do.

505
00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:49.440
Alicia Noedel: I was over exaggerating. And if you thought I needed to, like, get on medication to, like, calm down, or like whatever the case may be, because I thought maybe you know I'm freaking out for no reason, or, you know, I'm being too.

506
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:53.190
Alicia Noedel: I don't know, like cautious.

507
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So far what you said no.

508
00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You're right there in the middle and with everybody else. We're all my hands are drying up from all the handwashing our

509
00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Schools are cancelled I my everybody's home it's

510
00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:11.760
Alicia Noedel: Where

511
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.630
Alicia Noedel: It's crazy.

512
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But it also doesn't the the opposite, that is

513
00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Another version of this is snow worse than the flu in a few weeks. Whenever we're going to hear

514
00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: The same people that were vulnerable before are vulnerable, just like the flu. It's me some peace with the CDC the funding, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And all that we're in, you did.

515
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:40.680
Necessary.

516
00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another version, why not this other version versus the one you're coming up with that one.

517
00:59:49.230 --> 01:00:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm choosing that one because I have not available to my family not available to my clients if I'm constantly in that headspace and there's nothing I can do. I'm going to write a list of the things I can do and I'm going to do.

518
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:13.200
Alicia Noedel: And I think it's a lot of it has to do also with me being raised by like a really, really Catholic family like all my elders were very, very Catholic and all that we're, you know,
