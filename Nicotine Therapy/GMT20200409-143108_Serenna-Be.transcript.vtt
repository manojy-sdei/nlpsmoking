Serenna Beers: Morning.

4
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.730
Kennerh Blaine: Good morning.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.930
Serenna Beers: How are ya.

6
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.370
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, how about yourself.

7
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.000
Serenna Beers: I'm pretty good for a Thursday, whatever that means.

8
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.200
Kennerh Blaine: You get

9
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:59.700
Serenna Beers: A yes I did my my office is still kind of in in in boxes. I'll probably get to that this weekend. So for right now, I've kind of got myself set up in the living room. It's nice. Got a fire going. Fun stuff.

10
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.350
Serenna Beers: Yeah, we're asking

11
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.790
So,

12
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.000
Serenna Beers: How are you, how are you doing with the whole stay at home thing.

13
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.340
Serenna Beers: Is that had any any any impact on you emotionally

14
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.630
Kennerh Blaine: No, not really because I i really don't stay home and log

15
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.450
Kennerh Blaine: In, you know, we're out on the lake for a week and then I've been going down to my parents house and remodeling.

16
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.400
Serenna Beers: So that's nice.

17
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.520
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, there's not a lot of just sitting around

18
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.660
Serenna Beers: Well, that's good. Cuz some some some folks I think are really struggling, struggling with it.

19
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:57.060
Serenna Beers: You know, but at least we can get out and do walks and stuff. And, you know, physical health is really important, especially for anybody who struggled, you know, with trauma and stuff like that. I mean, just getting

20
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.450
Serenna Beers: Getting your body active and your and your, your mind active is really huge you know

21
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.360
Kennerh Blaine: I agree.

22
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.150
Kennerh Blaine: Now, are you a primary drug and alcohol counselor or a primary mental health counselor.

23
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.880
Serenna Beers: So I so I am both. I am a licensed for both. I am a mental health counselor, as well as a substance abuse.

24
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.910
Serenna Beers: I've worked primarily with substance use disorders because of where I lived.

25
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:43.980
Serenna Beers: But, but, quite honestly. I mean, they really go hand in hand. I don't know any recovering addict. That doesn't that doesn't have some sort of trauma trauma trauma, but

26
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:53.310
Serenna Beers: My, my, my specialty. My focus my higher education is really around trauma and like I had shared with the group.

27
00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:03.990
Serenna Beers: Experience wise as well is is is what got me is what led me to become more educated with mental health because there's such a

28
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:15.660
Serenna Beers: There's such a shortage of help. I mean there is never going to be a time for somebody in my background to find work because, I mean, there are so many

29
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:27.510
Serenna Beers: undiagnosed mental health folks as well as there's so much out there, especially in this day and age in this world and how how it is. A lot of times people just really don't know what

30
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.280
Serenna Beers: To do with it and so

31
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:39.810
Serenna Beers: Yeah, so I primarily at this point, it seems like I'm doing more work around mental health because of my specialty and

32
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:54.660
Serenna Beers: In trauma trauma, which, which I love. I mean that's honestly where my passion lies. And so when I had this opportunity to really use my skills. I was, I was pretty pretty excited about it. So,

33
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.100
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, um, the reason I ask is my other accounts for Gabby wasn't sure.

34
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.930
Kennerh Blaine: I would pay for to mental health counselors show

35
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.240
Kennerh Blaine: Oh no, how that all works out. But I guess if it's not

36
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.300
Kennerh Blaine: If Medicare doesn't say anything, then I'm not gonna say anything until they

37
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.880
Kennerh Blaine: So,

38
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.000
Serenna Beers: Well, I don't want to speak out of turn and I can

39
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.910
Serenna Beers: Follow, follow up on that, because that really is a good

40
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:44.910
Serenna Beers: Question, but I know that there's certain billing codes that you bill for under em, Dr. And so I think as long as the billing code is differently than there's no reason why they

41
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.830
Kennerh Blaine: They wouldn't pay for it because it is a

42
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:58.200
Serenna Beers: Specialty service. And so they the builders, thank God they know what what coding to Bill under so I don't believe that.

43
00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.100
Serenna Beers: That's even going to

44
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.850
Serenna Beers: Be an issue for you, but I will follow up because now I want to know, but but i i feel like

45
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.050
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah.

46
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:15.330
Serenna Beers: That would be the that would be what would happen, that would be. That's not very good English. I believe that's how they would kind of

47
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.440
Serenna Beers: Formulate it it would fall under a different category because it is a specialty

48
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.080
Serenna Beers: Okay.

49
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.130
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, good.

50
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:37.800
Serenna Beers: So specifically, what I want to kind of go over with you today, in which I which I take notes for is just one. I just want to go into more specifics with you you know i i did share a little bit with it.

51
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.570
Serenna Beers: Within the group setting.

52
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.060
Serenna Beers: But there's, I need to scoot up so I can see your face more because I am blind, even with glasses on.

53
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.760
Kennerh Blaine: I just want my computer.

54
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:57.270
Serenna Beers: Oh, awesome. Thanks. There is more. You know, there's more specifics that I like to go over with, with folks.

55
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:10.710
Serenna Beers: If they're going to go through em, Dr. You know, there's I go over the the protocol with you. Specifically, and then and then you, you, you and I identify

56
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.130
Serenna Beers: I like to start with the five most

57
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:26.580
Serenna Beers: Five most disturbing events and then we rate them and then I kind of explained to you what to expect. And then our next session is when we go for it. Does that make sense.

58
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.780
Kennerh Blaine: Yes, it does. Okay.

59
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:41.220
Serenna Beers: And so one of the things that I do want to make sure that you understand is when we begin the actual work and we start doing the bilateral stimulation. It's going to be really

60
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:54.570
Serenna Beers: Important that you are in an area in in in an area where it's quiet and where you're not distracted. Like there's no no one walking around or anything, because when you begin to

61
00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:04.200
Serenna Beers: Follow the wand and do the bilateral stimulation to be interrupted kind of interrupts that process. And it's really important for the

62
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.160
Serenna Beers: Advocacy that that it not be interrupted. You know what I mean.

63
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.440
Kennerh Blaine: Yes.

64
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:24.150
Serenna Beers: Okay, perfect. Let me see. I don't know if I can share my screen. I want to see if there we go. So I'm going to share my screen with you and just kind of go over these steps. So part of what what we're

65
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.720
Serenna Beers: Doing OKay. Right. Right. Now, are you able to see all that

66
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.360
Kennerh Blaine: I am

67
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.730
Kennerh Blaine: Oh, wonderful. I'll have to scroll up

68
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:39.000
Serenna Beers: Yeah, I'm part of the. Oh, it looks like I have a typo. Okay, anyway.

69
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:48.240
Serenna Beers: The preparation is just basically for you to prepare yourself. And so like I just shared with you finding a really

70
00:08:50.010 --> 00:09:01.440
Serenna Beers: Set cured suitable place and that you're setting aside that that time where you know you know you won't have the dog won't come in or the wife won't come come in, it's just

71
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.850
Kennerh Blaine: Just for you to

72
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:13.080
Serenna Beers: Not be disturbed and then we identify the nature of the issue, which is which is part of the the work that you and I are going to do in this session.

73
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:19.860
Serenna Beers: You know, and then we kind of talk about it, but specifically when we go go over the

74
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:30.060
Serenna Beers: The top five. What I don't want to have to have you do, though, is go into the specifics. And the reason why that I want to just kind of keep it to the

75
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:43.230
Serenna Beers: Bullet points and then kind of like a specific yes and no questions is, because I don't want to actually activate you until we're getting ready to go through it because when I activate

76
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:54.450
Serenna Beers: Yeah, because if you start to like, share with me and go into the store story part then your brain is doing the same thing that it's always done. So you're talking about it.

77
00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:02.130
Serenna Beers: All the while it's part of your trauma, your brain will naturally push it down or become more

78
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:21.270
Serenna Beers: Emotionally over reactive and what we want to do is when when we go through the story the event that's when we want to be doing the bilateral stimulation, because that's how your brains gonna going to desensitize itself is through that process. Does that make sense.

79
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.850
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, okay. Uh huh.

80
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:42.030
Serenna Beers: So, and, and then we'll, we'll specifically pinpoint the exact memory that is causing you pain so that we can effectively address it. And what I mean by that is you know there's there's an event and like I shared with the group, you know that.

81
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.730
Serenna Beers: The, the whole event around my mom's death was pretty traumatic.

82
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:55.800
Serenna Beers: But the specific target that that bothered me for years and years and years that I had the intrude terms of memories with and all that was that.

83
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:09.150
Serenna Beers: Moment when I was sitting on the steps and my dad comes rolling up in in the car and but I don't see my mom. So that would be like this specific target that's that memory that that core memory.

84
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:16.200
Serenna Beers: Out of the whole event that stood stood out and had caused me pain for all of those years. So we're going to find

85
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:37.230
Serenna Beers: That that target now on the next part where it says target selection is one of the most critical steps in EM Dr. It is because, again, it's that heightened part of that event that continues to to kind of like loop itself, it goes around and a loop and a loop and a loop.

86
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:45.390
Serenna Beers: And and here it says 10 most traumatic memories and 10 most faith 10 most fate fate favorable

87
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.150
Serenna Beers: The reason why I want to start with five

88
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.800
Serenna Beers: Your, your top five is because most often in EM Dr.

89
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:59.910
Serenna Beers: When you begin doing the work by it, but by about the third or fourth memory and this has been really

90
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.580
Serenna Beers: Consistent and all the patients that I've done, em, Dr. With by about the fourth or fifth memory.

91
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:22.590
Serenna Beers: The other ones that used to be as disturbing just just kind of dissipate. Like, it's not as disturbing there, your, your, your brain starts to do the work on its own. And that's exactly what we want.

92
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.280
Serenna Beers: And the part about

93
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:34.650
Serenna Beers: The favorable memories is just really for me to be able to pull from it's it's doing what's called a cognitive inner

94
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:48.210
Serenna Beers: Inner weave and what that entails is let's say that you bring up a traumatic memory and you really become activated and you you you become stuck.

95
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:57.870
Serenna Beers: Meaning your brain is kind of going, Yeah, I'm pretty comfortable with this trauma. I think I'm just not going to process it, which is very common.

96
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:07.560
Serenna Beers: I can pull from those those favorable memories and interweave it to the negative to be able to help

97
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:25.770
Serenna Beers: Help that Pat pattern be broken. So I it's me trying to pull from the positive to to instill to kind of move the negative aside so that your brain doesn't doesn't feel so over loaded and it, it kind of

98
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.800
Serenna Beers: unstick itself for for lack of better terms.

99
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:42.720
Serenna Beers: And so this is a step by step process in which you'll describe from start to finish the specific details of that memory, including like any visual images that you

100
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.730
Serenna Beers: Notice any sounds feelings physical sin.

101
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.930
Serenna Beers: Stations because that trauma gets lodged in your nervous system.

102
00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:07.800
Serenna Beers: It's quite common again for that to be associated with, you know, whether like you start to feel a stomach ache coming on, even during the process of doing the the bilateral stimulation

103
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:22.320
Serenna Beers: You might start to feel, you know, sadness, or you might start to feel anger. I mean, it's really common, common for you to associate that event with various parts of images feelings sights and sounds. Okay.

104
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:24.690
Serenna Beers: And then

105
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.390
Serenna Beers: You know, every traumatic event.

106
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:39.390
Serenna Beers: Is attached to a name a negative disempowering belief about yourself, you know, for, for, for me, that memory of my mom.

107
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.800
Serenna Beers: Was, you know,

108
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:49.320
Serenna Beers: I'm never I'm never gonna, I'm never going to be loved. Again, you know,

109
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.260
Serenna Beers: I felt unlovable.

110
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:52.980
Kennerh Blaine: Because

111
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.110
Serenna Beers: At the point that my mom had died.

112
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.400
Serenna Beers: And I kind of took

113
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.630
Serenna Beers: Over because I was

114
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:08.670
Serenna Beers: The oldest girl of the fam family, all of a sudden, while all my siblings went out and played. I was in the house, making dinner. I was doing the cleaning

115
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:18.180
Serenna Beers: I became like I took over that that that that role. So I felt like I just wasn't worthy of love. I was just kind of a slave. That's how kind of how I felt.

116
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.470
Serenna Beers: And so I also had that that

117
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:48.480
Serenna Beers: Feeling of I will never be normal again and hence why I use that as an egg sample because I really felt like I was cheated of my childhood and I resented my dad for 20 plus years. So you can imagine, you know, to, to work through that traumatic event and to replace that I will never be

118
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.130
Serenna Beers: Normal

119
00:15:50.160 --> 00:16:09.540
Serenna Beers: Again with I did the best that I could with with what I had. Or, you know, I am lovable. This is a normal thing because I really felt like I was not a normal kid like this didn't happen to others. When in reality, I'm there's thousands and millions of

120
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.980
Serenna Beers: Kids that have lost their

121
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:20.130
Serenna Beers: Parents at a young age. So then once we identify that negative cognition that you have attached to that traumatic event.

122
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:35.730
Serenna Beers: Then comes the work, then we start the desensitization and the desensitization of which, when we start this work. I'm going to be in a different room with a different background so that way you're able to see this light. Can you see this light.

123
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.430
Kennerh Blaine: Yep.

124
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:44.550
Serenna Beers: Okay, so it's much brighter hang on there. There we go. You see it, it's much brighter when

125
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:51.690
Serenna Beers: I'm when I'm in a different background, but I just basically I follow it like this and you follow it and then you know you

126
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.250
Kennerh Blaine: You tap using your hands.

127
00:16:53.250 --> 00:17:05.070
Serenna Beers: Like, like I shared and you'll tap with me simultaneously while I move the one and then you will begin to share that traumatic event from start to finish. All the while,

128
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:21.990
Serenna Beers: I'll like stop at certain times. And this is also where I really pay attention to your body language. I look at your eyes I I I I asked you, things like where do you feel it in in your body.

129
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:26.340
Serenna Beers: And so this is this is where you would say, you know, I feel

130
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:34.140
Serenna Beers: I mean, I've heard things like my fingers feel tingly. My I have a stomachache. I have a lump in my throat. I mean,

131
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:43.650
Serenna Beers: The traumas really weird. I mean, it hits people very differently. And so that's where you'll share what's happening to you fit bit physically

132
00:17:44.220 --> 00:18:05.700
Serenna Beers: And so within that as you're doing the bilateral stimulation. We basically move the trauma down and out. So I'll have you do, I'll have you do described to me. Basically what you feel. What you see what you hear, until we get the disturbance level.

133
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.950
Serenna Beers: Of which

134
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.200
Serenna Beers: At the beginning, I forgot this part, I

135
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:18.180
Serenna Beers: I asked you to rate it. So when I activate you when when I say tell me about this event. More specifically,

136
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.680
Serenna Beers: The goal of that is

137
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.220
Serenna Beers: Is to activate you because I want to bring your disturbance

138
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:34.650
Serenna Beers: Level up as high as I can so that we can desensitize you all the way and it's not because I like to see you in pain that I'm going to poke and prod to add to

139
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:47.370
Serenna Beers: Its it's so that we can do the most effective work and how we do the most effective work is by myself really activating you and pushing that trauma button for lack of better terms.

140
00:18:48.390 --> 00:19:01.110
Serenna Beers: Okay, so I usually use the wand for about 10 minutes give or take. There's times when I've actually done a consistent wand. I've done bilateral steam you

141
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.180
Serenna Beers: leyshon back and forth like 100 times because the disturbance level.

142
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:12.930
Serenna Beers: Was so high, I and I'll keep going. As long as you can, can handle it. Okay.

143
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:24.450
Serenna Beers: And then adding and then after each each round, I will stop. I'll have you breathe in and and and I'll and I'll guide you through that. So you'll breathe in everything positive

144
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:44.010
Serenna Beers: The positive cognition that we identify that that you identify and you'll breathe out all those Nate. Nate negative things. And so it's kind of like we're basically going to work all aspects of your mind and body and how this has impacted you

145
00:19:45.570 --> 00:20:01.260
Serenna Beers: And then the installation part. This is my, my, my favorite part. And the reason it's my, my favorite part one as a therapist and to when I went through this is because this is where we get to replace

146
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:18.120
Serenna Beers: The intensity of the negative motion of the negative emotions with the positive and empowering beliefs that maybe you want to feel so like if my feeling is, I'm not good enough. I want to feel like I'm good enough. I mean, I don't want to sit in that yucky.

147
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:18.570
Kennerh Blaine: Thought and

148
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:31.980
Serenna Beers: I I'm not good enough. So we do the installation part and with the installation. The ones motion will change. So while we kind of go like this with the negative. Right.

149
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:39.480
Serenna Beers: And it'll honestly you really will be able to see the one better in when when there's

150
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:47.430
Serenna Beers: A darker background with the installation. It goes faster. So you'd go faster. And that's like basically

151
00:20:47.820 --> 00:21:02.070
Serenna Beers: The slower pace. We open. Yep, for lack of better terms we unlock the trauma box and then with the faster. We're kind of closing it down. Right. And so we in do the installation until you feel yourself.

152
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:13.470
Serenna Beers: Kind of back to a homeopath spaces place so you feel more balanced your body feels better your mind feels better your overall sense of

153
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.300
Serenna Beers: Of

154
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:25.140
Serenna Beers: Negative emotions and feelings that are were associated with that event feel more stabilized. Does that make sense.

155
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.380
Kennerh Blaine: Okay. Uh huh.

156
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.220
Serenna Beers: Okay. And so then the closing part, um,

157
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:41.940
Serenna Beers: Basically, your brain is going to experience high stimulation, especially to your

158
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:52.260
Serenna Beers: Nervous system. So, I mean there. I don't want to put ideas in your head, because I don't want you to build a construct memory around it, or a construct thought

159
00:21:52.860 --> 00:22:05.850
Serenna Beers: Because this really is an individual experience, but just, just to kind of share a couple. The most common thread is my feet and hands feel tingly. I cannot tell you

160
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:14.760
Serenna Beers: The hundreds of times that I've heard that at the end of it, and they almost feel kind of floaty almost feel like like they're drunk without the booze.

161
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.640
Serenna Beers: But it makes sense because we're

162
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.030
Serenna Beers: We're doing intense stimulation to your brain by you.

163
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:28.380
Serenna Beers: By by activating left and right brain back and forth, right, which is initiating rim and so

164
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.820
Serenna Beers: In closing, one of the things that I will ask you

165
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:45.690
Serenna Beers: To do is to just kind of notice that stuff because the the end our processing continues even post session. So you could feel the effects of it. Gosh, for up

166
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.650
Serenna Beers: For up to the next 24 hours, you might feel kind of like

167
00:22:51.120 --> 00:23:02.640
Serenna Beers: foggy. You might feel very kind of like, like you're kind of walking around in a daze which I just want you to know is pretty pretty standard does all this make make sense.

168
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.850
Kennerh Blaine: It is

169
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.760
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, we had

170
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.630
Kennerh Blaine: I had started this with Gabby.

171
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:23.250
Kennerh Blaine: And then all of the, you know, we're no longer allowed to go to the county buildings so okay right now we just check in by phone.

172
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:26.730
Serenna Beers: Okay.

173
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.650
Kennerh Blaine: So some of this i i

174
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.990
Kennerh Blaine: I barely heard off we practice it very, very little.

175
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.060
Serenna Beers: But okay um

176
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.700
Kennerh Blaine: I want to do anything that's going to help

177
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:39.660
Okay.

178
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:48.720
Serenna Beers: All right, well, now that we've gone over the steps and i think i mean this is really in an important piece because

179
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:58.380
Serenna Beers: If you don't understand, you know, what's what, what we're doing. It's, it seems to me that it's more difficult.

180
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:05.940
Serenna Beers: For you to be more open minded about it because like I said, I think I mentioned in in the group.

181
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:12.030
Serenna Beers: It's very important that I have your buy in that you understand that the work that we're

182
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:31.680
Serenna Beers: Doing one is real to is effective and three is actually going to help you. I mean, you know, if I was going through the motions and I didn't understand something, how am I really going to be fully Oh, open to what the benefits could could actually be right.

183
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:33.810
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah.

184
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:45.450
Serenna Beers: Okay, so why don't we start with, and I want to reiterate, I don't want you to go into the story because I don't want to activate you until we're ready to do the work. So give me kind of

185
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.720
Serenna Beers: Sure. A brief snapshot of

186
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.510
Serenna Beers: What, what you want to work on.

187
00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.010
Kennerh Blaine: Um, I'm

188
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.240
Kennerh Blaine: Going to my anger.

189
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.880
Kennerh Blaine: Because of the

190
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.000
Kennerh Blaine: molest

191
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.790
Kennerh Blaine: Um, let me

192
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.470
Kennerh Blaine: Have you stopped being sad.

193
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.480
Serenna Beers: And just really quick.

194
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:35.100
Serenna Beers: Can you tell me who who was responsible for that.

195
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.210
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah yeah

196
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.560
Kennerh Blaine: His name was wanting it was back in

197
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:53.880
Serenna Beers: 6465 Boy, that's a long time to carry that around.

198
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.820
Kennerh Blaine: And that's BS.

199
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.630
Kennerh Blaine: And it continues to

200
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.090
Kennerh Blaine: Come back up and affect my life in all aspects.

201
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.560
Serenna Beers: Okay.

202
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.130
Serenna Beers: Would you say

203
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:33.150
Serenna Beers: If I were to ask you to rate it on a scale of zero to 10 where 10 is the highest disturbance zero is

204
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:35.820
Serenna Beers: None

205
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:40.410
Serenna Beers: Obviously, it's not that. But how would you rate it just just

206
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.330
Serenna Beers: Just your, your first thought.

207
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.500
Kennerh Blaine: Nine.

208
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.430
Okay.

209
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.330
Serenna Beers: And is there another one.

210
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.800
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah, my father, leaving home for war.

211
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.660
Kennerh Blaine: He would be gone for a couple of years at a time.

212
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.830
Kennerh Blaine: Up until he got out when I was 14

213
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:18.480
Kennerh Blaine: So having for a year, maybe year and a half, they made shipped out for a couple of years.

214
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.700
Kennerh Blaine: All through the you know the Vietnam War.

215
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:25.980
Serenna Beers: And

216
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.040
Serenna Beers: On a scale of zero to 10

217
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:30.720
Serenna Beers: How would you rate that

218
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.040
Kennerh Blaine: Can okay

219
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.910
Serenna Beers: Do you have another one.

220
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.920
Kennerh Blaine: Having my son, taken from me on his sixth birthday.

221
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.180
Kennerh Blaine: Which was deserved.

222
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.040
Serenna Beers: But there's just the pain or pain around that.

223
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:09.690
Kennerh Blaine: Yeah.

224
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.720
Serenna Beers: And

225
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.450
Serenna Beers: Just briefly why was he taken away.

226
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.820
Kennerh Blaine: My drug addiction.

227
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.990
Kennerh Blaine: I had, I had lymphoma cancer and

228
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.940
Kennerh Blaine: Then I was shooting large quantities of heroin and speed and

229
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:38.520
Serenna Beers: Okay.

230
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.890
Kennerh Blaine: It wasn't very nice home life one

231
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.910
Sure.

232
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.290
Serenna Beers: Okay scale of zero to

233
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.980
10

234
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:51.720
Serenna Beers: Okay.

235
00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.920

Kennerh Blaine: Yeah. Actually, my son molesting a six year old boy in my house when I was 14

237
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.880
Serenna Beers: On a scale of zero to 10

238
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.990
Serenna Beers: Can I have your rating.

239
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.600
Serenna Beers: All right, give me. Do you have a fifth one

240
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.790
Kennerh Blaine: I don't think so.

241
00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.400
Kennerh Blaine: Well, I know I do.

242
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.190
Kennerh Blaine: My parents into a

243
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.510
Kennerh Blaine: Home and memory care.

244
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:08.010
Serenna Beers: Okay.

245
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.680
Serenna Beers: When did that happen.

246
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.200
Kennerh Blaine: Nine months ago.

247
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.720
Serenna Beers: That's pretty fresh then

248
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.230
Kennerh Blaine: Yes.

249
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.570
Serenna Beers: Tell me on

250
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:37.980
Serenna Beers: a scale of zero to 1010

251
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.980
Serenna Beers: So, oh,

252
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:48.720
Serenna Beers: That's right. So give me. Give me, give me your, your top five.

253
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:59.850
Serenna Beers: Fake, fake favorable moments. I mean, give me your top five favorable moments or memories and with this, if

254
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.050
Serenna Beers: If you want to describe it a little bit more, that's fine because

255
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.780
Serenna Beers: There's, it's not a negative, so it's not going to

256
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.120
Serenna Beers: Activate you, if anything, it'll create

257
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:17.790
Serenna Beers: positivity and that is really where we want your brain to naturally gravitate to. We want it to become more adaptive

258
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.250
Serenna Beers: Versus map, map maladaptive

259
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:21.480
Kennerh Blaine: Oh,

260
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:23.640

265
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.750
Kennerh Blaine: That stands out to you.

Serenna Beers: Okay.

272
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.840

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:36.870
Serenna Beers: Okay.

286
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.810

296
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:42.540
Kennerh Blaine: We just celebrated three years. That's why I was gone last week.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:55.410
Serenna Beers: How

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.210
Serenna Beers: How was that trip was

302
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.760
Kennerh Blaine: Oh, it was absolutely wonderful.

303
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:03.300
Serenna Beers: Was it

304
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.470
Serenna Beers: That's so great.

305
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:13.230
Kennerh Blaine: Um, it rains. Some days, but we just laid in bed and

306
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:20.910
Kennerh Blaine: Listen to the rain and then when we're able to, we went out fishing and caught fish.

307
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:23.370
Kennerh Blaine: So it was

308
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.830
Kennerh Blaine: It was extremely nice

309
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:26.940
Serenna Beers: That's right.

310
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.490
Serenna Beers: Okay, give me one more happy memory.

311
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.020
Kennerh Blaine: Probably buying my house in Orland

312
00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.610
Serenna Beers: And how long ago was that again.

313
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.230
Kennerh Blaine: 13 years ago.

314
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:10.830
Kennerh Blaine: We were always

315
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:20.580
Serenna Beers: Was, was it specifically around buying your house because it was something that

316
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.100
Serenna Beers: Made you feel accomplished was

317
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.950
Serenna Beers: What what what created

318
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.200
Serenna Beers: That that happiness.

319
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:28.950
Around that

320
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:40.620
Kennerh Blaine: Um, my mom and the plan and already been when my mom was unable to care for herself that she would come live with me.

321
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:41.850
Serenna Beers: Okay.

322
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.590
Kennerh Blaine: And so I found a five bedroom house on an acre property.

323
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.160
Kennerh Blaine: And so she lived with me for

324
00:36:54.870 --> 00:37:06.600
Kennerh Blaine: Two and a half years until and just medical got to where I was unable to care for her. The way she needed to be care for. Okay.

325
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:08.970
Kennerh Blaine: Last

326
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.200
Serenna Beers: Okay, so really quick because

327
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:21.810
Serenna Beers: I I failed to mention a very important component

328
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:43.380
Serenna Beers: Is establishing a calm place. So one of the things that we close with so i i i pulled from these happy memories in the event that you become so activated and that you become stuck. I use it as a way to interweave it with with with the work that we do.

329
00:37:44.040 --> 00:38:00.420
Serenna Beers: But then I also need for you to to establish a calm place but within this calm place there cannot be what we call an EMT our world any pop pollution, so like if you have

330
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:17.580
Serenna Beers: Your calm your comp places for eggs example on a river, listening to the crickets at night, whatever. But within that calm place if that memory or that image remote brings up a negative

331
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:34.980
Serenna Beers: A negative emotion or any type of Nate negativity, if that is attached with any polluted memories, then that won't work for a calm place because you're that that's something that your that your brain will attach itself to. Does that make sense.

332
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.680
Kennerh Blaine: It does.

333
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.430
Serenna Beers: Okay perfect, so tell me what your comp places.

334
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.400
Serenna Beers: That we're going to be able to

335
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:44.760
View.

336
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.590
Kennerh Blaine: Going down the

337
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.780
Kennerh Blaine: Middle Fork.

338
00:38:53.190 --> 00:39:06.540
Kennerh Blaine: With my dad. It was a professional raft trip Him done 18 years in a row. And so he and I finally got to do one and it was

339
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.650
Kennerh Blaine: It was gorgeous. It was fun.

340
00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.560
Kennerh Blaine: And he had a good time.

341
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.010
Serenna Beers: That's cool.

342
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:19.650
Serenna Beers: That's really cool.

343
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.870
Serenna Beers: Okay.

344
00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:42.690
Serenna Beers: All right, so, um, one of the things that I like to do with folks is before we start the intense work. And the reason that I say that with with you, especially, I mean I don't always have to do this step.

345
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:58.800
Serenna Beers: But when I see a lot of high ratings like I see with you. I mean, there's you know you you have one five. You have to 10s and two nines. So it's important that we build what's called your ego strength. So I like to do

346
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:13.500
Serenna Beers: didactic re resourcing and so that's just where you're you're following the one we're stimulating left brain, right brain, but it's all about positive. So we're installing positive. So we're building your

347
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:22.470
Serenna Beers: Your eat your ego strength to prepare you for the work that we're going to do, where you're bringing up all that yucky stuff, you know,

348
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.140
Serenna Beers: And so with our with our first session.

349
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:41.460
Serenna Beers: That's what that's going to be about. So we're going to do the wand. But we're also going to install positive cog mission. So you're, you're going to fall. Follow the wand and

350
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:55.470
Serenna Beers: Whether you describe a favorite movie star that you really look up to. I mean, some anomaly say say that because it's just an example and mine was Sandra Bullock.

351
00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:05.160
Serenna Beers: You know, I talked about during my dot dot diabetic re sourcing because I there. There were so many things that I admired about her and

352
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:15.660
Serenna Beers: You know when when we see things in others that we really like it's really just a mirror of ourselves. And the same thing with negative stuff like if I think to myself,

353
00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:29.610
Serenna Beers: What would it be, gosh, why is she so rude or, you know, I have it when I had issues with someone, it's usually something that I spot you know that that expression you spot it. You got it. It's the same

354
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.530
Serenna Beers: For positive and negative

355
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:44.130
Serenna Beers: So we're going to take any positivity, whether it's from an author of a book or maybe a family member that you've looked up to, or maybe just something you just want to find within yourself.

356
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:57.030
Serenna Beers: And we just do the work around that. And so we start your brain with positive diabetic resourcing and then we move right into one of the trauma memories.

357
00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.180
Serenna Beers: So did this all makes sense to you because I've talked a lot

358
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:06.480
Kennerh Blaine: It.

359
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.440
Kennerh Blaine: Really has

360
00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.200
Kennerh Blaine: Okay. Um, so

361
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.030
Serenna Beers: You're frozen.

362
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.800
Serenna Beers: Okay.

363
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:24.720
Kennerh Blaine: I'm frozen.

364
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.190
Kennerh Blaine: Oh, no.

365
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.660
Serenna Beers: We are not

366
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.990
Serenna Beers: So this really makes sense to you.

367
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.300
Serenna Beers: It does. It really does. Okay, great. And so

368
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.050
It's

369
00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:44.520
Kennerh Blaine: Good to have it out and good and

370
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.000
That's

371
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:49.020
Serenna Beers: You know what, that's a great way to explain it.

372
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:52.980
Serenna Beers: So,

373
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.510
Serenna Beers: Um, let me take a look

374
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.830
Serenna Beers: At my calendar.

375
00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.490
Kennerh Blaine: Okay.

376
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:01.800
Kennerh Blaine: Um,

377
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.820
Kennerh Blaine: And then I have to be willing to do the work.

378
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:06.750
Right.

379
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.650
Kennerh Blaine: Which I am

380
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:12.690
Serenna Beers: So great.

381
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.950
Serenna Beers: Okay, where is there it is.

382
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:34.110
Serenna Beers: Do you like the early mornings better than the later afternoons.

383
00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:36.810
Kennerh Blaine: I do

384
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.410
Serenna Beers: Okay, so let's go with

385
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:56.010
Serenna Beers: Okay, right now on my schedule. I had to have it at the same time ATM. If you want to do that for Thursday for next Thursday.

386
00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:11.250
Serenna Beers: Absolutely. Okay, so I'm going to mark that down on my calendar. I'm also going to shoot a message to the to the virtual clinic and there they are really, really good about when I asked them to put

387
00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:30.210
Serenna Beers: Something down on my schedule, they usually get it done within within like then within an hour. So that's cool. So I'll let them know to mark you down for the, the 16th for next Thursday. And then we will get going.

388
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.160
Serenna Beers: Okay.

389
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:36.990
Serenna Beers: Sounds like a plan.

390
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:41.370
Kennerh Blaine: It does.

391
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:51.510
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, yeah. Every time I call them Monday when we get off the lake and I got real good cell service. You know, like I call them and

392
00:44:52.860 --> 00:45:00.420
Kennerh Blaine: They just told me that I missed my my doctor me and I told him that that was pre planned.

393
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.550
Kennerh Blaine: And I'd let them know a couple weeks in advance that that was going to happen.

394
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:12.630
Kennerh Blaine: Uh huh. Um, and I just want that clear that I didn't just flake. The

395
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.900
Kennerh Blaine: Group off, it was

396
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.540
Kennerh Blaine: Well, and an advanced

397
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.270
Serenna Beers: Okay, well, what I'll do is

398
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.450
Serenna Beers: Would you like me to shoot a message to your therapist.

399
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.860
Kennerh Blaine: You are my therapist.

400
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:36.450
Serenna Beers: Oh, well, I'm your em. Oh, you know, what am I, you're standing one. So, this wasn't a referral. Oh my goodness.

401
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:38.700
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

402
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.760
Serenna Beers: Oh, goodness. I apologize if I'm a

403
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.500
Kennerh Blaine: Me see. Well, I thought that wonderful watch

404
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:54.900
Serenna Beers: Let me double check because you very well might be. But I sometimes do groups with other physicians who have

405
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.350
Serenna Beers: Patients who have another

406
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:17.640
Serenna Beers: Therapist and I sometimes work with other therapists patients 4444 4am Dr. So I just wanted just to double check to make sure that I was actually assigned to you, which would even be better. That would be cool.

407
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:23.430
Serenna Beers: Yep, I sure him. Nice.

408
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:24.720
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

409
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.580
Serenna Beers: Alright.

410
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.540
Serenna Beers: So for some reason I thought that this was

411
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:46.140
Serenna Beers: A reefer for referrals. So I want to make sure that the EMT the FDR was something that you wanted to work on with me. Right. I mean, that's kind of where our goals were way when I meet with you is to work with you around that. Right.

412
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.370
Serenna Beers: Yes. Okay.

413
00:46:47.850 --> 00:47:00.120
Serenna Beers: Because I just, okay, because, because I do some in individual sessions that have nothing to do with em, Dr. But I believe I remember you specifically during our group, saying, I want to do this right

414
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:03.030
Kennerh Blaine: Yes.

415
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.140
Serenna Beers: Okay, great.

416
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:21.210
Serenna Beers: Yeah, we're on the same page so I don't need to let your therapist know because I know now, and I do remember you saying that. And so, but Dr. L. Dr. Ella DAG did too, because I think that we had talked about you trying to do your best.

417
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:21.960
Serenna Beers: To get

418
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.190
Serenna Beers: But then if you

419
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:29.370
Serenna Beers: Okay. Yeah. So I think, I think, I think you are all good there.

420
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.580
Serenna Beers: So do you have any questions for me and

421
00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.260
Kennerh Blaine: Okay, I just want to make sure

422
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:41.370
Kennerh Blaine: You know, I don't think so. I'm not looking forward to working with you and

423
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.690
Kennerh Blaine: Didn't some of this stuff figured out in my head.

424
00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.040
Serenna Beers: That's great.

425
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.600
Serenna Beers: And I am

426
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.340
Kennerh Blaine: Too as well more

427
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.780
Serenna Beers: Well, uh, you know, it's

428
00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.160
Serenna Beers: Like I shared

429
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:07.830
Serenna Beers: We're working through some of my trauma, you know, and there was obviously while there was a lot more. It started with that. But over the years and also being

430
00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:12.660
Serenna Beers: In addiction, the addiction lifestyle comes with its own set of trauma. Right.

431
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.730
Serenna Beers: And but working

432
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.380
Serenna Beers: Through that stuff.

433
00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:33.510
Serenna Beers: Really really honestly was a game changer. It literally changed everything about me and life is so much better with that stuff not, you know, with not having the chronic headaches and the chronic stomach aches. It was just

434
00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:43.140
Serenna Beers: It really did save my life. So I hope for you that you have, you know, the same sort of experience and we can help help you heal.

435
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.580

440
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:10.770
Kennerh Blaine: I told her I wanted to be Kenny two point O, which meant

441
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:19.890
Kennerh Blaine: I want to work on this. I want to get past it and still be able to use my tools.

442
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:22.470
Kennerh Blaine: To heal.

443

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:42.390
Serenna Beers: Well, I think that that is a common goal. So I think that we can help you achieve achieve that you do the work and I just don't see how you couldn't get to that Kenny 2.0 and I'm gonna write that down. Because that is pretty clever.
