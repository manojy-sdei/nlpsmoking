Chris Alliman MD: Right.

43
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.120

Chris Alliman MD: Okay. All right.

86
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.500
Chris Alliman MD: What's that

87
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.690
Heather Pepin: I wish I could have went to rehab instead of prison.

88
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:36.510
Chris Alliman MD: Would have been nice as you're in prison. What did you find helpful to try as you came off the short acting opiates.

89
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:45.630
Heather Pepin: Um, well, honestly, it was hard. It wasn't really. I mean, because they don't really care about you in there. So I just kind of had to just go through withdrawals.

90
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.810
Chris Alliman MD: And how long did it take you to go through withdrawals.

91

Heather Pepin: A couple weeks.

92
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.930
Heather Pepin: Yeah, that's the hardest.

93
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.540
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, it can be tough. Why are you wanting to get on Suboxone at this point.

94
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.360
Heather Pepin: Oh, because I feel like I want to use a lot

95
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.800
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

96
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.350
Heather Pepin: And I'm on parole and probation, so

97
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.420
Heather Pepin: I don't want to go back. Yes, sir.

98
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.270

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.900
Chris Alliman MD: Do you have a primary care doctor to help out with your other issues, following the cervical cancer.

100
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.540
Heather Pepin: Um, I go to ob gyn my doctor that delivered my kids. But other than that, I don't go to a primary care physician.

101
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.810

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.460
Good.

104
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.410
Chris Alliman MD: Are you in counseling or in groups.

105
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.130
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

106
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.620
Chris Alliman MD: Which one both

107
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.910
Both

108
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.680
Chris Alliman MD: Right.

109
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.670
Chris Alliman MD: And you mentioned that you had a tubal ligation.

110
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.850
Chris Alliman MD: Yes, sir. What's your marital status.

111
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.470
Chris Alliman MD: Single. Okay. And who are you living with at this point.

112
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.240
Heather Pepin: My brother and his wife.

113
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.910
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and they know what's going on for you.

114
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.750
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

115
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.840
Chris Alliman MD: Good. And they're supportive. It sounds like

116
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.710
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

117
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.660
Any children.

118
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.990
Chris Alliman MD: In that for yourself. You've got three

119
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.590
Chris Alliman MD: Yes, and any kids at that house.

120
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.030
Heather Pepin: Yes, my brother has to

121
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.590
Chris Alliman MD: Hold, are they

122
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.330
Heather Pepin: Um 12 and eight.

123
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.890
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

124
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:44.160
Chris Alliman MD: The reason I ask is because Suboxone the residue that gets on the hands the residue that's around the mouth or in the mouth. The residue from the packet is enough for kids to overdose. It can cause them to stop breathing.

125
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:56.040
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so when you use the box. So, and you need to make sure you wash your hands. Well, rinse out your mouth in the packet needs to be thrown away outside, not in the house.

126
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.790
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

127
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.110
Chris Alliman MD: You also need to make sure that the kids aren't getting into the Suboxone itself.

128
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.030
Heather Pepin: Yes, if I keep my other medication put up and they not to touch it, so

129
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.480
Chris Alliman MD: Often we recommend like a lockbox or something to just

130
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:10.740
Heather Pepin: Do that.

131
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.020
Chris Alliman MD: That would be really good. Yeah.

132
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:25.470
Chris Alliman MD: That's good. And for that reason, we also send it. I'm going to get you a prescription of Suboxone today, but we also send in a prescription for Narcan the nasal spray for overdose.

133
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.510
Heather Pepin: I've heard of it, but I've never really

134
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:41.550
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so it's actually required by law that we send it in, but it's a good idea. Anyway, so that'll be part of the prescription that we send in plus it'll have a bunch of refills on it. So if you use it, you just go get another one.

135
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:50.400
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Now, it's important that you make sure that other people in the house, your brother and his wife that they know where the Narc can is also

136
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.270
Heather Pepin: Yes, they're

137
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.250
Chris Alliman MD: Just so they can get to it if need be.

138
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.850
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

139
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.110
Chris Alliman MD: Good, good, good, how are you spending the time currently

140
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.240
Heather Pepin: I'm I'm working

141
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.010
Heather Pepin: So,

142
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.390
Heather Pepin: Most of the day. I'm at work and then I'm at home with my brother and his family.

143
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.620
Chris Alliman MD: Good.

144
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.530
Heather Pepin: I get to see my kids certain days.

145
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.770
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, they're not at your house. They're elsewhere. It sounds like

146
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.580
Heather Pepin: Oh, there was my mom.

147
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.050
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, good.

148
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:26.700
Chris Alliman MD: Right. And this is kind of a sensitive question, but was there any chat history of childhood abuse for you.

149
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:34.740
Chris Alliman MD: Know, sir. Okay. We know that, especially for women that can lead towards addiction issues. So we like to just at least ask that question.

150
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.580
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

151
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:42.150
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Alright, so I'm going to ask you some more questions here. I've got a bunch yet to go

152
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:42.840
But

153
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:51.210
Chris Alliman MD: I want you to think back to the time when you were taking the pills, as we go through these like nine nine questions or so. Okay.

154
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:51.810
Heather Pepin: Okay.

155
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.770
All right.

156
00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:02.340

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:43.950

266
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.050
Your heart rate.

267
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.220
Heather Pepin: My brother said I was dead.

268
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.100

270
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.770
Chris Alliman MD: And stop right

271
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:47.940
Heather Pepin: She said nine

272
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.730
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent. Thank you very much. So we take that times

273
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.590
Chris Alliman MD: 10 and that gives us a positive 90

274
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.280
Chris Alliman MD: Right.

275
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.960
Chris Alliman MD: And then the final part of the physical exam is just having you push on your stomach.

276
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.550
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, need to know if there's any pain as you push on your stomach.

277
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:11.940
Heather Pepin: No.

278
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.060
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, great. And that's what we got.

279
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.660
Chris Alliman MD: Alright. So Heather, how much do you know about our

280
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.130
Chris Alliman MD: Group are

281
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:24.870
Chris Alliman MD: And what we do.

282
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:35.700
Heather Pepin: I'm not much a friend gave it to me. We were both locked up together so she was like, maybe this will help you so she really I don't want to talk to her a lot so she just sent me the information

283
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:41.820
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so basically what we do is we have their two appointments, a week.

284
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:52.350
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, a group appointment, where it would be me you a therapist and several other clients patients also and we do a group visit over zoom

285
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:53.310
Okay.

286
00:18:54.420 --> 00:19:04.650
Chris Alliman MD: While that's going on for the first half. We do a medical check in, where I see how people are doing on their medications, the second half the therapist does kind of a group processing thing.

287
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.030
Chris Alliman MD: And that's when I send in prescriptions for people

288
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.890
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so one has to come to group to get the prescription

289
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:14.640
Heather Pepin: Yeah, so

290
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:24.690
Chris Alliman MD: The second appointment. A week is an individual therapy appointment so it would be one on one with the therapist just you and her working through stuff.

291
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.710
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, that's also required not optional.

292
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:42.810
Chris Alliman MD: And at least for the first month, what happens is the prescription from group is enough days to get you to the therapy appointment and then I hear that you saw the therapist, and then I send in a second prescription to get you back to group.

293
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:43.710
Okay.

294
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:52.560
Chris Alliman MD: The reason we do that is previously we just did one week prescriptions, but people didn't tend to show up for their therapy appointments

295
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:53.670
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, you know,

296
00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:01.890
Chris Alliman MD: The medication while important is only part of the equation. It's also dealing with the mental aspect and working through that behavioral health

297
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:11.910
Chris Alliman MD: Our goal is to get people off this stuff. We don't want to on it for long term, but to be able to do that folks have to learn the skills of how to how to manage

298
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:12.960
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

299
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:24.510
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, now in your situation you're seeing a psychiatrist and you said you're going to groups and go into individual therapy. So what I, what we need to do is have you have a

300
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.180
Chris Alliman MD: initial appointment with one of our therapists to do kind of our behavioral health intake.

301
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:40.500
Chris Alliman MD: And then they talk what's going on and see what's most appropriate for you at that point we tend not want to double do the services because that tends to get confusing and messy.

302
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.280
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, but we can work that out as we go along.

303
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:55.830
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, everything happens through zoom right. So the way you get into therapy and the way you get into group meetings is like you did today, you call into the virtual clinic.

304
00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:08.430
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and just like it calling the virtual clinic is like calling the doctor's office and it's like going in the front door at the doctor's office. There's always align and there's always paperwork to do

305
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.980
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so

306
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:18.510
Chris Alliman MD: What we encourage is that you call in at least 30 minutes before the appointment.

307
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:29.670
Chris Alliman MD: That way you can get through all the paperwork and wait in line, if necessary, and we're discovering it's taking that 30 minutes we're getting really busy with everybody being closed up at home.

308
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.690
Chris Alliman MD: Yes. So, so plan on that. Okay.

309
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:48.270
Chris Alliman MD: So as we work out your Suboxone and the group and the therapy and all that stuff. There's information that will send to you. I have your email address as Pepin Heather 450 at GMAIL. COM

310
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.050
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

311
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.610
Chris Alliman MD: Excellent. So as we finish off here. I'll make sure to get that sent in to you.

312
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.510
Okay.

313
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.640
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so

314
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:05.850
Chris Alliman MD: It sounds like you're dealing with these cravings, but you're not just recently, not having to go through the withdrawals. You did that already.

315
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:11.340
Chris Alliman MD: Yes. So what I'd like to do is send in the Suboxone one film a day for you.

316
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.420
Heather Pepin: Okay.

317
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:18.630
Chris Alliman MD: All right, and then we can talk it group and kind of see how things are going and if we need to adjust that.

318
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:26.880
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, part of the thing to keep in mind is, if we go to a higher dose. It's just going to take you that much longer to come off of it eventually

319
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:37.860
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, right. But that shouldn't be the deciding factor. We want to keep you safe. We want to keep you, you know, able to manage the cravings and not go back to using again.

320
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:47.070
Chris Alliman MD: Yes, sir. That's the priority, that's what's important. Yeah. So let's start off. We'll start off with the eight milligram films one film a day.

321
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.210
Okay.

322
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.430
Chris Alliman MD: Do you know. Have you ever taken. Have you ever taken Suboxone

323
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.910
Heather Pepin: Um, I did a few times and I was locked up.

324
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:10.200
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, fair enough. So you just kind of so you close yourself in the bathroom wash out your mouth. Put the film under the tone or in the side of the cheek and you sit there for five minutes and you don't swallow.

325
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.510
Heather Pepin: Are you. Hello. Oh, she found a little thing that takes it.

326
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:26.130
Chris Alliman MD: So every three months, we take vitals. So you'll need that again later on. Okay, that'll be good.

327
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.760
Okay.

328
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.020
Heather Pepin: Okay.

329
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:29.190
All right.

330
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.960
Heather Pepin: Thank you.

331
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:42.420
Chris Alliman MD: So you close yourself in the bathroom wash out your mouth. Put the film in and then you keep it there for five minutes and you don't swallow for five minutes.

332
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.140
Heather Pepin: Okay.

333
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:51.870
Chris Alliman MD: The medication has to absorb through the cheek or through the gums. If you swallow it, and it goes to the stomach acid then it just gets inactivated.

334
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.070
Heather Pepin: Okay.

335
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:59.250
Chris Alliman MD: All right, now you can't go for five minutes without swallowing, you're gonna swallow, that's fine.

336
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.880
Chris Alliman MD: Right. But, but you get the idea with that.

337
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:03.840
Heather Pepin: Yes, sir.

338
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:10.740
Chris Alliman MD: Afterwards, rinse out your mouth, brush your teeth, whatever you need to do, take care of the trash. Wash your hands, all that stuff we talked about

339
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:16.770
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. But all right, and then I'll get the Narcan sent in for you also.

340
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:17.700
Okay.

341
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.990
Chris Alliman MD: What is your work schedule when

342
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.680
Heather Pepin: I'm it varies

343
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:36.660
Heather Pepin: Um, so like Mondays. I work all day and then like Tuesday and Wednesday Wednesdays I work from five in the morning to 11am and then

344
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.980
Heather Pepin: Thursdays and Fridays. I work day

345
00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:42.630
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

346
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.210
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so you're

347
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:45.600
All

348
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.710
Heather Pepin: Set and stuff like, Is there certain time, that those happen.

349
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:59.880
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, yeah. And I'm just trying to work through those in my mind here initially. Um, we have a group on on Wednesday evenings at 730

350
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.530
Heather Pepin: Okay. Yeah, that'd be perfect.

351
00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.180
Heather Pepin: Good. Yes.

352
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:04.350
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

353
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.750
Heather Pepin: So that's going to be tomorrow.

354
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:17.790
Chris Alliman MD: Tomorrow, once you're there tomorrow, so check in half an hour ahead of time, at least half an hour ahead of time. If you check in five minutes beforehand, you're not going to get in. It's just

355
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.170
Heather Pepin: Okay.

356
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:26.340
Chris Alliman MD: One thing that we are starting to tell people is, you could even check in the night before, if you wanted to.

357
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.950
Heather Pepin: Oh, OK.

358
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:34.710
Chris Alliman MD: So that's always an option. And then you get all the paperwork done and then you call in

359
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:42.390
Chris Alliman MD: You still have to check in before the meeting on the day but you wouldn't have all the paperwork to have to work through

360
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.330
Chris Alliman MD: Okay work things out that way. So,

361
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.480
Heather Pepin: We close because I know we're on different times. Right.

362
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.150
Chris Alliman MD: So I'm actually in in Albuquerque.

363
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.350
Heather Pepin: Oh, okay.

364
00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.680

Chris Alliman MD: Okay, fair enough. So the virtual clinic is open 24 hours a day.

368
00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:06.420
Okay.

369
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.080
Chris Alliman MD: So there's yeah you can get that at any time.

Chris Alliman MD: So in the email that I send you. It'll have the information about when your group time is and all this stuff that we're kind of talking about. So I'm going to send that to you.

371

Chris Alliman MD: When we talk, we will on Wednesday we'll talk about getting you connected to a therapist.

372
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:43.230
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Actually, you know what I'm going to send I don't with your schedule. I don't think it's going to work out too well the therapist for the Wednesday group is in Hawaii.

413
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:19.230

414
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:28.230
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, but you'll see how all of it kind of works out, you'll be there for the medical check in and I'll check other people in before I talk with you. So you'll kind of see how it goes.
