00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.280
Jodi Dumler: We're finally on track. It sounds like

2
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.440
Jodi Dumler: Did they tell you what day your meeting is with the doctor.

3
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.130
Jodi Dumler: Oh yeah, you're right. I did my calculations wrong first Pacific and central. Yep.

5
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.350
Jodi Dumler: Yep.

6
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.640
Jodi Dumler: 12 Pacific. So that would be to your right. Yes, I went the wrong way.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.530
Jason short: Okay.

8
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.620

12
00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.310
Jodi Dumler: And then, did they did anybody call you the other piece that I wanted them to make sure they had so we don't run into this, again, is

13
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:16.410
Jodi Dumler: That anybody call you with just making sure they have everything they need so they can, they should already. But what I want to set in place is back and forth communication with your doctor's office that you use for your drug test.

14
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.030
Jodi Dumler: So that we don't run into issues so that that doesn't become a thing again.

15
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.440
Jason short: Probably

16
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.310

Jodi Dumler: I want us to all be on the same page, and I want it to go smooth.

20
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.540
Jodi Dumler: I don't like it when we have hiccups and I want us all to be on track. So, um, let me see.

21
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.590
Jodi Dumler: I'm going to put it here where I'm going to put it

22
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.140
Jodi Dumler: Give me a second. I want to put it somewhere where I can find it again. Everybody can see it.

23
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.630
Okay.

24
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.230
Jodi Dumler: You got all that information on your doctor.

25
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.230

Jodi Dumler: Well as soon as we get off. All right. Before we get off and want you to give me that information, because I want to make sure I got it in the computer.

30
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.700
Jason short: Oh, so

31
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.200
Jodi Dumler: We just need

32
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.670
Jason short: To close off.

33
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.220
Jodi Dumler: Because I'm pretty sure you've signed releases. I'm sure you have. So I felt like we should be good on that end.

Jason short: Girl.

93
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.330
Jason short: Wait a few. Mm hmm.

94
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:43.680
Jodi Dumler: With not that you want to. But I'm just curious with you, having to drive monthly now to Walmart in the other town anyway. Is there a doctor there or, you know, or a hospital, clinic mix there that would be a better fit possibly

95
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.070
Jason short: Oh well, they're probably are.

96
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.200

97
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.550
Jason short: I love the doctor that I can go her

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.980
Jason short: I can't stand that man.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.050
Jason short: Run, he will go. She's pretty.

100
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.630
Jason short: Close to the rock. I always wonder if you will. Oh, say really helps to talk about

101
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.600
Jodi Dumler: Right.

102
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:31.140
Jodi Dumler: I mean, I want to, I want to work with who you have as a doctor. But I also want I want my patients to have a primary care doctor that they like

103
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.610
Jodi Dumler: Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

104
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.730
Get there.

105
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.240
Jodi Dumler: Okay.

106
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:04.590
Jodi Dumler: Okay 931-243-4607

107
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.340
Jason short: Okay.

108
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.440
Jason short: Perfect.

109
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:24.720
Jodi Dumler: Alright, well I'll keep that in there and I'll will try to work with that doctor's office, but if you change and you find another one. Or if you find one touch to a hospital at the other town, you're driving to anyway. Then let me know.

110
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.720
Jodi Dumler: Because if it's attached to a little or low

111
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.570
Jodi Dumler: Or if it has a lab then that'll might be faster to for you if you're doing tests or whatnot.

112
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.120
Jason short: Because I

113
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.580
Jodi Dumler: Have a lab attached to the clinic.

114
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:40.740
So,

115
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.800
Just maybe at least

116
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.430
Okay.

117
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.850
Jodi Dumler: So we're good. We got our plan. Let's look

118
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.250
Jodi Dumler: I mean other than the withdrawal.

119
00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:09.300
Jodi Dumler: Last time I talked to you. I mean, PTSD symptoms have been down. You said, seizures, have been down right so i mean physical health and mental health has been better. Or what would you say

120
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:13.380
Jason short: It's

121
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.740
Jason short: Coming.

122
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:18.510
Jason short: Back.

123
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:57.720
Jodi Dumler: One thing I'd really like you to do this month, while you're for sure going weekly and you're going to have the medicine consistently.

124
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:15.990
Jodi Dumler: I mean, I'm hoping you'll be able to keep it taking your dose every day, like we want, but I'd love to know as you go forth through this month how your pain does when you're actually you know where your pain level you sit out when you're taking the, the two a day. Right.

125
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.240
Jodi Dumler: Or. Mm hmm. Because I feel like you've been not on to a day consistently for so long.

126
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.490
Jodi Dumler: That

127
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.450
Jodi Dumler: I'd be interested to

128
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:35.550
Jodi Dumler: See where your pain and depression and stuff. How they sit now that you you know if you're consistent for a month how you're feeling, if that makes sense.

129
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.700
Jason short: Or where oh

130
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.320
Jason short: Yeah.

131
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:51.180
Jodi Dumler: So as of today, just give me a starter as of today of 10 was the worst pain zero, as you know. No pain at all. Where, where would you say you are today on pain scale.

132
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.190
Jason short: For

133
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.470
Jodi Dumler: Okay, yeah.

134
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.350
Jason short: Cocoa

135
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.070
Jason short: Or

136
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:09.600
Yeah.

137
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.580
Jodi Dumler: About depression.

138
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.070
Jodi Dumler: 1010 worst

139
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:38.250
Jodi Dumler: Have you had much anxiety. What you did during the withdrawal of course so that once you

140
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:38.760
Jason short: Got your

141
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:46.740
Jodi Dumler: Yesterday, and I guess we'll see. So as of today, where is anxiety sitting today and we'll just go from there.

142
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.480
Jodi Dumler: What would you put it out.

143
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.990
Jodi Dumler: Well, that's good. At least you're not waking up depressed or anxious. That's good news.

144
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.650
Jason short: I was

145
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.530
Jodi Dumler: Good.

146
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:21.510
Jodi Dumler: You weren't. You're just a little bit when when I'm not surprised, your pains out of four or five, even though you just woke up because you've been laying Tuesday haven't been moving

147
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.170
Jodi Dumler: So you probably get sore overnight.

148
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.730
So that makes sense. Okay.

149
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:41.580
Jodi Dumler: Those are the top ones that I know for you pain sometimes the depression and anxiety. Other than that, I mean, are those your big ones are there something else I

150
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.960
Jason short: Missing that's good that you

151
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.220
Jodi Dumler: Know that kind of keeps you down.

152
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.950
Jason short: Oh, that's

153
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.730
Jodi Dumler: Okay, that's all I thought it's just those three. Okay, just making sure

154
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.460
Jason short: All right.

155
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:05.070
Jodi Dumler: Otherwise daily life howson and Maria and family, how are things going

156
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:07.980
