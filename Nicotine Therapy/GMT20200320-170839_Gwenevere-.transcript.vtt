155
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What is a goal around the substance use that you have kind of phrase it in. I want. So I want this typically people say, I want more of this or I want less of something else. So if you could phrase your own goal, not mine. Because this is for you. What would your goal be here in this program.

163
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's not. I it you're in a treatment program. So I want to write down exactly what you want. I don't make any assumptions. There are plenty of people

164
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:58.020
Galaxy A10e: I will open. Yeah, I want to continue to stay aware and continue to

166
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:20.130
Galaxy A10e: Okay, good. We miss you guys that way. You know, I know what I need to like, you know, like whenever, whenever I told you that I should be stripping the hat, the other day, or whatever, like that.

168
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a, I have a concern is unethical to have two treatment providers, giving you the same service. So I'm going to need to talk to you about that we're going to do it when you have more time. Okay, so I'm going to give you a call for now I want to set an appointment.

169
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.580

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You will have come to another group and I'll be able to talk to you more about what I just said, which has to do with the conflict of interest, having multiple treatment providers, you're, you're receiving psychotherapy from someone else.
