00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Kelly. Kelly.

2
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're in your camper.

3
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.020
Yeah.

4
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Opening up a note. So I'm gonna have just a little quiet second here. You can talk, but I'm just let me know why my

5
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking all over the place.

6
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.200
Okay.

7
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Two.

8
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And we are. Do not for you. We're good. Alright, so you were talking about some pretty pretty important decisions that you were contemplating

9
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: How you doing around those those ideas.

10
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:54.210
Kelli Ottnat: I'm still kind of stuck with that and it's that's been bothering me a lot because I've just been there, you know,

11
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.160
Kelli Ottnat: And I've thought about it and thought about it.

12
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.510
Kelli Ottnat: The only thing that

13
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.270
Kelli Ottnat: I can't make any plans right now. I guess that's the problem.

14
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so you thought about and thought about making a plan and then you're saying I can't make any plans right now. So what's a way of you making plans.

15
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What's in the way of you making a decision.

16
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.660
Kelli Ottnat: Not knowing

17
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.070
Kelli Ottnat: Not, I mean,

18
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.870
Kelli Ottnat: Not really being financially able to do that for one

19
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.320
Kelli Ottnat: And not really knowing

20
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.170
Kelli Ottnat: What to expect.

21
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.930
Kelli Ottnat: From people like us. I really don't want to put this on anybody but

22
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Not knowing what to expect from him.

23
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Not knowing what to expect from home.

24
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.770
See if he can get that in

25
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.270
Kelli Ottnat: From

26
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.870
Kelli Ottnat: From Scott and

27
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.110
Kelli Ottnat: Jude grandparents. I mean, I can kind of expect

28
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.690
Kelli Ottnat: I just assume that they're going to stay the same.

29
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a safe bet.

30
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

31
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk a little bit about the financial part

32
00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't hear much about that from you around notions of preparation and remember before you left the state that conversation was coming up. I was asking you questions about how to prepare didn't stick around for it. You left it whatever was fine, your choice.

33
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is the first time I'm kind of hearing. I want to take a look at the financial stability for a second.

34
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Nevermind feelings. Nevermind expectation

35
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you want, what, how you deem stable might not be what you have now what stable might look like. What do you think about, like, What do you mean

36
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.280
Kelli Ottnat: Well, I'm I did make a lot of progress on getting my driver's license back

37
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.810
Kelli Ottnat: This week,

38
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me about

39
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.210
Kelli Ottnat: I paid. I got a stimulus check for this code 19

40
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.520
Kelli Ottnat: I paid off.

41
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.480
Kelli Ottnat: Tickets that were

42
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.540
Kelli Ottnat: I couldn't have been able to pay it off, unless I had a large lump sum sum of money. So I took care of that.

43
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.460
Kelli Ottnat: It'll cost me less than $90 to walk away with a driver's license. Now,

44
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.300
Uh huh.

45
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.400
Kelli Ottnat: And I have a job lined up with the census.

46
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.080
Kelli Ottnat: I just, I had to have a driver's license.

47
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.060
Kelli Ottnat: Or that

48
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:40.650
Kelli Ottnat: It pays pretty good money. I think it's like 17 or $18 an hour. I figured in the three months that I would be working for them.

49
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.660
Kelli Ottnat: I'd make enough money to

50
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.220
Kelli Ottnat: Buy a home, you know, rent a home somewhere.

51
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How many months again.

52
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.690
Kelli Ottnat: Three months.

53
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not got it. So it's a full time gig.

54
00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

55
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.250
Kelli Ottnat: as many hours as I as I won't work.

56
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: How many hours do you want to work.

57
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.130
Kelli Ottnat: As much as I can.

58
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me ask you just now I'm looking at goals. Do you want to set a goal of saving a certain amount of money.

59
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I don't know, three grand 10 grand five grand two grand, something like that. And then we can watch that and track that we can see if it starts to leak somewhere if they're spending can kind of watch that.

60
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.130
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah.

61
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.140
Kelli Ottnat: That's kind of my, on my plan for the census. I'm

62
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.490
Kelli Ottnat: I'm kind of, I don't know if I'll be able to get the job though.

63
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to

64
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.330
Kelli Ottnat: I have to show up in person and pay i don't i don't know i may it's

65
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, what

66
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.090
Kelli Ottnat: pay a fee down in Louisiana.

67
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.330
Kelli Ottnat: For my license.

68
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: To show them can t. So I did here. All I gotta do is pay $90 so when we keep talking. There's something else, holding me up something in Louisiana. What's the fee. What is that, is that a bail, something, something. What is that

69
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.830
Kelli Ottnat: That's a small feeling of I guess it's a click to get a clearance for the DMV.

70
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. How much is it

71
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.230
25

72
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have to show up in person. Well,

73
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.480
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, but I mean, maybe I could send somebody in more me

74
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Okay, so that's a call to find those facts out

75
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.100
Okay.

76
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you know there's $25

77
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.620
Kelli Ottnat: I was on the phone with them. Yes.

78
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you made the call. And then what's missing is maybe nobody mentioned and didn't ask

79
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If it can be hand delivered by a representative or a proxy and how to accomplish that proxy.

80
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's people you can kind of do that maybe a grandparent or somebody could be a proxy. So maybe another call to ask about it. Yeah, I would.

81
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.880
Kelli Ottnat: Say,

82
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.180
Kelli Ottnat: That's why I gave up yesterday on it.

83
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.290
Kelli Ottnat: The Office won't be open until May 15 to take a fee, that's what it was.

84
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe 15

85
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:39.840
Right.

86
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.130
Kelli Ottnat: So I guess that

87
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.020
Kelli Ottnat: Tells me that I need to

88
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.140
Kelli Ottnat: Forget about working for the census.

89
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Well now what

90
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it because I'm

91
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just saying you're 100% sure that there's no other options.

92
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.640
Kelli Ottnat: I'll call them again and see if I can push or something.

93
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: A temporary something just an ID something so that you know what's an alternative. How are there ever any communications that go interstate understanding, somehow, is there something I can do that. I could pay New Mexico's

94
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Department of Motor Vehicles, and they can sort of have that sort of in an escrow. I mean, you start throwing crap out, see what they say.

95
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and then you guys are closed and yeah this is a time of exception, you know, with what all is going on and I can actually be earning a living, I could have a job that contributes to our economy. I see a lot of sides.

96
00:09:52.620 --> 00:10:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this is a really odd time is your supervisor available. Maybe I could see if they've got some creative ideas and just keep seeing if you can find me. Yes.

97
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Not your style. I bet, but can do it.

98
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:17.640
Kelli Ottnat: So that's, that's my plan for my finances as of right now, if, if the census doesn't work out.

99
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:25.860
Kelli Ottnat: I think Texas is going back to business as usual. This week, maybe I heard so.

100
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.730
Kelli Ottnat: Mexico won't be

101
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.220
Kelli Ottnat: Too far behind.

102
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So back to I want to say give me a number.

103
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.680
Kelli Ottnat: Of

104
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.040
Kelli Ottnat: It would be nice to have.

105
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.110
Kelli Ottnat: Three, three or four grand

106
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you start looking for a place if you had three

107
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so why don't we start there and see where where it gets us. Okay.

108
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So it sounds like first part, you've already got moving and grooving here, you're out looking for a job you found one. That's a great income and what's holding you up. Is this ID and what's holding that up is this clearance fee.

109
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like to be on the phone with someone and keep going until

110
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You truly could not get the yes out of that person.

111
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.740
Kelli Ottnat: And I guess I would have really

112
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.700
Kelli Ottnat: When I started making the calls it wasn't, you know,

113
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:56.880
Kelli Ottnat: I need my driver's license, but for some reason, I wasn't really thinking about this job and pushing forward even though in the back of my mind. I knew that I know that once I get my license, you know, and if there's a rush for for that. But for some reason, it just wasn't really

114
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.850
Kelli Ottnat: Organized history.

115
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:00.780
Okay.

116
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't dots weren't connecting somehow they weren't associated the importance the urgency of it, maybe you weren't feeling that when you were on the phone.

117
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And now that you have it maybe

118
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: A little more assertive, a little more. Another question. Another question. Maybe there's someone who has an idea, what do people do with the office closed. Where do you direct people

119
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, you know, business and things still have to keep moving forward.

120
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And also what about New Mexico's Department of Motor Vehicles. Maybe they have exceptions that can be made to so maybe it's two calls trying to find out the yes from one side or the other. Somebody to make an exception might be convenient right now. Right.

121
00:12:51.420 --> 00:13:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it's the employer that also might make an exception, could you take a picture of, I don't know, because the census sounds like it's a government job.

122
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they may not be as flexible.

123
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they're going to want to send into right w w to book 1099 or whatever to to chart in your

124
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Your taxes.

125
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I

126
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.850
Kelli Ottnat: Have an ID. I just need

127
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.630
Kelli Ottnat: A driver's license. Before I go down.

128
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.350
Kelli Ottnat: In the paperwork.

129
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

130
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll just start with client will obtain a driver's license.

131
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Once it I am diving lessons because far as I can tell, doesn't look like you're having any challenges picking a job going after the job getting it. It just sounds like it's this license is getting in the way. Right here.

132
00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.610
Okay.

133
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So we just right as

134
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.430
Okay.

135
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So the other piece of this had to do with

136
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Scott

137
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You focused quite a bit more on that dynamic on the last time we met.

138
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.270
Kelli Ottnat: I really feel like it's time for me to

139
00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.320
Kelli Ottnat: To probably go

140
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.250
Kelli Ottnat: But I don't know how to do that on

141
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.710
Kelli Ottnat: I left to go yesterday.

142
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.320
Kelli Ottnat: Like literally, I was gonna go

143
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:51.840
Kelli Ottnat: Sleep.

144
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.070
Kelli Ottnat: Down behind a Walmart or something.

145
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.160
Kelli Ottnat: Until I could find.

146
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So Kelly sorry and unmute yourself someone texted yet. So Kelly why the urgency why

147
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Why does it have to be urgent yesterday what was going on that it seemed urgent that you go

148
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.320
Kelli Ottnat: God

149
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.150
Kelli Ottnat: And doing his thing.

150
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:38.580
Kelli Ottnat: It's time for me to go and we got into an argument argument yesterday, Aaron.

151
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.520
Kelli Ottnat: Mind.

152
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.340
Kelli Ottnat: I mean I can, I can handle.

153
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.840
Kelli Ottnat: A lot of things, but

154
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.000
Kelli Ottnat: Is when he gets upset.

155
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.040
Kelli Ottnat: Like he jumps to talk and

156
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.080
Kelli Ottnat: Hateful

157
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.340
Okay.

158
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.380
Kelli Ottnat: So she's ready

159
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to be around that that hateful talk and

160
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got you.

161
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he doing math.

162
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you recognize it. Don't you

163
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's not him anymore. It's now it's drug. So it's

164
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to be as sensitive about your feelings. Not gonna care because right now. It's the addict. That's it. You're living with and so that urgency, I gotta go.

165
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So Scott. Scott might not be present, the person

166
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.320
Kelli Ottnat: Fear. I told him that like

167
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.390
Kelli Ottnat: I'm listening to you.

168
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

169
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I imagine that it's hard to say.

170
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: These things right.

171
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: To talk about someone you care about that's going through this

172
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And to make a decision based on his most recent behavior. I imagine you don't want to be made a decision based on right your substance use. You don't want to be treated like that. And so maybe you're hoping, hoping please let it stop. But the truth of the matter is right in front of you.

173
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: He's using again.

174
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And Scott the authentic self. The one that loves you.

175
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't around

176
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The addict doesn't care. It will lie. It will steal it will emotionally abused it will sometimes physically abuse assault exploit because all it cares about, especially with that with the math piece. It's just

177
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: This rush of domain that's like this, this much when

178
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A sunset is like that.

179
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't compete with that.

180
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't mean the amount that it facilitates in the brain is in the brain. All it cares about is getting this feeling again.

181
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not thinking, how am I hurting the people I love who might. It's not doesn't have a the the addict has no morals whatsoever.

182
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: only cares about. I cannot have the crushing depression that follows when I don't have the mass. I can't feel that depressed and I gotta just chase this feeling this one.

183
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this little thing this little was a nice conversation or maybe I had a piece of chocolate. It's not going to cut it all, it cares about is that it get this this this high

184
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So Scott isn't making decisions the addict is

185
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're in a small space. That's scary.

186
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So I get it now because I was wondering why is the back a Walmart has what's the urgency. Now I see it, now I get it.

187
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's, those are words like, you know, do you want me to pull up my list of places you could call to spy and set up some support. Do you want me to pull up my get this little list. I'm starting to build i don't i probably already have the numbers, but I can bring them up.

188
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.870
Kelli Ottnat: I can try.

189
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.800
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, I'll take down any information because things

190
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Let me see. I might already have it open, unless somebody asked for it recently.

191
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: As call and called it

192
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Mexico resources. It's not a lot, a lot, but I did call a few of them think about two or three weeks ago, everybody. I talked to was. Oh, nice.

193
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, you're so sweet and so helpful and then it led to this other conversation and this other conversation. So let me just pull this up, New Mexico.

194
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is. OK. So I'm going to share my screen with you when you can either screenshot. You can write stuff down whatever works for you.

195
00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

196
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is who I talked to, I spoke with someone from this this place beret Foundation, which it

197
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: JUST SPOKE WITH A WOMAN here.

198
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a, like a shelter, a woman shelter.

199
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And then safe house I spoke with them about the protocol you have you call them and they interview you over the phone takes like 20 minutes. They want to know that you're meeting their criteria, kind of thing that one might be requiring a domestic violence presence.

200
00:22:44.550 --> 00:23:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Either you're kind of minimizing that existence. I don't know that right now. It might be emotional, violence, but I don't know if it's reaching the domestic violence, but if it is. You wouldn't want to hold back if you wanted in the door, you would want to make sure you included that okay

201
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Then there's, I don't know what these are. But this one I've heard from several clients, um, it's Esperanza shelter. I put a smiley face because

202
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Two people have said that they were treated just so well, they're

203
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So like, oh, that's cool. And I don't know anything about morning star.

204
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this is a in Sunnyvale County is haven house and Valencia shelter is in Berlin.

205
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this is so these up here because originally it was me looking for food.

206
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, this one here is in Las Cruces, this one's in Albuquerque.

207
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

208
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You want me to look anything else up

209
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.260
Kelli Ottnat: Huh. No.

210
00:23:50.040 --> 00:24:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really. Okay, so maybe that would get the conversation going. Maybe if you made a call. You could get a sense of what they're looking for. What would that be like. And just in case. Sorry, I got something floating around in here.

211
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, I'm seeing things.

212
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But that might be a better alternative to

213
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Back of Walmart kind of thing.

214
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to get off your chest. How sad it makes you to see someone you love, go through this

215
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.270
Kelli Ottnat: I'm really just kind of letting him do his thing and and believing that

216
00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:01.950
Kelli Ottnat: He'll get it together that I'm you know I'm a firm believer in the Holy Spirit working on people and

217
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.020
Kelli Ottnat: Getting high is not always, you know, you get that rush of

218
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:17.280
Kelli Ottnat: Goodness good time, but it's not that it's not always that great you know there's that much bad that comes with a lot of time.

219
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.340
Kelli Ottnat: So I am believing that

220
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.830
Kelli Ottnat: He'll get it together, but

221
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.490
Kelli Ottnat: In the meantime,

222
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.840
Kelli Ottnat: I know

223
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:37.560
Kelli Ottnat: I don't want to be talked to, like a like a dog, you know, do what you want. Stay on

224
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.500
Kelli Ottnat: Whatever. But don't you know come into my happy world that I've created and

225
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.620
Kelli Ottnat: Of itself, it's time for me to go. I've got friends in Louisiana.

226
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.710
Kelli Ottnat: That are ready for me to get down there.

227
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.380
Kelli Ottnat: That distance between Scott and I has been

228
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.130
Kelli Ottnat: There for a long time. So,

229
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:15.510
Yeah.

230
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: check in with yourself and see see

231
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What the hesitation was about telling me about it. See if you can find what the answer to that question might be,

232
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.210
Kelli Ottnat: I really believe that you will

233
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.660
Kelli Ottnat: He will, you know,

234
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.880
Kelli Ottnat: Get back to where he needs to be.

235
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.760
Kelli Ottnat: With with not using

236
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:04.590
Kelli Ottnat: And

237
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.360
Kelli Ottnat: I don't know why I will tell you, really, I just

238
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.490
Kelli Ottnat: I feel like he'll

239
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.450
Kelli Ottnat: Get it together, come back, we're going to be

240
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about the importance of changing the people were around the places that we're staying the things we're doing around recovery.

241
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty important to my client that you be in an environment that supports your recovery plan.

242
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that maybe you didn't want to tell me for a specific reason that something about me knowing about that.

243
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

244
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.550
Kelli Ottnat: I'm pretty strong in my recovery.

245
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:02.970
Kelli Ottnat: He came home, the other night and handed me some stuff and asked me to flush that he was done.

246
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.650
Kelli Ottnat: And I flushed it. I think he was probably kind of surprised.

247
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't that's your thing. I can't remember if that was ever your thing.

248
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You did for

249
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.000
Kelli Ottnat: This stuff for a few years.

250
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I forgot that timeline. We did, but his way in the back of my mind that maybe there was a some history with it. So you were surprised to how easy it was to do

251
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:28.800
Yeah.

252
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. You got tested. Didn't you

253
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Passed nice

254
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But this has to do with an interpersonal dynamic. This has to do with what is it like for you to sit here with me now knowing that I know what you've been living with what's that like

255
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.500
Kelli Ottnat: Kind of it kind of kind of fear.

256
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.650
Kelli Ottnat: I guess.

257
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:23.880
Kelli Ottnat: I don't know why.

258
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it feel more real. Now that you've told me

259
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:35.250
Yeah.

260
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe that's part of it.

261
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.730
Kelli Ottnat: Part of me thinks that I should

262
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.150
Kelli Ottnat: Stop right hard and just be quiet.

263
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:02.670
Kelli Ottnat: But I can't do that.

264
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.160
Kelli Ottnat: Just kind of put all my trust and

265
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.360
Kelli Ottnat: Into what we have going on here.

266
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.840
Kelli Ottnat: And in God. I mean, you know, forced

267
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.040
Kelli Ottnat: By him but

268
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.270
Kelli Ottnat: It's, it's really hard to do.

269
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm curious about how do you know when

270
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To act on which message.

271
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the message of put my hands up and have faith. What does faith. How does faith. Move on this planet.

272
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't isn't there some information about how to take action. How do you, how do you register when to go to Walmart parking lot versus stay like how do you interpret the Word of God. How do you know which part to take action on

273
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.720
Kelli Ottnat: I think that as long as I'm

274
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.980
Kelli Ottnat: For example, I'm dealing with that with with with something here now.

275
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:27.840
Kelli Ottnat: We have a neighbor, he uses, you know, do I do I run him off.

276
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:35.520
Kelli Ottnat: If I make a you know a fuss about it to Scott and say you need to go, he's bad for you to be around or

277
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.910
Kelli Ottnat: Or do I just put my faith in God and

278
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:48.300
Kelli Ottnat: Believe that everything's, you know, evolving in a healthy way even though you know from it from an unhealthy.

279
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.480
Kelli Ottnat: Way.

280
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.070
Kelli Ottnat: And I don't know, I just kind of have to meditate on

281
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.060
Kelli Ottnat: I'm just very slow and careful

282
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Slow and careful and your, your, your speech style reflects that.

283
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So something I had setting group and I had this in my head for so long that I had forgotten the author, but apparently Dr. Gabriel reminded me oh it's Byron Katie, that's where that came from. I was like, I didn't even read her stuff. But this phrase has stuck with me.

284
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: At any given juncture right

285
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: At any given point. This is all me. That's not Byron Katie, I'm going to say the scent of the statement in a minute, but

286
00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're feeling lost, confused, like that one like

287
00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the right thing to do.

288
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: They both look right. They both look wrong, what the heck.

289
00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: If you try this question on

290
00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: See where it gets you

291
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Not hands off the wheel. Right. Aren't you still don't. You still have to have your when you're driving. Don't you still have to have your hands on the wheel.

292
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is where I'm trying to get to. Where does it begin where I get my hands on the wheel.

293
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And when's the times that I just let the car slamming do

294
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: cavern.

295
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see where I'm going. Is that the moments you face though sometimes

296
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Your which one's faith, which one are they both

297
00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know which one.

298
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the question.

299
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: what would love do

300
00:33:52.890 --> 00:34:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Every single time. Not quite. God but stick with love for just a second, because it exact a little bit different hand on the wheel. It puts a little bit more behavior in it.

301
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice to do

302
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: To do.

303
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: what would love do

304
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't overanalyze it

305
00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Loves never wrong. You're not going to go wrong.

306
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But catching the glimpse as it passes by. When that answer comes by sometimes love

307
00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to be flooding to you. It's going to be coming to you. That's what love with you, it would come at me and I would do love I would make sure that I was safe.

308
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And not be distracted over here.

309
00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what love would look like.

310
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes love will be sacrificed sometimes love would be

311
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: On a different things. But if that's what steers each decision. How can you go wrong.

312
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's apply it to neighbor and see where it gets you try to catch. I know you're so say the Go slow and I think

313
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But still try to catch

314
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That first answer.

315
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You love Scott

316
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Scotts

317
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: In your imagination at higher risk because of said neighbor.

318
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you.

319
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: In this scenario. So remember that player, because that's a part of the stage as well. You're on the stage to you're there. So these other characters. They may not be right here. But there's also this greater mission, which I think is to get to back to be with him.

320
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a question.

321
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What would love to.

322
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your first answer to that.

323
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

324
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch the first one. Try not to censor Kelly. What's the first one that you just decided not to tell me

325
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.290
Kelli Ottnat: Patient

326
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Be patient.

327
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.780
Yeah.

328
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING. WHAT'S THE PATIENT'S needed for. And yes, there's the answer. It's sort of that quiet. It's to do is maybe not rushing to the obvious enabling behavior or doing for Scott what he needs to be doing for himself.

329
00:36:52.350 --> 00:37:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting consequence happen the way it naturally organically would if you didn't interfere. Maybe that's it i don't know but patient. So what are you being patient for what's on the other side of patients.

330
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:07.620
Kelli Ottnat: Healing

331
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:08.880
Okay.

332
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.220
Kelli Ottnat: Resolved.

333
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if it was energy, something happened the other night that you almost or maybe even started to walk, you know, remember what you said towards Walmart.

334
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that patients.

335
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What was that

336
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What was love doing right then.

337
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the answer to the question in you getting your shoes on walking.

338
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.960
Kelli Ottnat: I guess I was just

339
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.130
Kelli Ottnat: Taking care of myself.

340
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.340
Kelli Ottnat: Love really wasn't a thought.

341
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:43.410
Kelli Ottnat: Actually, and I thought about that afterwards you kind of had a

342
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.900
Kelli Ottnat: You know, like, where was your faith and

343
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.490
Kelli Ottnat: I didn't really think about it too much, but

344
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's continue this dialogue.

345
00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you telling me that love

346
00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is reckless

347
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And takes the hands off the wheel when what's needed is you put your shoes on and you go

348
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh this road is so I see I need not be on this road to pull over and I need to sleep until the morning and the sun comes up and it's melted the road and it's safe.

349
00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: How was that not in faith. If I find it. Isn't that what love would do is keep this vessel safe well

350
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Why not I thought of it, it's going to keep this body safe. I want this body to exist. Another. I don't know how many years I thought it had the thought, I need to be safe, not reckless. With this body.

351
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This is dangerous pullover

352
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: hands on the wheel, though.

353
00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm suspecting you're calling that selfish. That's my worst fear just now.

354
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.770
Kelli Ottnat: Not so much selfish alone.

355
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.220
Kelli Ottnat: Just, I mean,

356
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.690
Kelli Ottnat: It was like, it's like

357
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.360
Kelli Ottnat: I miss you know it was, it hasn't always been like this or

358
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.610
Kelli Ottnat: But it just felt like I was his target.

359
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.650
Kelli Ottnat: Probably just go

360
00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the solution. So guess what

361
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not patient

362
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's something else. What is it, what is that I know the solution is time to go. Got it timings. Right. What is

363
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the it's not hands on the wheel. What is it, if it's not patients, maybe it is patience but just patients come in a lot of different forms. What is love doing when you say it's just time to go. What are you going to do

364
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:27.510
Kelli Ottnat: Given us

365
00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

366
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I see it now.

367
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you took care of yourself.

368
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What were you getting up on

369
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:54.960
Kelli Ottnat: Green I was

370
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.670
Kelli Ottnat: It was just, I was I was tired of being entitled to

371
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.190
Kelli Ottnat: So bad.

372
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.770
Kelli Ottnat: There wasn't much thought in all that it was mostly just

373
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.920
Kelli Ottnat: Action.

374
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah.

375
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice. My question is to do what would love do, let's say, Well, would love contemplate analyze for a month. Yes.

376
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The answer is going to come from you.

377
00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're fed up. You're tired of it.

378
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You put action behind keeping yourself safe. That's what love did it got you out of a dangerous environment.

379
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We re languages so interesting. I was taking care of myself. And when we pick at it long enough.

380
00:42:54.060 --> 00:43:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of have a negative meaning like like you're giving up on something else because you're going towards yourself towards self care towards love of you, you're giving up on something else.

381
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.190
Kelli Ottnat: Right now I feel like

382
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.710
Kelli Ottnat: I'm some stability for Scott, maybe that's

383
00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:37.860
Kelli Ottnat: Listed but

384
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.110
Kelli Ottnat: I don't want him going out and getting just

385
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:55.170
Kelli Ottnat: Lost in that crowd. You know what I mean like if I wasn't here, then it would be here that the drugs would be here.

386
00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.460
Kelli Ottnat: And he comes back here to, you know,

387
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.110
Kelli Ottnat: Sleeping like this thought like it's

388
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Good is Scott

389
00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Really around or is it just the attic and so you're not leaving behind Scott you're leaving behind the addict. When this healthy man shows up again when he's in recovery, you'll recognize him.

390
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not around.

391
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Around

392
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The attic treats you like crap.

393
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't care about you.

394
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want it to be so.

395
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have evidence because you are an incredibly patient woman. Some might call it enabling which did kind of right um stability for him.

396
00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't do things for someone else, we can say, here's the plan. I got an idea about how you can be stable for yourself, but you don't hear me saying when you're talking about saving money. Well, why don't you lean on Scott for it, talking about you doing talking about you can hold is good.

397
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.260
Kelli Ottnat: I heard you talking about saving money.

398
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're talking about you taking action getting a hold of. So we'll taking action, what would love do you put action behind your vision of getting back with your son. That's what love would do. And anything that gets in its way.

399
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That can't be the path.

400
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If I was telling you

401
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to stay with this man, you've committed to them. And you know what, I'm sorry. You made that decision about your son, long time ago. You made that. That's it. You do it you know that's the right thing to do. You made a commitment, Scott. That's it. How's that feel when I say that.

402
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Really bad right wish you knew right away that is not what I'm looking for, you know right away when it isn't a loving decision.

403
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're not gonna

404
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Call the police.

405
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the only thing an advocate here anyway. You're not going to have bars, meaning bars right locking this person from if you're not going to

406
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Be the tough love because that's what tough, you know, love would look like with an addict is, you know, I talk a lot about that. I like the felony drug court that I was in, because it has tough love. It can grab a person off the street, pull them in Cassie thing and then they go

407
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What did I just do and then come back to me and they say was hated you was so mad at you made me do that. And now I see. Thank you.

408
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can't do that.

409
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So what love would do is steady the course do the next thing.

410
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You do know what's right.

411
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you think it through. You sit over there and I just need to go.

412
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's what love would do, but it isn't that you're wandering across the desert. Is it you know exactly where you're going. You have Louisiana.

413
00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a little bill is a $25 bill pay over there. And I want you to think about this job here in New Mexico. I can't even put those two things together.

414
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's Louisiana. I think you want to be over there.

415
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.820
Kelli Ottnat: I want to be with. I want to be with me. Sure, yeah.

416
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything that's contradictory to that.

417
00:47:59.220 --> 00:47:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

418
00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the loving decision.

419
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is Scott making loving decisions when he chooses to escape his own disappointments his own emotions his own failures his own anything. I don't know the man I'm

420
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Now he's giving up.

421
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: On himself.

422
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he is enough. He's enough just the way he was born, you are enough and eventually you

423
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to taper off of this stuff and you're going to get deeper. I think into faith and when you are concerned and scared and all those human emotions.

424
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You may. Pray you may breathe. You may journal. You may give yourself. You know, I'm going to take another shower feels so good. I'll take another shower. You may do these other techniques, but you won't reach for a substance reaching for a chemical

425
00:48:55.770 --> 00:49:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: When the problem is a spiritual one right reading for chemical solution when the problem is a spiritual one you'll stop doing that.

426
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Guys are still doing it, what would love do it would do the next loving thing.

427
00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your course is steady, it's this way. It's up in Louisiana. Anything else that gets in its way.

428
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are the one that's going to get it there. You have to take care of this one body, you have it includes your emotional state. It includes your psychological well being and you're being assaulted.

429
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So the loving thing to do is to protect yourself.

430
00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course, you went walking because you've got a brain in your head, you go, this guy's abusive course you're going to go. He's, he's an addict. He doesn't care about you. Scott, does she haven't seen him in a while.

431
00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sure you'll have a conversation when he's back being himself. But for now, he's dangerous.

432
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The addict is dangerous.

433
00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know it in yourself. Kelly, you know, when you have made decisions when she were high. All he cared about was the high you weren't there either.

434
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't you make some decisions. You're like, how could I have done that.

435
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I think you

436
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Said chemical

437
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: When you came around, you got some some sobriety behind you that inner voice the authentic self spoke up and said, Okay, I got it. Seriously, I gotta turn towards a spiritual solution, right, I got to do that. And then you quieted this addiction voice and you've been moving forward.

438
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot

439
00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot to chew on.

440
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder in here if you on some level were worried that I was judging him.

441
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a possibility.

442
00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.480
Kelli Ottnat: Not really judging him. I just

443
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:24.240
Kelli Ottnat: He said,

444
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:31.650
Kelli Ottnat: Everything you know for so many years, everything was just

445
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:40.890
Kelli Ottnat: No, don't, don't really speak about. So I guess that's just kind of, you know, habit that I'm

446
00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:42.750
Kelli Ottnat: Trying to to

447
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't say that. Don't say that. Don't say that. And then, don't say that, and don't say that all of it. And so in here. It's all about talking

448
00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

449
00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's rewind and review.

450
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Kelly what felt different for you today.

451
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:24.570
Kelli Ottnat: The Congress, you know, I was talking, I wasn't as seemed a little more

452
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:26.940
Kelli Ottnat: Casual

453
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:29.280
Yeah.

454
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You felt less intensity since like the last time.

455
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:40.410
Kelli Ottnat: Ruby.

456
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: More comfortable talking to me.

457
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

458
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's true. I got some more. I got more information from you, you know, I could

459
00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I could I could get some

460
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Some info.

461
00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So that I could see that.

462
00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I enjoyed it. I like hearing what's going on in your head.

463
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I need to message the doc. Are you still have some medicine left over. We want me to do.

464
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.590
Kelli Ottnat: And I'm still good.

465
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:35.880
Kelli Ottnat: Okay.

466
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's. So here's the thing.

467
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it

468
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of touching go like at any minute. You might just dip.

469
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:51.480
Kelli Ottnat: Into

470
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.620
Believing

471
00:53:59.160 --> 00:53:59.490
Kelli Ottnat: You know,

472
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:05.880
Kelli Ottnat: I don't know, I've kind of

473
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:15.120
Kelli Ottnat: So it's difficult, because we've, I've been with Scott for so long. And I've kind of, you know,

474
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.910
Kelli Ottnat: Built a life with him.

475
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:24.240
Kelli Ottnat: If I mean the things would have been as

476
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.920
Kelli Ottnat: as intense as they were last night all day.

477
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:33.120
Kelli Ottnat: Know when I probably would still be here.

478
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I got the message. So you really know. You don't know.

479
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, you've got those numbers and if you

480
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of plan ahead a little and say I just want to know what availability is what's you know what's the typical amount of time, what's the address, let me at least, have it. Then you have some preparation for just in case.

481
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay means you're taking care of yourself. You can't be there as a healthy physical and emotional mommy. You can't, if you keep enduring craziness.

482
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:09.660
Kelli Ottnat: You

483
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't be available.

484
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are just facts are

485
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Just saying.

486
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Enough trauma from the past, you don't need it still coming at you.

487
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

488
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.770
Kelli Ottnat: So glad

489
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.730

Kelli Ottnat: Hopefully he will to ensure will be will be good, you know, because

492
00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have any worries about that.

493
00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's going to take one decision after the other, and some of them are going to be hard, hard decisions and you're going to need some kind of compass.

494
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When right a loving thing to Scott is this way and Jude is this way. What about me already.

495
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What would love to.

496
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Try it on. See if you like it, see if it can guide, a little bit more than just hands off the wheel that everything's the patients is sometimes grabbing tight onto that wheel. Isn't that the wisdom of knowing the difference helped me know what would love to right now.

497
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:46.590
