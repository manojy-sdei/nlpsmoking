00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
Joey Raya: 2018 I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, with the lipase, the

2
00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:29.910
Joey Raya: Give or take. And then from there, just kind of escalated and has now turned into a chronic pancreatitis idiopathic I don't have a drug or alcoholic history. I've had a endoscopy colon asked the ER CP Mr Mrs EP

3
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.020
Joey Raya: They thought that it was a pancreatic diversity and they went to put a stent in and that was not the case.

4
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.910
Joey Raya: All my scans are clear. The only thing out of whack. Is my lipase

5
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.010
Joey Raya: Nobody knows why. And so, as of right now, we're just

6
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:58.710
Joey Raya: I've been seeing a pain management doctor over at UC Irvine. And before I was using. Excuse me. Just one second cat, sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.030
Joey Raya: The UCI doctors switched to me. Or actually, when they first started me on medication. They gave they had me on

8
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.590
Joey Raya: Methadone Gabba Penton and Percocet, which worked wonderfully and I was on that for about a month.

9
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:38.880
Joey Raya: Month, a month and a half or so, give or take. And then when I went to go see the pain management group at UC Irvine. That's when she switched me over. So I know I said UC Irvine, a couple of times and I'm, I'm trying to keep everything straight for you. So I apologize.

10
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:55.890
Joey Raya: I was admitted into UC Irvine, and the palliative team that I was that I saw there while I was in the hospital. There were the ones that changed my medication to the Methadone Percocet.

11
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.710
Joey Raya: Get dependent combination

12
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.390
Dr. Figg: While you were in the hospital.

13
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.780
Joey Raya: Correct. And before that, prior to that, I was taking a

14
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.050
Joey Raya: Morphine and Percocet. Okay. Again, I was RMS cotton just a delayed, you know, extended release.

15
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:27.840
Joey Raya: And that worked okay but hands down. As of right now, the methadone, you have a patent Percocet, is what worked best for the last about two months.

16
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:39.120
Joey Raya: I just ran out of my my study text actually and I knew I was going to run out and I knew I was getting here. So I kind of tapered myself off already.

17
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.470
Joey Raya: I know you're not supposed to do that. But I was going to run out completely. And I didn't want to just stop it. So,

18
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.430
Joey Raya: I so I took a

19
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.680
Joey Raya: One milligrams this morning about 5am

20
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.650
Dr. Figg: Okay, how much going on before

21
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.760
Joey Raya: two milligrams three times a day, sublingual

22
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.810
Okay.

23
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.600
Dr. Figg: How much methadone, where you

24
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.820
Joey Raya: 2.5 milligrams also three times a day.

25
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.990
Dr. Figg: And how much purpose.

26
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.820
Joey Raya: It was 10 325 as needed.

27
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.090
Dr. Figg: And how much did you typically take

28
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.280
I'm

29
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.600
Joey Raya: Not every day.

30
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.470
Joey Raya: In a week time

31
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:44.940
Joey Raya: Maybe I would take it, maybe three out of the four days. Okay. And maybe about three to four times in that day, whenever there's a flare up of some sorts, which

32
00:03:45.840 --> 00:04:04.650
Joey Raya: I'm actually kind of having right now and I'm actually waiting until this appointment is over, and to see how I feel. Because I might go to the ER. Again, I was just there like a week and a half ago my life pace was at. And that's when I got the this process started with with your attention.

33
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.520
Dr. Figg: And how much you have a pencil. Do you take

34
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.510
Joey Raya: 600 milligrams also three times a day. Okay.

35
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.350
Dr. Figg: And that's a study

36
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.750
Joey Raya: Does he

37
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.460
Dr. Figg: Have you been on a higher dose than six milligrams a day of subindex buprenorphine.

38
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.760
Joey Raya: I have not an ER doc suggested that that might be beneficial to me and I'm more than happy to do that.

39
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.700
Joey Raya: Okay, I just fit the thing is is I part of my one of my concerns is

40
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.170
Joey Raya: Sometimes I get acute pain.

41
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:59.640
Joey Raya: When it when it spikes. And my last time when I went to, to the ER, like I said, My lipase was 880 and their range, I believe, is 75 to 350 if I remember correctly, the Saddleback in in Mission Viejo

42
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.150
Joey Raya: But because I was taking the study texts and he said that he couldn't

43
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.780
Joey Raya: He suggested that I not take anything. And he wasn't sure if it was going to be effective, is that how that works.

44
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.330
Dr. Figg: You can be

45
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.790
Joey Raya: Because I, I know that.

46
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.780
Joey Raya: I do 911 rescue out here in California.

47
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.480
Joey Raya: So I know that

48
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:39.240
Joey Raya: Study Texan Suboxone they kind of do the same thing, but this Suboxone has the naloxone in it and the subby Texas know if I am I getting that correct. Okay.

49
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.810
Dr. Figg: So, so that's fine.

50
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:56.760
Dr. Figg: I just kind of want to understand their what the medication history has been you. And you mentioned that since switching over to the buprenorphine the cyber attacks that you haven't been very impressed.

51
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.830
Joey Raya: That is that is correct.

52
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:06.030
Dr. Figg: Okay, do you have any side effects. So back when you were taking two milligrams three times a day. Did you have any side effects from it.

53
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.320
Joey Raya: Constipation was the biggest one.

54
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:20.280
Joey Raya: Okay, even taking a Seneca 12. What is a 12.6 milligrams twice a day.

55
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:32.280
Joey Raya: Just, you know, the over the counter at every once in a while I drink some sanity, but I would get a BM maybe every 36 to 48 hours.

56
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.310
Dr. Figg: Did it make you sleepy.

57
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.370
Joey Raya: Not really know

58
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.470
Joey Raya: Give you a headache. Now,

59
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.840
Dr. Figg: You give you more stomach pain.

60
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.740
Joey Raya: I honestly i i

61
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.560
Joey Raya: Couldn't tell you if they did or not, it's

62
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.720
Dr. Figg: Just one phrase that question that way.

63
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.920
Joey Raya: Okay.

64
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.570
Dr. Figg: Ministry right so it didn't make the pain worse, did it make you nauseated.

65
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.070
Joey Raya: That I wasn't any nauseated anymore less so. All right.

66
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.220
Dr. Figg: It didn't, it didn't cause any highs or anything and didn't give you any severe reactions, but it was

67
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.200
Dr. Figg: OK.

68
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:24.450
Dr. Figg: Um, what So currently, you're on the buprenorphine and the gamma Penton those medications for pain. Do you take any other medications.

69
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:45.810
Joey Raya: I also have a, oh, I have toward all 10 milligrams that ER doctor gave to me just on an as needed basis. Okay. Also, I take 100 milligrams of imitrex for migraines just on an as needed basis, but it's been it's been over a month since I've needed to take

70
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.920
Joey Raya: A look at imitrex green

71
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.680
Alright, so

72
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.420
Dr. Figg: Okay, and so you said you had been on pain medication since 2018

73
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.720
Dr. Figg: And your dose been going up over time.

74
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.560
Joey Raya: I'm sorry. Hold on one second here.

75
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.760
Joey Raya: They started me

76
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.070
Joey Raya: I've been taking pain medication. Prior to that, for

77
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:28.950
Joey Raya: Pain management for my knees. And at that time I was taking Norco 10 325 just on an as needed basis. Usually, it was maybe

78
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:38.430
Joey Raya: Twice a week three times a week at the very most, just if I had a an extra you know heavy day at work.

79
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.830
Joey Raya: You know, so

80
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:51.180
Joey Raya: And then after that, at about december of 2018 they switched me from the Norco

81
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.230
Joey Raya: To the percocet five

82
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.780
Joey Raya: For the, for the pancreatic pain.

83
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.230
Joey Raya: And then about

84
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:19.350
Joey Raya: Maybe April or so of last year, they bumped it up to the 10 325 okay and and it just it it stayed at the 10 325 range.

85
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:32.070
Joey Raya: And I was okay with not going to anything higher, but I did let them know that sometimes they would have to take more than one depending on how severe the pain was

86
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.410
Joey Raya: Gotcha. Okay.

87
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:42.690
Dr. Figg: So, you told me before that methadone percocet gabapentin combination was started by the inpatient palliative team.

88
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.690
Joey Raya: At yes at UC Irvine. Correct.

89
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.930
Dr. Figg: Why in why did it gets switched to the Sunday Times.

90
00:09:50.940 --> 00:10:00.450
Joey Raya: Because I had been taking I had been taking opioids, I guess for for so long. And because my condition is idiopathic

91
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.680
Joey Raya: And, to be quite honest with you, there's no end in sight. As of right now.

92
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.200
Joey Raya: They wanted to get me on some type of

93
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:26.340
Joey Raya: Pain management that that would work. But that wasn't opioid based so that when I did get better. I wouldn't have any issues later on down the line.

94
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.950
Joey Raya: Which I'm very thankful for.

95
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.280
Dr. Figg: Okay, so they wanted a safer alternative basically that's

96
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.200
Joey Raya: Correct, yeah.

97
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.290
Dr. Figg: That's a good reason.

98
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:51.690
Dr. Figg: But you didn't have any problems or did you have any problems with taking more pain medication than you were prescribed with getting pain medication from multiple doctors or sources.

99
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:57.990
Joey Raya: Now, now, I always went to the same same pain management doctor every time.

100
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:09.390
Dr. Figg: Okay. And so you're you're coming to Brian heart. Now just for mostly the payment our pain management program. The primarily works on Suboxone side effects.

101
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.600
Joey Raya: That that's, that's correct. What

102
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.380
Joey Raya: There's so many wheels.

103
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:25.620
Joey Raya: What I went into the ER last week you know I told them that I was having trouble finding a position to prescribe this

104
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.570
Joey Raya: Text for me through the pain management.

105
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:41.370
Joey Raya: Out here because a lot of the physicians out here that have the licensure to prescribe that do it for opiate cessation or opiates sensation.

106
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.580
Joey Raya: Not for pain management.

107
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:52.200
Dr. Figg: Okay, cool. I understand it. Okay. Um, let's talk about some other history. Are you allergic to anything.

108
00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:00.330
Joey Raya: That specifically but reglan and diaper Hydra mean I have reactions to

109
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.080
Okay.

110
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.750
Dr. Figg: You mentioned that you have knee pain in both knees. It sounded like

111
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.520
Joey Raya: Yeah, I've used to write professional skateboards and I've had

112
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:18.240
Joey Raya: Two knee surgeries on my left knee and one on my right right and so

113
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:25.410
Dr. Figg: Do you have any other medical conditions, other than the idiopathic pancreatitis, and the knee pain. Okay.

114
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.880
Joey Raya: Yeah, okay.

115
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.770
Dr. Figg: You mentioned the only other medication was toward all anything else.

116
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.070
Joey Raya: Toward all on the imitrex that's

117
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.170
New tracks. Okay.

118
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.740
Dr. Figg: And but you haven't had any migraines recently.

119
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:48.600
Dr. Figg: Correctly, other than the knee surgeries, have you in the stent or attended Stanford placement. Have you had any other surgeries.

120
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.870
Joey Raya: A tonsillectomy. And what I was one in 1977

121
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.860
Dr. Figg: Okay, cool. That's young for a tonsillectomy. Well, okay.

122
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.650
Joey Raya: It was back in the day when when I had a repetitive ear infections.

Joey Raya: No, they did have me on Zen PEP for back in May, when they thought that it might be the diversity, but then after discovering that that was not the case. I was taken off of this Empath and have not taken any sense probably mid June of last year.

147
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.310
Right.

148
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:12.480
Dr. Figg: So all right, so bright heart is there are multiple things that we do, we do addiction treatment for some people, we have a pain management program. We have a weight loss program. We have several things they're all based around our Telehealth services.

149
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:19.320
Dr. Figg: But are both on paying even in our addiction treatment stuff are based around weekly support groups.

150
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:26.880
Dr. Figg: So you have a history of chronic pain that's the program that you would probably benefit from the most

151
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:49.080
Dr. Figg: The way our program is set up is that we get you hooked up with a weekly support group of other people who have similar chronic pain issues so that you can support each other and share strategies for other non medication based pain management. Okay.

152
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:57.300
Dr. Figg: Okay, because medication is one aspect of it. But there are a lot of other things that are helpful for pain management.

153
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:06.120
Dr. Figg: The groups are led by a counselor with a background in pain management in chronic pain.

154
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:26.820
Dr. Figg: We also have pain boarded physicians who alternate with our internal medicine. So I'm internal medicine. I do the medication management, primarily, but we also have pain management warded physicians who do other non medication based education and support and things like that.

155
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:35.640
Dr. Figg: Every week, the group. Start with medication management with the was my computer so

156
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:44.550
Dr. Figg: medication management check ins with the doctor. So you basically get access to your doctor every week or every other week to make sure that

157
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:55.710
Dr. Figg: Your pain as well controlled your functioning is maximized. And just so you understand subtext is not the only thing that we do. It's the only opiate that we manage

158
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.380
Dr. Figg: For safety reasons and for tell

159
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:05.070
Dr. Figg: But for instance, you're also on gabapentin with I do gather content management and and other things as well.

160
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:19.860
Dr. Figg: So you have weekly or every other week access to your doctor, basically, to make sure is your dose adequate, do you have your supply. Are you having any problems. Are you having any side effects. Is there more or less that we could or should you

161
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.820
Okay, okay.

162
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.480
Dr. Figg: When's the when's the last time you took your time.

163
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.240
Joey Raya: This morning about 5am and it was

164
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.060
Joey Raya: Oh, it was only one milligram. And yeah, before that.

165
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.030
Joey Raya: Was about

166
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.870
Joey Raya: 1216 hours prior to that was another one milligram. Yeah. OK, so

167
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.930
Dr. Figg: My inclination here is that you should be on a higher dose.

168
00:17:54.060 --> 00:18:01.380
Dr. Figg: Excuse me, constipation, we can manage if that's the only major side effects that it sounds like you got at a higher dose.

169
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.680
Dr. Figg: Me relax works better than Cena

170
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.200
Dr. Figg: For opioid induced constipation mural X is generally first line.

171
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:19.950
Dr. Figg: So that would probably work better and I would stop the sound all together, that's more likely to give you spasms and cramps than actually move things along.

172
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.710
Joey Raya: Okay. All right. There's

173
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:30.210
Dr. Figg: Just no center. Make sure I'll squeeze. But if there's not enough water, then it's just going to squeeze. It's not going to move things

174
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:36.270
Joey Raya: Yeah, that's, that's another issue too is, you know, I don't have an appetite and

175
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.710
Joey Raya: I'm not very, very thirsty and

176
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.940
Joey Raya: You know, I have a

177
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.150
Joey Raya: I have a thermos and it's

178
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:51.330
Joey Raya: It's really a chore to get through it, just one time throughout the day.

179
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.280
Dr. Figg: Right. Um, as far as groups go so I

180
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:12.750
Dr. Figg: I have a pain management group that I alternate with the pain boarded doctor on Thursdays at 130 or at noon to noon. One is getting a little full

181
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.090
Dr. Figg: So we're looking for.

182
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.280
Dr. Figg: To fill up our 130 Thursday through

183
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.450
Joey Raya: With. Now, how long is the meeting.

184
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.820
Dr. Figg: Their, their hour long meetings.

185
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.010
Joey Raya: An hour long um

186
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.680
Joey Raya: Thursday at 130 that's

187
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.690
Dr. Figg: That's one of my availabilities

188
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:52.260
Dr. Figg: For for my patients with chronic pain if that's if that's a no go. That's a non starter. I have availability, but not much for my noon or if neither of those work, we can find there are other doctors who do this as well.

189
00:19:54.060 --> 00:20:06.390
Joey Raya: The new WORKS, HONESTLY THE noon works best. The 130 would be cutting it just a little close because I have a chiropractic appointment every

190
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:21.870
Joey Raya: Tuesday and Thursday at 240 and, you know, I've been attacking this pancreatitis thing. I'm from all angles. I mean, I see a nutritionist a chiropractor. You know, I have my primary I have the pain management. I mean,

191
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.690
Joey Raya: Just trying to do anything I can

192
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:37.080
Dr. Figg: Okay, I understand that's fine. Um, let's make sure I'm not going to commit to putting you in the noon, because I don't want to cross my counselor who I do the group with

193
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:42.510
Dr. Figg: No longer have enough time to do things so i don't i don't want to do that.

194
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:55.710
Dr. Figg: But we'll, we'll make sure and look at which we can get you into if the 130 is now going to 12 years ago. I'll have the care coordinators set up a different group with you. Like I said, there are other groups as well.

195
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:08.130
Dr. Figg: And for your medication. I think we should put you on eight milligrams space throughout the day, we should start at a higher dose than you were at because

196
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:18.840
Dr. Figg: It sounds like six milligrams in the day you're you were unimpressed with you felt like it was less effective than what you were previously. And both of those are a load of still

197
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:25.440
Dr. Figg: If we look at our ceiling of 32 milligrams in the day we're on the way, low and

198
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.580
Dr. Figg: Now it's different for

199
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.020
Dr. Figg: Everyone everybody sensitivity to this medication and requirements are totally different.

200
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.820
Dr. Figg: Though on the low end of dosing is that you're not in withdrawal.

201
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:49.170
Dr. Figg: And that your pain and functioning are treated the best we can. And on the high end of dosing. The high limit his side effects or the seal. Right. Does that make sense.

202
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.010
Dr. Figg: So I want

203
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.880
Dr. Figg: A high enough dose that we maximize what you're able to do and minimize your pain.

204
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:55.140
Joey Raya: Right.

205
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:59.430
Dr. Figg: With the lowest effective dose so that we don't have side effects. So does that make sense.

206
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.090
Joey Raya: Yes.

207
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.580
Dr. Figg: And it sounds like you were on an adequate dose.

208
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:21.120
Dr. Figg: And so I would start you on four milligrams twice a day. The, the actual duration of effect for buprenorphine is usually 18 to 30 hours. It's on the longer side, it's a little bit different for everyone, but usually we can do twice a day dosing pretty well.

209
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.940
Dr. Figg: For pain management. So I would start with you have the tablets are the films.

210
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.930
Joey Raya: They were just the sublingual tablets.

211
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.720
Dr. Figg: Okay, great. So you're familiar with how to take them.

212
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.470
Joey Raya: Have a little yeah

213
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:40.200
Dr. Figg: All under your tongue. Don't chew them. Don't swallow them, don't eat or drink afterwards, things like that. Good.

214
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:40.590
Yeah.

215
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:47.310
Dr. Figg: And did you have any problems with your insurance as far as coverage for

216
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.830
Joey Raya: A No.

217
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:56.880
Joey Raya: Okay, no, no, I haven't. I, I, I just got married. And so my insurance has changed.

218
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:03.270
Joey Raya: Okay and so i mean it's it's a full on you'd have

219
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.300
Joey Raya: To so I'm guessing I probably shouldn't have any issues.

220
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.760
Dr. Figg: I think they actually want usually

221
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:23.940
Dr. Figg: Either way, if I'm going to write the prescription for the generic and if for some reason they go all know we want film, just let us know as soon as possible, so we can fix the prescription, because sometimes

222
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.460
Dr. Figg: Yes, in advance for the insurance companies rules, but

223
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.720
Joey Raya: I understand. Yeah.

224
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:39.060
Dr. Figg: I would start you at four milligrams twice a day and then see how that works, and then go up or down as we need to.

225
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:49.740
Dr. Figg: Um, one of the things you're talking about is that you get flares, which is typical of relaxing chronic pancreatitis, regardless of whether it's idiopathic or for alcohol or whatever.

226
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.670
Dr. Figg: And that you were thinking of going to the ED.

227
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.880
Joey Raya: Yes, that is correct.

228
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.250
Dr. Figg: Is that because you're out of medication.

229
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:08.670
Joey Raya: No, no, that's because I'm I'm keeping my shit together pretty good right now i'm i'm about a seven. Okay.

230
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:16.230
Dr. Figg: Okay, um, even when you were on the Methadone Percocet. Did you still have days where you said, I'm going to go to the ED.

231
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.500
Dr. Figg: Yeah. All right.

232
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:29.460
Dr. Figg: So that you understand my goal is to treat your pain, including the flares, as well as I can so you don't have to go to the ED.

233
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:38.250
Dr. Figg: Ed and you're on Suboxone, the answer is yeah, they can give you whatever they want. They just have to give you more.

234
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:39.780
Dr. Figg: So,

235
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.420
Joey Raya: They can donate as Suboxone or

236
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.220
Joey Raya: Under such either way.

237
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:45.660
Joey Raya: Either way, if you have

238
00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.410
Dr. Figg: buprenorphine in your system. It just raises the threshold.

239
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.500
Joey Raya: Oh, I see. Okay. Pass. Okay.

240
00:24:52.890 --> 00:25:04.920
Dr. Figg: It's it hasn't blocking mechanisms so that if you take, you know, purchase that are delighted or heroin or whatever that person was taking before

241
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:14.910
Dr. Figg: At the normal versus it has no effect. You just have to cross the threshold with the pain management with the pain medication.

242
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.500
Joey Raya: I see that I didn't know I was under the impression that

243
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.670
Joey Raya: That they blocked the receptors completely

244
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.550
Dr. Figg: For free in

245
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.160
Dr. Figg: Effect. It does.

246
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.230
Joey Raya: It locks it up into a certain level.

247
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.390
Dr. Figg: You just have to give more pain medication to kick the buprenorphine now.

248
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:43.230
Joey Raya: Yeah, see, I did not realize that completely i i thought that it just said.

249
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:57.030
Dr. Figg: It's not irreversible, but it hold on tighter to the receptor than most other medications do so in order to kick it off and get the effect they have to give you more, but things like tour.

250
00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.900
Dr. Figg: Dalhousie are totally different. That's an anti inflammatory

251
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:01.530
Joey Raya: As I think

252
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:14.820
Dr. Figg: With the opiate receptor. So that'll work. But just so that you understand the, the answers are to either give you more buprenorphine which is valid option or to give you more of whatever else until it works.

253
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.860
Joey Raya: I say okay

254
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:29.880
Dr. Figg: And you've been on opiates for a couple years now your tolerance to them, to some degree, you're less likely to have respiratory depression in a monitor setting.

255
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.580
Joey Raya: Right, yeah. Also, just so you know, I'm actually

256
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.890
Joey Raya: Here we go. It used to be on my desk, but I have my my Narc can

257
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.540
Dr. Figg: Okay, cool.

258
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:54.480
Joey Raya: From when they gave me the method when they first started me on the Methadone percocet combination. They gave me a narc and for home.

259
00:26:54.930 --> 00:27:01.680
Dr. Figg: So you understand buprenorphine on its own. It's a partial agonist, which means and only flip that switch halfway

260
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:12.720
Dr. Figg: tighter than others, so it prevents the action. That's why we use it for addiction management and prevents other opiates were having an effect. Under normal circumstances.

261
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:28.620
Dr. Figg: But it effectively on its own. You can't overdose on it because it does, it has a ceiling of about 32 milligrams. And beyond that, just more doesn't do anything else. And that's not enough to put people into respiratory arrest.

262
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:40.620
Dr. Figg: don't check. So that's why it's a safer medication. From that standpoint, but for people who have been on opiates for a while. It also tends to be more effective and it reduces

263
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.370
Hypersensitive

264
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.010
Joey Raya: Okay. All right.

265
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:51.720
Dr. Figg: I'm gonna, I'm going to end my talk here. I'm going to issue your prescription for four milligrams twice a day. I'm going to give you a two week supply

266
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.610
Dr. Figg: I'm going to have the care coordinators reach back out to you to

267
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:04.140
Dr. Figg: Set up your time for your group and then I'm gonna let you go so that you can go to the ED if you need to. Okay.

268
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.690
Joey Raya: All right, I appreciate it. Um,

269
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:13.050
Dr. Figg: You know, it was nice to meet you. If you have any questions please reach out to the. I'm sorry. My kids came up

270
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.030
Dr. Figg: Please reach out to the virtual clinic. Okay, they're the best point of contact for you. Okay.

271
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.250
Joey Raya: All right, I appreciate it. Thank you for your help.

272
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.350
Dr. Figg: You take care. I hope you feel better soon.

273
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.490
Joey Raya: Thank you. Have a good one.

274
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:45.240
Dr. Figg: And on his church report. He's been on buprenorphine and he was on methadone and Percocet and things like that before. He's going to be restarted on buprenorphine four milligrams twice a day, and we're going to get them plugged into a pain management.
