Brandon Cordova: Tried to make me, like, get a job, and, like, ever since I found heroin, like she don't

349
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.200
Brandon Cordova: Well, up until now, but like when I was on it. She would

350
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.570
Brandon Cordova: She would do nothing for me.

351
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.770
Brandon Cordova: Just cut me off.

352
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:34.260
Brandon Cordova: From the heroin. I think I did some last time was in May. Okay.

353
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, you said from heroin. So what else did you try after me.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.440
Brandon Cordova: Or just do the Suboxone

355
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:57.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, I gotta accident to say from heroin and then next thing you know i know that was something else that happened after me. All right, make sure I got it all together. Okay, so, um,

356
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:06.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's talk about the THE LEGAL IN and OUT OF JAIL. When did that well prison. When did it all start

357
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.320
Brandon Cordova: Well, she ever since I was what 13 is my first time and

358
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.150
Brandon Cordova: I got out of the New Mexico boys school when I was 19 and their

359
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:23.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: State OUT FOR LUCKY 13 tell me the charge and how long

360
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.920
Brandon Cordova: I think it was a solid battery in the household memory. And I don't know, I went to July 26 times, you know,

361
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:49.020
Brandon Cordova: It'll my sister. I was laying on the ground and she kicked me and I hit her. And they were just looking for a reason to put me in jail because I wasn't listening. So they said, the next time they have to come over, they're going to put me in jail for anything.

362
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What what me to escalate to law enforcement.

363
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.390
Brandon Cordova: Because I just was out of control, and I wouldn't listen

364
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:12.030
Brandon Cordova: So they kind of trip. My mom telling her that she put me on probation, it would it would help me out and she would get a grip on me, but that she just made me worse.

365
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:17.910
Brandon Cordova: Yes, there are wonderful.

366
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.470

Brandon Cordova: Yeah.

372
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.370

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:38.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

409
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.950
Brandon Cordova: Well, I just barely got out December 10th.

410
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.760
Why

411
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:47.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All the pieces together. Alright, so, but from a

412
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From a voiceover

413
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so when you got out in December. Did you use

414
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.400
Brandon Cordova: Oh no, not heroin just Suboxone

415
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.710
Brandon Cordova: And then I use heroin one time in prison and may

416
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:15.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know, I know I must be very naive in LA, but it always shocked me when you see that they were shooting heroin in jail.

417
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:34.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you know it. We hear it personal. But, but this is just an isolated case but this will happen a lot because there's several patients that don't want to make it seem like this is of course of being in jail. You can have access to the drunk.

418
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.820
Brandon Cordova: Good like Suboxone into Mexico. So it's a big theme.

419
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.810
Brandon Cordova: Yeah, they sell it in there for 800 a strip

420
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:44.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well,

421
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.450
Yes.

422
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.930
Brandon Cordova: It's $100 and he

423
00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:50.340
But

424
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.320
Brandon Cordova: Yeah.

425
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:19.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Alright, so I went through your family history and know about in the marital status which parenting, the time you graduate from high school and you are entrepreneurial several businesses, those are all shut down. I know last those businesses, um, what's your current employment status.

426
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:21.270
Brandon Cordova: Oh,

427
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:30.750
Brandon Cordova: Well, I went back to the DVR. I'm in the process now of getting another business grass. One thing about that program is they they cannot

428
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:39.300
Brandon Cordova: discriminate on you. So I was completely honest with them everything that happened. And they're like, well, we can't discriminate. So we're going to help you again so

429
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are you thinking of starting this one.

430
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.650
Brandon Cordova: Um, I wanted to do a

431
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:58.200
Brandon Cordova: Two of them. I wanted to do a start my own clothing line and then I wanted to get some hot dog carts and make people to do hot dog vending for me.

432
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:12.240
Brandon Cordova: Yeah, I mean, because with anything. It's just all how you market it isn't a millionaire off everything. So, I mean, I'm pretty good business orientation minded.

433
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you take any courses in that way. It just comes natural.

434
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.530
Brandon Cordova: I'm just

435
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.190
Brandon Cordova: As I was raised. My mom always had her own business.

436
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.560

Brandon Cordova: And then from my PTSD and all that.

539
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.630

Brandon Cordova: Mom, I really

544
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:20.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: am concerned that when you're the person that you use with a lot when she's

545
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:42.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Released that both of you. What happened hold each other accountable to this edition. So what I would see as a relationship trigger is if she gets a craving, you might get a craving and vice versa, if she confesses to you which. That's what we do in relationships. Right. And I got a craving.

546
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:51.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Will you be strong enough to tell how to resist the craving and to not be tempted to just explore that craving together and get out

547
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.600
Brandon Cordova: Oh yeah but

548
00:47:55.110 --> 00:48:12.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the room that we have to address. We can't make it seem like oh when she gets out you just gonna be clean will start a business method because that easy diction will not be a problem. So I just want to be direct and throw that out there, so you're aware of that will trigger

549
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:21.930
Brandon Cordova: Yeah, and that's good, that's kind of why I turned to Suboxone because, I mean, it still getting behind it. Oh, it replaces

550
00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.830
Brandon Cordova: The need for the heroin something

551
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:34.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I guess you would have to accommodate your wife, she'll be offering Suboxone or what was the

552
00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.810
Brandon Cordova: Last time I talked to her when she was in detox. They had her on it to

553
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:44.400
