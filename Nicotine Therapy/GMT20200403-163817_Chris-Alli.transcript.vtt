Chris Alliman MD: All right. Why did you get started on the oxy codeine pills in high school.

57
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:17.430
Jeremy Lujan: I don't know, just reframing my friends and getting offered it and I never really liked that stuff because I've seen my sister were on and she was always honest. I even used to throw your clothes away and find them and

58
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.230
Jeremy Lujan: One day, just

59
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:32.040
Jeremy Lujan: Like with with some girls and a friend, they're doing learn tabs and I am now for me a line. And I guess they did it just, just to be calling from the chicks. Exactly. I don't know.

60
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.750
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, and I like this. I kept on doing it.

61
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.880
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, for some reason for some people it can also be an escape from depression or anxiety. Was that ever

62
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.830
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, that's a

63
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.330
Jeremy Lujan: big part of the reason I started getting anxiety in eighth grade and

64
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.200
Jeremy Lujan: When I think that's why I started liking them because it was helping with my anxiety.

65
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.780
Jeremy Lujan: I was getting it pretty bad.

66
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.640
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. Gotcha. And for some people it's a family systems like just everybody in the family.

67
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.980
Chris Alliman MD: uses drugs and it's just normal for them.

68
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.750
Jeremy Lujan: Is that your situation. No, just my sister was the only one that did drugs.

69
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.650
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, she, it was the opiate use also

70
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:34.530
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, but she got off of him. She graduated. She was on the Methadone one just move to Suboxone and then she graduated from Suboxone she's cleaner.

71
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.050
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Good for her. That's great.

72
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.980
That's great. Yeah.

73
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.920
Chris Alliman MD: I'm all right.

74
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.800

Okay.

77
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.070
Chris Alliman MD: Now I did see that you were on Suboxone about a little over a year ago.

78
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.600
Chris Alliman MD: You had gotten Suboxone yeah

79
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.040
Yeah, how did they

80
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.200
Jeremy Lujan: Were good at first, for

81
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.780
Jeremy Lujan: Them and then I remember

82
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.000
Jeremy Lujan: I can't remember what happened when I stopped doing ozone. The methadone.

83
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.080
Jeremy Lujan: I think I was I got on the message on after that.

84
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.480
Jeremy Lujan: You're going to jail and how to kick the

85
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.110
Chris Alliman MD: Methadone

86
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.020
Jeremy Lujan: Oh yeah, he realized that the Methadone is rough to kick off so

87
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.520
Jeremy Lujan: I wouldn't get back up.

88
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.280
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, that can be a tough process. Absolutely.

89
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.910
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah.

90
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:46.590
Chris Alliman MD: Now after with in all of these like nine to 10 years of this going on. Have you gone to rehab or been in counseling.

91
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.940
Jeremy Lujan: Gone to group meetings.

92
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:57.060
Jeremy Lujan: I was going. I've been on Joe core before and I, they sent me to the men's recovery in Los Lunas

93
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:04.830
Jeremy Lujan: Six months. But I got turned over there for five months and they got terminated for having a cell phone.

94
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.480
Jeremy Lujan: Okay, with that.

95
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.400
Jeremy Lujan: Pretty much messed me up and

96
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.870
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, and so we

97
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.180
Chris Alliman MD: Actually when you were actually doing those programs. Did you find them to be helpful.

98
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:31.380
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, the men's recovery was really helpful, but we have got terminated. I, I was on probation and they sent me to jail for a whole year after that essentially provision being in jail kind of ruins that whole five months of rehab.

99
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.820
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, that makes it

100
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.500
Jeremy Lujan: Out of him about to hit the streets from injury coverage. I think I would have been good.

101
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.330
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, yeah, that would have been a nicer process for you.

102
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.590
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, I want

103
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.060
Chris Alliman MD: I want to switch gears just a little bit and get some of your history also

104
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.510
Chris Alliman MD: Do you have any allergies to medications.

105
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.880
Jeremy Lujan: Just amoxicillin.

106
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.100
Chris Alliman MD: And what happens with amoxicillin.

107
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.110
Jeremy Lujan: Break out with a hive.

108
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.640
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, do you take any medications regularly at this point.

109
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.410
Jeremy Lujan: No, nothing.

110
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:12.000
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Have you been diagnosed with any problems like diabetes or high blood pressure or hepatitis C.

111
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.460
Jeremy Lujan: Pepsi.

112
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:16.860
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

113
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.890
Chris Alliman MD: Have you been treated for Pepsi.

114
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.210
Jeremy Lujan: No, I haven't. I've been looking to do that though.

115
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.400
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. What town are you in

116
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:27.990
Jeremy Lujan: Santa Fe.

117
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.430
Chris Alliman MD: You live in Santa Fe.

118
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:37.320
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. Okay, so I know there are some groups up there that are treating hepatitis C, do you have a primary care doctor

119
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.660
Jeremy Lujan: Um, I don't know. That's a moment.

120
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:50.100
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, I would encourage you to start there. Hepatitis C is very, very treatable at this point. But the first step is getting a primary care doctor to get it worked out.

121
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.660
Jeremy Lujan: Okay. Do I get a primary doctor

122
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:09.330
Chris Alliman MD: Well basically I would say look online for primary care doctors in Santa Fe, or family medicine or or internal medicine, any of that and and also check with your insurance and see who's covered by your insurance.

123
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.670
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, that

124
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.730
Chris Alliman MD: Insurance is probably a good way to go that way you make sure that you're getting someone that's covered

125
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:24.330
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Yeah. Any other diagnoses that you have besides the hep C anxiety and

126
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.310
Chris Alliman MD: Opioid Use

127
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.850
Jeremy Lujan: No, no, that's it. Okay.

128
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.330
Chris Alliman MD: Sounds good. Any surgeries at any point

129
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.080
Jeremy Lujan: surgery on my ankle and I broke a one time. It's been a long time ago.

130
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.840
Chris Alliman MD: What year vaguely. I don't need to know

131
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.410
Jeremy Lujan: Exactly 2012 maybe

132
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.210
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, and which ankle.

133
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.580

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.510
Chris Alliman MD: And any other surgeries.

136
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.360
Jeremy Lujan: No. No other surgeries.

137
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.850
Chris Alliman MD: All right. Do you smoke tobacco.

138
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.150
Chris Alliman MD: Yes. How much do you smoke.

144
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.400
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, I think getting getting a stable on the Suboxone and then working at the tobacco be a lot of sense. Don't

148
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.530
Jeremy Lujan: No I don't drink.

149
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.480
Chris Alliman MD: Ever had an alcohol problem.

Chris Alliman MD: How old is your son.

171
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.500
Jeremy Lujan: He's for

172
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:19.560
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. The reason I asked about that is because Suboxone when you use Suboxone the residue that gets on your fingers and residue around your mouth. The residue in your in your mouth and the residue on the film packaging is enough to kill a kid. If they lick it.

173
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.900
Jeremy Lujan: Okay, it'll

174
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.960
Chris Alliman MD: It'll cause them to overdose and cause them to stop breathing.

175
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.720
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah.

176
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:35.550
Chris Alliman MD: So when you use the Suboxone and we'll get you a prescription today, and I'll also send in a prescription for Narcan for the nasal spray

177
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.420
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, you'll need to have one of those at home, there'll be lots of refills. So if you use it, you go get another one.

178
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:49.410
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. And if you use it also call 911 immediately. Okay. Okay.

179
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.560
Chris Alliman MD: Not forbid something happens to your son. We don't want

180
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.110
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, I'll make sure that

181
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.500
Chris Alliman MD: But you want to keep the Suboxone out of his reach.

182
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.750
Chris Alliman MD: You don't want, you want to make sure when you're done you wash your hands. Well, wash your mouth. Well,

183
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.580
Chris Alliman MD: Rinse out your mouth and then the package needs to be thrown out outside

191
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.480
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. Fair enough, fair enough.

192
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.380

Chris Alliman MD: Okay, how much do you know about our program.

196
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:56.220
Jeremy Lujan: The fire department. This lady from the fire department, she

197
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.920
Jeremy Lujan: recommended me to it and she came in explained

198
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.410
Jeremy Lujan: To me like pretty much the guys help with

199
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.590
Jeremy Lujan: To get on the subs or to get like towns thing treatment.

200
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.140
Jeremy Lujan: She was explaining all that

201
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.000
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah.

202
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:29.430
Chris Alliman MD: Good, so I'm going to get you a prescription for Suboxone today and we'll talk about how to get started on that. It's a little tricky since you've been currently using heroin. We got to work through that a little bit. So we'll talk more in

203
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.810
Chris Alliman MD: The end, we'll get set up.

204
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.670
Jeremy Lujan: With our program.

205
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:47.400
Chris Alliman MD: We require a couple things. One, we require a weekly group check in where I'm there. The therapist is there and several patients are there. Also, it's on zoom just like we're doing today. Okay.

206
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:53.250
Chris Alliman MD: But we'll have to figure out which group will work out well for you and for your time.

207
00:14:53.310 --> 00:15:00.030
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, this. The second thing that we have is, you have an individual counseling appointment every week.

208
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.500
Jeremy Lujan: Okay.

209
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.280
Chris Alliman MD: So there are two meetings, a week, a group visit and a counseling visit

210
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:23.640
Chris Alliman MD: We start a prescription. Well, the prescriptions for the first month, there are two prescriptions. A week one to get you from group to therapy and then after you attend therapy. I hear about that from the therapist, and I do a prescription to get you back to group time

211
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:24.960
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

212
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:44.700
Chris Alliman MD: The reason for this is that we want people have to go to group Suboxone helps to keep those withdrawals away but there the therapy helps with the mental aspect of the the addiction and helping me that because we want to get you off the Suboxone. We don't want you on that forever.

213
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.480
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

214
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.330
Jeremy Lujan: Make sense. Yeah, it does.

215
00:15:48.690 --> 00:16:01.470
Chris Alliman MD: Good. Now after the first month if you show that you've been attending and participating and doing well. Then we start to space out those prescriptions to more like weekly or whatnot. So it's a little easier on you.

216
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.200
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, so we got to work that route.

217
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.450
Chris Alliman MD: So I've got a bunch more questions, but we'll get to all of that here at the end. OK.

218
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.580
Jeremy Lujan: OK. OK, cool.

219
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.550

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.540

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.340

225
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:36.150
Chris Alliman MD: All right, I have some yes or no questions for you. Okay, we're going to be thinking about during the time that you've been using heroin to kind of answer these questions.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.720

314
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:50.010
Chris Alliman MD: Okay, I'm kind of hard to do. Right. But I've been watching you, and you've been resting comfortably. So I'm putting down to normal respiration rate of 18

315
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:51.330
Jeremy Lujan: Okay.

316
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.800

324
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.260
Chris Alliman MD: And during those six seconds. I want you to count the number of pulses.

325
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:17.610

Chris Alliman MD: So we got nine there's that's going to be a pulse of 90

333
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:40.200
Jeremy Lujan: Okay.

334
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.910
Chris Alliman MD: All right. Now, the other part that I need. And I see you're in the car. So this will be a little bit hard

335
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.180
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah.

336
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.150

338
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.310
Chris Alliman MD: And let me know if you have any pains as you push

339
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.870
Jeremy Lujan: No good.

340
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.520
Chris Alliman MD: All right, so that's about the extent that we can do for the physical exam. Okay.

341
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.120
Jeremy Lujan: Okay.

342
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.200
All right.

343
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.590
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so

344
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.090
Chris Alliman MD: We need to figure out the Suboxone process for you.

345
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:16.530
Jeremy Lujan: Okay.

346
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.520
Chris Alliman MD: Right. So you use heroin last this morning.

347
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:21.720
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah.

348
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.910
Chris Alliman MD: Have you started to go into withdrawals.

349
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.030
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, I

350
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.120
Jeremy Lujan: Want to like this afternoon or

351
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.810
Tonight.

352
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:38.910
Chris Alliman MD: So generally Suboxone if you take it too early, it'll kick you into severe withdrawals, it'll

353
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.710
Chris Alliman MD: fly out the heroin and

354
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:42.960
Chris Alliman MD: Make your really super sick.

355
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.760
Jeremy Lujan: Right corner. Yeah.

356
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.860
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah. So what we want to do is wait till you're in moderate withdrawals.

357
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.300
Chris Alliman MD: Not early withdrawals.

358
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:58.650
Chris Alliman MD: But also not where you're feeling so horrible and having diarrhea like crazy doubled over perhaps we don't want to wait for

359
00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:58.980
That

360
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.110
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah.

361
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.980
Chris Alliman MD: So we want you in moderate withdrawals where you're getting some

362
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:05.970
Chris Alliman MD: Stomach cramping.

363
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.950
Chris Alliman MD: Feeling, you know, sometimes. Yeah.

364
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.080
Chris Alliman MD: You might have the

365
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.840
Jeremy Lujan: Chills and goosebumps. Yeah, maybe a little bit of sweating.

366
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.760
Chris Alliman MD: Right, and that's when we want you to start taking the Suboxone

367
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.170
Jeremy Lujan: Okay.

368
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:31.980

Chris Alliman MD: Okay and I'm going to have them change that on your profile.

376
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.020
Chris Alliman MD: Because this stuff should be going to you, not your mom.

377
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.850
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, I don't know how her email even got on there like, I don't know.

378
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.700
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, it's really weird.

379
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.640
Chris Alliman MD: So I'll get that worked out. And I'm going to send you these instructions that we're now going to talk through. Okay.

380
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:09.540
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

381
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:16.230
Chris Alliman MD: The instructions will be very simplified on the bottle at the pharmacy, because there's way too much for them to print on the bottle.

382
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.410
Chris Alliman MD: Yeah, so I'm getting email you these instructions.

383
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:20.250
Chris Alliman MD: Alright.

384
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.560
Chris Alliman MD: Alright, so the way you go do it.

385
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.840
Chris Alliman MD: When you're in moderate withdrawals. You take one film of Suboxone

386
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.100
Okay.

387
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:39.870
Chris Alliman MD: And then, about half an hour later if you feel like you need it. You can take an I'm sorry one to two hours later if you feel like you need it. You can take half another film.

388
00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.100
Jeremy Lujan: Okay.

389
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:45.870
Chris Alliman MD: And then three to four hours later, again, if you need it. You can take another half of film.

390
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.990
Chris Alliman MD: Okay. All right, that's it for the day.

391
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:50.520
Jeremy Lujan: On the

392
00:25:50.790 --> 00:26:06.510
Chris Alliman MD: Second day. You start with whatever you took the first day. So if you only took one film. And that's all you needed the first day that's what you start with the second day, but in that first day if you needed to take two films, then that's what you start with the second day

393
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.410
Chris Alliman MD: Okay.

394
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.570
Jeremy Lujan: Does that make sense. Yeah.

395
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.160
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, that makes sense.

396
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:19.110
Chris Alliman MD: And then again, two to four hours later, you can take half a film and then two to four hours after that you can take another half of film again.

397
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:20.040
Only if you need to.

398
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:21.570
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah.

399
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.320
Chris Alliman MD: On day three, you take the total from day to. So again, if that was one film on day two, and

400
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:35.070
Chris Alliman MD: That's all you needed the whole day that's what you take on day three, but if you need it. All three films, then you start with that. On day three.

401
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.020
Chris Alliman MD: But there's no other extra half of film.

402
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.280
Jeremy Lujan: Yeah, that's good.

403
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.790
Jeremy Lujan: People that actually take three of them anytime

404
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:45.900

405
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:46.350

406
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.610

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:51.840

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:53.580
