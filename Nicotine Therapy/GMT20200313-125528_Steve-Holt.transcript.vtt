Steve Holtsford: lesson on how it works. It really is effective. And the reason it's effective is it goes to that same receptor in your brain where the heroin goes

165
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:26.280
Steve Holtsford: And it and it does stimulate the receptor, but it doesn't stimulate it as much as heroin, but it stimulates it enough to take care of the withdrawal symptoms and the cravings.

166
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.050
Galaxy A20: And okay

167
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:37.290
Steve Holtsford: And the nice thing about it is it is it sits on that receptor for a long time. So, you know, in terms of

168
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:48.000
Steve Holtsford: You know you probably use several times a day and you know and and whenever you're not using your thinking about how to how to

169
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.700
Steve Holtsford: You know, get the next bed in it and sort of your, your mind becomes

170
00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:03.990
Steve Holtsford: Obsessed with with using and and getting ready to us again and and it makes it hard to sort of

171
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.630
Steve Holtsford: live a normal life.

172
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.220
Steve Holtsford: And

173
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.090
Steve Holtsford: With the

174
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.260
Steve Holtsford: With the yeah with with the Suboxone or buprenorphine.

175
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:33.240
Steve Holtsford: All the withdrawal symptoms are are taking care of that medication is on that receptor taking care of the withdrawal symptoms and it's on there for a long time. You only have you only have to take it once or twice a day, and it has what

176
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.570
Steve Holtsford: Half Life, which is which is the amount of time it takes for half of it to be metabolized is

177
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.520
Steve Holtsford: 24 to 36 hours.

178
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:53.340
Steve Holtsford: So it really, you know, it takes several days for it to be out of your system. So, so if you take it everyday as as you're supposed to

179
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:59.160
Steve Holtsford: It's all it's always there and you don't have to worry about withdrawal symptoms. You don't have to worry about cravings.

180
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.390
Galaxy A20: And the other

181
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.980
Steve Holtsford: The other nice thing about it, Sonia, is that

182
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:15.960
Steve Holtsford: Wallet wallet is on that receptor and it stimulates it not as much as heroin. It sticks in that receptor really hard. Like it doesn't let

183
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.320
Steve Holtsford: On that receptor in your brain. So, so if you're on.

184
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:35.730
Steve Holtsford: buprenorphine and you run into an old friend, and they've they've, they've got some some heroin and you're like, Okay, what the heck. I've been good. You'd be wasting your money.

185
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.690
Steve Holtsford: Because, because the heroin wouldn't be able to get to the receptor.

186
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:41.550
Galaxy A20: Okay.

187
00:19:41.610 --> 00:20:04.410
Steve Holtsford: That's kind of and then even the next day, say, your friends, you run another friend, the next day and you're like okay, and it's still there. Take your buprenorphine so you, you know, in order to use, you would have to wait three full days and then and and if you're if you're in recovery.

188
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:06.690
Steve Holtsford: You know, in those three days.

189
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:19.590
Steve Holtsford: You know, you should you should call me. You should call bright heart health, you should you should call a friend, you should take a wall those other things rather than then could you know relapse.

190
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.450
Galaxy A20: Okay.

191
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.670
Steve Holtsford: That's, that's kind of the, the

192
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:39.450
Steve Holtsford: the nuts and bolts of it, it's a it's a medication that that prevents withdrawal and cravings and then it also blocks the receptor from heroin getting on it so

193
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.230
Steve Holtsford: That's kind of how the how the medication works.

194
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.280
Galaxy A20: Okay. Sounds good to me.

195
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.610
Steve Holtsford: Yeah, yeah. So the only thing

196
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.580
Steve Holtsford: Sonia is is that

197
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.520
Steve Holtsford: You in order to start the medication. You have to be in

198
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.050
Steve Holtsford: Uncomfortable with brawl like you are in an advanced battle.

199
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:10.710
Steve Holtsford: Okay, so, because if you don't, then you'll take the the

200
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:18.030
Steve Holtsford: Suboxone it will go to that receptor and it will kick off the heroin.

201
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:24.390
Steve Holtsford: And then not stimulated as much as the heroin and you'll and you'll feel worse.

202
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.940
Steve Holtsford: You see what I mean.

203
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.230
Galaxy A20: Yes.

204
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:35.790
Steve Holtsford: So some people, some people will tell you, Oh yeah, I took took Suboxone and made me feel horrible. That's because they took it too soon.

205
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.780
Steve Holtsford: Okay, so, so you

206
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.010
Steve Holtsford: Basically, let me just ask you this. If

207
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.490
Steve Holtsford: Do you have an idea.

208
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.000
Steve Holtsford: You know, if you last few years yesterday.

209
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.290
Steve Holtsford: When when today would have probably be today when you start to feel really bad.

210
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.030
Steve Holtsford: Or do you

211
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.650
Steve Holtsford: Wait, okay,

212
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.540
Galaxy A20: Wait a day. Yes.

213
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.170
Okay.

214
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.710
Steve Holtsford: Because you know if

215
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:22.860
Steve Holtsford: If 10 were the worst withdrawal imaginable, and zero was no withdraw, you should probably be a four or five or six before you take of buprenorphine.

216
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.110
Steve Holtsford: Okay, okay.

217
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.080
Steve Holtsford: Do you know what about what time you might be a four or five or six

218
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.460
Galaxy A20: Then I started getting sick.

219
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:40.890
Galaxy A20: Yeah yeah I'm about to say about two, three.

220
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.040
Galaxy A20: This afternoon, yes.

221
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:58.380
Steve Holtsford: Okay. Okay. All right. So if it. So yeah, I wanted to be feel pretty darn shitty when you take that buprenorphine because then, then it will help you a lot, because if you take

222
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.180
Steve Holtsford: If you take it too early, you know that you know it's not dangerous.

223
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:11.280
Steve Holtsford: You know, it's not. It won't hurt you but it, but it makes you feel bad. And that's exactly what we don't want to have

224
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.720
Steve Holtsford: We want you to to get to feel better after the medication. Yeah.

225
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.120
Galaxy A20: Right, okay, out of the state.

226
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.560
Steve Holtsford: And and then

227
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:33.180
Steve Holtsford: You know, you just dissolve under your tongue like you didn't have the, er, you know, just let it sit there. Don't talk don't drink. Don't swallow and just let it sort of

228
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:44.550
Steve Holtsford: Dissolve over you know everybody's different. But it's at least five minutes really you just let it, let it sit there and and dissolve.

229
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:45.780
Galaxy A20: And work.

230
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.370
Galaxy A20: Work.

231
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.210

Galaxy A20: I'm getting this stuff.

255
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:06.990
Right.

256
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.690
Galaxy A20: It's time. Right.

257
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:09.990
It's

258
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.210
Galaxy A20: Yeah.

259
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.540
Steve Holtsford: It's time. Let's do it.

260
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.680
Galaxy A20: Yes, I'm ready. I'm ready to do it for real.

261
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.930
Steve Holtsford: Alright, let's see. And you've got eight

262
00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.230
Steve Holtsford: I know you have you've had no recent hospitalizations besides that ER visit

263
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.130
Galaxy A20: Man No, I should don't

264
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.110
Steve Holtsford: Okay.

265
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.950
Steve Holtsford: All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna try

266
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.040
Steve Holtsford: When you were in the ER. Did you have a tablet or a film.

267
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:21.750
A tablet.

268
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.080
Steve Holtsford: And was that. Okay. Did you

269
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.930
Galaxy A20: Yes. Did that think that's better than

270
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.370
Steve Holtsford: The film. Yes, sir.

271
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.950
Steve Holtsford: Okay. All right. I know none of them taste good, but

272
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.120
Right.

273
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.400
Steve Holtsford: Alright.

274
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:49.380
Steve Holtsford: So I think the the the typical dose Sonia is at least to start is is is eight milligrams in the morning.

275
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.560
Steve Holtsford: And eight milligrams in the evening.

276
00:27:53.250 --> 00:28:00.150
Steve Holtsford: Okay, that I would, I would say 80% of the people you know that's usually the starting dose.

277
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.780
Steve Holtsford: And we can and we can stay in touch and make sure that that that is a good dose.

278
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:08.700
Steve Holtsford: For you.

279
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:20.250
Steve Holtsford: There, there are other medications. Did you, did they discharge you from the ER with any other medications.

280
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.540
Steve Holtsford: They all

281
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:26.250
Galaxy A20: Day is some kind of pump. They gave me, just in case that over deep

282
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.050
Galaxy A20: Plan.

283
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.960
Galaxy A20: I'm not planning on doing it so

284
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.030
Steve Holtsford: No, no. Yeah, that was Narcan okay

285
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.860
Steve Holtsford: But that's always good to have on hand.

286
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.860
Steve Holtsford: It's always it's always good to have on hand, you know, really. Everybody should carry that in their purse, just in case, because you

287
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.300
Steve Holtsford: You never know, you might be. You might be at the store and somebody needs it. So,

288
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.340
Galaxy A20: That's always good.

289
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.230
Steve Holtsford: It's always good to have

290
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.000
Galaxy A20: Okay, okay.

291
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.440
