Dr Katrina Groves: Pretend I'm a new doctor and I don't know your story tell me from the beginning when you started having issues with substances, was it, you know, eight years old with alcohol or nine years old with pot or just kind of take me through your, your history.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.220
Charles Clausing: Probably like

21
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.400
Damn.

22
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.070
Charles Clausing: I started smoking weed and like, and that was the first thing in like, fuck. Sorry. In

23
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.610
Charles Clausing: When I was like 1413 or 1413

24
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.340
Charles Clausing: And then I went to I smoke weed whatever I drink from that age as well. So it was pot and lead at 14

25
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.380
Charles Clausing: And

26
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.960
Charles Clausing: Math was after that that was like 15 to

27
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.690
Charles Clausing: Age 15 to

28
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.570
Charles Clausing: Almost 19

29
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.370
Charles Clausing: And that was like almost like an everyday thing.

30
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.470
Charles Clausing: But there will be points where I would stop like doing math for a while.

31
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.260
Charles Clausing: For like, you know, a month or two and then I would just go back to it, but it was like pretty much steady that whole time.

32
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:21.180
Charles Clausing: And then it maintain I got into like research chemicals like they altered the drug by like one carbon atom or whatever. And then it's legal, and they can sell it online. It's like a gray area.

33
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow.

34
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.740
Charles Clausing: But I got into those really bad.

35
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.790
Charles Clausing: That was like 19 and then I got into heroin right after that.

36
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.190
Charles Clausing: And then I stopped doing that at like age, I did it for a year, about, about a year.

37
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.650
Charles Clausing: Year and some change.

38
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.360
Charles Clausing: And that, that's pretty much it.

39
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.650
Dr Katrina Groves: And then during that time. Did you ever feel like GI I want out. I want to quit or were you just happy as a clam through all that

40
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.380
Charles Clausing: Throughout all of it.

41
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:09.000
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. During all you're used to Jerry feel like, wow, I'm in trouble. I should get some help, or go into detox or

42
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.010
Charles Clausing: Um,

43
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.850
Charles Clausing: Well for heroin. Yeah, but everything else. I was like I was good.

44
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:27.270
Charles Clausing: To go anywhere like for method. I mean, I still smoke and drink every once in a while, but for method I didn't

45
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.280
Charles Clausing: Do any inpatient things or anything like that.

46
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.200

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.800
Charles Clausing: Yeah, I needed to join the Suboxone group.

49
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Did you do any other before you came to us. Did you do any detox any place else or groups or rehabs

Dr Katrina Groves: I don't see any other

59
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:35.790

60
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.610
Dr Katrina Groves: But you haven't taken that in a long time.

61
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.870
Charles Clausing: No, I haven't taken that for quite a few months. Good.

62
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.550
Dr Katrina Groves: What do you think your anxiety was about and why is it better.

63
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:55.110
Charles Clausing: I don't know, really, I just felt like I was just blowing up issues that I didn't need to.

64
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:07.980
Charles Clausing: And there was just overthinking stuff and that I get to, and I, I realized I couldn't control a lot of it so might as well just live with it.

65
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.540
Dr Katrina Groves: That's really good, especially in today's environment, right, like we can't control the virus. So he has just one to live with it.

66
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:28.680
Charles Clausing: Right. I've been thinking like I've been at my house or at my apartment with my girlfriend and where I just like I just keep pacing around. And I'm like, fuck, I need to take an advantage or like, you know, I'm just like, do I really

67
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.780
Charles Clausing: But I have like, especially now like

68
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.190
Charles Clausing: I'm sure you're going to get to that. But I've been having cravings lately for like for math not opiates. Okay.

69
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Go ahead and tell me about that right now.

70
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:50.490
Charles Clausing: I just feel like, because I have unlimited time on my hands, but I still have responsibility, so I can't you know

71
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.250
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. So what happened and limited time. You mean, you're not working right now.

72
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:04.620
Charles Clausing: Yeah, I asked for a month off of work because my parents are elderly, my dad 72 and my mom 60

73
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.790
Charles Clausing: And they both have varying health issues.

74
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:17.100
Dr Katrina Groves: So you're still living with them and then do you see

75
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.630
Dr Katrina Groves: The foresee that in the future.

76
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.180
Charles Clausing: Um, we might move out of our apartment, just because of how things are right now.

77
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:34.320
Charles Clausing: Because this is her first day working in a month, almost like this is her first day back at work. That's why I'm here because she likes me to watch our kid here.

78
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.760
Charles Clausing: And I like to bring them here to

79
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.130
Charles Clausing: Let them see my parents.

80
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.660
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, of course.

81
00:08:46.050 --> 00:09:04.860
Dr Katrina Groves: So yeah, with the virus and it's come up a lot in different groups as far as how long this goes on and how, how do we restructure our lives because this may not just be coming and going in a few weeks. You know, this may be here for months and

82
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.060
Dr Katrina Groves: And

83
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.820
Dr Katrina Groves: Have you thought about, you know, long term.

84
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:22.380
Dr Katrina Groves: Maybe your parents are probably are they okay on their own. Can they live on their own and just have people drop food and stuff at their door and and isolate them.

85
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.550
Yeah.

86
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.690
Charles Clausing: Yeah, I think so.

87
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:40.860
Dr Katrina Groves: I worry about, like you said when you don't have a job and you don't have anything to do. And then you've got your brain going, it can be pretty hard not to go use it brings up all those triggers.

88
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.420
Charles Clausing: It really does.

89
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:44.640
Charles Clausing: What

90
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.410
Dr Katrina Groves: What are you doing now besides pacing the room to get your brain out of there.

91
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.430
Charles Clausing: By just play with my sign or just hanging out with people.

92
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.410
Dr Katrina Groves: That's a good one.

93
00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:05.430
Charles Clausing: Because I knew, I knew if I was high. I couldn't be able to do that. Like, I would just want to do something else or like my main priority. You want to be my son.

94
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.270

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:37.260
Charles Clausing: arrested for domestic violence or whatever it was just a hair pulling match. I mean, I'm not downplaying it shouldn't have happened. But our one of our neighbors, called the police. So, of course, they had do something about it.

101
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.040

160
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:32.580
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so why don't I have you joined this Monday night at 530 ish. It's the same routine, you get on the virtual clinic and they takes a while to check people in and we have like quite a few people tomorrow.

161
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:45.960
Dr Katrina Groves: So if I were you. Do what you did today, get on like half an hour sooner than you need to plug in your phone, go do something else come back, you know, around 545 is when the group starts

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:48.810

166
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.410
Dr Katrina Groves: Right, okay.

167
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:14.220
Dr Katrina Groves: And what I'll do is then I'll prescribe your medications on that day so that we get the day that your meds are prescribed is the day that you're seeing in the clinic.

168
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:21.690
Dr Katrina Groves: Or in in Bret Hart. So are you still seeing, Tony. Are you going to their groups.

169
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.050
Charles Clausing: Every once in a while. I haven't gone for like two or three weeks.

170
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:34.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, I know they're not in person, but she's got video ones going on. Did you know about that.

171
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.170
Charles Clausing: No, I haven't. No, no, no. I didn't know about that.

Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

174
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.460
Dr Katrina Groves: So Facebook HER AND SAY, TONY Hey, I heard that you've got groups.

175
00:16:50.790 --> 00:17:03.600
Dr Katrina Groves: Because I think right now, when people are really isolated and everybody's got a lot of virus questions. It's really good to keep track of each other. It helps your recovery a lot to be connected instead of just isolated in your own head.

176
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:11.250
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. So if you can reach out to Tony and do some groups with her during the week.

Charles Clausing: Know,

215
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:13.500
Dr Katrina Groves: Some people at home that they're getting there. They get some weights at home, they start lifting try to think of things you can do around the house that you can set up like a routine for yourself like you would at the gym. Would that be something that you would be able to do or

216
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:21.390
Charles Clausing: Yeah, I mean, that could be like that could also be something for me and my girlfriend to do is really struggling to find stuff.

217
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.090
Charles Clausing: So maybe we can make something

218
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, I like that. That's a good idea.

219
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.200
Dr Katrina Groves: So any trouble with constant

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.340

224
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:52.410
Charles Clausing: Know, I have a little cough, but I don't have a sore throat right now. That was like when I was sick.

225
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.720
Charles Clausing: With the ship. Yeah.

226
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.970
Dr Katrina Groves: And in any chest pain or pressure or heart palpitations.

227
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.500
Charles Clausing: Now,

228
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.650
Charles Clausing: I have been noticing one thing at night.

229
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.780
Charles Clausing: When I lay down

230
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:18.450
Charles Clausing: Sometimes it. I can't tell if it's my lungs or if it's my stomach. It feels like something's rumbling right right about like it like top of my rib cage.

231
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.820
Charles Clausing: Um, my ribcage. Like I just can't tell what it is.

232
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.210
Dr Katrina Groves: Is it her like like heartburn.

233
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:34.680
Charles Clausing: No, it doesn't hurt. It just rumbles in like it feels like it's vibrating is weird.

234
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.160
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, but you're not short of breath with it and you're not like your heart's not pounding out of your chest or anything.

235
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.840
Charles Clausing: No, nothing like that.

236
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.580
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. Okay. Are you eating late at night. Right, right. Before you lay down

237
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:48.600
Yeah.

238
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.570
Dr Katrina Groves: That's time try not to do that.

239
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.770
Charles Clausing: I know it's like one of my biggest things I know it's really bad to do

240
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:56.850
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

241
00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:58.530
Dr Katrina Groves: It is hard because

242
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:09.150
Dr Katrina Groves: It's making your stomach. You take this big wad of food and then you're dumping it in there and then you're laying down and so your stomach is wanting to sleep, not to have to digest all that food so

243
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.530
Charles Clausing: Right, right.

244
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.180
Charles Clausing: Yeah, my girlfriend always using cracker used to give me crap about it.

245
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:15.900
Dr Katrina Groves: As

246
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:29.760
Dr Katrina Groves: Much anymore. Yeah, well you know you're an adult, you're going to do it, you're going to do, but you might feel better if you try to drop the amount of food you're eating a little bit and and wait another hour stay up and watch a movie or play a video game some

247
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:38.340
Dr Katrina Groves: So besides that, do you have any vomiting with it or nausea or constipation or diarrhea.

248
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.120
Charles Clausing: Um, no, no. Any

249
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.340
Dr Katrina Groves: Any blood in your stool when you poop.

250
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:45.390
Know,

251
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.080
Dr Katrina Groves: Any tremors or seizures.

252
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:50.850
Charles Clausing: Oh, no.

253
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.360
Dr Katrina Groves: And do you get vertigo dizziness or headaches.

254
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.460
Charles Clausing: No.

255
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:03.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. And how's your mental status, other than the cravings, like you said, do you feel what's your mood like

256
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.360
Charles Clausing: I'm good. I think I feel good.

257
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.350
Charles Clausing: Okay. So, wait, wait, sorry.

258
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Not depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts.

259
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.380
Charles Clausing: Um, little bit of anxiety. Every once in a while, I

260
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.440
Charles Clausing: Just because everything going on but

261
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.110
Charles Clausing: Right, I haven't had like

262
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.240
Dr Katrina Groves: You haven't had a panic attack.

263
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.200
Charles Clausing: Yeah, I haven't had anything like that in a while.

264
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:52.020
Dr Katrina Groves: And what are your coping skills you remember from Tony's groups about anxiety. I mean, you're probably already doing them and you don't know it. Like, what do you do to get out of that space in your head.

265
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.490
Charles Clausing: Oh,

266
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.470
Charles Clausing: I tried to take my mind off like I just switch my

267
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.770
Charles Clausing: Focus and

268
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.440
Charles Clausing: I don't know, I just

269
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.550
Charles Clausing: I breathed sometimes like good

270
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.510
Charles Clausing: Do you do used to come in and talk to us right

271
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.980
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, Rick.

272
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:16.920
Charles Clausing: Yeah.

273
00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:33.720
Charles Clausing: He showed us a breathing exercise that actually helps like I was making fun of it in there. Yeah, I got you know I didn't take it serious and I had something had been labeled in through the nose, out through the mouth. No.

274
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.440
And that helped

275
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:46.620
Dr Katrina Groves: That stuff helps. We did. That's great. Um, do you still work on your coins. Your. How is that hobby going

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.590
Dr Katrina Groves: Copper magnet.

282
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:11.610
Right.

283
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.790
Charles Clausing: I wish I was a silver magnet.

284
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.230
Charles Clausing: Silver is not magnetic or neither is copper so

285
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:23.160
Dr Katrina Groves: True. It's not okay, I get the point.

286
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:24.930
Dr Katrina Groves: You get it.

287
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:27.180
Charles Clausing: All right.

Dr Katrina Groves: As far as how bright hurts going to work.

290
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:48.360
Charles Clausing: A lot of them were answered in group because I thought that I wasn't going to have you as a doctor, I knew I was going to have you as a doctor, but I didn't know that I didn't want to see a bunch of random people

291
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:58.410
Charles Clausing: But then they told me that it's all going to be Tiffany I think it was Tiffany Borden who is like random people. What are you talking about

292
00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:09.900
Charles Clausing: Like what, and then she said how everyone can group is going to be our Tony took over and told me how everyone in group that I see now is going to be in the online ones.

293
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.100
Dr Katrina Groves: So, exactly.

294
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.720

Dr Katrina Groves: Please do Facebook Tony today. Your homework is two things, Facebook, Tony and find out when are the meetings that she's having because she's doing them like Tuesday. I don't know what her days are

298
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:44.160
Dr Katrina Groves: And then me you'll see me on Monday at 530 ish come early and then that's when I'll do your prescription what pharmacy. Are you at the trials in case I forget to ask

300
00:26:53.670 --> 00:27:02.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, it's hard for me to know I'll just probably do CVS and then if they don't have it, you'll have to call Tony and tell her to switch it or something.

301
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.010
Dr Katrina Groves: Right. How often are they out

302
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.540

Dr Katrina Groves: Tell them for sure you want to do the clinic not Sutter coast hospital and have them. They'll send over an order for you to get your blood drawn and it's just routine stuff like I haven't. I did it on you when you first came in, I think,

Dr Katrina Groves: So you're likely not to have too much trouble but

313
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:09.630
Dr Katrina Groves: It's good to just do that and then they're going to send you a urine cup in the mail. So, give them a mailing address if you don't want it to go to your parents. I don't know what to open

314
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:15.150
Dr Katrina Groves: It. It'll be a discrete package and when you get it, you call them up and you say, hey, I've got the urine.

315
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:26.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Then they'll explain to you how to do it. Don't just open it yourself because they want to be able to show you and and have you on camera while you're doing it. And you don't have to pee in front of them.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.660

382
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:35.070
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm sorry about last time I guess there was some kind of glitch so

383
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.350
Tamara Von mauw: What I found out is when it comes to this phone to get this video through

384
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.520
Tamara Von mauw: I have turned

385
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:50.880
Tamara Von mauw: Completely off and then turn it back on and then not don't touch it or do anything to it until after this is over with and then went through.

386
00:34:52.050 --> 00:35:05.490
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, we got it. So this is just an intake process and it's like you're going to have to pretend like I'm a new doctor I don't only think about you. So I'm going to ask questions that I already know, but I have to ask you, anyway. Okay.

387
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.780
Tamara Von mauw: No problem.

388
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:16.770
Dr Katrina Groves: And we're going to start from the beginning, which is like, how old were you when you first started using any substance at all like

389
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:26.130
Tamara Von mauw: When I was about six or about 15 or 16 I started drinking became an alcoholic. By the time I was 20

390
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:47.430
Tamara Von mauw: And drugs started them when I was about 21 and was doing cocaine then started doing math still drinking and then I'm when I was about 2022

391
00:35:48.210 --> 00:36:02.490
Tamara Von mauw: I stopped drinking and stopped doing cocaine, but I kept doing the math. And I did that until about 10 years ago. And then I stopped that. And I haven't touched it since.

392
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:05.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow 10 years clean. That's great.

393
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:15.180
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, and I did it on my own. I wasn't a snorter are a smoker of it. Some people that smoke it or that put it in the veins.

394
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:25.710
Tamara Von mauw: They become more immune are more addicted to it. Then I started it, and I never had any withdrawal symptoms at all getting off of it. I just had to stay away from the people who did it.

395
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.360
Tamara Von mauw: And I was fine.

396
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.510
Dr Katrina Groves: So when, when did the pills come into play.

397
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.890
Tamara Von mauw: That I was about 30

398
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:41.880
Tamara Von mauw: I will know what yeah I was in my late 30s, probably around 38

399
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:42.960
Tamara Von mauw: Was I when

400
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.370
Dr Katrina Groves: I left the elevator.

401
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.950
Tamara Von mauw: Uh huh, or off the ladder.

402
00:36:47.280 --> 00:37:00.090
Tamara Von mauw: Ladder. Yeah, that's when I fell off the ladder and I did it for five years, maybe more, and when I got into your program is when I stopped.

403
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.610
Dr Katrina Groves: And and they had a confirmed a fracture of your spine.

404
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:15.030
Tamara Von mauw: Uh, I'm not sure if they did or not. It's like, I don't really have any back problems. I don't know where that came from.

405
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.720
Dr Katrina Groves: Lucky but falling off the ladder. What made them give you pain.

406
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.570
Tamara Von mauw: Oh I I broke my leg.

407
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.610

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:27.570
Tamara Von mauw: As they

410
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:33.540
Tamara Von mauw: They gave me only a week's worth, but unfortunately a week is all it takes to get hooked on those things.

411
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.080
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, which really sucks.

412
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.580
Dr Katrina Groves: And so you went from getting it from the doctor to getting it on the street.

413
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:42.540
Yeah.

414
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Did it ever put you in the hospital, like in withdrawals or

419
00:37:59.100 --> 00:37:59.670
Tamara Von mauw: That's it.

420
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.440

Dr Katrina Groves: Oh,

427
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.820
Tamara Von mauw: I went into detox. Then I spent a month in detox going through withdrawals and DTS.

428
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:32.550
Tamara Von mauw: Wow, I was a heavy drinker. I drink tequila. Like it was water and

429
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.480
Tamara Von mauw: I carried a flask with me everywhere. My mother called me a sober drunk.

430
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:44.640
Tamara Von mauw: Because I could be drunk or in a skunk and do everything perfectly, but when I sobered up my hands started shaking so bad and I got so sick. I couldn't do nothing.

431
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:50.610
Tamara Von mauw: But that was the only time I was in rehab the rest of the time is

432
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.490
Tamara Von mauw: I just did it on my own.

433
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:59.880
Dr Katrina Groves: And did rehab work for you. Like when you were 22 when you stopped alcohol. Was that the last time you drank.

434
00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:01.080

Tamara Von mauw: I don't like the taste of it anymore. And I don't like being drunk at it makes me dizzy kids like I didn't like it. So I tried a couple of hits or shots when i right after I got out of a detox, but it wasn't, it wasn't worth it. So I stopped.

441
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Detox worked. Yea.

442
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:32.970
Tamara Von mauw: Yea did

443
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.610
Dr Katrina Groves: So now you're on the sub self correct

444
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.630
Dr Katrina Groves: Yes, and the milligrams. Are they okay for you.

445
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:45.750
Tamara Von mauw: There. Perfect. I get 5.7 I think it is milligrams. Yeah.

446
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.790
Tamara Von mauw: And I'm take I have

447
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:57.390
Tamara Von mauw: My script is for two a day but I'm trying to cut back on. I'm so I'm taking one of those two breaking it and a half and only kicking one and a half of it.

448
00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.410
Dr Katrina Groves: How is that to break it in half. It's a crumbly kind of pill.

449
00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.130
Tamara Von mauw: No, it doesn't. Crumble at all. I can break it in half, no problem.

450
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.760
Dr Katrina Groves: But it's not scored right it doesn't have a line down the middle.

451
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.860
Tamara Von mauw: There's no score on it. Interesting.

452
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.500
Dr Katrina Groves: So the last time we talked or a few times before this, you are pretty stressed out.

453
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:24.270
Dr Katrina Groves: It was either pain or anxiety or depression and you actually wanted more and more and more as of self. So what has made

454
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.060
Dr Katrina Groves: The switch of you wanting less. Now what happened day

455
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:32.310
Tamara Von mauw: Typically, I'm Dr. Claw Pearson gave me my closet. Pam.

456
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:43.500
Tamara Von mauw: And I take a half a milligram or yeah it's one milligram I kick a half a milligram a day. And that's been helping with the anxiety and the depression.

457
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:49.230
Dr Katrina Groves: Great. I can't, I can't believe that happened. I mean, I can't believe he gave it to you.

458
00:40:49.920 --> 00:41:04.500
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah you did. I we made a deal that if I cut back on my absolved he would leave my inbox on the law or my calls Pam alone, but he's already cut me back from 27 to 25 and this

459
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.600
Tamara Von mauw: I get to keep my 25 but next month. We're going to cut back some more so.

460
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:18.300
Tamara Von mauw: Okay, I'm gonna try to talk to him and see if he'll let me just stay on it until I get off the subs all completely because

461
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:20.550
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

462
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:30.060
Tamara Von mauw: Because a lot of times you know i i just need it. It's like, I need my sub ball. I can feel the sickness coming on.

463
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.160
Tamara Von mauw: Right, yeah. I'm trying my best to just do the one and a half a day.

464
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:40.140
Dr Katrina Groves: That's really good. That's really good. And I think sometimes too.

465
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:53.640
Dr Katrina Groves: Especially with the virus thing and being isolated and having a lot of fear and worry now is not the best time really to try to taper people from things so

466
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.530
Dr Katrina Groves: That may like hold them that when he asked me when he said he was going to cut it back.

467
00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:13.410
Tamara Von mauw: I said, Could you please just leave it where it is for right now. I said, with all the crud going on. I'm still feeling really anxious and anxiety. So, and he said he weighed in a month before we cut back again, but I'm

468
00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:21.780
Tamara Von mauw: It's still going on. And I'm still isolated. It's like I, if I may have to talk him into letting me have a little

469
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.220
Tamara Von mauw: A little longer.

470
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:28.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Mm hmm. Okay. And and sub solve to you is kind of like a

471
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.780
Dr Katrina Groves: I mean, you may need it very low dose but but you're going to find that sweet spot, you know, eventually

472
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.860
Tamara Von mauw: What I'm looking for right now, if I take the one and a half.

473
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:50.160
Tamara Von mauw: Some days it works fine. And I have no problems and then other days, all of a sudden in the middle of the night I'll wake up and I'll have that nausea feeling

474
00:42:50.640 --> 00:43:03.390
Tamara Von mauw: I start getting the anxiety and feeling like I'm going to throw up. So I take one rule. The other half that I've saved for that day, I'll take that and brings it down to normal.

475
00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:12.360
Dr Katrina Groves: So I'm looking, I'm actually looking at your other computer screen, which is why I've got this one on the the Tonys computer

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.150
Dr Katrina Groves: Once a day.

489
00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:11.190
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, it wasn't working. It wasn't keeping the stomach problems away so he upped it and now I'm fine.

490
00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Good. And what about the

491
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.890

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:27.960
Tamara Von mauw: So you only need a couple

496
00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:38.370
Dr Katrina Groves: On nights, though, that when you have that bad anxiety that you just described to me and you're feeling horrible take an extra half or an extra one that's, that's when you want to use that

497
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:39.330
Tamara Von mauw: Okay.

498
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:45.450
Dr Katrina Groves: That will help sleep. So what about promethazine. Do you still use that for nausea or anxiety.

499
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:47.760
Tamara Von mauw: Do I use it for nausea.

500
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.100
Dr Katrina Groves: And how often are you taking that

501
00:44:50.460 --> 00:45:01.410
Tamara Von mauw: I'm probably at least four times a week. It's like I'm still figuring out what foods, I can eat that aren't going to mess my stomach up

502
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:02.460
Dr Katrina Groves: Right, like

503
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.800

504
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.780

505
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:16.440
Dr Katrina Groves: No, and the promethazine is 25 milligrams

506
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.160
Tamara Von mauw: Yes.

507
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.590
Dr Katrina Groves: And you take it once or twice.

508
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.730
Dr Katrina Groves: At one time.

509
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.270
Tamara Von mauw: One time, one at a time. Yeah. I never take more than one

510
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:35.370
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, I'm just getting through your med list here. What else we got looks like you had something for your colonoscopy or you had some kind of constipation problem.

511
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:44.760
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, it's not it's not constipation. I can go but my stool is really hard and like little golf balls.

512
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:49.020
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh dear. So have you ever taken just a stool softener like cold.

513
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.630
Tamara Von mauw: I can I take the mirror, relax.

514
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.280
Tamara Von mauw: When I need it.

515
00:45:54.060 --> 00:46:09.000
Dr Katrina Groves: What about a stool softener. So me relax is a laxative, it kind of pushes your stool through but colleagues is a softener so that it kind of makes it easier. It doesn't just come out like so harshly. So sometimes we all

516
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:10.470
Tamara Von mauw: Face so I can

517
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.250
Tamara Von mauw: Take those

518
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:19.170
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, I would add color to because otherwise, if you've got really rock hard poop. And if you're forcing it through your bowels, you're going to rip something so

519
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.930
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't already

520
00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.460
Tamara Von mauw: haven't gotten any blood yet. So we're okay.

521
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.780
Dr Katrina Groves: Good. Do you want a prescription for the stool softener. You said you had it.

522
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.840
Tamara Von mauw: I have some I have some in medicine cabinet.

523
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:53.370
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. Just take it like every day, every day because every time you take us up solve. It's going to slow down your gut. That's just how it works. OK, so now we got that out of the way. Um, let me go into your family history a little bit your father and mother still living.

524
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:58.560

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:32.310
Tamara Von mauw: She had already had three open heart surgeries. They wanted her to have another one. And she just couldn't do it anymore. She was old and she just said on done and she just went in their sleep.

534
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.200
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, that's a blessing.

535
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.300
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, that's what I was happy about.

536
00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:39.810
Dr Katrina Groves: So did she have diabetes as well.

537
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:40.500

Tamara Von mauw: She had a couple of the small strokes with the CIA's

541
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:53.850
Dr Katrina Groves: Mm hmm.

542
00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:07.680
Tamara Von mauw: She had a couple of those, but that went to the hospital took care of it. And they said she was fine, but that she that's when we found out she needed that fourth bypass surgery and she said no.

543

Dr Katrina Groves: Okay and so

544
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.640

547
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.310
Dr Katrina Groves: And your blood pressure's good

550
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:40.440
Tamara Von mauw: Didn't because I had they did a sonogram on my heart last month and Dr. Pearson said my heart looks fabulous. It's strong as can be.

551
00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:54.000
Tamara Von mauw: Yay. That's what I said, Yeah, you know, because my grandmother and my mother both died from heart problems. So I figured I was going to get it too, but I guess not. Because I'm 59 and I've got a healthy heart.

552
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.870
Dr Katrina Groves: Good. And that's your mom's grandma that also had heart.

So I'm not. I haven't seen any of my relatives in hell. I haven't even seen my own daughter in nine years so

558
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:28.590

656
00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:03.930
Tamara Von mauw: And making me throw up and have diarrhea. So I found out it wasn't because I was allergic. It was just because the eggs were making me guess.

657
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.970

Tamara Von mauw: I get night sweats and I have been getting a little bit fatigued, but not not really bad. I mean, it's not nothing. I can't handle, it's just

674
00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:25.110
Tamara Von mauw: Doing a lot running around, you know, and with the COPD, I lose my breath that I get shorter breath quite easily. Now, so

675
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:37.320
Tamara Von mauw: Okay, I, I try to do things is, you know, get them done. But I do one thing at a time. And I just do a little bit that way I don't run out of breath and have to go use my computer all

676
00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:41.700

679
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:51.300
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and what about breathing. I'm coughing, wheezing short of breath, like I

680
00:59:52.320 --> 01:00:06.450
Tamara Von mauw: I wheeze at night when I'm sleeping. But that's from the COPD and basically I just get up and I take a shot of my album. After all, and it goes away. But I also try to sleep in and sitting up position as much as I can.

681
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:11.760

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.690
Tamara Von mauw: Yep, yep.

683
01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:18.150

Dr Katrina Groves: He might want to up your servant or add a different like inhaler. Because if your COPD is under good control, you would only need that I'll beat around like once a week. So I think you're not really under the best control. You could be. I hate it. That

685
01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.260

729
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.730

730
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.360
Dr Katrina Groves: But you're you're dependent on it. Yeah.

731
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:44.850

Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, it's legal here now.

735
01:03:54.090 --> 01:04:00.540

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.260
Yeah.

737

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:39.870
Dr Katrina Groves: That helps the nausea and

744
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.760
Dr Katrina Groves: It helps relax you what we saying about it. Well,

745
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:47.640
Tamara Von mauw: That's about it. It's like it does those two things.

746
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.520
Dr Katrina Groves: So when you do when you do go to see Tony is it. Are you seeing her regularly still or you

758
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:48.360
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, because you never know if there's a glitch. Right.

Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, especially with this phone and is like Steve look to see where all the towers were that internet towers that are around us. Yeah. And we're surrounded by them, but guess where we are right at the very outside of

760
01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:05.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Figure out

761
01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.300
Tamara Von mauw: Why we get

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:15.510
Dr Katrina Groves: All right, well, if we ever get disconnected. You just call back and we'll make it work.

769
01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:48.930
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. That's all right. Now that's pretty much what I'm trying to just take is our group, and maybe I'll add a few new people, as we go. But I, my goal is to get everybody from group on first, because you guys need a doc.

770
01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah prescribed so

771
01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.040
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't know, it's

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:58.320
Dr Katrina Groves: It's fine. We have a good therapist. Her name is Rebecca. She's awesome. I really like her.

773
01:06:59.070 --> 01:06:59.550
Tamara Von mauw: Good.

774
01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:02.160
Dr Katrina Groves: So when do you need your next prescription, are you

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:19.800

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:21.870
Tamara Von mauw: Oh, I'm sure on Polycom

781
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:23.010
Dr Katrina Groves: So because I'm

782
01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:27.240
Tamara Von mauw: Doria had called them in and they didn't fill them.

783
01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:39.330
Tamara Von mauw: And so I had to get a hold of Mike at Walmart and have him do it. And he called you and you okayed it. So he took care of everything and I was able to pick them up on the

784
01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:52.080
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so when I look at my calendar. The eighth next month would be on a Friday. So I'm going to give, I just want to try to make our, our, our meetings about the time when you need a refill.

785
01:07:52.560 --> 01:08:05.640
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so that will be actually one to the Thursday the 30th of April and you'll be like a few days early, but I'd rather you be a week early than a week late

786
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.120
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, hold on. I gotta get a

787
01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.980
Tamara Von mauw: Piece of paper and a pencil right that

788
01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.750
Tamara Von mauw: I will forget

789
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.230
Tamara Von mauw: I'll forget before I even get off the phone you

790
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.930
Dr Katrina Groves: May.

791
01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:19.650
Tamara Von mauw: So,

792
01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:25.740
Dr Katrina Groves: April 30 30th, because normally we walk

793
01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:29.640
Dr Katrina Groves: And 30th at 10 o'clock. Yes.

794
01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:32.070
Tamara Von mauw: Okay, Kim.

795
01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Tamra but but put down

796
01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.150
Dr Katrina Groves: 930 check in.

797
01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.750
Tamara Von mauw: 930

798
01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:52.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Because what they'll do every check in, they're going to have you do a little talk, they're going to ask you, you know, how's your cravings. Have you used you know all that like seven questions and that takes about 10 minutes for each person so

799
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.160
Tamara Von mauw: You can imagine. Okay, no problem.

800
01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:59.490
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah. Imagine, did you hear that

801
01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:09.120
Tamara Von mauw: This zoom thing that this zoom application. It was on the news. Two days ago saying that the security on it isn't very well. Very good.

802
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:11.640
Dr Katrina Groves: I heard somebody comment.

803
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:23.040
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, I heard something about that. But with bright heart health. It's different. It's a more restricted see bright heart is a medical company.

804
01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:28.200
Dr Katrina Groves: So they've got more HIPAA regulations and it's a tighter.

805
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:33.240
Dr Katrina Groves: Security. So for us, but I mean, really, who cares i mean

806
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:46.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Right now, just you and I are here when there's five or six people its people with addictions trying to be in in recovery and you guys need support right now. We all need to support each other.

807
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:47.610
Dr Katrina Groves: So,

808
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:59.310
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, I think some of those things are going to happen. But I think the the benefit of these groups is so outweighs the risk of any kind of issue. Okay, so

809
01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:00.510
Tamara Von mauw: Alrighty then.

810
01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.630
Tamara Von mauw: all all all not worried about that. Then

811
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:09.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, unless you're trying to rob a bank, you know. Just don't tell us about it on TV and you'll go

812
01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.950
Tamara Von mauw: I think I can do that.

813
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.200
Dr Katrina Groves: And thank you again. All right. What other questions and housekeeping stuff.

814
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.250
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh what pharmacy, do you usually go to

815
01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.580
Tamara Von mauw: Um, for my absolve I go to Walmart.

816
01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:34.620
Dr Katrina Groves: Or x of Walmart and are you going to want me to do to a day still or try to

817
01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:34.890
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah.

818
01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.060
Dr Katrina Groves: And make it last.

819
01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:42.270
Tamara Von mauw: Today to a day. That way if I if I need it. I've got it. If I don't, I don't

820
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:47.910
Dr Katrina Groves: And you can go to Pearson and take your bottle or they're probably doing zoom things too, but

821
01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:48.870
Tamara Von mauw: They are, yeah.

822
01:10:49.230 --> 01:11:00.480
Dr Katrina Groves: You can show them count out how many look how many I have left. I don't even need it yet but but I'm going to prescribe the still the sub solve for you. Okay, that's good. And

823
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.810
Dr Katrina Groves: What else. Oh, they're going to ask you to do blood work. So I don't know if they've had you do that yet.

824
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.350
Tamara Von mauw: Know, last time I had blood work was a few months ago.

825
01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:13.230
Dr Katrina Groves: Was it through bright heart or Dr. Pearson

826
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.340
Tamara Von mauw: Dr. Pearson

827
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:19.260
Dr Katrina Groves: So I have to ask you to write one more thing down on your paper there.

828
01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.870
Tamara Von mauw: Okay, hold on. I gotta go back in the business.

829
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.650
Dr Katrina Groves: I don't know why you

830
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.570
Tamara Von mauw: Are here with me. I'm an idiot.

831
01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:27.300
Dr Katrina Groves: Now I just asking you, too many things.

832
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:34.140
Tamara Von mauw: Now we've got it.

833
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:35.880
Dr Katrina Groves: Will just leave it out here, what

834
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:52.260
Dr Katrina Groves: You've got your April 30 at 930 ish and then add down asked Daria or Tony or whoever to fax the lab work you have done to bright heart so they can see it.

835
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:16.530
Dr Katrina Groves: They may ask you to do more, because they they want all their new people to have an HIV test and Pepsi test and you know, things like that. So there might be more blood. They need because Pearson might have only done like a liver and kidney thing.

836
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:17.610
Tamara Von mauw: Okay.

837
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.570
Dr Katrina Groves: But at least

838
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:21.690
Dr Katrina Groves: At least they'll know like that part. They don't have to repeat

839
01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:29.280
Tamara Von mauw: Well, when next time I see him. I'll go ahead and have him. Well, I better do it soon as the net since they need you guys need it, huh.

840
01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.910
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, you can just call Tony next week or

841
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:37.320
Tamara Von mauw: Next week and make an appointment to go down and get some blood drawn

842
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:45.990
Dr Katrina Groves: And actually make sure that them wait for bright heart, though. Wait, bright heart is going to tell you when you need to go in, so you

843
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:47.490
Tamara Von mauw: Don't know. And until then.

844
01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:55.830
Dr Katrina Groves: All I want is for them to send your old labs to bright heart in advance so that they won't duplicate up on the ones you already had.

845
01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:57.990
Dr Katrina Groves: That makes sense.

846
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:02.640
Tamara Von mauw: Yeah, so wait for them and then make the point

847
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:06.750
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. And have they sent you a peek up in the mail yet.

848
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:17.610
Tamara Von mauw: No, they will I Astoria. She wanted one the other day when I was our last week when I was down there. I had to go potty before I left, and I asked her if she wanted when she said, now you're always playing

849
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.150
Yeah.

850
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:21.000
Dr Katrina Groves: Does not feel good.

851
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:22.800
Tamara Von mauw: Yes, it does.

852
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.000
Dr Katrina Groves: They're trying to save

853
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:33.060
Dr Katrina Groves: You should be so bright heart will be sending you one in the mail. It'll be like a urine cup in plastic. They're going to send you one to your house.

854
01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:39.960
Dr Katrina Groves: If you haven't gotten one in a week or so you might want to call them and just the same number. You called today.

855
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:48.300
Dr Katrina Groves: And say, hey, I need my urine cup, when you get it. Don't open it and do it. Just wait call them and say, What do I do, and they'll walk you through it.

856
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:49.980
