00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you sleeping.

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.450
Matt Huss III: Hello.

3
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you hear me.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.170
Matt Huss III: I can't hear you.

5
00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.470
Matt Huss III: Oh, there you go.

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.660
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I project such him for my air but

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.760
Matt Huss III: Okay.

10
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I said we're sleeping.

11
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.420
Matt Huss III: Almost. Yeah.

12
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.880
Matt Huss III: Um, yeah, that's what I was gonna tell you off right away was

13
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.590
Matt Huss III: Yeah, for some reason, I am very, very exhausted today.

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.060
Matt Huss III: And just like nodding off and stuff.

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:01:09.330
Matt Huss III: So I don't know that. I mean, I was thinking maybe it might be like what a lot more beneficial if maybe we spoke tomorrow or you know later in the week instead of tonight or but if not, it's OK. I just, I am I don't see myself.

16
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.940
Matt Huss III: talking as much as you

17
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, that's fine. Let's just do a quick check in and

18
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then I'll let you out. Okay.

19
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so tell me how your week when

20
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.330
I'm

21
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.380
Matt Huss III: Pretty good. This week, actually, um, I did do two real actual journal entries

22
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.730
Um,

23
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.660
Matt Huss III: Well, one of them is so long that you can consider it for the whole week and you know

24
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.690
Matt Huss III: It's like three pages of like tight.

25
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.480
Matt Huss III: Tight pages.

26
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.850
Matt Huss III: But yeah, I sat down and tried to do that, you know, one or two days. I forgot about it completely.

27
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.460
Matt Huss III: At least I'm

28
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.750
Matt Huss III: Getting to was like amazing that I did that to me for me.

29
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.830
Matt Huss III: So proud about that.

30
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:24.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You should be, it's a start. You know what I mean you have to start somewhere and you're trying and that's all that matters. You know, tell me after you wrote your first one, your three pager. How did you feel getting it out on paper.

31
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.520
Matt Huss III: Was

32
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.930
Matt Huss III: As cathartic for me as

33
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.730
Matt Huss III: You know,

34
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.120
Matt Huss III: Writing poetry or painting.

35
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.240
Matt Huss III: Mm hmm. Whereas, this was just

36
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.430
Matt Huss III: Writing down just how I felt. And what I was thinking at that moment.

37
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.530
Matt Huss III: So,

38
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.600
Matt Huss III: Next time I will try to pay attention. Better to any changes from

39
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.680
Matt Huss III: Before, and after. But

40
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, don't forget that the idea is to be able to write down things that you're struggling with things that

41
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are bothering you, things that you're stressed out about

42
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:39.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And after you write it down and you close that book or you you close the page down to be able to say, Okay, I'm not going to worry about that scenario.

43
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For 24 hours.

44
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.890
Matt Huss III: Okay.

45
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm not going to worry about it for 24 hours. I'm not going to think about it for 24 hours.

46
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.070
Okay.

47
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.970
Matt Huss III: I didn't, I didn't know

48
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.880
Matt Huss III: It was so specific. I was so, like, especially that long one. I wrote was way off topic.

49
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay.

50
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the thing, Matt, is it doesn't matter what topic. It is. It's whatever you're you're getting out on paper.

51
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's all that matters. Yeah, and you know, getting in the routine in the habit of doing that.

52
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.580
Matt Huss III: You know,

53
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.510
Matt Huss III: There was one there was. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you're saying

54
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.490
Matt Huss III: But the one I was trying to think about. My feeling was there was something that was really eating at me. Um,

55
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:49.650
Matt Huss III: And I wrote it down. And I don't remember feeling like any better about it. But like you said, Maybe I can say I write it down the close the book and say okay I can forget about it for now.

56
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.050
Matt Huss III: For hours, maybe, maybe I'll try maybe that might work. I don't know.

57
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:04.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, and here's the thing, writing it down. And that's what what the second half of the information that I'm giving you today. So when you do it.

58
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're writing things that you're struggling with

59
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pay attention to whether or not they're in your control or they're not in your control.

60
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

61
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.670
Matt Huss III: That was actually a big aspect of the first one I did it was

62
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.740
Matt Huss III: It was along the lines of, I can change.

63
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:50.220
Matt Huss III: Myself and my life and my circumstances, I can forgive myself, but I will never be able to change the things that I did, or the ways that I affected negatively other people

64
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.960
Matt Huss III: And even a

65
00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:03.510
Matt Huss III: Truly, honestly, forgive me, I will never be able to forgive myself for things I've done to other people, you know, so

66
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.300
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that's kind of

67
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.270
Matt Huss III: That yeah just remind my mind is the only reason I brought it up, was because of that control thing, whereas you know that that I guess that's a big

68
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.870
I'm a

69
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.550
Matt Huss III: I'm a control freak. I guess kind of

70
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.780
Matt Huss III: Yeah, it's it's things that are not in my control drive me a little nuts.

71
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I guess. Sure, sure. You know, when we feel powerless in some areas of our life.

72
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:48.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's easy to need to be in control to have the need to be in control in control in with as much as we possibly can in our life.

73
00:06:50.100 --> 00:07:02.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And really being able to identify the things that you do have control over versus what you don't have control over. You know what you don't have control over is other people, places and things

74
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have control over what you do. From this day forward.

75
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

76
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how you respond and how you react.

77
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.410
And

78
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm glad that you wrote it out. But I also want to work with you on learning how to forgive yourself for past for the past your past, because who you were back then.

79
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Under the influence

80
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is not who you are today.

81
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:38.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And remembering that piece. You know what I mean. You don't need any extra baggage hanging on your back.

82
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yard. I mean,

83
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It gets really heavy.

84
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

85
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:54.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If we allow it to stay there. It can consume us and ruin what we're trying to create for our future.

86
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:55.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

87
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you. That's why in a they say

88
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:14.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't ever close the door on your past nor do you stay, nor do you leave a foot in it or or something like that. Basically, you want it to be like a rearview mirror to where you can look back there and say,

89
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I did some pretty shitty things, thank God.

90
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I've turned my life around. Thank God I'm not acting in those manners anymore.

91
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm a different person. I'm who I'm supposed to be.

92
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so that kind of combats those negative thoughts that

93
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:40.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those internal feelings of low self worth, low self esteem and that you deserve to be punished for the rest of your life.

94
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because those all those are all falsities

95
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:58.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I really, they really, really are. So if we can get you to that point to get it down on paper, identify what you're powerless over what you can work on changing

96
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then it gives you a better idea, you know, of how to move forward.

97
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

98
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.890
Matt Huss III: Definitely

99
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, tell me how

100
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How you're sleeping is during

101
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.340
Matt Huss III: I'm I'm

102
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.230
Matt Huss III: I'm waking up. I go to sleep. Fine.

103
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.870
Matt Huss III: But, and this has been basically as for as long as I can remember.

104
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.400
Matt Huss III: I wake up three, four or five times a night.

105
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:42.510
Matt Huss III: Sometimes I have to get a drink. Sometimes the bat, go to the bathroom. Sometimes

106
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.010
Matt Huss III: I can stay in bed and go back to sleep, but

107
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:55.080
Matt Huss III: Yeah, without fail. Every night I'm up every couple hours few hours.

108
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any nightmares.

109
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.150
Matt Huss III: No, no.

110
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:03.660
Matt Huss III: No.

111
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, that's a plus. Right.

112
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, how are you doing on your water and your

113
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Food

114
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.760
Matt Huss III: Better actually

115
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.710
Matt Huss III: Been eating.

116
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.860
Matt Huss III: Oatmeal, and some healthy cereal in it, putting fruit into the oatmeal.

117
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.720
Matt Huss III: But yeah, so a little better.

118
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:45.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're working progress. You know what I mean. Little baby steps at a time. We can't change everything overnight. I mean, you know, a year ago when you got sober. You already changed.

119
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:58.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A huge you know this basic part of your life. And so now it's just about honing in on the things that will make you feel better and your life feel better.

120
00:10:59.490 --> 00:10:59.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

121
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.710
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I've

122
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:15.960
Matt Huss III: Done so much so many times, which ended in relapse because I wanted to, once I was clean. I wanted to be able to do everything and everything perfectly and take the world on

123
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.880
Matt Huss III: Immediately

124
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.860
Matt Huss III: And

125
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.580
Matt Huss III: And it's taken me a long time to learn, to start with, you know, those baby steps.

126
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.330
Right.

127
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:41.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now we have to start somewhere. You know what I mean. And oftentimes, you'll see people when they get clean and sober, they will go, they'll get a job, you know, because they haven't had a job in a while, and they will go full into work.

128
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 24 seven

129
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

130
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:56.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's unhealthy too because like look at the scenario around us. Now, you know, something that's out of our control happens and we have to take time off work.

131
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: idle hands. I don't mind.

132
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.200
Matt Huss III: You know,

133
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:15.420
Matt Huss III: If I didn't do the like if this was one of my past. Try to try and recoveries. If I didn't do it like I was this time without any help or therapy or, you know,

134
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:30.480
Matt Huss III: And I just, and I did what I usually did by going into school and work or just a full time job work and then this coronavirus hit, I would definitely say I probably would have relapsed by now.

135
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:32.790
Matt Huss III: So,

136
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.240
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I could see that. Yes, definitely.

137
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so it's about finding

138
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Learning your balance and finding it.

139
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:50.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there needs to be a little attention given to sleep a little attention given to

140
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Food intake and water intake.

141
00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:13.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Connections human connections. You know what I mean work, school children, you know, and you're in the middle. So you think about it as a circle and you're in the middle. And if your self care you know if you're lacking, and some of the basic necessities. Everything suffers.

142
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:21.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But if you're giving yourself the best self care that you that you believe that you can everything flourishes.

143
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

144
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.840
Matt Huss III: So you're saying that

145
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.130
Matt Huss III: If I, if I'm interpreting this correctly.

146
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.750
Matt Huss III: You would rather

147
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.970
Matt Huss III: The person.

148
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.890
Matt Huss III: Say it's a circle like that.

149
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:51.150
Matt Huss III: And this is the max potential of every single aspect of your life that would make you happy.

150
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:59.130
Matt Huss III: You would rather have the center core come out evenly, rather than like this way.

151
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:07.170
Matt Huss III: Or this way instead. And then, yeah, okay, so like less less of one thing

152
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.050
Matt Huss III: And more of another is better than you know.

153
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:22.290
Matt Huss III: Like the, the higher one that the more higher one will come down, but the lower one will come up and that's way more healthy

154
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.130
Matt Huss III: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I can see that.

155
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're, you are the center of that circle.

156
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:31.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

157
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so if you're working on getting yourself healthy, healthy

158
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:49.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: mentally, emotionally, physically and everything that you engage yourself in around it in that circle flourishes because you're what you're saying to yourself, is I matter.

159
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what you're putting out there in all of these areas is that

160
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I matter.

161
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, because I am taking care of myself. I can give you

162
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:17.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 100% of me, whether it be in parenting, whether it be in your, your schoolwork, whether it be in in work, you know, whatever that might look like whatever your balances, you know,

163
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:27.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so that's why it's important that baby steps are taken because you're in the middle and your world around you is bigger

164
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a heavy load to carry

165
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For you.

166
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.500
Matt Huss III: Right yeah for me right now. Yeah.

167
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For you and anybody that's the

168
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:44.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thing for you and for anybody. It's like that for everybody in early recovery in the first couple of years of

169
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.200
Matt Huss III: Every yeah that's

170
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

171
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're not alone in that you know at all.

172
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:52.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

173
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.420
Matt Huss III: Somebody come from.

174
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:00.960
Matt Huss III: When I

175
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:11.160
Matt Huss III: You know, as, like, get off, you know, shooting up oxy code on three times a day. And, you know,

176
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:29.220
Matt Huss III: Doing whatever you know you have to do, like, really low and bad like really bad into their addiction and then quit. And then, and have you seen them become a functional

177
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.680
Matt Huss III: Person.

178
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:42.720
Matt Huss III: Not just functioning and not just by substitution or a day or but actually feel happy.

179
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.090
Matt Huss III: Become a happy.

180
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.130
Matt Huss III: Individual

181
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.980
Matt Huss III: And if you have

182
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.880
Matt Huss III: How long did that take

183
00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I haven't several occasions, I want you to know that I'm

184
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:13.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably depending on the work that you do internally and part of the, the issue is that you have to be able to address the core issues.

185
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That deep down, you know that deep down core in that volcano that

186
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you don't want anyone to know

187
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:34.050
Matt Huss III: Yeah, and that, and that's why I'm. That's the reason I'm finally going to therapies, because you know I can be on Suboxone and stay clean the rest of my life.

188
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.620
Matt Huss III: You know,

189
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.060
Matt Huss III: I had to, but

190
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.340
Matt Huss III: That doesn't

191
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:40.920
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

192
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:56.880
Matt Huss III: It's, yeah, this time. This is the first time of any of my recoveries that I've wanted to actually find out what causes causes the addiction and relapses and stuff. The underlying

193
00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:58.350
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

194
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:11.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you if you dissect your, your relapses if you think about, and you actually dissect your last relapse. You could probably pinpoint it to

195
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something in the regards to either your environment.

196
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:27.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or not dealing with the stuff not not dealing with that internal stuff that's underneath there and not learning coping skills to be able to deal with life.

197
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Taking on the world.

198
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, making yourself so stressed out that you know of course your addiction is going to grab you and Yankee back, you know, um, but I've also seen people that have walked in recovery.

199
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:54.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Didn't think for one minute that they were going to be able to stay sober and did it one day at a time, one meeting at a time, one group at a time.

200
00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One assignment at a time, and before they knew it.

201
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:08.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Their life was perfectly okay and they were happy with what they had created in the work that they had done.

202
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that internal work.

203
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just the stuff that nobody knows about that you think that if people knew

204
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that they would think you were a horrible person.

205
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We all have we, everybody has that you have to know that.

206
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

207
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.830
If you

208
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know,

209
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:41.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everybody especially everybody that goes through addiction. It could be environmental that that creates the addiction.

210
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your family, you know, drank and use drugs while you were growing up around you all the time. That was the normal life for you. Or there could have been sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse. There could have been

211
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: tragedies that you'd been witness to or been a part of

212
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Losses you know any of these things that cause massive internal pain massive emotional plane pain if we don't have the coping skills to deal with it and know what what we're supposed to do the easiest thing to do is is to drink and use

213
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's an instant, right, it just shuts it off.

214
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But if you had the coping skills to be able to dig out that crap.

215
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Throw it on the floor.

216
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: dissect it

217
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then get rid of it.

218
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:47.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then you have this ability to feel that internal that internal hole that that stuff's been sitting in there.

219
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:59.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now it's empty. So now we got to fill it. So we fill it with sobriety we fill it with what does it mean for Matthew to be happy. What does that look like

220
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how do we get there.

221
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We feel it by engaging ourselves in healthy people.

222
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: connecting with people that are on the same path you know as us, or that

223
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:22.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can help us in our walk with us in our life you know that

224
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is part of us moving forward versus us being stuck in the past.

225
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the number one thing that you have to work through

226
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is forgiving yourself.

227
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because this is what I'm going to tell you

228
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:54.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everybody has has the story to tell. Not everybody has especially everybody that struggles with this disease.

229
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because who they are when they're under the influence.

230
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:07.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is not who they are. We do things that we wouldn't normally do we hurt people. You know, we wouldn't normally hurt or we never wanted to hurt you know

231
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All of that commons with drugs. Drugs and alcohol use.

232
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Drug and alcohol addiction.

233
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.070
Matt Huss III: It's still crazy to think about you being capable of

234
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.100
Matt Huss III: Doing such horrible things

235
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.620
You know,

236
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.390
Matt Huss III: When

237
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.720
Matt Huss III: That's, I guess that's why it makes

238
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.830
Matt Huss III: It so unforgivable for me because

239
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:53.040
Matt Huss III: You know, you're still you you're not you, you know, the real you. But you, you realize that you do have a

240
00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:00.660
Matt Huss III: something in you that is capable of doing so much

241
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:09.510
Matt Huss III: Harm and such horrible things and good, you know, at the same time.

242
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:12.690
Matt Huss III: That

243
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:20.700
Matt Huss III: You know, is it truly the addiction that brings you out that like lets you

244
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.790
Matt Huss III: That enables you to be able to do something that horrible.

245
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.200
Matt Huss III: Be but because

246
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:36.720
Matt Huss III: I don't know. I mean, it just, it's so hard to

247
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.960
Matt Huss III: wrap my head around that.

248
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:42.930
Matt Huss III: Something

249
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.730
Matt Huss III: Would

250
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.090
Matt Huss III: Make me do some things that I

251
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.060
Matt Huss III: You know, would

252
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:10.260
Matt Huss III: Never have imagined that I would do, or even dream. Think of being able to do you know

253
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:14.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh. So remember that there was a driving force.

254
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Number one, do you have you ever heard people say that addiction is a moral failing.

255
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:23.880
Yeah.

256
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's that whole controversy of it being a disease versus a moral failing.

257
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

258
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:53.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The reality of it is it is it is a disease. And when you're under the influence your values and your morals, they're pushed down and the drive, which is your addiction to get your drug stories and to not feel and to, you know, deal with it. It's a compulsion. That's what's driving that.

259
00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:06.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you get clean and sober and your morals and values are coming back. That's what makes you so horrified that you can't believe that you reacted or you know behaved in that manner.

260
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.070
Matt Huss III: Yeah, because even after doing it while I was still high, and

261
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:26.790
Matt Huss III: Yeah, it makes sense because I didn't like regret it the next day or night, you know, say to myself, I can't believe I was able to do that. Or, you know, it wasn't. It's not until a few months of being clean that you look back and it's like

262
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is a lot of

263
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People struggle in early recovery. It's not just

264
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:48.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the cravings and the triggers of us, but it's letting go of the the people, places and things that you used with and around it is identifying who you are when you're under the

265
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:59.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Influence versus who you really are. When you're not and taking a look at that guilt and shame those, those two are big relapsing

266
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Issues.

267
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the craziest thing to me.

268
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your disease lives in your head.

269
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it knows these things.

270
00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

271
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:12.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't feel

272
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right let's play on that a little bit.

273
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's get uncomfortable in our, in our skin, you know, because it's got one job.

274
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's to take you out.

275
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Period. It doesn't have any other job but to take you out. It never says things nice to you your disease talks to you when you think about using when you are dwelling on your behaviors of your addiction.

276
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:45.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because the Lord knows if if he can, you know, hammer on your heart enough he'll get you back you'll give up.

277
00:26:47.040 --> 00:27:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so it's about combating those thoughts identifying them and combating them and changing those thought that thought process. You know what I mean. And that's why it's so important that you're able to say to different people.

278
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Addiction driven

279
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:05.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And Matthew

280
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:08.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

281
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:14.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, when we have struggled with childhood trauma.

282
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:22.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when there has been an addiction in our family unit growing up that is

283
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:38.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We don't see anything wrong with it because it's a normal part of life. Right. And so it's easy to fall right right down into that same you know pathway with it, whether it be drinking, smoking marijuana or you know whatever whatever

284
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everybody else the people that are supposed to love you protect you.

285
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And teach you

286
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are the ones that are teaching you to be an addict.

287
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so you think about you know that you think about that.

288
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:05.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, I can tell you for myself I my I have three adult children and I created the best attics there ever there ever was.

289
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No.

290
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:23.640
Matt Huss III: That's funny to hear somebody say that because I'm scared as hell that I did some real emotional and mental trauma to my daughter growing up and yeah I'm

291
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.710
Matt Huss III: So scared of just waiting for her to

292
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:31.920
Matt Huss III: Have

293
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.410
Matt Huss III: That you know that Catholic girl.

294
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.920
Matt Huss III: explode like

295
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:46.200
Matt Huss III: You know what I mean, like those Shelton, and then all of a sudden just

296
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.360
Matt Huss III: go off the deep end.

297
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:53.700
Matt Huss III: Like waiting for that to happen so well and

298
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here's the thing.

299
00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:58.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you think about this.

300
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You also are getting ready to go, move back with her.

301
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get to teacher. The other side of the coin.

302
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.610
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. I thought about that.

303
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

304
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:20.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, what you bring to the table for her being a sober dad is so much you can do. You can

305
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know show her your experience how it felt the things that you went through, you know, give her the information power, you know, knowledge is power.

306
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.460
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I've always been

307
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:40.380
Matt Huss III: very weary on discussing the details of my past.

308
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.200
Matt Huss III: When it comes to drugs with her because

309
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:59.700
Matt Huss III: You know, I guess I'm afraid of how she'll view me or her opinion of me, but kind of think of it, maybe I maybe

310
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.850
Matt Huss III: If I'm

311
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:09.360
Matt Huss III: If I knew more about the consequences and stuff of

312
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:18.600
Matt Huss III: Addiction and how it all plays out beforehand or at an earlier age might might have been

313
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:40.950
Matt Huss III: A lot of help. So I don't know. You know that's hard. It's hard to admit, just the only the one the person that you love the most. And the person that you the moat. The that you care the most about how they view you are at well their opinion of you, you know, and to

314
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:47.640
Matt Huss III: Tell them what you some, some of the things you've done and

315
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:51.900
Matt Huss III: I don't know.

316
00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:57.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't have to die. You don't have to dive in deep, you know, with her. But giving her

317
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:04.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the process of what happens when you first start using and how it progresses.

318
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:08.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then it gets to a point where it owns you. You know what I mean.

319
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:22.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: giving her the information in a, in a manner that is non judgmental and supporting her if you find out that she has done something but be non non judgmental with her. And you know what I mean.

320
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:40.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That piece is what's important. Letting her know that you came out on the other side. After you you know experienced this dragon this dragon this drug. And this is where that lead you. And by doing that, you have to remember to with kids. Hey,

321
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:52.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Number one. Number one person is their parents. Number one, and they love their parents on conditionally no matter what.

322
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:59.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. She knows that you've been. I mean, you're you've been away for a year, she knows that you've been struggling right

323
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What a great opportunity for you to go back

324
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:19.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Explain to her about using about drugs and alcohol and about addiction and just maybe take some early from her. Because I can tell you that kids sometimes believe that they're the problem.

325
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:27.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

326
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:39.450
Matt Huss III: I've heard about that, like of divorce and stuff. I've never experienced that myself. It's weird. But yeah, I have. Yeah, I definitely can see how

327
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:52.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How it can can, you know, um, it's that way with of course towards families, but it's also like that with, you know, parents that struggle with addiction.

328
00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because you're putting you've put something else in front of her.

329
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so it's easy for her to think that she's the problem.

330
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.380
Matt Huss III: Or

331
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.930
Matt Huss III: She doesn't matter as much as

332
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:26.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah. And to get to go back and say, Listen, this is my story and this is you know where I am. It has absolutely nothing to do with you. You know, I was able to find the strength within myself to get sober because I love you so much, you know,

333
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.620
Matt Huss III: I love that. I love that saying ever hear that saying that

334
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.380
Matt Huss III: People are just children having children.

335
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You had her when she was when you were how old

336
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.890
Matt Huss III: I was 18

337
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:51.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. Baby raising a baby, yeah.

338
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:53.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

339
00:33:54.300 --> 00:34:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I tell my, my daughter. I had heard a young age to and I tell her I'm so glad you survived my parenting.

340
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:11.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know you didn't come with the book, I had no idea what I was doing. I had nobody to show me so thank God I appreciate the fact that you're here and that you survived, you know,

341
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:18.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now that she's you know a grown adult we laugh about it. But you know what I mean, it's just

342
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:27.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just those things that are important and knowing that you never, you know, you never meant to hurt anybody.

343
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ever

344
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But there was a driving force a compulsion.

345
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And you have to remember that, too.

346
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:45.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what helps you day by day a little by little work on forgiving yourself.

347
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:50.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Make sense

348
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.740
Matt Huss III: Yeah, definitely.

349
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

350
00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are so you're tired, you're not feeling well you just really tired.

351
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:11.550
Matt Huss III: Just, just really, really fatigued and tired. Yeah, that's all. Otherwise, done. Yeah, I'm okay. I'm just extremely yeah

352
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.510
Matt Huss III: lack of motivation, just like can barely

353
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.460
Matt Huss III: Week in my muscles and yeah just

354
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.760
Matt Huss III: That's all. But I'm

355
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.720
Matt Huss III: In a fine mental state actually today.

356
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

357
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:35.100
Matt Huss III: And no

358
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:42.720
Matt Huss III: No crawling under my skin or Restlessness or anything like that, you know,

359
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:53.130
Matt Huss III: It's just really, I guess it's purely just and I slept. I was up late last night, working on the next day. That was do but

360
00:35:55.110 --> 00:36:01.050
Matt Huss III: But I got a lot of sleep today. Maybe I slept too late or something and day. I don't know.

361
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or maybe the stress of everything that you've been going through maybe

362
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:11.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know your body knows that it wants rest, now's the time to get it.

363
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or maybe your, you know, your system is fighting off.

364
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, allergies, or, or, you know, above

365
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:21.750
19

366
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wasn't going to take it that far but

367
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:28.740
You know,

368
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:45.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about it, think about that and listen to your body when it says I need a break. I need to just rest you know it's telling you that's its way of talking to you and telling you what its needs are. So you have to listen.

369
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

370
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:50.790
