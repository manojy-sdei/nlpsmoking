171
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.160
Dr Jameson: And are you going to be able to stay there while or that's up in a year.

172
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.800
Curtisha’s iPhone: Yeah, I don't know how long.

173
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.620
Dr Jameson: So it's uncertain. Okay.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.490
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you've you've tried it.

177
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.320
Curtisha’s iPhone: Yeah, and

178
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.070
Dr Jameson: How did it go, I take it, it wasn't bad or you probably wouldn't be

179
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.300
Yeah.

180
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.890
Dr Jameson: It was fine.

181
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.310
Curtisha’s iPhone: Okay.

182
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.790
Dr Jameson: Do you did you just do it once or twice or you've taken that like four

183
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.630
Curtisha’s iPhone: days in a row.

184
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.460
Curtisha’s iPhone: On the whole bunch of times.

185
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.300
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Do you know how many a day need to not feel bad.

186
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.940
Curtisha’s iPhone: Hi, like four

187
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.210
Dr Jameson: Okay, and they were the eight right

188
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.350
Yes.

189
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.230
Dr Jameson: Have you taken

190
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:09.420
Dr Jameson: Your I've just just it helps me to know. So it's not it's not a bad or anything, but they you know there's films and there's tablets. Have you tried both of them are just one which

191
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.500
Curtisha’s iPhone: I just tried the one

192
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.460
Dr Jameson: Which one

193
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.830
Curtisha’s iPhone: The one that'd be up under your tongue.

194
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.070
Dr Jameson: Is it like it's a flat film, though it's not

195
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:17.610
Curtisha’s iPhone: A real

196
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:23.400
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you're trying to film. Okay, I'm in there, they don't. So there's two options. There's films and their

197
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:33.720
Dr Jameson: Tablets, and some people have a preference, like when they don't like the taste of or, you know, some people want one. And some people want the other. So that's why I was asking if you have a preference, but it sounds like

198
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:45.540
Dr Jameson: Let me try that one. Okay, so, so I don't go on and on about stuff you already know. Can you just tell me a little bit, but what you know about Suboxone so i don't i don't bore you with. Do you

199
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.440
Curtisha’s iPhone: Really know too. I don't really know too much. I just was taken.

200
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.000
Dr Jameson: Okay, you just know they helped

201
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.710
Curtisha’s iPhone: Yeah, okay.

202
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:59.490
Dr Jameson: So well it works the way that it works is that it it's it's

203
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:10.920
Dr Jameson: It's still an opioid, it's still an opiate medication. It's basically kind of like a designer. They designed this drug specifically to

204
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:19.890
Dr Jameson: Kind of go into the same receptors in your brain that that opioids go into the narco goes, or any of the other ones.

205
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:34.170
Dr Jameson: So it goes the same place, but it holds on like super duper, duper tight to the receptor and it stays there for a very like a longer time than most other drugs and while it's in there. Other drugs can't get in there. So you could use

206
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:40.170
Dr Jameson: Norco and nothing. It was like have nowhere to go in your body, it would just

207
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.310
Dr Jameson: wash out and you wouldn't have any effect from the Norco

208
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.450
Dr Jameson: Um, it also is

209
00:12:50.250 --> 00:13:01.350
Dr Jameson: Special in that there are multiple different types of receptors in your brain that the opiates go to. So, some of them make you sleepy. Some of them make you feel high, some of them.

210
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.710
Dr Jameson: relieve pain. Some of them caused these physical symptoms, right, that

211
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.520
Dr Jameson: That you get

212
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:14.760
Dr Jameson: Well, they do the opposite of all the physical things you get so they calm you down, they relax your muscles, they

213
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.390
Dr Jameson: Slow down your, your digestive tract.

214
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.570
Dr Jameson: And band you up and all that. So then when you

215
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:28.890
Dr Jameson: Don't have opioids in your brain. You have all those opposite effects like nachos and diarrhea and sweats and

216
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.780
Curtisha’s iPhone: You can't sleep and

217
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.320
Dr Jameson: You know, the kind of the opposite of what what the drugs to do so.

218
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:42.030
Dr Jameson: This medicine goes in there and sort of solves that problem. So that's how it keeps you from feeling sick. Is that it, it sort of

219
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:56.040
Dr Jameson: Takes over those parts of your brain. It goes in the other receptors to but it blocks. Some of those receptor. So, it blocks the one that makes you stop breathing and it blocks the one that gives you a high

220
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:56.880
Curtisha’s iPhone: So,

221
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:03.300
Dr Jameson: It sort of it does only the things we wanted to do and not the things that we don't want it, if that makes sense.

222
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:16.620
Dr Jameson: So that's kind of the basic console. So basically, it satisfies your, your brain, the part that has become more like it needs the opiates to to not feel bad. It'd be

223
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.880
Curtisha’s iPhone: Okay, okay, fills in there. Does that make sense. Yeah, okay.

224
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.600
Um,

225
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:30.300
Dr Jameson: So I guess. Tell me what symptoms you do get when, how does your. How does your withdrawal look

226
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:39.060
Curtisha’s iPhone: I just be sweating it don't wanna vomiting sweating. Do you have trouble sleeping, yeah. I will say they cannot sleep.

227
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:44.640
Curtisha’s iPhone: Okay, ya can't sleep at all. Do you get pain. Yeah.

228
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.540
Curtisha’s iPhone: Ma love my body. Yeah.

229
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.550
Dr Jameson: And then how about people say things like being anxious or restless.

230
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.230
Curtisha’s iPhone: Yeah, always

231
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.780
Curtisha’s iPhone: Always be like restless. Yeah.

232
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.180
Dr Jameson: Right runny nose, and he yawning.

233
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:08.160
Dr Jameson: Yeah, random things funny. It's not funny. But this, you know, strange sort of combination of thing.

234
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.060
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So you have all of that stuff.

235
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.050
Curtisha’s iPhone: Is

236
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:20.130
Dr Jameson: How long does it take, like, if you have don't have Norco how long can you go before you start to feel sick.

237
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.840
Curtisha’s iPhone: Polly a day.

238
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.880
Dr Jameson: About 24 hours. Okay.

239
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.070
Dr Jameson: And then how long till you're like vomiting and really really terrible.

240
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.330
Curtisha’s iPhone: 24 hours.

241
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.640
Dr Jameson: By then that's when it's pretty bad. Okay.

242
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.730
Dr Jameson: Have you ever heard of people getting more sick when they take Suboxone

243
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.160
Curtisha’s iPhone: No. Okay.

244
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.460
Dr Jameson: So there's a funny sort of

245
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:59.850
Dr Jameson: special thing about the medicine, which is that it actually is so strong, to the receptor that it will actually push the whatever heroin or Norco or morphine out

246
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.220
Dr Jameson: And and hold on.

247
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.110
Dr Jameson: So if you have

248
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:24.450
Dr Jameson: Been using to recently and you have good levels in your system and you're not feeling sick yet taking the Suboxone will actually make you suddenly extremely sick. And then we have to just wait and it's it's miserable. So

249
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:31.980
Dr Jameson: We call that precipitated withdrawal, which just means that it creates that and then it's anyway so

250
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:41.400
Dr Jameson: As long as you have, as long as you wait. The worst part about to box on is that you have to wait till you feel sick. Before you can take it.

251
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.190
Curtisha’s iPhone: Because otherwise, it will make you sick.

252
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:52.080
Dr Jameson: And it sounds like. Luckily, you've never accidentally done that because he will I guess you've always done it, maybe more in desperation and

253
00:16:52.380 --> 00:17:02.130
Dr Jameson: Once you once you started it, then you don't have to be sick anymore, but the very first beginning is is kind of, you gotta wait till you feel pretty bad.

254
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:11.940
Dr Jameson: So that's really important because if you take it too soon, then you're not going to have a good experience at least at first.

255
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.780
Dr Jameson: So, so when is the last time that you took any normal

256
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.480
Curtisha’s iPhone: This morning, okay.

257
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:38.550
Dr Jameson: So that means that we had to wait at least until tomorrow, then you're, you know, feeling bad before you take your first dose of the Suboxone which is okay. I just important that you understand that and and really wait because all

258
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.260
Curtisha’s iPhone: We got prescribe them today so I

259
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.090
Dr Jameson: said, Yeah, I'll send the prescription

260
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.510
Dr Jameson: But I just don't want you to start taking it until you really feel

261
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.280
Curtisha’s iPhone: Okay.

262
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.950
Dr Jameson: As bad as you can stand to feel really

263
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.990
Curtisha’s iPhone: Okay, unfortunately.

264
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.620

Dr Jameson: Thank you. Otherwise, I have to flip between two different screens with the pain.

272
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.150
Dr Jameson: And you live in Richmond, right.

273
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:24.990

274
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.860
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you've been getting prescriptions and then buying it too is that what's happening.

275
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.000
Yeah.

276
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.330
Dr Jameson: Is it a primary care who's been doing that or

277
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.060
Curtisha’s iPhone: No, I don't have a primary care right now.

278
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.920
Dr Jameson: Who's Dr. Carter.

279
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.010
Curtisha’s iPhone: Oh yes, the man I go to now.

280
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.290
Dr Jameson: Is he like a in an urgent care a pain clinic or

281
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.570
Curtisha’s iPhone: Now he just had a doctor's office.

282
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.710
Okay.

283
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:03.540

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.230
Dr Jameson: Every

286
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.480
Dr Jameson: month or so. Right.

287
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.190
Yes. Okay.

288
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:20.280
Dr Jameson: All right, so just but you haven't been there. This month right

289
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.170
Dr Jameson: No. No. Okay.

290
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.030
Curtisha’s iPhone: Though

291
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.950
Dr Jameson: Well,

292
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.840
Dr Jameson: I guess if you're going to be taking the Suboxone, then you can't be taking that anymore. Right.

293
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.500
Curtisha’s iPhone: Oh, I can't take my Narcos more more

294
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.000
No.

295
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.430
Dr Jameson: Because remember, I was saying that the Suboxone will block the narco from working.

296
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.970
Curtisha’s iPhone: On oh no I need monarchos because milestone. I've got shot in the foot, my foot be payment.

297
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:55.980
Dr Jameson: Ah, well, so the Suboxone actually helps with pain, too.

298
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:05.070
Dr Jameson: So, but the point of taking Suboxone is to stop taking all the other opioids. That's the point of it so

299
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.540
Curtisha’s iPhone: Why just call back

300
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.290
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you don't wanna, you want to

301
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.270
Dr Jameson: Nevermind.

302
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.450
Curtisha’s iPhone: Want to just try for right now, I guess.

303
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.400
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, so

304
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.080
Curtisha’s iPhone: We have people who don't work out.

305
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.610
Dr Jameson: Yeah, um, that

306
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.180
Is

307
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.660
Dr Jameson: Sorry, I can't hear.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.560
Curtisha’s iPhone: Your fingers are just text stop taking the Suboxone it if I

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.630
Curtisha’s iPhone: Still be taking my Marcos.

310
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.710
Dr Jameson: Yeah. So did you have to have an operation on your foot or

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.770
Curtisha’s iPhone: Yeah, cash on the fleet. Okay.

312
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.360
All right.

313
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.660
That's definitely

314
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.270
Dr Jameson: How long ago did that happen.

315
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.060
Curtisha’s iPhone: Like about 10 years ago but

316
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.950
Curtisha’s iPhone: I was pregnant with my daughters.

317
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.250
Dr Jameson: Oh, so that's more like 18 years ago.

318
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.120
Yeah.

319
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.880
Curtisha’s iPhone: But I've never got it fixed because I was pregnant so you can. And I'll start.

320
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.350
Dr Jameson: I see.

321
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.370
Dr Jameson: So wait, so they didn't. Wait, I'm confused. So they didn't operate. When it first happened, but then they operated

322
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.980
Curtisha’s iPhone: Nope, I never got it operated on

323
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.350
Dr Jameson: Oh, you just have the wound. And that's it.

324
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:16.920
Yeah.

325
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:27.750
Dr Jameson: Never operated occur. Geez, while pregnant. That's horrifying.

326
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:37.590
Dr Jameson: So, I mean, we have to try it to see, but it does seem that a lot of people get pain relief.

327
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.820
Curtisha’s iPhone: So you prescribe those for me. My doctor mobile to give me my Narcos

328
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:51.000
Dr Jameson: Well, generally the point of taking Suboxone is to not be taking any other pain pills.

329
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:51.990
Curtisha’s iPhone: Well, I'm

330
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.180
Curtisha’s iPhone: Just I'm gonna just wait to do that.

331
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.480
Curtisha’s iPhone: Because I'm the my paint goes right now.

332
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.210
Dr Jameson: OK.

333
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.280
Curtisha’s iPhone: OK.

334
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:03.570
Curtisha’s iPhone: That's fine. Okay.

335
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:04.470
Curtisha’s iPhone: Alrighty.

336
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.230
Dr Jameson: All right. Good luck. Thank you. Bye.

337
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.290
Dr Jameson: Okay, so this was her Tisha Henderson.

338
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.690
Dr Jameson: Who presented for initial

339
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.870
Dr Jameson: Intake history and physical

340
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.710
Dr Jameson: has a history of using

341
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.130
Dr Jameson: Norco initially as

342
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.010
Dr Jameson: Just recreationally

343
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.700
Dr Jameson: But also subsequently for pain control due to a remote

344
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.010
gunshot wound to her foot.

345
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.340
Dr Jameson: Which has left her with

346
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.340
Residual chronic pain.

347
00:22:48.720 --> 00:23:08.250
Dr Jameson: Most recently, she's been taking upwards of 12 Norco 10 milligrams per day, a local physician prescribes enough for one to two a day 45 and then she purchases the remainder herself.

348
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.850
Dr Jameson: She has used Suboxone in the past that she's purchased on the street.

349
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.210
Dr Jameson: But

350
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.920
Dr Jameson: When

351
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:35.340
Dr Jameson: Informed that she would not get any further benefit from the north goals. If you were taking Suboxone she

352
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.030
Dr Jameson: Wants to

353
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:49.530
Dr Jameson: Postpone delay her so she's not she's no longer interested, I guess in in Suboxone treatment.

354
00:23:51.870 --> 00:24:00.960
Dr Jameson: past medical history and is detailed in their mental status and physical normal assessment.

355
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.840
Dr Jameson: opioid use disorder.

356
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.240
Dr Jameson: Severe, number one. Number two, chronic pain.

357
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.090
And her foot.

358
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.530
Dr Jameson: Well, any I guess I didn't, I sort of skipped over review systems.

359
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:34.830
Dr Jameson: So you can detail what she what she reported as far as her withdrawal symptoms go

360
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.700
Dr Jameson: Plan.

361
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.690
Dr Jameson: We discussed the

362
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:50.790
Dr Jameson: Mechanism of action of the medication, as well as the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

363
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.950
Dr Jameson: I do think she would be a good candidate for Suboxone

364
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:08.430
Dr Jameson: As she's had a she had clearly has a physical dependence on opioids and had to escalate her dose over over the time

365
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:14.790
Dr Jameson: However, she I explained that it can also provide pain control.

366
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:23.130
Dr Jameson: But she is not willing to entertain the idea of stopping Norco completely

367
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.710
Dr Jameson: Due to concern about untreated pain.

368
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.970
Dr Jameson: She therefore

369
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.730
Dr Jameson: We therefore will not proceed with treatment at this time.

370
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.230
Dr Jameson: Total times

371
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.410
Dr Jameson: Well, more than 50% of this visit was spent counseling education about

372
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.550
Dr Jameson: The use of Suboxone and benefits.

373
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.650
Dr Jameson: So I think that will be the end

374
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.700
Dr Jameson: For her

375
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.460
At the moment,

376
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.650
Dr Jameson: Hello.

377
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.390
Dr Jameson: Hi.

Can you hear me.

379
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.360
Dr Jameson: Hi. Hi.

380
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.310
Dr Jameson: It looks cold.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.540
Dr Jameson: No, I'm

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:10.980
Dr Jameson: So we don't have to take long Center here at work, but um it's. Can you hear me, because it seems like the connections not fabulous.

Jacob Cains: Yeah, I can hear you. Okay.

384
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:25.470
Dr Jameson: So, um, geez. That sounds like a really upsetting.

385
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.780
Dr Jameson: Situation.

386
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:40.320
Jacob Cains: RIGHT WORD. Yeah, it is weird. We didn't know what happened but someone that she works with she was living with her and they said that she didn't come to work. So then

387
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:52.410
Jacob Cains: They went to her ex. The guy she was divorcing working with like God look nice car. And there's one software over the car and he took her to the cops to her body.

388
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.830
Jacob Cains: And weird weird situation.

389
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.260
Dr Jameson: somebody you knew well or

390
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:16.080
Jacob Cains: Yeah, I'm like cousins or like best friends with his the kid that they gotta kill her his brother good friends with his little brother so weird. I knew her to from school and stuff.

391
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.620
Jacob Cains: And she's only

392
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.950
Dr Jameson: Yeah, there's, it's hard to even know

393
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.790
Dr Jameson: never really know somebody well yeah and you meet satin angry and

394
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.250

Dr Jameson: All sorts of things. Yeah.

396
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.060
Dr Jameson: You got your refill.

397
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.980
Jacob Cains: Yeah, which I demon needs. I forgot that you gave me two weeks.

398
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.320
Dr Jameson: Well,

399
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.950
Dr Jameson: So how are you. I mean, how are you doing with all this

400
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:59.340
Dr Jameson: Is it. Do you feel like, oh, it's there now. Yeah, okay, well they they'll release it to when when it's time

401
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:07.530
Dr Jameson: How are you do. I mean, do you would would meeting with someone talk about grief and that kind of stuff. Be helpful. You think

402
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.720
Jacob Cains: Aren't really process that yeah I think

403
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.360
Dr Jameson: Well shock, I bet. Yeah.

404
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.820
Jacob Cains: It's kind of weird to think of

405
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.400
Dr Jameson: It's hard, hard to wrap your head around it, I bet.

406
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.280
Jacob Cains: I know you both on like feel more bad for her family. I do his cuz I don't know.

407
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:31.620
Dr Jameson: Wow.

408
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.720
Jacob Cains: I wouldn't want to be on his side of the

409
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.820
Jacob Cains: Family very well. So it's weird.

410
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:44.310
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, cuz then they have to have the deal with, you know, being associated with him and having the mixed feelings.

411
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.550
Jacob Cains: Of

412
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:45.360
You know,

413
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.890
Dr Jameson: He's

414
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.410
Jacob Cains: He's online shit talker and

415
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.870
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and he's somebody that face probably still love it but

416
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.680
Dr Jameson: Now have a whole different set of feel anyway. Either way, I mean,

417
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.240
Dr Jameson: Know, so he's in jail. I take it.

418
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:10.590
Yeah.

419
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.140
Jacob Cains: Turning try to plead guilty.

420
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:26.670
Jacob Cains: Detroit and they went, let them for you can't plead guilty in Ohio to violent crime, you have to plead not guilty. So he's already saying he did it took them to the body and yeah like

421
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:33.960
Jacob Cains: I always wonder and allow the contact his family or her family. So there's no content correct order with anybody.

422
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.120
Wow.

423
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:43.950
Dr Jameson: I always wonder why people plead not guilty to things that it's like so obvious that they did. Maybe that's why

424
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:52.980
Jacob Cains: Maybe they're forced to. Yeah, they did. That's crazy like that everywhere. I know in higher. You can't plead guilty to a violent crime will tell felony.

425
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.000
Dr Jameson: I've never heard of that before but seems stupid like if you're admitting you did it.

426
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.300
Jacob Cains: Then

427
00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.480
Jacob Cains: Why are we wasting almost admit they did so, yeah.

428
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.210
Dr Jameson: And it's cost a lot of money to put a trial on so

429
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.180
Dr Jameson: Anyway, well,

430
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:14.010
Keeps things I think keeps FREEZING ME still there.

431
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.360
Jacob Cains: Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

432
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.790
Dr Jameson: Alright, so, I mean,

433
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:29.190
Dr Jameson: You're not supposed to know how to process through something this awful so

434
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.560
Dr Jameson: I mean, I just, I would

435
00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:40.200
Dr Jameson: I would strongly encourage that you and I mean your little brother i mean it's it's it's just so super upsetting so

436
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:50.550
Dr Jameson: If there's grief counselors locally that that are available or I don't know if I don't know how that works. But we certainly obviously have counselors here and I

437
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.550
Dr Jameson: I guess I can't see how it would hurt.

438
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:54.870
Dr Jameson: No.

439
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:56.580
Jacob Cains: I mean,

440
00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:03.690
Dr Jameson: I get it. If you're just not even ready to know quite yet to talk about it but i i do think that at some point, it makes sense to

441
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:05.640
Dr Jameson: Just kind of

442
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:12.840
Dr Jameson: Have somebody help you process a little bit and figure out where you know kind of what to do.

443
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.520
Dr Jameson: With all the emotions. Yeah, yeah, there's, it's

444
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.660
Dr Jameson: But, you know, of course, times like this, or when people, you know, are more

445
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:31.950
Dr Jameson: Compelled to try to stop feeling things that are very uncomfortable. Right. So, you know,

446
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:38.280
Dr Jameson: Obviously raises concern on my end that you know I don't want this to be a trigger.

447
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.810
For any kind of

448
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.540
So,

449
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.030
Jacob Cains: Think about this.

450
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:50.850
Dr Jameson: Hasn't been even. It doesn't even cross your mind. You don't have dreams about anything like

451
00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.720
Jacob Cains: Going back

452
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:57.690
Dr Jameson: He's okay. If you do. I mean, I most you know it's sort of almost surprising that if you haven't really but

453
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:15.840
Dr Jameson: Okay, well just really be honest with yourself about if you do start entertaining the thought. That's the first step of a relapse. Okay, so we want it. We want to intervene. Yeah, you know, get the thoughts out of your head before they actually become actions. Right.

454
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.720
Jacob Cains: So, so please

455
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:31.200
Dr Jameson: Please just really be honest with yourself and and reach out, okay, if anything is starting to feel a little on certain unsteady

456
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.000
Dr Jameson: About, about your recovery, you've done. Great. So I just

457
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.690
Dr Jameson: Big tragedies are commonly

458
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:41.610
Dr Jameson: You know,

459
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.070
Dr Jameson: An excuse or, you know,

460
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:55.620
Dr Jameson: Anyway, I want to say like that. But, you know, it starts to become a, oh, well, I don't like this. So let me, let me just use a little while to get me through this and then off you go.

461
00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.200
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay. So we'll, we'll touch base next week at group.

462
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:10.710
Dr Jameson: I, well, is it something you want to talk about in group out loud or something you don't want to talk about or like I

463
00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:14.760
Jacob Cains: What do you how do you want me to. It don't matter to me. Okay.

464
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:15.540
Um,

465
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:29.010
Dr Jameson: I can tag it happened. Yeah, I can touch base with you privately if that would be more accountable for you. But, okay, well, so we'll see how things are settling, I guess. Are there, like funeral services and stuff happening.

466
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.150
Jacob Cains: Yeah, well, there's the

467
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:45.240
Jacob Cains: Attorneys and like attorneys all our stuff all the State attorney all this stuff as her body and stuff. So they're still doing whatever they do with it.

468
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.620
Jacob Cains: Okay.

469
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.130
Well, maybe.

470
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.080
Dr Jameson: That's called when they

471
00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.280
Jacob Cains: Well, I don't know, I guess, forensic almost sure what's

472
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.290
Jacob Cains: The investigations, but

473
00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:05.430
Dr Jameson: I don't know. I mean, but depending on if it was a violent death, sometimes it's not a situation where you're going to have a display anyway. Like sometimes you need to have

474
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.990
Jacob Cains: A moment you know more about memorial.

475
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.680
Dr Jameson: Service, then

476
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.530
Jacob Cains: Anyway, but, um, so that's

477
00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.570
Dr Jameson: Close Catholic. Yeah.

478
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.080
Dr Jameson: That's still up in the air, though. Yes. Yeah. Okay.

479
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.930
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, I don't know. Yeah. What do you say, so it's just

480
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.150
Jacob Cains: too terrible think

481
00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:41.400
Dr Jameson: You can know so. But just know we're here. And even if it's just to talk to somebody you know the people in the virtual clinic are generally trained in some some counseling type ways so crisis stuff, you know. So if you're

482
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.600
Jacob Cains: Really just

483
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.130
Dr Jameson: Talking somebody just give us a call. We're here.

484
00:35:50.250 --> 00:36:00.840
Dr Jameson: And appreciate. We'll touch base next week and group and see if it seems like maybe time to just just schedule and it doesn't mean you have to me with a counselor 27 times just maybe once or twice.

485
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.200
Jacob Cains: Like

486
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.130
Dr Jameson: Just to kind of

487
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.910
Dr Jameson: Help you process because you're, you're not supposed to know how to do that on your own. So

488
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.220
Dr Jameson: Don't, don't.

489
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:23.130
Dr Jameson: It's not a sign of weakness. It's a sign of being a human and compassionate person who you know doesn't tolerate tried you know it's just is too awful to think about. So

490
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.200
Dr Jameson: Okay.

491
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.060
Dr Jameson: So you're also with medicine.

492
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:31.800
Dr Jameson: Anything else that we can can help you with this point.

493
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.160
Jacob Cains: Yeah.

494
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.040
Dr Jameson: Oh, anything else that we can help you with at this point.

495
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:56.760
Jacob Cains: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure I let you knew what was going on to you. I think I just get Group two weeks.

496
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:13.230
Dr Jameson: Sarah. I appreciate it. Yeah, I was little, I was like, Haha That's funny, because I think yeah but um yeah just come next week and then we can we can alternate from here, but if you want or you can come every week for a while. Again, if things are crazy, which they probably will be for a while.

497
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.030
Dr Jameson: But it's up to. I mean, you don't have to buy

498
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:29.130
Dr Jameson: And I mean, it's hard because they have other people there. I'm sure that are equally distraught and then you have to see them me just, what do you say, you know, it's just, it's just a big

499
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.480
Jacob Cains: Yes, yeah.

500
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:37.170
Jacob Cains: Then you got you. But every time somebody dies think they knew

501
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.560
Jacob Cains: About it every time somebody dies or conducted woodworker. Oh.

502
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.100
Jacob Cains: Yeah, it drives me nuts.

503
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:53.010
Dr Jameson: Well, I think, I think that, yeah, I see what you're saying. I hear you. I think

504
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.240
Jacob Cains: Especially when something like this happens.

505
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:02.100
Dr Jameson: Once some attention house smells, as though. Yeah, well,

506
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:12.870
Dr Jameson: It could be that are, you know, I think you don't know what's in other people's minds anymore than they know what's in your so you know I think

507
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:22.740
Dr Jameson: Even someone you only knew casually when you hear that they were killed in such a senseless violent way. I think it's

508
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:29.790
Dr Jameson: You know, sometimes it's a way for it depends what they're doing. But if it's sometimes it's a way of just paying tribute to that person or

509
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:38.700
Dr Jameson: Offering condolences to the family, you know, like trying to help and and you know I don't know. So I don't know exactly what's happening or what you're referring to, but

510
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:45.510
Dr Jameson: You might get try to give people a little bit of benefit of doubt because they're probably feeling

511
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:50.850
Dr Jameson: in similar ways that that you are, you know, and I don't know that it's all self.

512
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.440
Dr Jameson: There may be some I think probably most people are actually trying to be helpful and

513
00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:58.920
Dr Jameson: You know,

514
00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.600
Dr Jameson: Kind of surround

515
00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:07.590
Dr Jameson: The people who have lost somebody so close with, you know, to try to support them, you know,

516
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:16.560
Dr Jameson: And I'm sure there are one or two people, you know, there's always, there's always a few rotten apples and in a bunch. Right, but I think

517
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.110
Anyway, it's, it's, it's, yeah. There's so many mixed emotions.

518
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.160
Are you there.

519
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:35.400
Jacob Cains: Yeah, actually, if you don't mind, I have to go swimming

520
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:36.450
Jacob Cains: I haven't

521
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:37.710
Dr Jameson: I have another patient

522
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.860
Dr Jameson: No problem. Hang in there, kiddo.

523
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:42.930
Dr Jameson: Sorry about this whole

524
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:46.080
Jacob Cains: Thing. All right, bye bye bye. Thank you.

Upset

530
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:21.060
Not quite processing yet. It sounds like still kind of in shock stage. Anyway, he missed group because he had just gotten this news that day.

531
00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:27.210
So this was just kind of an individual met check, given the situation.

532
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:40.080
Dr Jameson: Unfortunately connection was not great but mental status physical normal or UD severe he's got refills available, number one. Number two, grief reaction.

533
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.150

535
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:57.690
And just

536
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:12.480
Dr Jameson: reassured him that it's normal to have all the variety of feelings. He has and he's not supposed to just be able to handle this. Like I said nothing has happened.

537
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.830

556
00:42:54.750 --> 00:43:03.270
Dr Jameson: If we need to talk about how it works, how it works, and then see if it seems like a good fit for our program and your situation.

615
00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:02.640
Charles Dickens: About restless leg syndrome. I'm 40 years old, since I was like 25 I know I started the gabapentin when I was like 29

616
00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:15.330
Charles Dickens: But he said, that is the worst case he's ever seen, because I can't be true with medication because of the allergies.

617
00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.410
Dr Jameson: Side effects. Yeah.

Charles Dickens: So what happens with the restless leg syndrome is

619
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:30.390
Charles Dickens: Leads I've like violent spasms. Like, I can't even control them. Like, I will jump up and down in my bed. I'll kick my wife like

620
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:45.810
Charles Dickens: Like, not knowing not knowing it. I can't sleep. So then, at least, insomnia, I have sleep apnea. And if you're trimming. I can't keep the masculine, which I don't know why I have sleep apnea, because as much as I exercise now healthy. I am but

621
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.100
Charles Dickens: So I can't keep them the mask on. So then I'll

622
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.350
Charles Dickens: Stay up and then it just leads to an I have two small kids.

623
00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:02.970
Charles Dickens: Sleep deprivation and insomnia and then when I was working. I lost my job because of all this.

624
00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:20.820
Charles Dickens: So anyways, that's why we went to the opioids, because he's like, hey, I can kind of just numb you numb. You're numb your feet where the spasms start and and you can go to sleep so

625
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.450
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that's how you ended up on opioids.

626
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:37.020
Charles Dickens: Yeah, so also about three years ago I had a ski accident. Like, I don't know what happened. I don't remember. I woke up in the hospital.

627
00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:44.370
Charles Dickens: I was bleeding from my ear. I was wearing a helmet, but my buddies found me and

628
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:51.990
Charles Dickens: Since that that was April 3 of 2017 since that

629
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:54.540
Charles Dickens: Head injury.

630
00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.980
Charles Dickens: More the allergy started

631
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:07.110
Charles Dickens: Medication and more of the like mood swings started and the Restless Leg Syndrome. Got a lot worse.

632
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:19.620
Charles Dickens: My neurologist, like he refused to say anything. So after they diagnosed me with a concussion and then I missed two months of work because I went into post concussive syndrome.

633
00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:30.480
Charles Dickens: Well, my apologies. He refused to admit had anything to do with TBI or or the head injury. He's just like your this is all restless leg syndrome so

634
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.840
Charles Dickens: I think it's probably a combination of both, but

635
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:35.670
OK.

636
00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:46.680
Dr Jameson: OK. And then, I think, are there more medications still to that you had side effects from I'm

637
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:47.550
Charles Dickens: Trying to think

638
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.710
Charles Dickens: That's a fair if. How many do you have now.

639
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:56.670
Dr Jameson: Will not 12 12346 No seven.

640
00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.360
Dr Jameson: Well, if you're counting off the content and oxy code on separately. I don't know.

641
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.730
Dr Jameson: How you're counting them.

642
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:13.920
Charles Dickens: Well, and then Percocet.

643
00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:16.320
Dr Jameson: That's actually caught on to

644
00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:34.830
Charles Dickens: What any of the audio so best all the opioids. I don't know any of the I can't think of any of the other opioids, but any of the opioids. I'm going to, they just make me. Okay, so that's what I was saying sorry. So any they'll be always I'm allergic to, and then

645
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:43.470
Charles Dickens: What happens is I get addicted to opioids, but I don't really know it because I don't take more than I'm prescribed

646
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.280
Dr Jameson: Mm hmm.

647
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:45.150
I don't

648
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.710
Dr Jameson: That's, that's what they do. That's what they do. Yeah.

649
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:51.570
Charles Dickens: But I don't like

650
00:51:53.100 --> 00:52:00.960
Charles Dickens: Go out to like get more methadone or oxy or paragraph. I never do their mind Suboxone so but then

651
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:14.520
Charles Dickens: My body craves it at one time, but then I'm also going through withdrawals because it wants more. And then I'll take and that's what's going on now with the Suboxone I stopped it. And then, you know,

652
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.980
Dr Jameson: Does it cause some sort of side effect when you're

653
00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:21.480
Dr Jameson: Taking it. I mean, that's what what what we call that as a physical dependence.

654
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:41.580
Dr Jameson: And you can be physically dependent to medication doesn't necessarily create an addict type behaviors like the buying and buying and taking more than you're saying you're taking. And, you know, that kind of stuff. But being physically dependent is very common. Unfortunately, and so

655
00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:45.300
Dr Jameson: I was actually wondering when you were seeing

656
00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:51.750
Dr Jameson: Some of these with vomiting and diarrhea that can be for some people, a symptom of withdrawal.

657
00:52:53.190 --> 00:53:00.390
Dr Jameson: So I don't know if you get the vomiting, diarrhea, when you're taking those medications or when you stop taking those medications.

658
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:08.580
Charles Dickens: Stop. No, no. Oh, so so I use. I was a cop, which we'll get to that. I lost my job because I got paranoid at work.

659
00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:25.410
Charles Dickens: Is I've seen people come off heroin and methadone yeah exactly what you've seen people come off of methadone. That's what I went through when we were tapering to go off of it. The like violent diarrhea and the sleeping like all that stuff.

660
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.240
Dr Jameson: You're talking about Suboxone

661
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.350
Charles Dickens: Or methadone.

662
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:29.460
Dr Jameson: Oh methadone. Okay.

663
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:38.850
Charles Dickens: Hello. That's why they put me on the Suboxone because the Methadone was just like absolutely destroying my life. Um, but

664
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:48.060
Charles Dickens: The diarrhea and vomiting on everything except methadone was just regular usage. Okay.

665
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:49.710
Dr Jameson: So as I stopped it.

666
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:58.410
Charles Dickens: When I happened with methadone was either tapering down to get off of it, or when I went cold turkey.

667
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:08.130
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that's a withdrawal. That's not a side that's well I guess it's a side effect in the sense that it may do physically dependent on what

668
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:15.540
Dr Jameson: You're that's a side effect of the medication, I guess, but it's more the lack of that medication that's causing your body to and it's

669
00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:26.370
Dr Jameson: I mean, eventually, it would stop, but it's really uncomfortable. Obviously, while it's happening. But the psychotic stuff and the suicidality, that was while you were taking it or while you were taping tapering

670
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:38.220
Charles Dickens: Um, so I was taking risks, I was on and what also with mineralogist an addiction specialist is very confusing to them.

671
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:53.100
Charles Dickens: But I explained, everyone's different is I'll tell you my dosages, and they're not very high. But I don't, for whatever reason, overall medication. I have an issue with. So I was on 20 milligrams of methadone.

672
00:54:54.570 --> 00:55:01.020
Charles Dickens: And the neurologist is like that's the lowest dosage for restless leg syndrome. Like, you're not gonna have any issues.

673
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:16.680
Charles Dickens: While I'm at work, and I'm a cop and I'm seeing shit. That ain't there and I'm should be seeing stuff that is there that I'm not AND I'M GETTING PARANOID then I'm hearing like my kids being raped and murdered and my wife.

674
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:29.430
Charles Dickens: And then the neurologist is like okay well let's take her you down from 20 to 10 but that took like three months and I had to. I had to miss work because that

675
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:40.050
Charles Dickens: I don't, I don't think you should wish methadone withdrawals on any of your enemies like this was horrible. So then I got down to 10

676
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:48.000
Charles Dickens: And I liked it. I still didn't like the way it made me feel and maybe paranoid made me. It kind of

677
00:55:51.990 --> 00:56:02.700
Charles Dickens: I couldn't really think straight. So that's why I tried to Claude a pin in the Cymbalta and the lyric and all that. So then I'm like, Hey, what are the other two options. He said bins those. And I'm like, I'm not doing bins. I was man.

678
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:17.040
Charles Dickens: And as, like, what about what about marijuana like a vague and he's like, well, I don't think the researches and out there yet, but I won't say no. So go ahead. So then around like October I started debate.

679
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:31.140
Charles Dickens: At night, I would. So we were at 10 milligrams. I was doing 10 milligrams and then the vapor before I would go to bed and for like three weeks. I kind of got I felt fine.

680
00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:42.450
Charles Dickens: He told me to stay off work until January, and it had been like four and a half months. And I'm like, Whatever, man. I feel fine. I was back up to run in like three, four times a week and all this.

681
00:56:43.920 --> 00:57:01.890
Charles Dickens: I get back to work and I just started getting paranoid. Again, I started seeing stuff that wasn't there. I'm telling him I was at Kaiser Kaiser is whatever it's called calmer and whatever you want to say it's like they really only care about like

682
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:04.800
Charles Dickens: I don't know, it's just out

683
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:22.230
Charles Dickens: I never really wanted to go on opioids and I really wanted to be in this situation, and that's part of my frustration is that I'm here because I felt that they didn't listen to me. But, and I'm telling him like, Hey, I'm paranoid. I think they're going to get rid of me like

684
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:29.340
Charles Dickens: Some stuff like that I presented at work was true.

685
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:40.890
Charles Dickens: You'd have your own opinions, like what you see on the news is not everything how cops are, but I was a cop for six years. I know how stuff works behind closed doors.

686
00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:59.730
Charles Dickens: And there's a certain way that people should be treated well I don't like racial epithets I don't like people talking about fucking my wife. I don't like people saying you've been here for two years. Don't talk to me and all this all this traditional for eternity stuff well

687
00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:09.180
Charles Dickens: I kind of put my foot down. Also like being paranoid, like, hey, these guys are looking at me and all this. I've been gone for four months.

688
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:19.590
Charles Dickens: All this thinking that people were dedicated we kind of had like a meeting of, like, Hey, what's going on. And I'm like, Well, I don't, I'm not going to work at a place that

689
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:29.550
Charles Dickens: Its military like I'm not working at a place where if you speak up your mind you're going to be like Trump and fire everyone do all this stuff well

690
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:39.270
Charles Dickens: The next day they were like, hey, it's time to go like, you can leave or we're going to get rid of you, like, you're not going to sit here and bad mouth people. And I'm like,

691
00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:50.880
Charles Dickens: All right, so then I'll follow up monitor neurologist. It took seven weeks to get an appointment, because he's like whatever will in between that time I

692
00:58:52.440 --> 00:59:02.280
Charles Dickens: The 10 milligrams of methadone just it just wasn't working, it wasn't. I knew it wasn't enough for my body, but I couldn't go off the withdrawals, because it was I just couldn't handle it.

693
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:13.560
Charles Dickens: So then on my birthday on January 5 my wife and I are out to dinner and stuff. And I just got paranoid again and the suicidal ideations and

694
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:34.320
Charles Dickens: I feel like the withdrawal symptoms, the restless leg syndrome was as too much to handle. I couldn't sleep hot all the time. And then like freezing cold and then we went to the emergency room and they were trying to put me on hold and all this stuff and was like,

695
00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:47.100
Charles Dickens: Never said, I actually wanted to kill myself. I'm saying, like the pain is so bad and you all don't listen. Like, where's the neurology neurologists, like I've showed them emails like hey

696
00:59:48.000 --> 01:00:03.570
Charles Dickens: I think like I'm having suicidal ideation since the Methadone please help me. And he would email back. I'll see when I see when I can. I'll see when I can get you and get you in. So then I'm telling them at the ER like

697
01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:08.760
Charles Dickens: All you all doctors do is talk about, Hey, tell us what's going on. So we can help you.

698
01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:20.040
Charles Dickens: Well, I'm telling you, like this is like the fifth time I've been in the ER for the same shit. The same reason. And you all release me to go back to my neurologist and I see him like

699
01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:29.070
Charles Dickens: Three times a year, and you'll tweak my medication, a little bit. And it's not enough. So then that's when they brought in that addiction specialist

700
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:45.480
Charles Dickens: And he's like, All right, well the reason why no doctors want to talk to you is, you're too much of a liability, like you you terminologies you have too many suicidal ideations you have all this. No one wants to deal with you and so

701
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.990
Charles Dickens: That so

702
01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:53.370
Dr Jameson: Did the addiction specialist talk to you about the Suboxone or like how

703
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:56.760
Charles Dickens: They put me on a soapbox and then

704
01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.210
Charles Dickens: That was on my mind.

705
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:01.050
Dr Jameson: Last month,

706
01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:11.580
Charles Dickens: Yeah. So what happened is, then they brought in the psychiatrists and they were like, hey, we know you're Kaiser is ending. So I switched to anthem, my wife's insurance because I lost my job.

707
01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:24.240
Charles Dickens: And they were like, hey, we know you fill in between. For the last three years with the opioids and all this. We're going to make sure you transition perfectly from Kaiser

708
01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:25.860
Well,

709
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:36.900
Charles Dickens: Good evening. Yeah, I'm the one that did all this work. Yeah, he, he wouldn't refill my Suboxone I actually have my neurologist, he actually did it before I left.

710
01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:54.750
Charles Dickens: Nobody would fill out disability paperwork. I finally got the neurologist, so I got denied unemployment, because they said I'm disabled and then I got denied disability because they said you're not disabled. So I'm dealing with all that crap I

711
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.890
Dr Jameson: What I've heard is that they always deny that first application for disability.

712
01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:10.890
Charles Dickens: Well. Well, part of it is the part of it. The reason why they denied it. I know is so my doctor put me off the neurologist, put me off for a year, but he backdated it to July when I first was off.

713
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:22.740
Charles Dickens: As I was off from July to November and the state granted me disability but then they said, go back to your employer because your employers, is it will pay more.

714
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:29.340
Charles Dickens: My employer denied me because of pre existing condition because it's I've

715
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.620
Charles Dickens: All everything I've been treated for has been going on for 15 years so they denied me

716
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:49.500
Charles Dickens: So the doctor read neurologist redid the paperwork, all the way back to the last July. So they're like you haven't been disabled. So I had to put everything together that I wasn't paid so I wasn't paid. I wasn't paid for four months. Right.

717
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.650
Charles Dickens: So so anyways.

718
01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.870
Dr Jameson: It's very complicated and frustrating.

719
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:56.970
Charles Dickens: Exactly so.

720
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:02.790
Charles Dickens: Then when he wouldn't feel my Suboxone. I'm like, Well, fuck it. I'm just gonna go off of it.

721
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:04.800
Dr Jameson: Now, well that's

722
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:08.670
Charles Dickens: I'm glad that didn't get it lasted about five days and then it was

723
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:09.210
Yeah.

724
01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:10.650
Charles Dickens: Yeah.

725
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:17.490
Charles Dickens: But I don't even I probably can't even imagine probably what was in my urine sample my blood system because

726
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:28.890
Charles Dickens: One night I was like the withdrawals are so bad because I didn't want to take the Suboxone so I was like, all right, I'll try to, I'll try to, I'll try the weed the weed didn't work. And I'm like, all right, I'll try a couple

727
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:37.770
Charles Dickens: Tylenol threes. They didn't work. So then I'm like, I like one in the morning and my wife was out of town. So she was gone for five days for work. So

728
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:43.260
Charles Dickens: So I'm here with the kids. So I'm like, all right, I have to make sure I can be stable for my kids like I can't

729
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:56.220
Charles Dickens: So then I went back on the Suboxone because it is. And I've been mostly Okay back on the Suboxone I just don't like the way because I'll have good days and bad days. But if I'm off the Suboxone I don't have any good days right

730
01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:11.100
Dr Jameson: So the withdrawal from any opiate, be it heroin Fenton no coding Tramadol like the strongest stuff the weekend stuff Suboxone method don't like the withdrawal. The same. I mean,

731
01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:12.480
Charles Dickens: Magic to Tramadol

732
01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:25.230
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so the receptors. They all go to the same part of your brain. Some of them are stronger than others. Some of you know, but they. Some of them are shorter acting. Some of them are longer acting, but they all cause the same physical dependence and the symptoms.

733
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:40.140
Dr Jameson: When you stop whatever whichever one of them. It is including Suboxone will be the same. The Suboxone is takes longer to come on, as you as you've learned, because it's a longer lasting medication, but

734
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:48.210
Dr Jameson: They are all opiates end of the day, and they all cause physical dependence. If they're used long term.

735
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.790
Charles Dickens: But I'm only on two milligrams

736
01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:52.740
Dr Jameson: Once a day or twice.

737
01:04:53.040 --> 01:05:01.950
Charles Dickens: Once that I changed it to before I go to bed. I used to take it at like 4pm just and then I picked the girls up from school. And I just, it was just

738
01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:07.080
Charles Dickens: Mood swings and all that. But now, since I've changed it before I go to bed. It's better but

739
01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:14.970
Charles Dickens: Because he tried me on eight so well. First he put me on the patch for like three days and I was high. I was just, it was

740
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:30.120
Charles Dickens: High as could be like, and I mean high. He's like, Oh, let's just keep doing it. And I'm just like, dude, I'm highly I am completely hot so we took that off after three days. And then I started the tongue ones.

741
01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:42.960
Charles Dickens: So for three days. I did like eight milligrams and it's I had it was like a hammer in my head, trying to come out and just and like flu like symptoms and he's just like,

742
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:57.120
Charles Dickens: I don't send that I don't believe you. I've never heard of this before. And I'm like, dude, I'm, I'm telling you, like, I don't. I want to like jump out of building the pain is so high. So then he switched it to four milligrams and it was the same problem of

743
01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:05.640
Charles Dickens: The pain in the head and all that so that when he went to to it slowly got better and better and better. So

744
01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:15.210
Charles Dickens: So when I last talked to him. He's like, there's, I don't even know how like two milligrams is working for you. And I'm like,

745
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:23.430
Charles Dickens: You're the one that told me in the beginning. Yeah, I'm I'm this weird patient and no one wants to talk to me like I'm telling you, like,

746
01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:39.570
Charles Dickens: And then he's and then they were like, well, I think your paranoia and all that has to do with marijuana and I'm like, No, dude, I didn't start the marijuana until like November or the end of October, like that had nothing that and it's just my opinion. I'm saying that nothing to do with

747
01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:44.580
Dr Jameson: Well, I could make it worse potential possibly i mean

748
01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:45.780
Sometimes

749
01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.220
Charles Dickens: Yeah, I

750
01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:52.770
Dr Jameson: See what you're saying. Like you have the symptom before you started that. So it can't all be from that, that's for sure.

751
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:59.370
Charles Dickens: With the marijuana, things got better. Yeah, like with so well but

752
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.080
Dr Jameson: It is associated with

753
01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.270
Dr Jameson: Delusions and paranoia, though, so

754
01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.520
Charles Dickens: Yeah.

755
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.210
Charles Dickens: I used to smoke in college and I never

756
01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.700
Charles Dickens: Thought I never had, like,

757
01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.400
Charles Dickens: Us or anything. So yeah, let's go.

758
01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:33.840
Dr Jameson: I mean, I guess the the thing to keep in mind they say is that the marijuana keeps getting stronger and stronger, you know, like they keep on concentrating it more. So sometimes anyway I that's okay, that's fine. Um, since you've been on the Suboxone. Have you been paranoid still

759
01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:39.420
Charles Dickens: Yeah, a little bit. But I went off of it twice, and

760
01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:54.120
Charles Dickens: Like two weeks ago, I just my wife and I mean we're like, okay, where I could get a divorce. So my wife's an attorney and she's the head of her phone very powerful woman very strong willed.

761
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.510
Charles Dickens: But doesn't understand addiction, so

762
01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:15.060
Charles Dickens: Think of, I mean, she's a powerful attorney and I used to be a federal agent. So that's how we met. So you have former social worker federal agent, where we're both highly intelligent

763
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:35.550
Charles Dickens: But I'm patient and kind of laid back well used to be and she's very like just gung ho and straightforward. She, she doesn't. She thinks like oh, take this pill. Your finer Oh, just stop it and suck it up for like two weeks and you'll be fine. And she just doesn't understand that but

764
01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:38.670
Charles Dickens: The other

765
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.130
Charles Dickens: Like two weeks ago.

766
01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:48.480
Charles Dickens: We got into a fight in the morning because the both the girls are sick because there's huge virus going around.

767
01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.290
Charles Dickens: And I'm like,

768
01:08:54.030 --> 01:09:00.180
Charles Dickens: Well, you've been sick for a week. Now, you feel fine. Like, I'm not going to be this fucking house husband like

769
01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:09.840
Charles Dickens: Every single time. And this kind of goes back to when I was working two is every single time. The girls are sick. She's like, You have to take off work.

770
01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:20.850
Charles Dickens: Because I'm the boss. Right. I'm like, this should don't that's not gonna fly with me. And I want to tell you, like, the more problems I have with these opioids like shits gonna hit the fan one day well

771
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:36.510
Charles Dickens: I was like, I don't feel well. Like I don't know what's going on. I don't know if you all got me sick or this is the Suboxone but i'm not i need to sleep like i don't i don't feel well. So I got up like a couple hours later and

772
01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:48.420
Charles Dickens: She we got into like this huge fight. So I come from, like, a very, very, very bad childhood and she from like a perfect childhood and

773
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:58.620
Charles Dickens: I don't want to fight or argue in front of my kids. So I got so pissed off that I just left the house and I'm just like, fuck this like

774
01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:06.480
Charles Dickens: And which I've never done before and I told her, like if I leave the house. It's going to be really bad news. So my friend has already come over took all my guns.

775
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:21.180
Charles Dickens: Because I asked him to I don't just in case I'm not, I don't have those type of thoughts or anything, but I don't need that stuff around. So I was just like, I'm just, I need to get away, and she kept calling me and I'm like,

776
01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:30.450
Charles Dickens: She's like, oh, everything's okay and I'm like, it's not okay because she doesn't know how to talk to me when I get upset like because he doesn't understand. She just really think

777
01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:40.470
Charles Dickens: And she's just like, I don't. Why can't you be like you used to be and I told you not to get on the opioids. I don't do that. I'm like, but you aren't at the doctor's appointments

778
01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:49.620
Charles Dickens: So if you're not at the doctor's appointments, you can't. Six months later, say, Why are you on this drug like you don't understand the pain that I go through

779
01:10:50.190 --> 01:11:05.520
Charles Dickens: To even do what I do throughout a day that so you think it's very easy to be like, hey, just go live your life and do this. And she's like, I need to see how many jobs, you've applied for because because we

780
01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.150
Charles Dickens: We were very well off, we have

781
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:21.840
Charles Dickens: Millions of dollars in real estate and all this. And now, like we're getting behind financially and all that stuff. And she'll say, like, hey, I need you to address your

782
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:31.800
Charles Dickens: Medical stuff, but you need to get back to work. As soon as you can. I'm like, that's been the problem I keep going back to work too early for the last three years since the ski accident so

783
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:49.110
Charles Dickens: I just, I was like, completely paranoid. So I just went to the flight Ferry Building and just sit there and like walked around and looked at the ships and all that stuff. And I'm just like, I don't like why can't she like understand or anything, and

784
01:11:51.300 --> 01:12:02.970
Charles Dickens: I'd stopped the Suboxone and I'm like, all right, well, maybe this is because I'm not on the Suboxone. So I went back on it again and things seem to get a little bit better so

785
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.820
Charles Dickens: I mean,

786
01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:09.120
Dr Jameson: Are you on any other medications. Besides, it. Awesome.

787
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:17.670
Charles Dickens: Now, they just the neurologists, try to put me on like Wellbutrin and I'm like dude like this is

788
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:19.680
Charles Dickens: Like

789
01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:35.010
Charles Dickens: I know I'm contradicting myself because as a social worker, and I understand the social stigma and all this and he's like telling my wife like restless leg syndrome and opioids can lead to depression like trolls, you probably have to be depressed and I'm like,

790
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:53.250
Charles Dickens: Well, the thing is, it's like everything is like so frustrating. Like you're 40 years old, you have a three and a four year old who like you can't give them what you want. Now you can't say for their college. You can't go on vacations and do all this stuff because

791
01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:01.590
Charles Dickens: Doctors like you're not you. I'm talking about no matter all just like I told you I didn't want to be on opioids. And then when I told you I was paranoid and

792
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:12.660
Charles Dickens: All this stuff that I completely understand like eating candy for like three straight days. That's when I knew that methadone was wrong. I'm like, Oh, holy shit i'm i'm addicted.

793
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:25.980
Charles Dickens: Like you all didn't listen. So now I've lost my job, my marriage is really problematic and then now when I'm never going to see you again. You're like, oh, take this Wellbutrin. It's like

794
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:37.110
Charles Dickens: I need to get off opioids, so I don't need to be on anti-psychotics or whatever. That's just my opinion because if I can get off the opioids.

795
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:47.610
Charles Dickens: I think that I'll be okay and his thing is, you'll never be off anything because you're restless leg syndrome. It's too. There's something wrong with your own

796
01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.330
Dr Jameson: They done

797
01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:54.180
Dr Jameson: Sorry to interrupt you. Have they done like workshops for a seizure disorders and stuff like that going to be at ease and all that.

798
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:59.700
Charles Dickens: Yeah so October 2008 18

799
01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.770
Charles Dickens: I was washing my two year old at the time and I collapsed in the house.

800
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:21.000
Charles Dickens: Sorry, having a seizure. I was able to call my wife this when I was on Percocet and the fire department broken my house and I'm like having a seizure and all this. They take me to the hospital and to Kaiser and

801
01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:24.510
Charles Dickens: It started this huge

802
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:29.790
Charles Dickens: fight between doctors, so

803
01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:38.370
Charles Dickens: They in the ER they determine there's three things going on. You still have post concussive syndrome.

804
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:53.550
Charles Dickens: You have TBI from the ski accident or you're addicted to opioids. So they did all these tests like psychological testing. I went to counseling. I went to. I had heart test had blood test I had

805
01:14:54.390 --> 01:15:08.700
Charles Dickens: Vestibular tests where they were like checking my ears and my balance and everything and they came back everything. They were like, you're addicted to opioids, like that's what all this is yeah you a lot of your stuff from opioids.

806
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:30.450
Charles Dickens: Is kind of the same thing as your TBI and depression. So that's why everyone probably thinks you're mentally ill. So they referred me right back to the neurologist, who's the head of Kaiser in California. So I can't speak bad about him. So when everyone

807
01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.910
Charles Dickens: referred back to him. He went right back to, well, this is the medication.

808
01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.480
Charles Dickens: Let's just budget and I was in so much pain. So that's what I agreed to go on a method. Oh, yeah.

809
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:48.420
Dr Jameson: So, okay, but so they they did check you for they did the eg where they put all the electrodes on your

810
01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:48.810
Charles Dickens: Head.

811
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:50.940
Charles Dickens: They did like to sleep test, they did.

812
01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.470
Dr Jameson: That's how they found them out to sleep.

813
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:53.160
Dr Jameson: I man. Okay.

814
01:15:54.630 --> 01:16:07.140
Dr Jameson: I have seen people actually I just had a lady yesterday came in and she I got the sense that maybe she like doesn't metabolize the way that most people do. And like things build up in her system.

815
01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:16.290
Dr Jameson: So maybe you're some similar to that. Like some people just are missing an enzyme or something. And so they don't clear the medicine at the like normal.

816
01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:26.490
Dr Jameson: Rate, you know, and then metabolites build up that are toxic and sometimes, sometimes there's that going on, and especially somebody that's had so many medications cause

817
01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:35.280
Dr Jameson: Problems. It does kind of make you wonder, you know, there's something about the way your body processes, that's a little bit different than most people.

818
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:37.380
Dr Jameson: Um,

819
01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:44.400
Dr Jameson: The other so when you're taking the Suboxone two milligrams at that time you do a strip or a tablet.

820
01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:48.870
Charles Dickens: Strip. So, I still have the eight milligrams and just cut them into four

821
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:49.440
Dr Jameson: Okay.

822
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:52.380
Dr Jameson: Well, they come into so it might be easier.

823
01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:54.270
Charles Dickens: And

824
01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:59.430
Dr Jameson: You might even be able to cut that if you wanted to. Have you ever tried. It's hard to cut it into too many pieces, I guess.

825
01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:02.910
Dr Jameson: You haven't tried the lower dose then to right

826
01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:07.710
Charles Dickens: Now, I've never done. I mean, I've thought about like how to taper but

827
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:08.160
Yeah.

828
01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:13.800
Dr Jameson: Well, you're just saying it still causes some funny thoughts. That sounds like

829
01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:23.730
Charles Dickens: Yeah, I mean, and here because like I know Bo is maybe not in the beginning, but I'll eventually know that it's

830
01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:29.550
Charles Dickens: The withdrawal symptoms like on. Oh, that it is, but then it's like

831
01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:37.110
Charles Dickens: Like, like I said last week, my wife had to go to Palm Springs for five days for work. So it's like

832
01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:46.590
Charles Dickens: I had to go back on it, so I could take care. I can't have like a flip out with the three and a four year old because not not safe. Yeah.

833
01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:51.780
Dr Jameson: Well, so the paranoid thoughts are when you're not taking the Suboxone or when you are

834
01:17:53.370 --> 01:18:02.040
Charles Dickens: When I'm not apparently that was with methadone and oxy codeine and all that I had. I don't have it with the box now.

835
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:03.960
Dr Jameson: Except if you stop it.

836
01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.240
Charles Dickens: Correct. Ah, OK.

837
01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:11.250
Dr Jameson: So some people that are part of withdrawal. It's like agitation.

838
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:12.270
Charles Dickens: Oh, yes.

839
01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:15.300
Dr Jameson: Risk restlessness insomnia.

840
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:19.560
Dr Jameson: You know, the hot and the cold, which you probably I think you mentioned that already.

841
01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:21.780
Charles Dickens: Bad back pain.

842
01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:24.600
Dr Jameson: I was just gonna say generalized pain.

843
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:38.820
Dr Jameson: Basically all the things that opioids do like pain relief making you sleepy relaxing things, making you constipated. Apparently, they have to do with your temperature control.

844
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:57.060
Dr Jameson: Because when you do anyway when you take them away like all the opposite things happen. It's, it's like you've had brakes on with the with the medication. And so your body has been revving up to, to maintain its normal speed it's had to work harder. And when you suddenly remove the brakes.

845
01:18:58.230 --> 01:19:08.880
Dr Jameson: It's still working harder. So all of a sudden, everything goes crazy. And it takes a good long while, for all the receptors to like reset themselves back to the original thermostat.

846
01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:20.760
Dr Jameson: That makes sense. Maybe you already know that, but that's okay. So, and then, um, so let me so you're not on any other medication justice Suboxone correct

847
01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:25.020
Charles Dickens: No i mean i i am

848
01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:34.500
Charles Dickens: So I did. Like I said, I did. I'm just telling you this, to be honest, not because I don't, I'm not here to hiding, I think. Yeah.

849
01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:35.760
Dr Jameson: Thank you.

850
01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:45.720
Charles Dickens: I did take the tunnel threes to help with the withdrawals. And then I started back with the marijuana. I was off the marijuana for a while because I was like, I gotta get a job and then I just

851
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:55.470
Charles Dickens: I have. I can't do just a Suboxone i mean i got people emailing me now for interviews for jobs. So I know I'm gonna have to stop the marijuana and soon but

852
01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:01.890
Charles Dickens: It's I don't do it to get high. I do it like it relaxes me and then I take the Suboxone and then I go to sleep.

853
01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:15.570
Charles Dickens: It doesn't. I mean, it helps with the restless leg syndrome. But you can't really sleep, even on Suboxone but that could just be doing the general anxiety that I have with my life right now. Yeah.

854
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:27.690
Dr Jameson: Okay. Have you ever had, like, going back to, you know, like general we got the restless leg, the sleep apnea. The head injury. Any other medical history, prior to all that

855
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.870
Charles Dickens: So when I was eight years old, I had, I don't remember, but my parents told me

856
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:50.850
Charles Dickens: I remember this. But my older brother kicked me in the face, the soccer ball. We were playing soccer and I went into the house and I was like, bleeding profusely out of my nose and my dad like clean me up or whatever. And that night.

857
01:20:53.100 --> 01:21:08.190
Charles Dickens: He said, I was just sitting up in my bed like like a zombie. My mom, who was the first female coffee Kentucky came home took me to the ER. I don't remember any of this. And they, I was there for like two weeks.

858
01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:22.140
Charles Dickens: I remember like after a few days the hospital, but I remember the first few days and I i had a massive seizure and they said I was fighting in the hospital and all that. I don't remember that.

859
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:27.420
Charles Dickens: So I had some type of massive seizure memory loss.

860
01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:29.730
Charles Dickens: And

861
01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:38.820
Charles Dickens: So I got discharged after like two or three weeks and then everything was okay and then around like

862
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:55.170
Charles Dickens: 12 years old 13 years old I was playing football and I just started getting really, really, really bad migraines and I had to quit sports in in middle school and the beginning of high school and I got sent to

863
01:21:56.970 --> 01:21:59.400
Charles Dickens: Vanderbilt you know Vanderbilt right

864
01:21:59.520 --> 01:21:59.850
Dr Jameson: Uh huh.

865
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:05.640
Charles Dickens: So I got sent to some head specialist there. And he was saying that

866
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:13.110
Charles Dickens: Well, I think I got sent there after the seizure anyways because I'm from a small town in Kentucky. They don't know what the hell they're doing

867
01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:19.740
Charles Dickens: So they were he was saying like after the seizures, like a couple months after when I was at Vanderbilt.

868
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:33.090
Charles Dickens: The longer time goes, the less likely. He'll have another massive seizure, but other head trauma may come, you know, whatever. So a couple years later when the headache started my mom. We went back to Vanderbilt.

869
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:41.730
Charles Dickens: And they were did a bunch of all the head tests and stuff like that. And they're like, we can't see any reason why he's having any of these migraines or

870
01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:54.570
Charles Dickens: Memory problems and things like that. So I stopped sports and then when I was like a sophomore, junior in high school, like the headaches went away. So

871
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.040
Dr Jameson: So you don't have those anymore.

872
01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:09.630
Charles Dickens: No, I mean, that was so then that was like I was like 15 or 16 they went away and then

873
01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:18.390
Charles Dickens: The migraines and stuff started back when I was like 2526 maybe like 27

874
01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:24.720
Charles Dickens: And I had those for like a couple years, and I would go to the as with Kaiser

875
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:31.620
Charles Dickens: And then we give me shot in my butt with for like migraines.

876
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:41.040
Charles Dickens: And then eventually, that is, they went away again. And then the Russell's leg syndrome started. So after that so

877
01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:49.800
Dr Jameson: So. So back when you were a kid, they must have done they so you were diagnosed with a seizure disorder. It sounds like

878
01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:51.270
Well,

879
01:23:52.320 --> 01:24:03.300
Charles Dickens: My mom actually sent me all that stuff like a couple months ago, the stuff from the doctor. And that's how I actually remember everything they said he, he had wrote, she had his doctor's notes and

880
01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:14.490
Charles Dickens: They were saying was a one time event. So as long as I didn't have another one. So the longer time passed, the less likely to have a seizure again well

881
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:19.740
Charles Dickens: I never that I know of. I wasn't diagnosed with the seeds. They were saying it was a one time.

882
01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:20.400
Dr Jameson: Event.

883
01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.350
Charles Dickens: And getting hit in the face with the soccer ball.

884
01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:27.510
Dr Jameson: But then you've had more seizure since then so

885
01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:31.860
Charles Dickens: But on opioids. Right.

886
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:39.810
Dr Jameson: Well, but, you know, so some people. This happened to my sister in law. Some people have like a little bit of seizure activity.

887
01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:55.530
Dr Jameson: Like very mild and they need some certain needs to be there, but they're more prone to having a see like it's easier to get somebody to have a seizure than somebody else. And so again, I mean, but again, I'm not a neurologist and I don't know how to read eg I've also heard of rare.

888
01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:06.270
Dr Jameson: Seizures that cause mood changes, like if it's a certain part of your brain. It can affect your how you think and not necessarily make you shake

889
01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:07.980
Dr Jameson: So,

890
01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:09.510
Dr Jameson: Rare

891
01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:16.170
Charles Dickens: I played college football for two years and I can. I know for a fact.

892
01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.430
Dr Jameson: bonked a lot. Yeah.

893
01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:28.380
Charles Dickens: I know for a fact I've been knocked out and got in, because you that's how it was back then. So it's like what 17 years ago 18 years ago 19 so I know that I've

894
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:39.240
Charles Dickens: I don't, I would probably at least say three or concussions maybe or your bell rung or whatever. But I know I've been knocked out.

895
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:44.010
Charles Dickens: And then like, oh, get up and you go on and play so

896
01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:48.630
Charles Dickens: I know that I've had those head injury. Well,

897
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:51.570
Dr Jameson: Has anybody ever asked you.

898
01:25:51.570 --> 01:25:54.060
Dr Jameson: Ever you ever asked me about what is it

899
01:25:55.350 --> 01:26:00.030
Charles Dickens: What is it CB. What does it CVT CB ticket. Yeah.

900
01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:09.330
Charles Dickens: I mean, I, I've shared everything with the neurologist, they said that I didn't play long enough.

901
01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:11.160
Dr Jameson: That's funny.

902
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.340
Charles Dickens: They're all saying that there's everyone

903
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:16.500
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so you said you're going to be seeing a

904
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:17.880
Dr Jameson: New neurologist, is that right

905
01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.090
Charles Dickens: Yeah, but he's saying, so he's trying to give me one.

906
01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:23.640
Charles Dickens: At Stanford.

907
01:26:23.730 --> 01:26:26.340
Charles Dickens: And then give me one that's like two blocks from my house.

908
01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:31.260
Charles Dickens: But this this doctor is this neurologist is

909
01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.360
Charles Dickens: Is it's just, he's not very reliable. I'll just say that

910
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.210
Dr Jameson: Well can you call yourself and turning and appointments

911
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:41.400
Charles Dickens: Yeah, they won't do it without a referral.

912
01:26:43.050 --> 01:26:43.650
Charles Dickens: And they

913
01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:48.660
Dr Jameson: But I don't think it has to come from a neurologist. It just has to come from. Usually the referrals from a primary care.

914
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:56.310
Charles Dickens: Only neurologist. Okay. Yeah, I know, I went, That's another great Socratic stuff that I went through actually

915
01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:08.340
Charles Dickens: A primary care doctor to at Kaiser and he wouldn't even do it. He's like, I'm not a neurologist, so I'm not going to refer you to the neurologist, but I'm like you referred me to this neurologist. He's like, Oh, I can't do non Kaiser neurologists

916
01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:12.900
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's what it is. Well, they can't refer outside but now you don't have Kaiser anymore.

917
01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:22.290
Charles Dickens: Correct. But they won't even take a primary care doctor with anthem, the only taken the only take neurologists to neurologist. Okay.

918
01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.800
Dr Jameson: Okay. Must be some special super duper neurologists

919
01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:41.130
Charles Dickens: Well, my wife's best friend is some bigwig Kaiser and they're like, you have the addiction specialist and the neurologist, that's who. Everybody wants. And if the only person that complains about him and

920
01:27:41.730 --> 01:27:46.560
Charles Dickens: She's like, I understand why you complain about him, but I'm like, Well, I'm just must be

921
01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:48.570
Charles Dickens: Like

922
01:27:49.950 --> 01:28:00.600
Charles Dickens: Well, no, I must not be special. That's what I mean. I'm saying, like what I told him when he wanted me to taper off methadone and I'm like, should I do this by myself in your house in my house with a three and a four year old.

923
01:28:01.170 --> 01:28:06.390
Charles Dickens: He's like oh you'll be fine. Your wife's there. And I'm like, yo, yo, did. I'm just telling you like I used to be a social worker like

924
01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:15.060
Charles Dickens: Do I need to go to like some groups. Is there someone I could call to talk to you did it. And he's like, you'll you're strong, you'll be able to do it on your own. And I'm like,

925
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:25.410
Charles Dickens: Okay, well I got worse. And I'm like, so I'd call them and be like, is there anyone that I could talk to her, whatever. He's like, Oh, this is just the side effects, you'll get through it so

926
01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:34.320
Charles Dickens: Throughout all of that I never had anyone to talk to you or anything. I mean, that's a tangent. But so, but any other medical stuff.

927
01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:37.080
Service any operations or

928
01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.680

Charles Dickens: Five left knee surgeries college football.

932
01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:04.890
Charles Dickens: One right knee surgery. That's because my brother, my twin shot me with the BB gun. Okay.

933
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:10.050
Charles Dickens: For

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Charles Dickens: left wrist surgeries three are from college football. One is from a being a kid.

935
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:25.590

936
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:29.400

01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:35.220
Any non orthopedic things

Charles Dickens: I've had

939
01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.400
Charles Dickens: surgery on my eye because I fell down on the ice rink.

940
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.170
Charles Dickens: When I was like

941
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:53.970
Charles Dickens: Like 12 or something and I had to like clean it all out and staple it and stitch it all up.

Charles Dickens: I've had like my wisdom teeth pulled and I've had to skin grass and my mouth.

943
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:07.200
See because

01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:10.470
Dr Jameson: We have your appendix, and your gallbladder and all that stuff.

945
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:11.610
Charles Dickens: Yeah.

946
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:17.580
Dr Jameson: Is there anyone in your family that had issues with substance abuse abuse alcohol.

947
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:21.990
Charles Dickens: I would say who hasn't okay um

948
01:30:23.610 --> 01:30:24.720
Charles Dickens: Where do you want me to start

949
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:33.900
Dr Jameson: Well, I guess we're, we're gonna have to wrap up because we only have a few minutes. So, but there's a strong family history and what types of substances, I guess, let's just

950
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:39.390
Charles Dickens: So both my brothers alcohol.

951
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:47.550
Charles Dickens: My dad was a poly substance user never really worked. Kind of a loser.

952
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:50.220
Charles Dickens: My mom. My mom was fine.

953
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:57.900
Charles Dickens: Okay. The granddad on my mom's side and Granddad. On my dad's side or I'll call it

954
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:03.180
Dr Jameson: And have you had an issue with alcohol at all. No.

955
01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:05.880
Charles Dickens: I don't drink very rarely

956
01:31:06.810 --> 01:31:08.700
Dr Jameson: How about smoking cigarettes.

957
01:31:09.150 --> 01:31:10.620
Charles Dickens: No, never smoked cigarettes.

958
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:14.130
Dr Jameson: And

959
01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:22.140
Dr Jameson: I I've gotten the blood test back but not the urine tests yet, so I can't answer your question about what's going to show in there, but it

960
01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.430
Charles Dickens: Should be

961
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:27.480
Dr Jameson: Marijuana Suboxone and and some coding, I guess.

962
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:34.650
Dr Jameson: Yeah okay um no other like math or any other stimulant type stuff. No.

963
01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:38.610
Charles Dickens: federal agent and a cop for like eight years.

964
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.750
Dr Jameson: Okay.

965
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.830
Charles Dickens: I would have been caught

966
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:51.480
Dr Jameson: I'm thinking, well, you know, I've had a couple patients recently who have had problems with paranoia, but both of them were smoking mask so I'm just thinking about the paranoia on anyway.

967
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:54.660
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

968
01:31:56.910 --> 01:32:04.920
Dr Jameson: We'll continue. What will you on the two milligram Suboxone did they tell you how our program works with the groups and that sort of stuff.

969
01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:13.770
Charles Dickens: Well, I mean, I was telling them that I mean they did, but I don't. I mean, I don't, I don't really have a problem with like the one on one. But like

970
01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:26.070
Charles Dickens: Because I see this is like Doctor induced like yeah I know I said yes but I was like, you got to do this. You got to do this. And I was like, so much pain that I got to where I am, because of

971
01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:38.520
Charles Dickens: Of what the doctors did to me. So like, that's why. Like, I don't. That's what I mean. And I know you're going to see things differently. I don't go out and do these i don't i don't

972
01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:49.410
Charles Dickens: I don't spend my money on extra Suboxone or heroin or anything like that. I do everything I can to like be a good dad and be a good husband and

973
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:56.700
Charles Dickens: That everything that I have is from withdrawals mainly not from like the actual use

974
01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:59.460
Charles Dickens: So that's why I don't know.

975
01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:09.600
Charles Dickens: If I would even be beneficial to other people in the group because it's like all I need to do is get off the box on I know those guys need to get off opioids, but like

976
01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:10.980
Charles Dickens: I don't know.

977
01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:12.600
Dr Jameson: Well,

978
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:20.010
Dr Jameson: Our program is really designed to be. I mean, the doctor visit is in the context of the group. So

979
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:27.480
Dr Jameson: I. You're not the first person to say they don't really feel like the group is is necessary or relevant, but

980
01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:41.760
Dr Jameson: We actually just had a conversation the other night about somebody else who felt that they are in the situation because DOCTORS PRESCRIBED too much and higher doses. And I mean, so you're, you're, that is not, you're not unique in that in that

981
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:44.400
Dr Jameson: Situation at all.

982
01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:49.290
Dr Jameson: We do do individual counseling and

983
01:33:50.730 --> 01:34:06.300
Dr Jameson: That is usually I usually require a couple months of one on one work with a counselor and sometimes it's to deal with stuff that's happening as a result of using opiates. Sometimes the reason people are using opiates in the first place was because they were not dealing well with other

984
01:34:06.630 --> 01:34:08.190
Charles Dickens: The one on one. I don't have a problem.

985
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:14.250
Charles Dickens: Like because I used to do. I used to do groups. So, yeah.

986
01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.060
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well, um,

987
01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:28.170
Dr Jameson: I guess I don't know what to tell you other than I mean if it's, if you're like absolutely not willing to sit through a group. Then I this probably isn't the best program for you.

988
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:32.400
Charles Dickens: I'm not, I'm not willing. I just know like I don't

989
01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.070
Charles Dickens: My experience of like groups and

990
01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:42.450
Charles Dickens: Stuff like that is like is. I mean, I don't know, maybe I don't have the insight as as

991
01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:43.470
Charles Dickens: Well,

992
01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:50.700
Dr Jameson: I mean, I think people find that it's it's comforting to have a community of people that understand you in a way that

993
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:58.290
Dr Jameson: Like somebody like your wife or even me on some level, I haven't lived it myself. So I don't you know it's

994
01:34:58.650 --> 01:35:12.480
Dr Jameson: People find it comforting to be able to have a sort of a group of people that gets gets it in a different way. The feeling of withdrawal and the frustrations of, you know, being judged negatively maybe

995
01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.990
Dr Jameson: And so, you know, even if it's not like a

996
01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:26.910
Dr Jameson: Talking about, you know, maybe some of the things we talked about might not be relevant to you if you don't have, you know, have situations that make you feel like using more because it doesn't sound like that's really been

997
01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:37.320
Dr Jameson: So much your. We also have chronic pain group which might, that might be a better fit for you, potentially, if it's been more of just a managing

998
01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:51.270
Dr Jameson: A symptom that that ended up getting you in this in this situation. So, I mean, we could we could talk about transitioning over to one of those other groups, maybe I don't run any of those myself, but we have other doctors that do

999
01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.010
Charles Dickens: Um,

1000
01:35:54.270 --> 01:36:01.200
Charles Dickens: Yeah, and I just like I said over on just frustrated because like, to me this is preventable. And that's why my wife is so upset. I like

1001
01:36:01.650 --> 01:36:10.020
Charles Dickens: Specifically was like telling, they're all just like get me off this get me off this him before. I was like, I don't want to go on and he's like oh you'll be fine. And don't

1002
01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:20.820
Charles Dickens: Beat me down for like years and then I finally like convinced to do it. And then I'm like, Okay, now I'm addicted. Give me off of it and it's been a two year cycle of

1003
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:29.940
Charles Dickens: Switching around opioids. That's where I understand now like now I lost my job and all this, where a lot of people. That's what happens when you're addicted. But it's like

1004
01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:37.920
Charles Dickens: All of my problems came from withdrawals or whatever. But yeah, I didn't say I'm against it. I mean, I'll try it. I'm just, I don't. Okay.

1005
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:43.770
Dr Jameson: I missed, I missed, I missed. I didn't understand what you meant. Okay. Um, so

1006
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:47.520
Dr Jameson: I'll send the prescription. How much do you have left. Now, are you

1007
01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:51.000
Charles Dickens: Pretty much a four month my neurologist gave me a bunch, because

1008
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:52.530
Charles Dickens: Of Suboxone yeah

1009
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.460
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1010
01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.600
Charles Dickens: Or months worth

1011
01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:55.110
Okay.

1012
01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:56.730
Charles Dickens: On out

1013
01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:59.670
Dr Jameson: Like prescriptions. You mean you don't have the actual medication.

1014
01:37:00.090 --> 01:37:06.300
Charles Dickens: The actual location. Oh, he gave me 30 you gave me whatever four months worth this

1015
01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:12.420
Dr Jameson: Surprise the pharmacy dispensed that much, or did they mail it. Did they do a mail order thing.

1016
01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.300
Charles Dickens: He went down there with me. Oh.

1017
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:18.600
Dr Jameson: Oh little Kaiser has their own little pharmacy. Right.

1018
01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:19.770
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

1019
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.530
Dr Jameson: Alright, so I was gonna say we could we could switch you to the two milligram

1020
01:37:26.730 --> 01:37:29.700
Dr Jameson: Film. If you want to start snipping

1021
01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.990
Dr Jameson: Or trying, you know, snipping little pieces off that

1022
01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:36.090
Dr Jameson: And you know, we can

1023
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:40.170
Charles Dickens: I can do what I have now it's not. I mean,

1024
01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:53.640
Dr Jameson: Okay. Well, I mean, you have it so you might as well use it, I suppose. But that is what I'm saying, like, at some point, we could start using the smaller strips and then you could see if you can gradually now you're still going to have a problem with restless leg.

1025
01:37:55.230 --> 01:38:00.510
Dr Jameson: So that's and that's. I'm not going to get nervous. I'm not going to help you with bad part, obviously.

1026
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:01.470
Dr Jameson: Um,

1027
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:07.620
Dr Jameson: So I can hopefully by, you know, as time goes on, you'll get the new neurology evaluations.

1028
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:24.180
Dr Jameson: And then I think just pay attention. You know, sometimes head injuries cause all sorts of weird things which you know certainly sounds like it's cause seizures for you, but sometimes it causes mood disorders to happen to I mean if you're prone to paranoia.

1029
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:36.210
Dr Jameson: Or mania Armenia, or whatever, which is possible to, I guess, you know, have you did the psychiatrists ever talk to you about anything about those sorts of symptoms.

1030
01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:42.450
Charles Dickens: No, like I did the individual counseling for like a month. And he's like, dude, like, why are you even here like

1031
01:38:43.110 --> 01:38:49.290
Charles Dickens: You have the insight and then I did like the waist exam and all that psychological testing and they're like, here's

1032
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:51.330
Charles Dickens: Your

1033
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:56.010
Charles Dickens: You're addicted opioids, like you got it off.

1034
01:38:57.870 --> 01:39:03.150
Dr Jameson: All right. Well, in a way that's I mean it's not good. It's bad news, but it's also, I mean,

1035
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:05.250
Dr Jameson: I think that's better than having an

1036
01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:06.060
Charles Dickens: Oh, yeah.

1037
01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:12.090
Dr Jameson: Yeah, like you having a psychosis that we you know we have to treat in some other way anyway.

1038
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:17.340
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I guess I don't write you a prescription anytime soon.

1039
01:39:18.690 --> 01:39:19.650
Dr Jameson: But yeah

1040
01:39:20.730 --> 01:39:35.160
Dr Jameson: So the way that works. We'll get you set up to meet and you may not need a whole bunch of counseling if assistance, you've already gone through and you know so we everybody gets at least an assessment by a counselor and then they decide on what you know what the appropriate

1041
01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:37.650
Dr Jameson: Treatment plan is

1042
01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:42.390
Charles Dickens: My wife says I need an emotional release because she doesn't know how to handle it.

1043
01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:44.790
Charles Dickens: But yeah, which is finally man.

1044
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:51.300
Dr Jameson: And sometimes, and sometimes I don't know if we do couples counseling here. But maybe that's something that, or maybe she can

1045
01:39:52.170 --> 01:40:01.050
Dr Jameson: You know, if there's resources for her to learn a little bit more because it. You know what, I'll be completely truthful for a very long time in my medical career I

1046
01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:10.980
Dr Jameson: Doctors, you're right. Like we don't understand what these medications do and some of that is our fault. Some of that is because there was all this miss

1047
01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:22.500
Dr Jameson: Miss information still you know oxy content is less addictive is what they told us. So if the patient has pain and you're treating pain. They have a much lower rate of getting addicted. That's what they told us. So, and then

1048
01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:33.000
Dr Jameson: I, you know, until I started really working with with addicts. I didn't understand a lot of this stuff either about the withdrawal and how long it takes, and

1049
01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:37.890
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so I'm not. It's not an excuse. I mean it's it's not

1050
01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:39.090
Charles Dickens: Defensive why

1051
01:40:39.690 --> 01:40:45.390
Charles Dickens: I tried. I tried for seven years to get her to read a very reader friendly book.

1052
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:48.900
Charles Dickens: By cops X certain ways.

1053
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:52.290
Charles Dickens: And I tried to get her to read

1054
01:40:53.700 --> 01:41:01.950
Charles Dickens: Like methadone withdrawals mirapex mirapex withdrawals, which is almost up there with freakin

1055
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:11.610
Charles Dickens: Methadone is equivalent to cocaine and I gave her like a very two page article and said this is what I'm going through and she didn't read it because she's

1056
01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:17.520
Charles Dickens: She's scared because I'm not the person that I was when we met. I know that I'm not my parents.

1057
01:41:18.330 --> 01:41:32.460
Charles Dickens: My mom and stepdad know that my, my brothers know that friends know that I'm not the person that I was, but she I told her, like, you have to educate yourself like you have to, and she just she's scared. I know that she's scared, so I'm not gonna go, sir.

1058
01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:42.210
Dr Jameson: You're scared to. I'm sorry, mutual you know yeah it's, yeah. Well, okay. So you'll get an evaluation by the counselor and then

1059
01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:55.980
Dr Jameson: There are groups meet weekly. I mean, if I'm not prescribing your medications for now. I think maybe if you want to come every other week for a while and you know sit in and you can participate little very little, you know, he's going to

1060
01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.900
Charles Dickens: Listen, anything to do so.

1061
01:41:58.290 --> 01:41:59.490
Dr Jameson: Or you can come every week. Okay.

1062
01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.790
Charles Dickens: Yeah, it's, it's, yeah.

1063
01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:11.310
Dr Jameson: And then so my the groups that I have on Wednesday during the day better for you than evening.

1064
01:42:12.570 --> 01:42:14.010
Charles Dickens: Yeah, any kids.

1065
01:42:14.610 --> 01:42:16.740
Charles Dickens: At school or something. Yeah, yeah.

1066
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:22.680
Dr Jameson: Um, so it. I have a 1030

1067
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.240
Charles Dickens: And this is

1068
01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.010
Charles Dickens: Big time. Anything.

1069
01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.260
Dr Jameson: Yes, I'm on Pacific time

1070
01:42:28.890 --> 01:42:29.670
Charles Dickens: Every Wednesday.

1071
01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:34.800
Dr Jameson: On Wednesday at 1030 in the morning, or I haven't 12 o'clock noon.

1072
01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:35.850
10 dirty.

1073
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:39.090
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I will

1074
01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.830
Dr Jameson: I will pencil you in there, do you, how do you prefer to go by Charles or

1075
01:42:47.190 --> 01:42:48.900
Dr Jameson: Yeah, Charlie, or okay

1076
01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:51.120
Okay.

1077
01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:54.510
Dr Jameson: All right, and it'll be

1078
01:42:56.490 --> 01:42:59.790
Dr Jameson: The two once we get there, but not yet. Okay.

1079
01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:12.510
Dr Jameson: Yeah i mean i think i think there's sometimes a benefit, just to sort of anyway. It's all walks of life, there's, there's a

1080
01:43:13.650 --> 01:43:21.570
Dr Jameson: GUY JUST GOT ANOTHER felony charge in this group so that you'll have an interesting. It'll be interesting.

1081
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:24.330
Charles Dickens: But I'm a different type

1082
01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:44.370
Charles Dickens: So that's one reason that we agreed to part ways is I'm a different type. So I've been at three agencies, I was a federal agent and I worked at i was i was a sheriff's deputy. You can look this up online. I'm not lying there were deputies using urine and feces.

1083
01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.610
Charles Dickens: On inmates.

1084
01:43:48.690 --> 01:43:50.790
Charles Dickens: Because they wouldn't become informants right

1085
01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:55.020
Charles Dickens: Yeah I reported I reported those guys.

1086
01:43:57.030 --> 01:44:08.280
Charles Dickens: Leave that job. So I'm going to type it. I'm not this cop that that I'm not on a power trip. So I'm actually open minded. That's why I got pushed out of both places that are work because

1087
01:44:09.450 --> 01:44:23.160
Charles Dickens: I don't, I'm not read to I don't I don't go to a domestic violence call and think that the woman's lying. Every time and she deserves it. Like, that's how I look ups are they are so

1088
01:44:24.450 --> 01:44:38.970
Dr Jameson: Um, and then there's a guy who's in school to be a counselor himself and works in a home anyway. I think you'll you may find it interesting to some of the people. There's a guy who's a producer in LA. He has his own recording studio i mean it's it's it's different. They're different.

1089
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:44.100
Charles Dickens: So what about the one on one that someone else would contact me about that.

1090
01:44:44.130 --> 01:44:52.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so they'll, they'll schedule that and then just so you know for group which I and you're not a smoker. So that part. You don't we ask people not to smoke during group.

1091
01:44:53.010 --> 01:45:01.320
Dr Jameson: We asked people to have headphones in for privacy purposes and you I see your home alone. And that's anyway. But we still just because you can't see what's behind here.

1092
01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:05.340
Dr Jameson: We just ask that for like privacy hip hop purposes.

1093
01:45:05.850 --> 01:45:14.910
Dr Jameson: And you start in the virtual clinic every time. So the way you did today for any appointments, no matter what it is that's

1094
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:18.570
Charles Dickens: Where, you know, sorry your code again.

1095
01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:25.860
Dr Jameson: Um, how did you get to that. Yeah. So there'll be and then with the groups that the code changes every week because

1096
01:45:25.890 --> 01:45:35.730
Dr Jameson: We want people to go through the virtual clinic. Sometimes they need to pay a copay sometimes we need to check that they've had their drug screen done in the last month and you know there's a variety of little things that have to be

1097
01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:39.420
Charles Dickens: Sent to me, or I'll just check in, or how to

1098
01:45:39.810 --> 01:45:40.320
Um,

1099
01:45:42.450 --> 01:45:45.510
Dr Jameson: I don't think an email is going to be sent. But if you

1100
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:48.240
Charles Dickens: We ask people to go and check in and then

1101
01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:54.840
Dr Jameson: We asked people to check in about a half an hour before group starts because, you know, sometimes it backs up a little bit while everybody's mind.

1102
01:45:55.170 --> 01:46:02.820
Dr Jameson: You'll see you'll get some surveys in the email to you every week. They asked, they're really into a monitor measurements and data and

1103
01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:16.470
Dr Jameson: looking for trends and different things. So when they ask you to fill out surveys once a week. So that's another thing that they want to make sure you've done before I let you in group. So anyway, um, if you. I don't know if you have a calendar or something if you can just

1104
01:46:17.490 --> 01:46:24.480
Dr Jameson: Pencil in 10am on Wednesdays and then sorry yeah 10am it's one my time 10 years time.

1105
01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:31.500
Dr Jameson: And then there's usually a weight. So just prepare yourself to have something to read or something while you're waiting

1106
01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:39.540
Dr Jameson: And then Jamie will be in touch with you. I don't know if you've met her yet but she'll be in touch with you about scheduling the counseling.

1107
01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:55.560
Dr Jameson: I'll see the let the labs when they come back and and they it is what it is. I really more about being with you. I think without saying, you know, honest and forthcoming whether, whether it's good or bad report that's okay we

1108
01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:59.070
Charles Dickens: Just want to be. But there's a blood work. I mean not everything's

1109
01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:10.650
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so far, everything's fine. Your blood count your liver tests and think, well, the hepatitis greens and all that are in fact, but that you haven't been injecting anything so

1110
01:47:10.710 --> 01:47:12.180
Charles Dickens: I don't think we have any reason to worry

1111
01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:12.930
Dr Jameson: About any of that.

1112
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:15.540
Charles Dickens: I would be stupid to cheat on my wife.

1113
01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:16.380
Yeah.

1114
01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:24.870
Dr Jameson: So, um, let me just pull it, I think. Yeah. So. So some things were still pending but the initial basic stuff was all fine.

1115
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:32.700
Dr Jameson: And so yeah, I'll let them know you'll do the 1030 group and

1116
01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:40.320
Dr Jameson: If you're unable to come for some reason. If you can just let us know ahead of time. So we're not wondering where you are and

1117
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:43.920
Dr Jameson: Whether we need to make sure you're okay or not, you know,

1118
01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:54.630
Dr Jameson: And then hopefully as time goes on, you'll get, you know, a second opinion from a neurologist about some of these other restless, miss.

1119
01:47:55.710 --> 01:48:02.700
Dr Jameson: Seizure type things, and I mean I don't know to me as a neurologist, I still unlike well, does he have some sort of minor seizure disorder or

1120
01:48:04.530 --> 01:48:09.000
Dr Jameson: Mayo Clinic something, you know, some other sort of specificity problem or something.

1121
01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:13.470
Dr Jameson: Not that I would know how to treat those things or even diagnose them but

1122
01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:16.800
Charles Dickens: I said it when you were talking, but

1123
01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:20.280
Charles Dickens: So Tramadol I'm allergic to as well. Okay.

1124
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:24.990
Dr Jameson: Was a the dis the during taking it or was coming off of it.

1125
01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.240
Charles Dickens: Taking it

1126
01:48:27.690 --> 01:48:29.280
Dr Jameson: Okay, I wanted what happened with that one.

1127
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:31.800
Charles Dickens: So that was like

1128
01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:42.180
Charles Dickens: The diary. Also, but also like really bad like nausea and like vertigo like like the room was getting like really, really bad.

1129
01:48:42.330 --> 01:48:49.710
Dr Jameson: Okay well so vertigo will cause nausea. So I guess it wasn't for her to go and diarrhea. Okay. All right. Okay.

1130
01:48:50.700 --> 01:49:00.480
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it sounds like you're yeah I mean, and some people are like you. You give somebody what seems like a low dose of something and they're like well you know it's it's it happens and it's unfortunate.

1131
01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:11.550
Charles Dickens: I don't even know how I know 20 milligrams, isn't that much but like I don't even know how was a cop for that long. I was on that stuff for like nine months and I was still like

1132
01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.520
Charles Dickens: Net looking back, I'm like, holy crap. I was high, as I was high as a kite everything

1133
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:19.470
Charles Dickens: Yeah.

1134
01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:22.050
Charles Dickens: The commute and everything well

1135
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:26.790
Dr Jameson: Yeah I we are started there. I mean, you hear more and more

1136
01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.230
Dr Jameson: Talk i here in the medical community I literature about

1137
01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:43.020
Dr Jameson: Metabolized thing and hyper mid to end and the other starting to be able to do some testing to sort of evaluate that a little bit, the psychiatrists are usually the ones that don't know more about that stuff. Some of them, not all of them.

1138
01:49:43.890 --> 01:49:52.500
Dr Jameson: But yeah, someday maybe we'll find out what it will be. It'll make sense when we learn more about how that all works and how you work and

1139
01:49:55.170 --> 01:50:02.040
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um, any questions about Suboxone in general the medication itself, how it works, what it does.

1140
01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:04.830
Charles Dickens: I think I understand. Yeah.

1141
01:50:06.930 --> 01:50:07.890
Charles Dickens: I just, yeah.

1142
01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:09.150
Dr Jameson: It's, um,

1143
01:50:09.450 --> 01:50:11.520
Dr Jameson: Do you have pain currently

1144
01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.890
Charles Dickens: In my fee. Yeah.

1145
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:15.420
Dr Jameson: One of the weird

1146
01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:21.480
Charles Dickens: No, not right now but it kind of it starts in the evening. Yeah.

1147
01:50:21.810 --> 01:50:28.350
Dr Jameson: One of the things that's unique about this drug. I don't think I've heard of any other drug that has this feature.

1148
01:50:29.610 --> 01:50:42.120
Dr Jameson: It has an analgesic property like it does address pain, to some extent, maybe not as much as some of the other opioids, but it works better for pain if it's taken in more frequent smaller doses.

1149
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:52.140
Dr Jameson: So I'm just WAS JUST THINKING MAYBE. And again, it would be hard to split your strip into eight pieces. It's bad enough doing for but

1150
01:50:52.860 --> 01:51:02.910
Dr Jameson: Taking a half of your dose in the morning and a half at night. You know, sometimes that is better, as far as pain control actually sometimes we have people taking

1151
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:10.920
Dr Jameson: Well, most people are taking one higher doses, then you are but you know taking for six doses, you know, splitting it and taking it even every so many hours.

1152
01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:13.290
Charles Dickens: Yeah, I can. I can try to

1153
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.830
Yeah.

1154
01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:15.900
Dr Jameson: So if it's

1155
01:51:16.110 --> 01:51:17.340
Charles Dickens: Not that big of a deal is.

1156
01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:19.710
Dr Jameson: Okay. I mean, I know some people say they get

1157
01:51:19.710 --> 01:51:21.480
Dr Jameson: soggy. After a while, and

1158
01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:28.740
Dr Jameson: Anyway, and I guess you do want to be super duper careful with those giving that you have little, little people running around and they're such small

1159
01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:30.660
Dr Jameson: Okay, you know, one blows away.

1160
01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:31.560
Dr Jameson: Accidentally you know

1161
01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:33.810
Charles Dickens: Yeah, keep it locked up. Yeah.

1162
01:51:34.410 --> 01:51:37.980
Dr Jameson: Be careful with the little, little fragments, I guess.

1163
01:51:38.610 --> 01:51:46.200
Dr Jameson: So if at any point you want to switch to the smaller you know it'd be the same size strip, but it would only have two milligrams in it. So you would have more

1164
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:59.010
Dr Jameson: Ability to split it into smaller doses, you know, just let me know if you want to do that and that dose is not. Oh, it's not very commonly used. So sometimes the pharmacies have to order it like they don't necessarily keep it in stock. Okay.

1165
01:51:59.190 --> 01:51:59.970
Charles Dickens: Sometimes we, you know,

1166
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.350
Dr Jameson: Just a little heads up, I guess if you want to do that. So we have a little time to do the logistics.

1167
01:52:09.090 --> 01:52:10.680
Charles Dickens: Along with a taper off.

1168
01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:13.020
Dr Jameson: Well,

1169
01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:17.250
Dr Jameson: I think I mean that's obviously it's always an individual

1170
01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:23.790
Dr Jameson: Experience like everyone is different. Anyway, and then you sound like you're

1171
01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:30.900
Dr Jameson: Extra you know unique. I don't want to say it's it just, you're just super sensitive, so

1172
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:39.570
Dr Jameson: I don't think I can answer that in like, you know, six weeks or, you know, in a very specific way. I think it's going to be

1173
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:52.140
Dr Jameson: Sort of as we go. And then, how, how much each drop caught you know how many symptoms each little drop causes and how long it takes for that to stabilize again on the left lower dose.

1174
01:52:53.490 --> 01:52:54.660
Dr Jameson: There are

1175
01:52:55.740 --> 01:53:03.150
Dr Jameson: And you also have some features that are unique, like the the different thinking is not an issue that most people

1176
01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:05.010
Charles Dickens: Respond report.

1177
01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:14.070
Charles Dickens: I have memory loss and then I have like a stutter. Now, sometimes I gotta be like, well, did that, that, that, that, and then it finally comes out. Yeah.

1178
01:53:14.610 --> 01:53:21.960
Dr Jameson: So, I mean, I, I have to say I do wonder if there are other factors going on here that some maybe I'm

1179
01:53:22.230 --> 01:53:34.170
Dr Jameson: Certainly the Suboxone and the withdrawals are aggravating things and causing all sorts of some, some of your symptoms, maybe most of them, but it also just still makes me wonder if you don't have an underlying

1180
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:41.970
Dr Jameson: You know, maybe from the TBI me. I don't know. But, you know, some of those. They're not things that are typically related to opioid

1181
01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:56.220
Dr Jameson: Use or discontinuation. So I'm eager for you to get the the extra super duper neurologist involved because this is this is some of this stuff sounds maybe unrelated.

1182
01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:13.530
Dr Jameson: But generally, when I'm tapering people. I tend to drop the dose and maybe once a month and and in pretty small increments and I will be honest it. The hardest part is going from the small last dose to none.

1183
01:54:15.450 --> 01:54:32.820
Dr Jameson: So, you know, we usually use their drugs that we sometimes add to address some of the symptoms like we sometimes use najah medicine, say if you're feeling nauseous, so that you can, you know, treat some of the some of the discomfort can be medicated somewhat

1184
01:54:34.230 --> 01:54:42.750
Dr Jameson: There's also for the hot and cold and jumping is sometimes we use other drugs like Clonidine or hydroxyl, which is an anti histamine.

1185
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:48.600
Charles Dickens: I'm allergic to Nortriptyline also. Okay, thank you.

1186
01:54:49.050 --> 01:54:54.000
Dr Jameson: So, in your case, I'm going to be really nervous about giving you anything really because

1187
01:54:54.090 --> 01:54:56.040
Charles Dickens: Well, I'm which I will let you know. Very good.

1188
01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:57.870
Charles Dickens: I usually know

1189
01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:02.100
Charles Dickens: I usually can tell within like 123 days.

1190
01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.550
Charles Dickens: I'm pretty in tune with my body to know like

1191
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:07.560
Dr Jameson: What happened with Nortriptyline

1192
01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:10.470
Charles Dickens: So Nortriptyline was paranoia.

1193
01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:15.000
Charles Dickens: Headaches, and like just

1194
01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.720
Charles Dickens: Really, really bad mood swings.

1195
01:55:22.110 --> 01:55:22.350
Okay.

1196
01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:28.260
Dr Jameson: There's nobody in your family that has any

1197
01:55:29.310 --> 01:55:32.700
Psycho psychotic type diagnosis. Right.

1198
01:55:34.230 --> 01:55:35.130
Charles Dickens: Mental illness.

1199
01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:36.900
Charles Dickens: Yes.

1200
01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:38.490
Charles Dickens: What sort

1201
01:55:39.810 --> 01:55:42.600
Charles Dickens: Of so my

1202
01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:47.730
Charles Dickens: Dad's dad had schizophrenia.

1203
01:55:48.930 --> 01:55:53.940
Charles Dickens: He died in a mental institution. My dad's brother had schizophrenia.

1204
01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:58.650
Charles Dickens: My dad sister had depression.

1205
01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:04.050
Charles Dickens: And attempted suicide four times and the fourth time she was successful.

1206
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:13.500
Charles Dickens: My dad's dad or I'm sorry, my dad's brother who had schizophrenia also had multiple suicide attempts.

1207
01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:29.730
Charles Dickens: My dad, he had to be depressed to be on to be an alcoholic and a poly substance abuse. I mean, he had to be. There's no other and I have a master's degree in forensic psychology and I there that man wasn't right. I'm just saying that

1208
01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:39.990
Dr Jameson: I was gonna ask you do you do now that you know a little bit about what you've experienced you looking back to you feel like you ever saw evidence that maybe he was hallucinating or not thinking right

1209
01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:41.430
Um,

1210
01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:56.880
Charles Dickens: I never thought about that. I mean, I knew about the drugs. But he, he, when he was on drugs he Yeah he hallucinated like he would, he would talk about being in Vietnam, and he was never in Vietnam, like all this stuff.

1211
01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:01.200
Dr Jameson: And he was hard to assess that if he was under the influence of something

1212
01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:04.440
Dr Jameson: Correct letter that was him right I met a

1213
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:08.550
Charles Dickens: Dream Lee violent and my mom was a cop.

1214
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:19.260
Charles Dickens: Yeah picture that your mom's a cop and your dad's been the shit out of you and your mom doesn't do anything and your mom's a juvenile detective who

1215
01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:24.660
Charles Dickens: And a sergeant who investigates kids being beaten by their family.

1216
01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:34.980
Charles Dickens: My mom's that my Mom's Mom grandma was depressed and was on antidepressants for her entire life.

1217
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:47.160
Charles Dickens: Both my brothers, my twin and both my brothers have been diagnosed depression like outside of drugs.

1218
01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.600
Charles Dickens: Yeah, and then

1219
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:55.830
Charles Dickens: I got diagnosed just this last time.

1220
01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:06.660
Charles Dickens: I got my medical records and read it but so they she diagnosed me major depressive disorder with psychotic features induced by methadone or Kim can

1221
01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:08.070
Charles Dickens: Okay.

1222
01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:13.140
Charles Dickens: Oh, but I've never had any type of mental health issues. So

1223
01:58:13.770 --> 01:58:17.370
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well, up until the last so many years. Yeah.

1224
01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.920
Charles Dickens: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No.

1225
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:21.390
Charles Dickens: Nothing.

1226
01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:33.180
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well, so that's a very, you know, that's a very strong family history and again in the same way that we talked about, you know, sometimes people are, it's easier to get one person to have a seizure. Then somebody else.

1227
01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:45.060
Dr Jameson: And, you know, same thing, it may just be much easier for you to get obviously I guess we obvious that it is easier for you to have hallucinations and other people because it's happened several times already.

1228
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:50.910
Dr Jameson: So yeah, but there may be. There's probably genetic factors involved in that as well. Sounds like

1229
01:58:53.370 --> 01:58:54.120
Dr Jameson: Okay, well,

1230
01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:57.900
Dr Jameson: Other than recommending

1231
01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:08.400
Dr Jameson: Not taking methadone, I guess, I guess. So that's the, that's the the diagnosis, unless it ever happens again when you're not taking methadone and then we have to rethink or maybe it was from something else, but

1232
01:59:08.670 --> 01:59:18.960
Dr Jameson: I guess what I'm getting at is sometimes we treat the the psychosis with medication if it's, you know, continues to keep being a problem. So I don't know.

1233
01:59:19.050 --> 01:59:20.250
Dr Jameson: If it has ever been.

1234
01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:23.940
Charles Dickens: I never had it on gab repenting. And I had it on

1235
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:30.540
Charles Dickens: Didn't come off Suboxone yeah

1236
01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:41.190
Dr Jameson: Yeah. So it seems like that. So that's what I guess what made me think, because people usually get agitated and anxious and restless and all that stuff, but they don't usually

1237
01:59:41.940 --> 02:00:01.710
Dr Jameson: Get frankly you know paranoid. So, or have psychotic features. So you may live like close to that edge anyway. And then, so we'll see. I think that's, that's going to be the probably the rate limiting step here is is how you do as if we tried to drop the dose.

1238
02:00:02.730 --> 02:00:14.460
Dr Jameson: Does the Suboxone create any side effects for you. Like if you. I hope this isn't the case. But if you had to just stay on it forever with that. Like what would. What would, what would you think about that.

1239
02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:19.410
Charles Dickens: Mean it's better than methadone, but

1240
02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:22.770
Dr Jameson: Yeah, especially if it helps your foot pain, I guess.

1241
02:00:23.370 --> 02:00:23.940
Yeah.

1242
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:30.600
Charles Dickens: I have like the temperature issues I have the memory loss, the memory loss issues.

1243
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:46.290
Charles Dickens: And then some days I just don't have, like, I'm just move forward. Yeah, then like yesterday was the first day I've worked out in two months, which is I work out three to four times a week like run 20 miles a week and not just that.

1244
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:48.090
Charles Dickens: And then

1245
02:00:49.830 --> 02:01:08.370
Charles Dickens: Kind of like not not like really bad but kinda like, and I know some of this has to do with my life because of where I am now but kind of like some down and out thinking like like daydreaming of, like, Why does my life suck of kind of focus more on the bad thoughts. Mm hmm. So

1246
02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:15.480
Dr Jameson: Do you ever have thoughts. I know I have to ask you, um, do you ever have thoughts of hurting yourself or being better off dead.

1247
02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:19.680
Charles Dickens: Not, not, not on the Suboxone know

1248
02:01:20.850 --> 02:01:22.770
Charles Dickens: I've had those thoughts. It's because like

1249
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:28.560
Charles Dickens: Like the painting of the withdrawals are so bad.

1250
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:35.850
Charles Dickens: The neurologists isn't listening to you. You go to the ER and they're like, oh, talk to the neurologist and oh

1251
02:01:36.450 --> 02:01:38.100
Dr Jameson: You're addicted and circles. Yes.

1252
02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:51.390
Charles Dickens: Yes, and then wife doesn't understand and then oh, now your wife's gone for three days and you got a three and a four year old and I have both girls. So I don't know what to do with girls they they run all over me. Scott, you know,

1253
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.950
Charles Dickens: So,

1254
02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:58.950
Dr Jameson: Well, I'm sure you're you're getting that you're probably figuring it out as time goes on it.

1255
02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:09.210
Dr Jameson: Anyway. Alright, so I guess, you know, I guess I just asked you to keep an open mind, because, you know, depending on how things go.

1256
02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:15.930
Dr Jameson: We may abort our attempt and to see you know what they run a very low dose like super duper low already

1257
02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:25.950
Dr Jameson: And maybe we'll get it down even further, but you know whether we'll be able to get you off completely. I will have to you know that remains to be seen. Does it help the restless way. Yeah.

1258
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:33.150
Charles Dickens: I don't have any I haven't had, um, well the only time I've had restless leg issue was last week when I went off of it.

1259
02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:34.170
Dr Jameson: When you run on it. OK.

1260
02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:44.040
Dr Jameson: So maybe that's the treatment for your restless leg and you just, just what it's going to be, and we'll see what we can try to get the dose as low as, you know, so, though the bare minimum.

1261
02:02:45.690 --> 02:02:51.180
Dr Jameson: But you're it is already a pretty darn low dose. So I don't know if that makes you feel better or worse. I don't know.

1262
02:02:54.330 --> 02:03:01.680
Dr Jameson: Okay, but I mean that that there is a bet. So there's a benefit to it, but it makes you you feel like it makes you tired, sometimes. Yeah, yeah.

1263
02:03:02.730 --> 02:03:11.970
Charles Dickens: And then I don't want to. Well, I mean, and then get back to where I was where I thought I was feeling fine and then I go back to work. Yeah. And then I end up. I don't know.

1264
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:14.310
Dr Jameson: I mean, so when that was happening, you were still on it.

1265
02:03:15.810 --> 02:03:18.750
Dr Jameson: Are you trying to get off it when you went back and go back to work.

1266
02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:27.480
Charles Dickens: Was I was on the 10 milligrams of methadone and the marijuana because I just couldn't, I couldn't get off the methadone. It was I went cold turkey.

1267
02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:43.410
Charles Dickens: And that that was painful. Yeah. Yeah. And I felt like ants for crawling on my face and my arm it and then add the restless leg syndrome, just so I went back on the 10 and I can't stabilize once I added in the marijuana

1268
02:03:44.970 --> 02:03:53.820
Dr Jameson: Before you were diagnosed with a restless leg. Had you ever been treated. I mean, you had a lot of surgery. So I had you had opiates, like after the surgeries in the past.

1269
02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:56.820
Charles Dickens: Yeah, and I never really had a. It wasn't a problem.

1270
02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.380
Charles Dickens: I mean the Common side effects of like

1271
02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:04.080
Charles Dickens: Constantly

1272
02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:06.810
Charles Dickens: Yeah. But no, I never had it.

1273
02:04:07.890 --> 02:04:09.570
Charles Dickens: I had a problem with anesthesia.

1274
02:04:14.490 --> 02:04:16.320
Charles Dickens: Okay, which is, I guess.

1275
02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:17.310
Dr Jameson: I just wonder if

1276
02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:25.200
Dr Jameson: If because you had some. I'm just wondering if somehow your system got primed to somehow. And then like all along the rest of his life has been withdrawal from

1277
02:04:26.130 --> 02:04:26.280
Charles Dickens: That

1278
02:04:27.210 --> 02:04:35.910
Charles Dickens: I've brought that up before like because of so many surgeries so many things with Anastasia, and so many shots of payment so many times I've been on

1279
02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:47.970
Charles Dickens: OBO paint, maybe something my body up there like, oh no, that wouldn't happen. It just was totally brushed aside all this stuff just doesn't like come out of nowhere. Like, I don't. And he's so

1280
02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.830
Dr Jameson: I mean, I think.

1281
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:57.210
Dr Jameson: Well, my personal approach. I never say never. Because I don't think it makes sense to

1282
02:04:58.470 --> 02:05:03.360
Dr Jameson: Assume you know everything about everything. Like there's, you know, I feel like there's always an exception to every rule so

1283
02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:19.710
Dr Jameson: You may be it like a case report, you know, you might be the person that they published a study about, you know, you know, a report about because this is a very unusual. I mean, it sucks when it's you and that does not make you feel any better that you have this. You're the lucky winner.

1284
02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:26.520
Charles Dickens: My neuron is unlike publish about me. And he just looked at, like, whatever. Well,

1285
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:42.510
Dr Jameson: So, but, you know, it's, I guess, you know, maybe will again someday someday we may find I think just keeping an open mind and continuing to ask questions and like getting other opinions which you're I know you're doing as much as you can because you're not in charge of all that but

1286
02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:47.400
Dr Jameson: And hopefully those doctors will also keep an open mind that maybe

1287
02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:54.630
Dr Jameson: Just maybe, I don't know. I don't know for sure either. I'm not saying that that is what happened either, but

1288
02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:02.610
Dr Jameson: The whole thing sounds so unusual that I just makes me wonder like, maybe there's something here, we, we are missing.

1289
02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:14.760
Dr Jameson: Which includes you know brain injury from all these concussions that you've had over the years, like maybe that is playing a role here. I don't know. I don't know.

1290
02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:20.010
Dr Jameson: Um, so anyway, you may be a question mark for some time.

1291
02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:36.360
Dr Jameson: To our best at least keep your symptoms. I mean, I feel like that's all we should focus on for now is keeping you as comfortable as possible with restless leg as far as that stuff goes and pain and, you know, minimizing or avoiding the withdrawal symptoms. And I think that's

1292
02:06:37.530 --> 02:06:44.400
Dr Jameson: You know, that's going to be the top, top of the list than anyway for for priorities on my end. I don't know how you feel about that but

1293
02:06:46.710 --> 02:06:49.620
Charles Dickens: It sounds good. Okay. All right.

1294
02:06:50.070 --> 02:06:53.700
Dr Jameson: All right. Well, I think that's a lot of talking for one day. Right.

1295
02:06:54.990 --> 02:07:01.620
Dr Jameson: Um, we will plan on seeing you next Wednesday at this thing 10am in your head.

1296
02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:08.160
Dr Jameson: And then Jamie will be in touch with you about the counseling initial anyway and

1297
02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:10.020
Charles Dickens: You again are

1298
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:12.570
Dr Jameson: Well, so I'll be at the group's every week.

1299
02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:13.440
Okay.

1300
02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:14.760
Charles Dickens: Okay.

1301
02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:32.190
Dr Jameson: And so usually and I do. I think from some of the things going. I think it will be, if nothing else, just like a relief to have people that understand what understand how you've been feeling and a different, you know what I mean, I think that will be just therapeutic in and of itself.

1302
02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:33.720
Dr Jameson: A little bit.

1303
02:07:34.530 --> 02:07:34.830
Charles Dickens: Okay.

1304
02:07:35.550 --> 02:07:37.170
Dr Jameson: All right. Um,

1305
02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:48.090
Dr Jameson: No problems, perhaps, we're here to help. So, um, and then if you ever need anything. The virtual clinic is where you go, you know, if you need

1306
02:07:48.480 --> 02:08:04.080
Dr Jameson: At some point, and you need refills and stuff like that. Well, we try to address that and group basically that's how you're supposed to address that. But even if you having any issues or problems. We do have psychiatrists here too. So depending on how things are going.

1307
02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:19.890
Dr Jameson: I don't know that we need to involve them now, but I'm not a psychiatrist by training but but we some of our doctors are so just throwing that out there too. If we ever decide we want to involve somebody that has more knowledge about these sorts of things. And I do

1308
02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:22.080
Dr Jameson: Have that opportunity to

1309
02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:23.700
Charles Dickens: Already

1310
02:08:23.970 --> 02:08:26.730
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right. Well, nice to meet you.

1311
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:27.540
Charles Dickens: Use what

02:08:28.290 --> 02:08:31.560
Dr Jameson: All right, I'm hanging in there. Is your wife away now or she's

1313
02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:32.340
Dr Jameson: She's back

1314
02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:36.990
Charles Dickens: She's at work. Oh yeah, she's back she got back late on Saturday girl's birthday.

1315
02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.300
Dr Jameson: Ah Valentine's Day.

02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:40.590
Charles Dickens: And it's Valentine's Day.

1317
02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:41.880
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Wow.

1318
02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:42.570
You're going

1319
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:45.660
Dr Jameson: You're going to want your semi

1320
02:08:45.810 --> 02:08:50.640
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Oh, wow. Just you and her with the kids and

1321
02:08:50.970 --> 02:08:51.870
Charles Dickens: Her whole family.

1322
02:08:54.450 --> 02:08:54.900
Charles Dickens: Yeah.

1323
02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:59.070
Dr Jameson: Well, that should be wearing California, are you, I don't know very well, but

1324
02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:02.430
Charles Dickens: I live right outside San Francisco.

1325
02:09:03.450 --> 02:09:04.050
Dr Jameson: Um,

1326
02:09:06.150 --> 02:09:11.430
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I don't know, I, as I told you before, I don't know how far that is from Yosemite. That seems kind of far

1327
02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:12.690
Charles Dickens: Three and a half hours.

1328
02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:13.950
Dr Jameson: Oh, not that bad. Okay.

1329
02:09:14.190 --> 02:09:19.050
Charles Dickens: Yeah, look at a map. Okay, just goes, it really is.

1330
02:09:19.770 --> 02:09:21.360
Charles Dickens: It's one full of poop.

1331
02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:24.360
Dr Jameson: San Francisco is

1332
02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:27.300
Dr Jameson: Yes, I, I thought you were talking about Yosemite. Firstly, I know I've heard

1333
02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:36.360
Charles Dickens: No, Sam, but we live like we live in the server like 15 minutes away. Well, with no traffic like 15 minutes so like an hour.

1334
02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:38.550
Dr Jameson: What does that look like there's never no traffic.

1335
02:09:39.450 --> 02:09:41.850
Charles Dickens: in Alameda, if you've ever heard of me that

1336
02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:45.450
Dr Jameson: I have heard of it, but I don't know anything about it other than that.

1337
02:09:47.010 --> 02:09:51.060
Dr Jameson: Okay. Well, I hope you have a nice trip and

1338
02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:58.470
Dr Jameson: Yeah, we'll, we'll take it one step at a time. I hope, I hope this works out in a

1339
02:10:00.090 --> 02:10:11.760
Dr Jameson: You know, as far as getting you what you need either staying stabilized on it. And definitely, or I mean it and still I think what we do see is that people that there are side effects of medication. It's true.

1340
02:10:12.330 --> 02:10:19.470
Dr Jameson: But they tend to look, obviously, the lower the dose that you're on the less intensity, you're likely to have with side effects. So

1341
02:10:20.250 --> 02:10:32.940
Dr Jameson: Even though for most people would already be a very low dose like for you, you know, maybe we get you down to a quarter of the two milligram films and your symptoms are controlled and you don't have so much lethargy, so we'll see how it goes.

1342
02:10:33.570 --> 02:10:40.980
Charles Dickens: Okay, all right, all right. Appreciate you know, have a good day. You too. Bye bye.

1343
02:10:41.550 --> 02:10:42.480
Dr Jameson: You know how to get out of here.

1344
02:10:42.990 --> 02:10:43.620
Charles Dickens: Yes, they do.

1345
02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:47.040
Dr Jameson: Okay, you see the leave meeting. Okay, so people like it's like

1346
02:10:50.220 --> 02:10:52.380
Dr Jameson: Okay. So Charles Dickens.

1347
02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:54.900
What a great name.

1348
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:59.940
Dr Jameson: Is here for the initial history and physical

1349
02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:07.950
Dr Jameson: Hey, and I guess I should always say confirm their name and date of birth and

1350
02:11:12.450 --> 02:11:15.450
Dr Jameson: Confirm to give consent for treatment using video

1351
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:18.780
Dr Jameson: So HDI

1352
02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:22.740
Dr Jameson: Charles is a 40 year old gentleman.

1353
02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:33.630
Dr Jameson: Who presents today for trends position from an outside position.

1354
02:11:34.650 --> 02:11:38.280
Dr Jameson: Period. He has a an unusual medical history.

1355
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:43.110
Dr Jameson: In that he developed restless leg syndrome.

1356
02:11:45.210 --> 02:11:47.340
Dr Jameson: In his I think he said

1357
02:11:50.130 --> 02:11:54.030
Dr Jameson: That is particularly severe and has been

1358
02:11:57.210 --> 02:12:08.400
Dr Jameson: Very difficult to treat. He's been followed by a neurologist for quite some time. And after numerous medications which caused a variety of side effects.

1359
02:12:09.690 --> 02:12:10.590
Dr Jameson: They ended up

1360
02:12:11.850 --> 02:12:13.200
Dr Jameson: Moving to methadone.

1361
02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:15.780
Dr Jameson: Which

1362
02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:22.350
Dr Jameson: Sounds like it worked okay for the restless leg but

1363
02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:34.290
Dr Jameson: He subsequently be realized that he's physically dependent on it and had extremely difficult time tapering the dose.

1364
02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:36.450
Dr Jameson: Due to

1365
02:12:39.210 --> 02:12:50.010
Dr Jameson: Withdrawal symptoms, but also which, in his case, seem to include paranoia and sometimes psychosis hallucinations.

1366
02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:54.030
Dr Jameson: Period. That's a very long sentence. So you can make multiple

1367
02:12:56.430 --> 02:12:58.560
Dr Jameson: He also has a history of seizure.

1368
02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:06.630
Dr Jameson: Starting at age seven, after a head trauma, but he had another seizure when the last few years.

1369
02:13:08.130 --> 02:13:13.590
Dr Jameson: As well as a ski accident and he doesn't know how that happened. But he didn't have hit his head. He also

1370
02:13:25.770 --> 02:13:30.450
Dr Jameson: Both high school and college football also has had a number of head injuries.

1371
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:35.190
Dr Jameson: Are head traumas, I guess, over the years.

1372
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:38.220
Dr Jameson: He's

1373
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:54.480
Dr Jameson: Been using Suboxone in place of the Methadone looks like methadone was taper down to about five milligrams. And then he was started on Suboxone a few months back.

1374
02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:05.070
Dr Jameson: After an evaluation by an addiction specialist. The initial dose was eight, but that seemed to cost of your headache and ultimately was

1375
02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:19.710
Dr Jameson: taper down to two milligrams, which is what he's been on currently he's had several attempts at stopping that as well. And each time develops typical withdrawal symptoms as well as paranoia and some hallucination.

1376
02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:31.890
Dr Jameson: This whole sequence has caused him to lose his job. He's currently unemployed also creating some tension in his marriage.

1377
02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:42.810
Dr Jameson: He's been on disability temporarily, but then denied that there's going back and forth between his employment.

1378
02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:45.900
Dr Jameson: Disability

1379
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:51.780
Dr Jameson: Policy and more typical disability. So that's still in

1380
02:14:53.130 --> 02:15:04.320
Dr Jameson: In the works. He's also transitioning from Kaiser to anthem, because he lost his job. So now he's got to move to different doctors so peace in transition.

1381
02:15:05.490 --> 02:15:07.860
Dr Jameson: To see a new neurologist.

1382
02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:19.560
Dr Jameson: I think I detailed the past medical history surgical family and all that pretty

1383
02:15:23.370 --> 02:15:24.600
Dr Jameson: comprehensively their

1384
02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:34.320
Dr Jameson: Mental Status and physical are normal.

1385
02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:38.880
Dr Jameson: There's no evidence of any

1386
02:15:40.050 --> 02:15:46.260
Dr Jameson: Hallucination or paranoia at this time he denies suicidal ideation.

1387
02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:53.820
Dr Jameson: So diagnosis, I think is, is

1388
02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:56.820
Dr Jameson: opioid dependence.

1389
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:06.630
Dr Jameson: If there's a distinct distinctive code for that, as opposed to use disorder.

1390
02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:18.000
Dr Jameson: He seems basically just to be physically dependent on it, number one. Number two, restless leg syndrome, which is does control.

1391
02:16:20.850 --> 02:16:21.810
Dr Jameson: Plan.

1392
02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:25.860
Dr Jameson: We I described the our program.

1393
02:16:29.970 --> 02:16:50.520
Dr Jameson: To him, and he's a little bit reluctant to deal with deal in a group setting but willing to he currently has quite a bit of the medication lefties splitting eight milligram films into four pieces just taking one at that time. So he doesn't need any refills anytime soon.

1394
02:16:52.860 --> 02:17:01.830
Dr Jameson: We will get them scheduled for bio psychosocial I have some partial labs back already. So far, everything normal

1395
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:21.990
Dr Jameson: Keep unreserved the idea of a psychiatry evaluation, depending on how things go so far it seems that his psychotic features have been drug induced or withdrawal induced

1396
02:17:23.070 --> 02:17:26.430
Dr Jameson: But I think it's given his family history not

1397
02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:28.470
Dr Jameson: Out of the out of the

1398
02:17:31.290 --> 02:17:39.960
Dr Jameson: realm of possibility that he has an underlying psychotic disorder that's possibly aggravated by medication.

1399
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:51.270
Dr Jameson: I am hopeful that the new neurologist for review. Consider whether he has an underlying seizure disorder and or whether there could be some

1400
02:17:58.140 --> 02:17:59.670
Dr Jameson: CBD. What is that chronic

1401
02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:05.850
Dr Jameson: Underlying brain disorder related to his repeated.

1402
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:08.160
Dr Jameson: head traumas.

1403
02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:15.810
Dr Jameson: CTE. I think that's what it's called, like a traumatic encephalopathy sE tE

1404
02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:25.200
Dr Jameson: So he's gonna join our Wednesday 1030 group which will begin next week and

1405
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:30.420
Dr Jameson: We'll proceed from this

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:52.680
Dr Jameson: typically happen.

1428
02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:53.760
Often

1429
02:19:56.370 --> 02:19:58.590
Dr Jameson: A specific person or a variety of

1430
02:19:58.800 --> 02:19:59.280
Books.

1431
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:01.200
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1432
02:20:02.730 --> 02:20:05.220
Dr Jameson: And so that was like me or D or Christmas or something.

1433
02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:08.700
THE QUEENS LG: And he was here for two and a half weeks.

1434
02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:12.090
THE QUEENS LG: jays

1435
02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:18.480
Dr Jameson: I mean, is it like something you need to be talked into doing are you, you kind of

1436
02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:23.010
THE QUEENS LG: everything you just said here. You want someone so true.

1437
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.480
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

1438
02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:27.690
THE QUEENS LG: We're doing this. Yeah, okay.

1439
02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:29.850
Dr Jameson: So he's not around now.

1440
02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:31.260
THE QUEENS LG: Not right now.

1441
02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:37.440
THE QUEENS LG: Since they still come out, he just he left like yeah he left like and I think six days ago.

1442
02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:38.940
THE QUEENS LG: Four days ago, something like that.

1443
02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:41.340
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, because he stays and

1444
02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:46.110
THE QUEENS LG: No, no, I just wasn't keeping up with the Joneses, I guess.

1445
02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:48.510
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, does it

1446
02:20:50.130 --> 02:20:58.710
Dr Jameson: I guess it's always a concern, you know, as far as maybe not making good decisions when you're under the influence. And, and so I guess that's

1447
02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:04.770
Dr Jameson: I guess I just want to make sure it's not sort of the first step on the wrong of

1448
02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:06.240
THE QUEENS LG: Elaborate on I

1449
02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:13.470
THE QUEENS LG: Do, do, whether that's for sure that Maria publishing to get it but

1450
02:21:13.890 --> 02:21:14.790
Dr Jameson: Wow, I mean,

1451
02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:17.220
Dr Jameson: You know, but

1452
02:21:17.610 --> 02:21:24.480
Dr Jameson: I guess, is there something that you're getting out of it. Like what's the benefit other than keeping up with the Joneses

1453
02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:26.760
THE QUEENS LG: Well, just we were just to

1454
02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:32.070
THE QUEENS LG: Just to burn unless I remember he pulled it out and I did some

1455
02:21:33.330 --> 02:21:37.020
Dr Jameson: Sort of just being social not like, would it be an issue. If you said no.

1456
02:21:38.670 --> 02:21:40.560
THE QUEENS LG: Oh man, I could have said no.

1457
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:44.580
THE QUEENS LG: No, he wasn't pressured me into anything

1458
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:47.100
Dr Jameson: I'm

1459
02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:48.300
Talk.

1460
02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:50.670
Dr Jameson: About

1461
02:21:51.210 --> 02:21:55.170
Dr Jameson: Him at Christmas or something I thought was alcohol or

1462
02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:57.330
THE QUEENS LG: And that was

1463
02:21:57.750 --> 02:22:00.270
THE QUEENS LG: For everybody is that next.

1464
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:22.860
THE QUEENS LG: Party over here. It's like my girl drinks after she gets her husband might have a beer, too. But yeah, there's no hard liquor, that's my thing and drinking really isn't, it isn't a thing when I do, I can have, let's put it this way. I drank really good for like five years.

1465
02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:44.850
THE QUEENS LG: When I will know this was, um, it's been shipped 1970 1997 I got married. So I could jump in before 1997 and a half drunk, like I can social drink now without getting up in the morning and having a drink.

1466
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:50.310
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, but I went through, like when my dad passed away for like five years straight.

1467
02:22:51.390 --> 02:23:00.150
THE QUEENS LG: When my mom passed away. Yeah. Well, that was a mess up a bit. When I quit. I quit. And I was virtually when I quit.

1468
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:07.740
THE QUEENS LG: And I was, yeah. I still beta mean and I wouldn't drink a drop for 12 years. I think it was close to 12 years

1469
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:09.840
Dr Jameson: Wow, that is

1470
02:23:09.870 --> 02:23:10.770
THE QUEENS LG: Where you

1471
02:23:12.810 --> 02:23:14.700
Dr Jameson: Know that's impressive. Wow.

1472
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:26.970
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, it's because of the things for me would say, and then I have to do speed Rambam know it's it's my downtime was opiates. That was oh

1473
02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:35.790
THE QUEENS LG: So I am like, I totally stole away from anybody that has anything to do with them. I've never been heard, and like that just kills it.

1474
02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:38.370
THE QUEENS LG: So,

1475
02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:41.130
THE QUEENS LG: Probably closer to her to get

1476
02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:45.570
THE QUEENS LG: You can't even get them in Canada.

1477
02:23:46.890 --> 02:23:47.370
THE QUEENS LG: Nobody

1478
02:23:48.450 --> 02:23:50.640
THE QUEENS LG: Chose to go off of pills. Yeah.

1479
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:52.740
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no, I just

1480
02:23:52.860 --> 02:24:01.740
Dr Jameson: I hadn't seen this before and I just was like, oh, this was a little bit surprising to me. So I just wanted to find out more about what the situation is.

1481
02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:05.490
Dr Jameson: I mean, I guess, are you

1482
02:24:08.250 --> 02:24:13.110
Dr Jameson: medicating anything like feeling down or depressed or Ty I mean is it uh

1483
02:24:13.890 --> 02:24:22.590
THE QUEENS LG: Well, I mean, I am bored to death because I don't have anything to do except babysit bands and kids and clean the house.

1484
02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:26.430
THE QUEENS LG: Man, that medication everything. It was just something to do

1485
02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:31.200
Dr Jameson: Is there any other ideas about addressing this boredom.

1486
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:33.210
THE QUEENS LG: And

1487
02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:34.950
THE QUEENS LG: You know,

1488
02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:39.150
THE QUEENS LG: This weekend ran thinking to go to Santa Cruz this week.

1489
02:24:39.390 --> 02:24:46.890
THE QUEENS LG: And then Rosetta I haven't seen these people for like 40 years, and oh, so that's where we're at.

1490
02:24:47.010 --> 02:24:49.080
Dr Jameson: So is that like a reunion or something.

1491
02:24:49.650 --> 02:24:54.900
THE QUEENS LG: It's one of the girls birthday, and she's turning 60 but we are. Oh, so we're going to

1492
02:24:56.130 --> 02:25:01.410
THE QUEENS LG: We're supposed to have a big party. I don't know if the group is going to show up to pick my best friend from high school.

1493
02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:04.290
THE QUEENS LG: As opposed to picking up. Okay.

1494
02:25:05.850 --> 02:25:08.820
Dr Jameson: Do you predict. Do you anticipate there being any

1495
02:25:10.890 --> 02:25:13.320
Dr Jameson: substance exposure there.

1496
02:25:13.770 --> 02:25:25.020
THE QUEENS LG: Maybe alcohol that I don't have an issue with that, no, not like that. I mean, I can have a drink. I cannot have a drink and just, I don't really care if it's

1497
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:27.390
THE QUEENS LG: Simply like oh my god

1498
02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:29.010
THE QUEENS LG: Yes, and

1499
02:25:30.210 --> 02:25:31.830
THE QUEENS LG: Then you know yeah yeah I'm not

1500
02:25:31.890 --> 02:25:35.520
Dr Jameson: I'm not that penetrates okay and you don't feel like the math isn't a

1501
02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:42.360
Dr Jameson: I guess a risk, as far as I close, either.

1502
02:25:44.130 --> 02:25:45.090
THE QUEENS LG: I don't think it is.

1503
02:25:47.100 --> 02:26:06.060
THE QUEENS LG: Really good. I'm doing good. Without pills, you know, I mean, yeah, I actually was just saying to my bad with that. But I think the medication that I was on the painters, maybe for. So I don't know if that makes sense. But I felt I was American. Yeah, no.

1504
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:14.250
Dr Jameson: No, I think you're absolutely right. There are, the more recent studies are showing that chronic opioid treatment creates more pain.

1505
02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:18.300
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah, cuz I was, I was in prison for 20 years

1506
02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:23.220
THE QUEENS LG: And you're not the first person to say that. I mean, you feel more pain when you first stop.

1507
02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:24.300
Dr Jameson: Them as a

1508
02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:25.050
THE QUEENS LG: Job.

1509
02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:26.190
THE QUEENS LG: Then once you

1510
02:26:26.370 --> 02:26:30.090
Dr Jameson: Once you get through the withdrawal actually pain level sometimes improved.

1511
02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:32.340
Dr Jameson: Very often, and fruit. Yeah.

1512
02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:39.750
THE QUEENS LG: And when I'm sorry I still had another Western pen. But it's, it just doesn't seem, I don't know. It just doesn't seem so

1513
02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:51.630
THE QUEENS LG: So tired, YOU KNOW. I JUST ON AN ANSWER BETTER. My body feels better. Yeah, good. But I'm still in another pain just it's just different, and

1514
02:26:52.470 --> 02:27:08.850
Dr Jameson: Well, it may be a lot of pain is we were talking about this. And one of the groups and all those years. But pain is in a lot of ways is perception. So it's how how you how the way that pain affects you can change like depending on how you're like, if you're distracted or, you know,

1515
02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:12.720
Dr Jameson: There's other factors, I guess, besides just

1516
02:27:12.930 --> 02:27:13.410
THE QUEENS LG: It's not

1517
02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:15.060
Dr Jameson: It's not black and white, I guess.

1518
02:27:17.310 --> 02:27:21.750
THE QUEENS LG: I made my skin color is different to I was kind of

1519
02:27:23.010 --> 02:27:32.310
THE QUEENS LG: You know, yeah, I don't know if it was when the pills or whatever, but probably when my skin is changing them step in three years. So, yeah.

1520
02:27:34.470 --> 02:27:34.800
THE QUEENS LG: Okay.

1521
02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:37.020
Dr Jameson: Well, I mean, obviously I'm not like

1522
02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:37.920
condoning

1523
02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:50.820
Dr Jameson: And I rather you weren't using that. So I guess, at least it's not something you're doing on a regular basis or that you feel like you have a problem is

1524
02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:51.060
But

1525
02:27:53.130 --> 02:27:55.440
Dr Jameson: Obviously the more you do something that more

1526
02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:58.740
Dr Jameson: Possibilities for having a problem with it.

1527
02:27:58.740 --> 02:27:59.340
So,

1528
02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:03.600
Dr Jameson: Less is more.

1529
02:28:07.380 --> 02:28:09.270
Dr Jameson: I yes i think i mean it's not

1530
02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:12.450
Dr Jameson: Always a good for you either the heart and blood pressure and

1531
02:28:13.650 --> 02:28:14.400
THE QUEENS LG: All that stuff so

1532
02:28:16.530 --> 02:28:19.590
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right. Well, I just wanted it. I didn't. I don't like to, like,

1533
02:28:19.650 --> 02:28:22.230
Dr Jameson: call people out in the middle group about this kind of stuff. So

1534
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:23.460
THE QUEENS LG: I yeah

1535
02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:27.060
THE QUEENS LG: I was like oh my god what happened when

02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:31.020
THE QUEENS LG: You're not in trouble. I just

1537
02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:32.790
THE QUEENS LG: I mean it's that's

1538
02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.750
Dr Jameson: That's silly. But I just, yeah, that's it.

1539
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:40.590
THE QUEENS LG: I guess you're due for my next test. So, you know,

1540
02:28:41.610 --> 02:28:41.940
THE QUEENS LG: Just

1541
02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:43.530
THE QUEENS LG: Okay.

1542
02:28:46.170 --> 02:28:50.520
Dr Jameson: All right, well, yeah. So let's try not to have that become a recurring theme.

1543
02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:52.950
THE QUEENS LG: Yeah. Also,

1544
02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:56.370

THE QUEENS LG: Wow, but I had to bet.

1549
02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:10.770
Dr Jameson: They say five days, but I guess for you. It's longer

1550
02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:16.050
THE QUEENS LG: It was because I had the flu and I was just, you mean

1551
02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:18.000
Dr Jameson: All right.

1552
02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:18.960
Dr Jameson: That's right.

1553
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:25.710
Dr Jameson: I'll let you go. I have another patient meeting and I yeah anyway, I just wanted to find out more about the situation.

1554
02:29:26.370 --> 02:29:27.210
THE QUEENS LG: Okay, yeah.

1555
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:29.700
THE QUEENS LG: I'm good on the bed.

1556
02:29:32.670 --> 02:29:36.360

Dr Jameson: Yes, ma'am. Hi, I'm Dr. Jamison

Dr Jameson: Nice to meet you.

1566
02:30:02.970 --> 02:30:03.600
Shane bailey: Nice to meet you.

1567
02:30:04.290 --> 02:30:05.880
Dr Jameson: Did you oversleep or what happened.

1568
02:30:06.270 --> 02:30:08.700
Shane bailey: No working, my phone died.

1569
02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:13.320
Shane bailey: Mama surveyors was way out there and I was trying to get back. I'm really sorry.

1570
02:30:13.470 --> 02:30:23.040
Dr Jameson: That's okay. I am I obviously stuff happens when you don't really want it being a kind of, you know, regular occurrence, but

1571
02:30:23.220 --> 02:30:25.440
Dr Jameson: Some of this is some of this is like

1572
02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:29.070
Dr Jameson: Learning. Oh, zoom really drains my battery. I better make

1573
02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:31.230
Dr Jameson: Sure. It's really, you know, I need to have a good

1574
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:37.050
Dr Jameson: Connection and you find the places where that where that works better. So, some of this is just kind of a learning

1575
02:30:37.470 --> 02:30:38.340
Dr Jameson: Learning Curve, but

1576
02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:44.310
Dr Jameson: So anyway, um, do you have a decent block of time now.

1577
02:30:44.580 --> 02:30:45.000
Shane bailey: Yes.

1578
02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:46.410
Dr Jameson: Please, at least half an hour. Okay.

1579
02:30:46.830 --> 02:30:47.220
Dr Jameson: Um,

1580
02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:55.020
Dr Jameson: So if you wouldn't mind confirming, I'm just going to go over. So we just really getting like review your medical history and any medications you take or whatever and then

1581
02:30:55.650 --> 02:31:02.790
Dr Jameson: Family, you know, just kind of like the general medical survey and then we'll talk about, I don't know if you've been on Suboxone or your

1582
02:31:03.570 --> 02:31:13.650
Dr Jameson: This would be your first experience or and we will talk about medicine and how it works and that kind of stuff, and then decide if it seems like the right fit for you. Usually it is

1583
02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:21.480
Dr Jameson: And then get you started. If so, so, um, so if you could just confirm your name and birthdate first of all

1584
02:31:21.930 --> 02:31:26.220
Shane bailey: Shane Bailey January 25 23 you're

1585
02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:27.690
Dr Jameson: In California, correct.

1586
02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:40.080
Dr Jameson: Um, and then you're obviously I assume it's should I guess I was implied with your contract with the video version of the visits, instead of being in person.

1587
02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:50.190
Dr Jameson: And then we do record just, you know, I guess I realize I haven't been telling people they record these sessions and the transcriptionist goes in and like types it all up, but they do save

1588
02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:58.140
Dr Jameson: Transcribe transcription of everything that's said just for posterity. Anyway, so just just, you know, you're being recorded.

1589
02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:04.470
Dr Jameson: Okay, so let's start with easy stuff. Are you allergic to any medicine that you know off.

1590
02:32:04.770 --> 02:32:05.640
Shane bailey: No, no.

1591
02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:09.270
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then are you sick. Are you just

1592
02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:10.170
Shane bailey: No, no, no, I just

1593
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:12.450
Shane bailey: I'm so sorry I got some coffee.

1594
02:32:14.010 --> 02:32:16.500
Dr Jameson: It's, it's kind of flu season. There were a lot of people with

1595
02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:19.920
Shane bailey: stuff around here. But no, I'm okay. I'm sorry.

1596
02:32:20.250 --> 02:32:20.670
That's fine.

1597
02:32:22.050 --> 02:32:25.020
Dr Jameson: And then are you prescribed any medications. Yeah.

1598
02:32:26.310 --> 02:32:26.910
Shane bailey: Let's see.

1599
02:32:28.170 --> 02:32:38.220
Dr Jameson: And then any previous history of any medical things like asthma or any medical history of illness big illnesses or operations or anything.

1600
02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:39.000
Shane bailey: Significant oh

1601
02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:40.620
Shane bailey: OK.

1602
02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:44.880
Dr Jameson: And then

1603
02:32:47.430 --> 02:32:48.870
Dr Jameson: No operations. Either you said right

1604
02:32:50.250 --> 02:32:57.930
Dr Jameson: Does anybody in your family suffer from any substance or alcohol kind of issues. No.

1605
02:33:00.570 --> 02:33:00.930
That's

1606
02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:05.730
Dr Jameson: Good. The more genetics are that are involved more

1607
02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:07.740
Dr Jameson: Things been getting

1608
02:33:08.040 --> 02:33:08.070
I

1609
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:11.340
Shane bailey: Don't know why.

1610
02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:13.350
Dr Jameson: Okay, well,

1611
02:33:15.660 --> 02:33:30.600
Dr Jameson: I take the approach. You know, I think it's important to look at why where we've been and where we've come from. And just to understand for future learning purposes. I don't see a lot of benefit and you know

1612
02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:38.460
Dr Jameson: torturing yourself about all the things you wish you hadn't done or had done differently. It's that's not very productive usually so

1613
02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:43.770
Dr Jameson: But anyway, um, so I guess. Yeah. Do you smoke cigarettes.

1614
02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:44.610
Yes.

1615
02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:46.950
Dr Jameson: And how much these days.

1616
02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:48.930
Shane bailey: I'd have to pack. Okay.

1617
02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:50.850
Dr Jameson: So does that cutting back on or

1618
02:33:51.690 --> 02:33:54.810
Shane bailey: Oh no that's been pretty average high school

1619
02:33:57.180 --> 02:34:00.180
Dr Jameson: And then how about any alcohol, either now or in the past.

1620
02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:01.260
Shane bailey: In the past,

1621
02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:03.900
Dr Jameson: That's been a problem like you had to stop, are you

1622
02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:10.140
Shane bailey: Yeah, I had, I had a pretty severe drinking up on but I quit. I haven't been drinking

1623
02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:13.980
Since 2000

1624
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:16.560
Shane bailey: Like 17 I say

1625
02:34:17.070 --> 02:34:21.600
Shane bailey: Okay, maybe the end of 2016 960. Wow.

1626
02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:24.000
Dr Jameson: Great. So you have you have

1627
02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:29.610
Dr Jameson: Definitely some some skills there as far as, you know, avoiding thing.

1628
02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:30.840
Shane bailey: That yeah

1629
02:34:30.990 --> 02:34:32.190
Dr Jameson: No problem. Yeah, good.

1630
02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:37.380
Shane bailey: Pretty much it was, it was just done with it. I got into a motorcycle accident. I almost lost my leg.

1631
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:40.140
Shane bailey: Oh yeah, so I didn't want to have that

1632
02:34:42.330 --> 02:34:44.520
Dr Jameson: So you had. Did you have to have surgery on that.

1633
02:34:44.970 --> 02:34:46.890
Shane bailey: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I guess so, yeah.

1634
02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:49.440
Dr Jameson: I forgot about that.

1635
02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:51.180
Shane bailey: I guess, I guess.

1636
02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:54.780
Dr Jameson: This happens all the time. I don't know.

1637
02:34:55.380 --> 02:34:55.650
Why

1638
02:34:56.970 --> 02:35:01.620
Dr Jameson: It happens all the time. All right, so they had to do reconstruction and fracture repairs and so my

1639
02:35:01.620 --> 02:35:03.810
Shane bailey: God. Yeah, they did fix my kneecap and

1640
02:35:04.170 --> 02:35:04.470
They

1641
02:35:06.330 --> 02:35:09.300
Shane bailey: They were talking about maybe going back in time, I might need a

1642
02:35:11.430 --> 02:35:11.880
Shane bailey: Knee

1643
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:14.370
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you have pain there.

1644
02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:23.100
Shane bailey: Yeah, yeah. So this is just, I think it's going to have it for life. So the, you know, it's just they should have should have been drinking and driving my motorcycle, I guess.

1645
02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:33.420
Dr Jameson: I guess the general generally good advice. Yeah, but it doesn't mean you deserve to have lifelong knee pain now.

1646
02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:41.730
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you have chronic knee pain and anything else I heard to lower that subject.

1647
02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:43.830
Shane bailey: No, no. Just, just my knee.

1648
02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:51.870
Shane bailey: I did have served in the end they did actually work on my arm to I broke my arm. Pretty good, but it doesn't hurt. It was all the same. It was all the same. The

1649
02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:53.670
Dr Jameson: Same side sounds like yeah

1650
02:35:53.910 --> 02:35:57.420
Shane bailey: Yeah, same thing, my armor doesn't hurt just just my knee.

1651
02:35:58.890 --> 02:35:59.130
Okay.

1658
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:23.010
Shane bailey: That sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. And while they build it and everything in between. Yeah, it's

1659
02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:26.490
Shane bailey: Really easy. It's easy. It touches the ground we

1660
02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:30.360

02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:55.590
Shane bailey: Yeah I lucked out yeah yeah I lucked out with it doing it for a long time.

Shane bailey: And then 10 all the way down to one. Uh huh.

1688
02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:50.730
Shane bailey: Okay.

Shane bailey: So you have like 9807 and one

1690
02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:56.490
Dr Jameson: Oh wow, that's quite a spread

1691
02:37:57.750 --> 02:38:00.060
Dr Jameson: Do you have like you share custody or are there.

1692
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:02.520

02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:16.410
Shane bailey: Yeah.

1696
02:38:17.460 --> 02:38:21.450
Shane bailey: Yeah, I'm to two years ago, I was a

1697
02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:23.220
Shane bailey: I got a

1698
02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:27.570
Shane bailey: 211 which is a strong arm robbery.

1699
02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:40.710
Shane bailey: I didn't, I didn't, I just don't know them already. But you, who is a I was well I was doing drugs. I lost it wasn't working. And I was hungry and I took a little bit of food from our grocery store. Oh.

1700
02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:43.800
Dr Jameson: Is that a misdemeanor or felony. I don't know.

1701
02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:45.510
Shane bailey: It's a feeling I gotta strike everything

1702
02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:47.820
Dr Jameson: Did you have to serve time

1703
02:38:48.210 --> 02:38:49.350
Shane bailey: Yeah, I did. I did a year.

1704
02:38:53.550 --> 02:38:55.230
Dr Jameson: And that was two years ago so

1705
02:38:55.800 --> 02:38:56.730
Shane bailey: Yeah, I've been out for a year.

1706
02:38:58.920 --> 02:38:59.370
Okay.

1707
02:39:01.980 --> 02:39:04.050
Dr Jameson: Jail, at least.

1708
02:39:05.430 --> 02:39:23.280
Dr Jameson: 2019, I guess, something like that. Okay. Any but you don't have any limits on your license or anything. No, that's okay. Um, alright, so I guess that brings us to the the main subject at hand. So tell me what your

1709
02:39:24.390 --> 02:39:28.500
Dr Jameson: I guess how were how your journey started or where you know where you've been.

1710
02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:31.950
Shane bailey: Ah, I, I used to rodeo.

1711
02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:36.900
Shane bailey: All through high school. When I first got out of high school during college I I really

1712
02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:47.010
Shane bailey: Got you. I got just a few injuries, you know, surgery, but I, but I got I got her a few times and was described up you know payment.

1713
02:39:47.610 --> 02:39:47.880
Dr Jameson: Uh huh.

1714
02:39:48.270 --> 02:39:48.630
Shane bailey: And then

1715
02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:49.650
Dr Jameson: Did you grow up.

1716
02:39:50.190 --> 02:39:50.760
You know,

1717
02:39:52.020 --> 02:39:53.820
Dr Jameson: California, okay. I didn't know they did rodeos.

1718
02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:56.460
Shane bailey: It's cowboy capital. The world.

1719
02:39:56.700 --> 02:39:59.940
Dr Jameson: Oh, yes. It depends on what part of California.

1720
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:01.740
Shane bailey: Yeah, yeah, there's like cowboys.

1721
02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:09.330
Dr Jameson: Yeah. That's awesome. Cool. Um, okay, sorry. It's just true. So you started with prescription and then

1722
02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:10.650
Shane bailey: Yeah, and then

1723
02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:16.200
Shane bailey: That was a long time ago that was, you know, when I was in my 20s early 20s and

1724
02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:27.990
Shane bailey: I had those off and on for quite a while and then they stopped, obviously I wasn't injured. I stopped early on, I need to begin her and equip describing them. So I started buying them on the street and then

1725
02:40:29.130 --> 02:40:41.040
Shane bailey: I did that for a really long time. And then, and then when the churches became impossible to get or even if by that I had a full fledged petition and the only thing I can find a substitute

1726
02:40:42.090 --> 02:40:44.610
Shane bailey: You know pills with was heroin. So, yeah.

1727
02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:49.620
Dr Jameson: Supply. So the supply hasn't dried up a lot. I am yeah yeah

1728
02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:52.080
Shane bailey: Yeah, he became

1729
02:40:52.470 --> 02:40:53.730
Dr Jameson: That in the financials.

1730
02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:54.480
Dr Jameson: Of it. I know.

1731
02:40:54.570 --> 02:40:56.610
Shane bailey: Oh yeah, oh yeah, I spent

1732
02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:00.990
Shane bailey: A lot of money, a lot of pain.

1733
02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:04.080
Dr Jameson: And that was how about how long ago did you switch to heroin.

1734
02:41:07.470 --> 02:41:08.310
Shane bailey: Four years ago,

1735
02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:10.320
Shane bailey: Okay.

1736
02:41:11.610 --> 02:41:14.430
Dr Jameson: And then that's when things really went down the tubes, I guess.

1737
02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:15.570
Shane bailey: That's when like when

1738
02:41:17.490 --> 02:41:18.030
Shane bailey: It really will

1739
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:22.080
Dr Jameson: Really know I guess your wife had kicked you out or

1740
02:41:22.110 --> 02:41:24.090
Shane bailey: Oh no, I managed to give her a

1741
02:41:25.290 --> 02:41:26.100
Shane bailey: Decrease as well.

1742
02:41:28.290 --> 02:41:31.350
Shane bailey: But when ended up happening was that I went to.

1743
02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:33.030
Shane bailey: I went to jail.

1744
02:41:34.290 --> 02:41:39.540
Shane bailey: She went to a treatment that God God herself straightened out. And when I got out, I was

1745
02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:44.100
Shane bailey: I was clean in, you know, but then I you know

1746
02:41:45.270 --> 02:41:52.050
Shane bailey: I was all alone in, you know, we weren't married anymore in itself. And I have a decent job. So I have a supposedly

1747
02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:56.670
Shane bailey: Scott. I don't know about two years. Yeah.

1748
02:41:57.300 --> 02:42:02.580
Dr Jameson: Okay, so how long, so you had been obviously you weren't using they didn't treat you in jail. You just detox.

1749
02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:02.910
Oh,

1750
02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:05.850
Shane bailey: No, that was pleasant.

1751
02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:08.820
Dr Jameson: How long would it take until you didn't have any symptoms. Just curious.

1752
02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:20.400
Shane bailey: Oh, well, the initial the initial just like the really bad part I didn't, it didn't it last a long time for me 30 days, right, the real bad stuff, stuff. But then the and

1753
02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:33.660
Shane bailey: depression. Depression and mainly mainly the fatigue was really what was stuck with me for a long time, like, seven months, eight months for I felt like a yeah I woke up, I didn't feel dog out.

1754
02:42:33.810 --> 02:42:37.230
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's, I mean I'm just, I'm just asking literally for for

1755
02:42:38.490 --> 02:42:39.450
Shane bailey: Too long. Yeah.

1756
02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:48.570
Dr Jameson: Intellectual reasons I unfortunately that's what I that's kind of what I've heard. You know, people have said six months, sometimes for the all

1757
02:42:48.930 --> 02:42:49.710
Shane bailey: Of that septa

1758
02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:50.130
Yeah.

1759
02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:54.090
Dr Jameson: I've been down, it's not, you know, it's not a straight line either right

1760
02:42:54.330 --> 02:43:02.670
Shane bailey: No, it's not. Sometimes, some days are better than others, and it's just and then one day you wake up you feel okay you know and it's just it takes a really long time. Yeah.

1761
02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:11.880
Dr Jameson: That's part of, I think what so many people and Dr. Than I didn't either know you know so many people don't understand

1762
02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:20.130
Dr Jameson: You know what we're facing and why it's not the same as cigarettes or alcohol or it's

1763
02:43:21.150 --> 02:43:21.810
Dr Jameson: It's really a

1764
02:43:23.310 --> 02:43:24.330
Dr Jameson: Problem anyway.

1765
02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:29.310
Dr Jameson: So you got out a year ago. And then when did you start using again.

1766
02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:39.960
Shane bailey: Oh I stayed i was i was i was clean for probably about four months, but I was staying with the I didn't have anywhere to go. I didn't have lost everything. So

1767
02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:42.900
Shane bailey: He felt. He says, my wife and

1768
02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:49.350
Shane bailey: My ex wife at that point. So I don't want to go, but my but my sisters and shoes using

1769
02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:58.710
Shane bailey: As well. Sister me. So when I say with her right eye gel and I didn't use for four months or so and then one day I just I don't work, it just

1770
02:44:00.660 --> 02:44:02.640
Shane bailey: Was there is always there so fast.

1771
02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:05.070
Shane bailey: They used to

1772
02:44:05.730 --> 02:44:06.630
Dr Jameson: And that was there.

1773
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:13.290
Dr Jameson: Did you already started to feel sick without using or you just like

1774
02:44:13.650 --> 02:44:13.920
Yeah.

1775
02:44:14.970 --> 02:44:17.040
Dr Jameson: So, so I know but I mean like the first time.

1776
02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:19.500
Dr Jameson: You used after such a long period of

1777
02:44:19.710 --> 02:44:30.540
Shane bailey: Oh no, did I feel sick. No. No, I didn't. I didn't, I didn't take enough, I guess, or using up to to get sick, but I feel

1778
02:44:31.290 --> 02:44:31.650
Dr Jameson: Good.

1779
02:44:31.890 --> 02:44:41.070
Shane bailey: You know, I was, I had problems with anxiety. I think that's another reason why I started using the persuasive really hideous hideous all my life, you know what, I didn't know what was like a child. I know what it is.

1780
02:44:42.390 --> 02:44:47.490
Shane bailey: And the reason why, when the reason I use is I can't, I can't get things are yourself. I think

1781
02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:56.010
Shane bailey: It's just crippling you know the things already have. So that makes it go away. It's one of the things drinking used to make it go away, but I can't do that anymore. So

1782
02:44:56.310 --> 02:45:00.930
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Have you ever thought like medical treatment for anxiety.

1783
02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:08.040
Shane bailey: Yeah, you know, they give you stuff like Wellbutrin money doesn't seem to have I've taken it for a long time, it, it makes me feel it makes me feel

1784
02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:12.720
Shane bailey: It's it's a weird. It doesn't stop the anxiety. I guess it helps with depression.

1785
02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:13.980
Shane bailey: I guess. Yeah.

1786
02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:15.810
Shane bailey: Well,

1787
02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:23.370
Dr Jameson: well written. It's not really typically religion. Religion is generally better for like down in the dumps blue kind of needing up

1788
02:45:24.330 --> 02:45:24.750
Shane bailey: Right.

1789
02:45:24.930 --> 02:45:28.260
Dr Jameson: You know, it's going to doesn't actually help anxiety at all really

1790
02:45:28.290 --> 02:45:34.140
Shane bailey: Yeah, and seeing that. And that's I think that's what's causing me to feel depressed because I know I have this constant just

1791
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:45.120
Shane bailey: Yeah, so sometimes I am being strangled or something, all the time. You know, it becomes he gets to the point where nothing nothing matters, nothing else but making that stop. Yeah.

1792
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:55.410
Dr Jameson: So that's going to be part of the solution right it's finding other ways to relieve for addressing anxiety.

1793
02:45:56.430 --> 02:45:56.940
Dr Jameson: Um,

1794
02:45:57.960 --> 02:45:59.280
Dr Jameson: Do you see a doctor now.

1795
02:46:00.330 --> 02:46:01.380
Dr Jameson: Taking all of your turn now.

1796
02:46:01.950 --> 02:46:05.790
Shane bailey: I had, I had been but like I said he wasn't wasn't helping was I

1797
02:46:07.890 --> 02:46:09.660
Dr Jameson: Haven't ever given you any other

1798
02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:11.370
Dr Jameson: Anxiety meds.

1799
02:46:13.650 --> 02:46:19.230
Shane bailey: Here in California. You know, when they saw you along with pain pills, they don't they don't hand out anything like that.

1800
02:46:20.130 --> 02:46:28.980
Shane bailey: Yeah, they the others, giving them a used to a long time ago, and it did help. I mean, it helps a lot. But when they stopped driving those kinds of things is subscribing to me. But there was given

1801
02:46:31.470 --> 02:46:36.150
Shane bailey: On a pin. Pin. Pin at first thing you guys even after taking it for a while.

1802
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:42.660
Shane bailey: Yeah, that I just felt it was like it was with only time I liked. I actually felt

1803
02:46:44.130 --> 02:46:47.970
Shane bailey: Okay. In the they don't do that anymore. They gave me something called out or

1804
02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:52.800
Shane bailey: It seems a, I guess it's like it was

1805
02:46:53.940 --> 02:46:57.570
Shane bailey: 45 milligrams, I cannot remember the name though they gave it to me when I

1806
02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:04.170
Shane bailey: When they stop giving that other stuff and it did, it would help it would help for, you know, a very, very short amount of time.

1807
02:47:05.430 --> 02:47:14.460
Shane bailey: That's it. That's the one. So they gave me that, and that would help. I mean, just, I mean, at first, in the beginning, it would help a little bit. Yeah. While it just, it didn't do anything either and

1808
02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:15.750
Dr Jameson: What about nobody ever

1809
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:17.940
Dr Jameson: Tried like Prozac or

1810
02:47:19.290 --> 02:47:22.410
Dr Jameson: Alexa or Lexapro or any of those kinds of things.

1811
02:47:22.770 --> 02:47:23.340
No, I

1812
02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:26.400
Dr Jameson: Know I just turned my Alexa

1813
02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:29.190
Dr Jameson: Brian's was so

1814
02:47:32.670 --> 02:47:34.770
Dr Jameson: Anyway, I'm having every time.

1815
02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:42.240
Dr Jameson: I'm okay. Well, so that, do you see a doctor now at all. Locally there there's. Have you seen a psychiatrist.

1816
02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:45.780
Shane bailey: I, you know,

1817
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:57.840
Shane bailey: I've only time I ever saw psychiatrist. When I was when I was in high school. We got to I got into a car accident with some of my friends and and one of the, one of my my buddy died and they sent me to a went to accounts and then

1818
02:47:58.380 --> 02:47:59.280
Shane bailey: I was like 17

1819
02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:01.740
Shane bailey: Okay.

1820
02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:09.570
Dr Jameson: Well, that's a counselor. But I mean, like, the doctors that that decided what medicine to give a person because, you know, for whatever symptoms. They have no

1821
02:48:10.740 --> 02:48:12.090
Shane bailey: No, I believe I've only ever seen a

1822
02:48:13.140 --> 02:48:13.770
Shane bailey: Doctor, yeah.

1823
02:48:13.890 --> 02:48:20.340
Dr Jameson: I mean in family practice, which is what I am. I mean we do definitely treat mental illness, a lot because it's very common.

1824
02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:30.570
Dr Jameson: But, you know, in the case of that are super severe and complicated by the fact that you've, you know, been in so much discomfort that you've

1825
02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:43.200
Dr Jameson: Been compelled to do self destructive things in order to to make that stop. You know, sometimes it's helpful to see someone that's a little bit more of an expert than us, you know, for, you know, more extensive training.

1826
02:48:46.110 --> 02:48:49.560
Dr Jameson: And then does it and I asked you, nobody else nobody else in your family has anxiety.

1827
02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:54.900
Shane bailey: Know, not that. Not that I, I know, I know.

1828
02:48:55.320 --> 02:48:57.300
Dr Jameson: But you remember having it when you were young.

1829
02:48:58.140 --> 02:49:01.680
Shane bailey: Yeah, oh my, I don't remember a time not having yeah

1830
02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:07.050
Shane bailey: They do have a certain, you know, it wasn't shared with me. I don't. Yeah.

1831
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:11.550
Dr Jameson: That's something you would have noticed, even if someone doesn't say hey Danny.

1832
02:49:11.850 --> 02:49:16.530
Shane bailey: Yeah. So no, I don't think they know what does my immediate family, I don't think

1833
02:49:17.490 --> 02:49:21.420
Dr Jameson: You have any other traumas like earlier in life. Besides, I know.

1834
02:49:23.130 --> 02:49:25.980
Shane bailey: I know my, my dad's my dad's my dad was abusive, but

1835
02:49:27.540 --> 02:49:32.460
Shane bailey: You know, beat on this a little bit, but it wasn't that terrible. Yes.

1836
02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:42.360
Dr Jameson: Okay, so it sounds like it was very good either. But okay, I'm just trying to see, you know, usually when what you're describing sounds like a pretty severe

1837
02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:53.970
Dr Jameson: Case of anxiety to be so young and already having it. But if it doesn't run in your family and I just makes it just unusual. I would have thought there would be other people in your family if you had such a strong, strong case of it.

1838
02:49:54.840 --> 02:50:01.140
Dr Jameson: So sometimes it's reactive to living, you know, living in a place where you don't feel safe for years.

1839
02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:03.480
Shane bailey: Yeah, I didn't feel safe.

1840
02:50:04.050 --> 02:50:13.050
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that will raise your alert, right, which is actually not and that's a normal response to a situation, but then you kind of get stuck in that

1841
02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:17.430
Dr Jameson: You know Fight or Flight state all the time.

1842
02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:34.050
Dr Jameson: Sometimes this is more like a PTSD situation that you know it's causing anxiety symptoms. I don't know, but just just throwing it out there. I don't know if it's ever been on your mind or something. I thought about, but

1843
02:50:34.350 --> 02:50:39.360
Shane bailey: No, I never thought about peace. I thought that was something that, uh, you know, like veterans.

1844
02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:39.720
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

1845
02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:41.550
Dr Jameson: Well, it is but

1846
02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:45.810
Dr Jameson: But it does not need to be a war situation to

1847
02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:56.190
Dr Jameson: That's kind of what happens to them right there. Don't know what the next time, they're going to get shot at. So they like live in this sort of constant alert says, you know what I mean. And that's kind of

1848
02:50:56.220 --> 02:50:59.100
Dr Jameson: The same, same idea just a different threat.

1849
02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:07.860
Shane bailey: I see I I get I can see that. Yeah, I did. I didn't I, you know, I said, you know what it would actually was, you know, I understand that.

1850
02:51:09.090 --> 02:51:10.500
Shane bailey: But that makes sense. Yeah.

1851
02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:12.720
Dr Jameson: Yeah and there's other things too.

1852
02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:24.240
Dr Jameson: Like if you're, if you have, you know, again, if you see I actually worked in urgent care one time and we were slopes, it was brand new, and there was a nurse there who's also was a paramedic before she went

1853
02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:30.540
Dr Jameson: I guess I guess before she went to nursing school and then the radiology tech and we were just shooting the shit and

1854
02:51:31.170 --> 02:51:38.100
Dr Jameson: I don't know how it came up, but it came up that both of them had had this very specific treatment done that has to do with movement. It's

1855
02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:52.140
Dr Jameson: really unusual thing, but apparently works very well anyway. Both of them have been treated for PTSD. One of them had witnessed like a college student jumped out of a building or something. And she was like, called to the scene as a paramedic and she couldn't

1856
02:51:53.730 --> 02:52:08.460
Dr Jameson: See it, you know, and somebody else had witnessed a bad car accident and it was, you know, it was just interfering like intrusive thoughts and waking up and you know you know anyway. Both of them had gone so it can be something even a one time thing.

1857
02:52:08.910 --> 02:52:09.330
Shane bailey: Sometimes

1858
02:52:09.900 --> 02:52:20.820
Shane bailey: So there's all different ways. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, in the car accident. We were we in a court when we were in the car x. And I was a seat belt. Next, you know, we were so broke up. I couldn't get away. You know, we were in there for

1859
02:52:22.590 --> 02:52:24.420
Shane bailey: An hour so before anybody came along.

1860
02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:26.070
Shane bailey: With your

1861
02:52:26.310 --> 02:52:30.000
Shane bailey: Friend Yeah, I guess, I guess that would I guess that

1862
02:52:31.170 --> 02:52:32.760
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I would think.

1863
02:52:34.170 --> 02:52:41.460
Dr Jameson: That sounds horrible. I'm not even the right way me. That's not even a bad enough word for that sound. That sounds unimaginable.

1864
02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:42.510
Um,

1865
02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:44.100
Dr Jameson: So,

1866
02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:51.180
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so I think my approach to this whole thing is, I'm sorry. We got you.

1867
02:52:52.260 --> 02:52:54.060
Shane bailey: Thinking about that, again, um,

1868
02:52:56.520 --> 02:53:04.860
Dr Jameson: My approach to this whole thing is, OK, we have a chemical imbalance that we can usually solve with this, the box on medicine.

1869
02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:17.130
Dr Jameson: But we, if we just ignore the rest of your life experience and we don't help you either process through things that need to be processed through

1870
02:53:17.550 --> 02:53:37.860
Dr Jameson: Treat untreated depression, anxiety, whatever, and help build coping skills that don't involve mind altering substances, we're not really doing the full, you know, comprehensive approach, you know, I mean, like, it's all part of part of the

1871
02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:40.080
Dr Jameson: Process, you know I'm saying

1872
02:53:45.630 --> 02:53:48.090
Shane bailey: Sorry, I wanna, I don't want to

1873
02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:49.800
Ignore that.

1874
02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:52.020
Shane bailey: Yeah.

1875
02:53:53.910 --> 02:53:54.360
Shane bailey: Well,

1876
02:53:55.140 --> 02:54:04.620
Dr Jameson: It isn't, it isn't really. I mean, that's obviously I didn't realize we were. I didn't mean to, like, rip a scab off of you just there unexpectedly, but

1877
02:54:06.690 --> 02:54:20.520
Dr Jameson: It's there. Right. And this is, I think, a common you will see one is as you go along. There's this is a kind of a common theme. Like, if we're carrying around this, or like bleeding inside and we just keep on putting a bandaid on but we never like stitch the wound.

1878
02:54:21.690 --> 02:54:26.970
Dr Jameson: You still have a woman that's leading like it doesn't go away just because we keep putting a bandaid on it. So, and it's sort of

1879
02:54:27.870 --> 02:54:37.410
Dr Jameson: The festers in there. So over time as you're comfortable. Are they gonna, we're going to like force you into something all at once when you're not ready, but I think

1880
02:54:37.770 --> 02:54:45.930
Dr Jameson: The point is just that we need to, I believe we need to take a more sort of comprehensive approach than just prescribing medicine and sending you on your way.

1881
02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:53.370
Dr Jameson: So, so we do have you taken Suboxone anywhere like in your travels

1882
02:54:56.760 --> 02:54:57.720
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

1883
02:54:59.070 --> 02:55:05.100
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, and then okay so lately, you've been using about how much And when's the last time you did.

1884
02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:08.910
Shane bailey: Score in but after Graham, I guess.

1885
02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:11.970
Dr Jameson: A day is I want you usually use or how much

1886
02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:14.340
Shane bailey: I mean, yeah, I'm trying to

1887
02:55:16.020 --> 02:55:18.690
Dr Jameson: Yeah. So have you been cutting down or that's just

1888
02:55:19.230 --> 02:55:20.280
Shane bailey: Yeah, I've cut down

1889
02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:21.930
Dr Jameson: Good.

1890
02:55:24.270 --> 02:55:24.780
Dr Jameson: Um,

1891
02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:28.770
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, so I don't go on and on about things you already know.

1892
02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:32.580
Dr Jameson: What do you know if anything about Suboxone

1893
02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:39.030
Shane bailey: That is a is an archipelago, too, but it's it's a it's not quite as it

1894
02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:42.360
Shane bailey: It doesn't have quite as much of a

1895
02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:52.890
Shane bailey: Guess effect on you. I guess it has a blocker and I understand that that it that it places in the receptors. If it takes the place of the then blocks other

1896
02:55:54.510 --> 02:55:59.310
Shane bailey: You know, other opiates opiates from from entering those same chapters.

1897
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:02.520
Dr Jameson: Yeah. So can you give a pretty good.

1898
02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:03.780
Shane bailey: Good.

1899
02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:11.850
Dr Jameson: Graph. So yes, it is an opiate I think sometimes people are bothered by that fact. But it's a basically a

1900
02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:16.290
Dr Jameson: Designer, I guess, drug. I don't know if that's the right word, but it

1901
02:56:17.070 --> 02:56:29.250
Dr Jameson: Was created to sit in the same receptors that the opiates other opiates. Do it turns. Some of them on and some of them, it turns off like it turns off the part that makes you stop breathing. Like it doesn't it doesn't

1902
02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:40.350
Dr Jameson: It sits in that receptor, but it turns that signal off. So in other words, it, it does not make people stop breathing and that you know so it does not really

1903
02:56:40.350 --> 02:56:40.980
Shane bailey: Have much

1904
02:56:41.010 --> 02:56:55.290
Dr Jameson: overdose. I mean, you can overdose on it. If you really work hard at it and take ginormous amounts, not the way it's designed and mix it with other things, but mostly it's relatively certainly far more safe than then what you're taking now.

1905
02:56:57.270 --> 02:57:06.330
Dr Jameson: It does not create euphoria, for the most part, maybe every so often, somebody will say, Oh, I feel a little bit. We usually lower the dose.

1906
02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:09.660
Dr Jameson: But it's not meant to and then it does

1907
02:57:10.980 --> 02:57:15.930
Dr Jameson: satisfy all the physical withdrawal sort of symptoms and cravings and

1908
02:57:16.050 --> 02:57:27.480
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's, yeah. Yeah. So, so most of our patients who are most successful are people that are at this point only using to not feel sick anymore. Like, they're not using

1909
02:57:27.870 --> 02:57:30.090
Dr Jameson: Words like you're there over the getting the high, it's just

1910
02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:31.020
Shane bailey: Yeah yeah

1911
02:57:32.070 --> 02:57:37.260
Shane bailey: I don't want, I have no yeah I didn't, I'm done with it. I don't want my interest.

1912
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:43.650
Dr Jameson: Is there any particular thing that sort of pushed you into the idea of treatment now compared to

1913
02:57:44.460 --> 02:57:52.710
Shane bailey: Just a well the reason I haven't done before because around here. The only way to get Suboxone or methadone is to go to a clinic every single day.

1914
02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:58.140
Shane bailey: Yeah. And then, and that even wouldn't be so bad I could probably get, you know, I could probably do that but

1915
02:57:58.770 --> 02:58:02.610
Shane bailey: If I get there early enough. You know, you get there early enough. I still need to work on time but problem is that

1916
02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:07.680
Shane bailey: Just all the time, and they'll hit you randomly with, you know, you have a doctor's appointment, you can't

1917
02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:17.910
Shane bailey: You can't get your medicine until you see the doctor. Well, that might take an hour or two hours, and it's it's random. So they don't tell you ahead of time so I can just show up late to work all the time hours logistical

1918
02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:18.900
Shane bailey: Problem. Yeah.

1919
02:58:19.410 --> 02:58:23.730
Shane bailey: So that that that keeps me from being able to to do it. Okay.

1920
02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:26.040
Dr Jameson: So you've been wanting to for a while.

1921
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:29.220
Shane bailey: Yeah, I would love to would love to.

1922
02:58:29.730 --> 02:58:34.140
Dr Jameson: Did your wife end up doing any medication assisted there. Excellent.

1923
02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:40.110
Shane bailey: Yeah, see, she got but she did. She got six you end up getting a

1924
02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:46.410
Shane bailey: Scene up having a really hideous blood infection that traveled to her heart.

1925
02:58:46.860 --> 02:58:47.160
And

1926
02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:54.390
Shane bailey: So yeah endocarditis. Right. She had three of her heart valves replaced with swine and update it really bad.

1927
02:58:54.960 --> 02:59:03.390
Shane bailey: Yes, he tried to die. But during that time. Obviously, when she was in the hospital that a one time see that by the time she got she was in there for a really long time with five months, six months.

1928
02:59:04.830 --> 02:59:05.730
Shane bailey: By time she was

1929
02:59:06.750 --> 02:59:10.230
Shane bailey: Left. She was often he went straight into a

1930
02:59:11.970 --> 02:59:12.780
Shane bailey: Great into a treatment.

1931
02:59:14.190 --> 02:59:18.270
Shane bailey: A long term treatment facility that that helped her so as far as medical yeah she was in there but

1932
02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:21.480
Shane bailey: As far as actual, like a treatment centers.

1933
02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:25.020
Dr Jameson: I mean, did they give her. Did you ever have Suboxone along the way, you don't know

1934
02:59:25.530 --> 02:59:25.950
Shane bailey: I don't know.

1935
02:59:26.490 --> 02:59:30.330
Dr Jameson: That's right. I just curious if you do you know anybody else that's taken it. I mean, if you

1936
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:35.520
Shane bailey: Yeah. Yeah, I have. I've spoken to people. That's how I do. Yeah, okay, good.

1937
02:59:36.390 --> 02:59:45.900
Dr Jameson: I mean, it has, as you know, I mean, it has a street value, which I'm not saying like, I want you to go sell it, but I'm just saying if people are willing to pay for it. In other words, like it works.

1938
02:59:45.930 --> 02:59:46.110
Shane bailey: Yeah.

1939
02:59:47.100 --> 02:59:48.060
Dr Jameson: That's what I'm trying to say.

1940
02:59:48.480 --> 02:59:48.660
Shane bailey: Here.

1941
02:59:49.440 --> 02:59:50.850
Shane bailey: Right, actually. Yeah, yeah.

1942
02:59:51.330 --> 02:59:51.840
Dr Jameson: So,

1943
02:59:52.470 --> 02:59:53.640
Shane bailey: The reason I'm sure I'm sure

1944
02:59:54.030 --> 03:00:01.470
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that's why I asked if you've had it because a lot of times people, you know, couldn't get what they really wanted and they take that as a as a replacement or something. So I'm just

1945
03:00:01.470 --> 03:00:10.860
Shane bailey: Scared. No, because what I understood was if you if you don't have enough like if you don't have a city supply that if you start taking it, it'll keep you need, you run out. Well then, Scott Walker's replaceable. Well, you did.

1946
03:00:11.730 --> 03:00:12.570
Dr Jameson: Well, yeah, right. You're

1947
03:00:12.660 --> 03:00:16.740
Shane bailey: Gonna you're gonna you're gonna withdraw again but it's it's it's

1948
03:00:17.490 --> 03:00:26.370
Dr Jameson: A little bit. Well, the onset of the withdrawals, a little bit slower longer. You know, it's a little bit more. It's a very long acting so it's more gradual that it comes out of your system.

1949
03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:32.520
Dr Jameson: Um, so yeah, so there's there's a couple other things that yeah so that's one of them.

1950
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:35.430
Dr Jameson: Yes, so it also block.

1951
03:00:36.540 --> 03:00:44.880
Dr Jameson: Other opiates. So once it's in there. It's. First of all, it will push other opiates out which is important because we need to make sure you're adequately.

1952
03:00:45.450 --> 03:00:54.060
Dr Jameson: Sick before we try to put this in, because if we if we if you've got stuff on board already, it will push that out and all of a sudden your withdrawal will be

1953
03:00:55.590 --> 03:01:03.840
Dr Jameson: Invalid actually give you withdrawal until things reset again. So I want to do that. That's not pleasant at all.

1954
03:01:05.370 --> 03:01:10.440
Dr Jameson: But it also sticks in there. So really strong. So most other opiates.

1955
03:01:11.550 --> 03:01:24.360
Dr Jameson: Maybe not fentanyl but most other opiates can't get at where they're trying to go if you happen to be exposed to something again while you're on the Suboxone so

1956
03:01:25.470 --> 03:01:28.530
Dr Jameson: Yeah. So those are the biggest thing. So, in your case,

1957
03:01:30.150 --> 03:01:46.860
Dr Jameson: The only, the only thing that we sometimes have issues with is if which is happening more and more what you're taking is some heroin and some fentanyl because fentanyl last a lot longer and it's stored in your fat cells. Anyway, it seems seems to take a lot longer to get out.

1958
03:01:47.430 --> 03:01:54.450
Shane bailey: Of right. Yeah. No, and I and I spent a lot of time and effort to try to stay away from. Yeah.

1959
03:01:55.980 --> 03:01:58.920
Dr Jameson: You know, sometimes you don't know like I had somebody who

1960
03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:14.070
Dr Jameson: I guess there's somewhere in San Francisco where you can actually have your medicine medicine, your drugs tested and he had done that at one point, and was pretty confident that he did not have any fentanyl and then we started Suboxone and

1961
03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:16.530
Shane bailey: Yes, we did.

1962
03:02:17.130 --> 03:02:26.130
Dr Jameson: So anyway, we don't know i think it's it's it's just the biggest thing is to really we. How long does it take for you to start to feel pretty thick.

1963
03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:29.340
Shane bailey: 10 hours probably 12 hours. Yeah.

1964
03:02:29.430 --> 03:02:33.690
Shane bailey: And if I if I if I take something before I go to bed. I'm easy. Okay. When I first wake up for

1965
03:02:34.830 --> 03:02:43.020
Shane bailey: I mean, honestly, six, seven hours em okay for the bars course. I usually don't wait that long. Usually, you know. Yeah, I don't feel like getting sick.

1966
03:02:43.380 --> 03:02:45.540
Shane bailey: Well preemptively all these

1967
03:02:45.540 --> 03:02:46.320
Dr Jameson: There's a lot of you.

1968
03:02:46.830 --> 03:02:49.920
Dr Jameson: Know there's a lot of like anticipatory

1969
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:58.620
Dr Jameson: Anxiety. Like, I don't want to feel bad. So I'm going to take it before you even get there and like the idea of going into withdrawal creates

1970
03:02:58.860 --> 03:02:59.910
Dr Jameson: Sentence almost on the

1971
03:02:59.910 --> 03:03:00.510
Spot.

1972
03:03:01.980 --> 03:03:06.390
Dr Jameson: So, some of this is, it's really. I mean, it's good and bad. I mean, yes, we can.

1973
03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:07.380
Shane bailey: Yeah.

1974
03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:24.900
Dr Jameson: You're thinking about stuff sometimes we can help with some of your symptoms, but I think in your case, I would probably and it's probably not going to be pleasant, but I think you probably need to wait at least 24 hours from your last dose of

1975
03:03:25.290 --> 03:03:25.920
Shane bailey: Heroin

1976
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:38.580
Dr Jameson: Before you start Suboxone. So that's the like if I had to say there's one downside to it. That's the hardest part is, is that you have to go into withdrawal before you can start the Suboxone

1977
03:03:39.420 --> 03:03:42.210
Dr Jameson: So it's not exactly a completely similar

1978
03:03:44.010 --> 03:03:47.580
Shane bailey: How do you take it and soon as you take it. Those withdrawals system. Stop right

1979
03:03:48.540 --> 03:03:55.380
Dr Jameson: So I've seen people have told me that within if we have the dose right within 30 minutes. Some people even sooner.

1980
03:03:55.890 --> 03:03:56.610
Shane bailey: I'm

1981
03:03:57.480 --> 03:03:59.250
Dr Jameson: Certainly no longer than an hour.

1982
03:03:59.730 --> 03:04:02.100
Shane bailey: Yeah, I can. I can get my teeth for 24

1983
03:04:04.260 --> 03:04:12.630
Dr Jameson: And we can do some other medicate like what kind of symptoms. I mean, I probably have an idea about what it. How does your withdrawal.

1984
03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:19.530
Shane bailey: Well he's it you know that's and then legs, you know, you know, you get like paying

1985
03:04:19.530 --> 03:04:29.640
Shane bailey: jumpy degree and jumping fatigue, you know, General fatigue in without it for some reason. It just makes you just do you want to draw this is

1986
03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:36.870
Shane bailey: Actually one of my besides anxiety. One of my biggest, biggest problems is that I have, you know, I work and everything else. We have to do it. And I can't be

1987
03:04:38.130 --> 03:04:43.110
Shane bailey: Dog down. It makes my life impossible if I don't have money to get out of get on my own way, you know,

1988
03:04:44.190 --> 03:04:47.040
Dr Jameson: When you're when you go into a job. Do you have trouble sleeping.

1989
03:04:47.520 --> 03:04:49.500
Shane bailey: Oh yeah, that's the yeah yeah yeah

1990
03:04:50.820 --> 03:05:01.950
Shane bailey: Yeah, hideous insomnia. That's, that's nothing. It's just, yeah. You're terribly on. It's just a perpetual never ending uncomfortable ability, it's just, it's not so much painful.

1991
03:05:03.660 --> 03:05:12.630
Shane bailey: You know, like, like a like a hurt like a real sharp pain. It's just a constant nagging persistent thing that over time wears you down when you just you just, you know,

1992
03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:15.150
Dr Jameson: How about stomach stuff you get upset.

1993
03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:23.100
Shane bailey: I never, you know, that's one thing I never, I never really had diarrhea. You know, sometimes, but never I don't feel. I never, I never throw out. Okay.

1994
03:05:24.330 --> 03:05:38.610
Dr Jameson: I'm asking, partly because we just a document, but also because I can, you know, potentially, we can. Well, I'll send some hydroxyl the end for you. Now that might help you sleep, but it might not. Because like it sounds like the insomnia is just sort of

1995
03:05:39.210 --> 03:05:41.850
Shane bailey: Yeah, this is yeah, while you're feeling what you're feeling that way.

1996
03:05:43.140 --> 03:05:44.250
Shane bailey: It's okay, you know, I

1997
03:05:44.490 --> 03:05:45.300
Shane bailey: Mean your other

1998
03:05:45.450 --> 03:05:53.010
Dr Jameson: Your other option would be to, I don't know what would be better. Where's your other option would be to wait.

1999
03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:58.950
Dr Jameson: Until you know not start your 24 hours until

2000
03:06:00.420 --> 03:06:03.900
Dr Jameson: You know need to do an evening dose and then wait 24 hours from that.

2001
03:06:04.350 --> 03:06:16.440
Shane bailey: Well right right now. Right now, I haven't, I haven't used this this morning when I got up, and that was that was at a 530 I guess so. It's already I'm already looking at what just almost eight hours. I'd rather just

2002
03:06:16.620 --> 03:06:20.190
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I'm just doing okay. I'm just trying to think of like timing. So you don't have to stay up

2003
03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:23.100
Dr Jameson: All night, you'd be like staying up all day, you know, you'd be up anyway so

2004
03:06:23.370 --> 03:06:28.980
Dr Jameson: Okay course. I don't want to tell you to use. And then, you know, God forbid you overdose on your, you know, I

2005
03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:31.020
Shane bailey: Understand

2006
03:06:31.170 --> 03:06:43.470
Dr Jameson: Yeah okay so so that's going to be so we can definitely send some hydroxyl. The and I guess it doesn't sound like knowledge and medicine is going to be, have you helpful. Have you ever sorry there's a shadow on my face I'm trying to keep out of it.

2007
03:06:44.550 --> 03:06:48.840
Dr Jameson: Have you ever used Clonidine, have you heard of that. No Klonopin Clonidine

2008
03:06:49.470 --> 03:07:00.150
Dr Jameson: Know, so we use that sometimes people seem, it doesn't always help, but sometimes it helps with some of the restless jumpy hot and cold stuff.

2009
03:07:00.180 --> 03:07:04.380
Shane bailey: I don't do that. Oh yeah, that's for sure. Yeah, yeah. So you're going through menopause or something.

2010
03:07:08.130 --> 03:07:11.640
Dr Jameson: I never heard it described that way, but I hope that's not what

2011
03:07:15.720 --> 03:07:16.980
Shane bailey: Mother do it seem like that was

2012
03:07:18.120 --> 03:07:19.410
Dr Jameson: A little bit, I guess. Yeah.

2013
03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:31.320
Dr Jameson: Things to look forward to. Um, okay, so we could try. I can send that to so you have a couple things that you can try overnight if you need some

2014
03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:38.070
Dr Jameson: Partial relief. Anyway, I don't, I don't think any. I mean, being realistic. We're not. You're not gonna feel good, but

2015
03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:41.520
Dr Jameson: make you less bad we can we can try anyway.

2016
03:07:46.200 --> 03:07:57.210
Dr Jameson: There are some anyway. Since you have to wait till tomorrow, there are sometimes delays on the pharmacy and like sometimes they need a prior all filled out sometimes they have to order it. They don't have any in sometimes the pharmacy is already

2017
03:07:57.300 --> 03:07:59.820
Dr Jameson: At their quota for how many patients, they can

2018
03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:11.010
Dr Jameson: Supply because they get a certain limited amount from their distributor and they only divides by so many patients in a month. So

2019
03:08:11.580 --> 03:08:17.670
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so sometimes we have some little hiccups. I don't know. Did you have you checked with the pharmacy that they have it or that they're taking patients or

2020
03:08:18.990 --> 03:08:28.710
Shane bailey: No, no, but I have, but I have a how I found out about this program is this is how this worked out for me that I have a friend. I know from

2021
03:08:29.850 --> 03:08:35.850
Shane bailey: My dealings, and he's doing and he's doing it and he's going to show you from the, from the pharmacy here in town. So

2022
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:36.210
Dr Jameson: Okay.

2023
03:08:36.270 --> 03:08:36.810
Dr Jameson: So, you know, they

2024
03:08:37.080 --> 03:08:52.380
Dr Jameson: Have it. Okay, so there's only, the only question is, if they're maxed out but hopefully not okay. Um, so, so that's important that we wait. And then I think, um, how long have you gone lately, without taking anything

2025
03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:59.850
Shane bailey: I usually try to go as long as possible. You know, I've been. I've been doing it. Like I said, I started feeling bad about 10 hours let Mary so

2026
03:09:00.030 --> 03:09:01.620
Dr Jameson: If you haven't gotten like a couple days or

2027
03:09:02.430 --> 03:09:16.140
Shane bailey: No, no, no, no. But I've gotten I've done you know like I got caught it work. We went out of town unexpectedly, and it was that wasn't fun, but I was almost full 24 hours before I was able to I survived.

2028
03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:23.340
Shane bailey: Yeah, by the by the end of 24 hours. I wasn't super it wasn't feeling super hot but you know I was, it wasn't that terrible

2029
03:09:24.300 --> 03:09:34.890
Shane bailey: It's usually because I don't really get the worst of it seems like because I have a problem. If you guys fully in doesn't seem like you really get the worst of until about three days three days seems to be the yeah really as bad as it gets.

2030
03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:35.730
Dr Jameson: Well, I'm so

2031
03:09:36.510 --> 03:09:37.260
Dr Jameson: I I'm

2032
03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:43.920
Dr Jameson: I worry a little bit about the you know possibility of fat know and that

2033
03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:49.860
Dr Jameson: Kind of makes me worry a little bit more that there might be some in there anyway.

2034
03:09:52.530 --> 03:09:55.680
Dr Jameson: So we should probably start at a low

2035
03:09:56.250 --> 03:10:09.600
Dr Jameson: lower dose of buprenorphine. Sometimes I just have people just take this dose. This is probably what you're going to need, and both, you know, just go for it. But I think, in your case, I want you to start with smaller pieces and then add every 30 to 60 minutes as long as

2036
03:10:10.680 --> 03:10:13.500
Dr Jameson: That's the case, it seems to make you feel worse. I wanted

2037
03:10:13.530 --> 03:10:14.130
Dr Jameson: To be as little

2038
03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:16.800
Dr Jameson: As possible in there when you first tried

2039
03:10:17.160 --> 03:10:17.970
Shane bailey: Just in case.

2040
03:10:19.350 --> 03:10:30.330
Dr Jameson: If, if the other meds that we prescribe How are helping you, and you can you feel like you can wait a little longer than the longer you wait, the better. I think

2041
03:10:30.420 --> 03:10:49.980
Dr Jameson: So you see what you can muster. I'm not that i i mean i hate to have you. Suffer, suffer. But you also did do it once and even though it wasn't, it wasn't by choice. So, I mean, you have survived it before. Unfortunately it's feels like you're dying right but it

2042
03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:53.070
Dr Jameson: Actually is rarely, rarely actually

2043
03:10:53.490 --> 03:10:56.400
Dr Jameson: Does cause that so alright so we'll

2044
03:10:57.870 --> 03:11:06.750
Dr Jameson: The timing is really the only thing you know the thing. Let me just look real quick. In this we have to me there's a prescription drug monitoring system and

2045
03:11:08.670 --> 03:11:15.240
Dr Jameson: When you see that real quick just to make sure there aren't any. I saw something else. This morning, and I put her in there and she had you know her.

2046
03:11:15.660 --> 03:11:19.740
Dr Jameson: Marco prescription from every, every month and I said something about oh

2047
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:34.380
Dr Jameson: You know I mentioned it, and then she's like, Oh yeah, I haven't. I said, well, you haven't gone this month. Yes, I want. Oh, I gotta go. And I was like, Well, wait, you can still take Norco if you're on. Oh, I can't. Oh, well, then I don't want to, like, okay.

2048
03:11:35.550 --> 03:11:41.790
Dr Jameson: Nevermind. So it was kind of a funny unexpected end to that appointment.

2049
03:11:43.350 --> 03:11:45.870
Dr Jameson: Right now is 125 83. Is that right,

2050
03:11:46.410 --> 03:11:48.090
Dr Jameson: Yes, oh, what

2051
03:11:51.030 --> 03:11:56.370
Dr Jameson: Did they explain to sort of the structure of our pro or does your friend use us or

2052
03:11:57.510 --> 03:11:57.840
Shane bailey: Yeah.

2053
03:11:58.110 --> 03:12:04.890
Shane bailey: Okay. Oh no, I don't mean I don't know. They use you. But it was going through, was it was I went to the same avenues that he went through. So I imagine is using you guys so

2054
03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:13.890
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's it's Shane SH e Bay and i i'm not nothing's coming up in the system. So I guess that means you haven't had any prescriptions and

2055
03:12:14.220 --> 03:12:15.210
Shane bailey: The last couple years. Okay.

2056
03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:17.220
Well, that's

2057
03:12:19.260 --> 03:12:23.490
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, and then I don't think I have you been injecting or how have you been using it.

2058
03:12:24.420 --> 03:12:29.250
Shane bailey: Well, originally before you know I did enjoy. I haven't been injected a long time.

2059
03:12:30.390 --> 03:12:31.830
Shane bailey: Or use smoking.

2060
03:12:34.410 --> 03:12:39.660
Dr Jameson: I guess that your wife's ex wife's medical scare probably

2061
03:12:39.870 --> 03:12:41.190
Shane bailey: Yeah yeah

2062
03:12:42.510 --> 03:12:43.350
Shane bailey: Yeah, it was horrible.

2063
03:12:43.740 --> 03:12:46.350
Shane bailey: Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly how she got it to us from

2064
03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:49.440
Shane bailey: There they all get it.

2065
03:12:50.310 --> 03:12:54.600
Shane bailey: From me or mud, so lots, and lots, and lots, lots of young people that have died from it. Yeah.

2066
03:12:57.030 --> 03:12:57.270
Shane bailey: Yeah.

2067
03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:01.920
Dr Jameson: And how about hepatitis any anybody had that around you.

2068
03:13:02.970 --> 03:13:04.530
Shane bailey: Oh yeah Rami sure I went to jail.

2069
03:13:05.730 --> 03:13:06.420
Shane bailey: Everybody in there has

2070
03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:08.820
Shane bailey: Okay. But generally, I don't. I know.

2071
03:13:09.450 --> 03:13:10.560
Dr Jameson: Your wife your ex wife.

2072
03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:11.460
Dr Jameson: Never did either

2073
03:13:13.470 --> 03:13:15.360
Dr Jameson: Okay, um, how tall are you,

2074
03:13:16.230 --> 03:13:17.100
I'm 511

2075
03:13:18.360 --> 03:13:19.560
Dr Jameson: And about almost anything.

2076
03:13:20.100 --> 03:13:21.870
Shane bailey: Right now I'm pretty skinny about 160

2077
03:13:24.510 --> 03:13:25.410
Dr Jameson: See lost some weight.

2078
03:13:27.720 --> 03:13:29.910
Shane bailey: Usually about 190 oh

2079
03:13:31.290 --> 03:13:31.590
Okay.

2080
03:13:33.570 --> 03:13:36.690
Dr Jameson: Okay, so there was something else. And I was gonna

2081
03:13:37.680 --> 03:13:51.600
Dr Jameson: Oh, so the way that we work, you have this this meeting, which we've already just about finished and then you'll have an evaluation at some point, probably not. Before you end up in our in a group, but we will schedule you for an initial counselor evaluation.

2082
03:13:52.110 --> 03:14:03.330
Dr Jameson: And that at that visit, they will sort of make a recommendation about oh you've had years of counseling, you're good. We can just do a follow up every six months for a little touch base or

2083
03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:13.140
Dr Jameson: We think you should we recommend every week or twice a week or twice a month or whatever, they'll, they'll give you a recommendation about how often it seems

2084
03:14:13.470 --> 03:14:14.550
Shane bailey: Beneficial that you meet

2085
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:17.310
Dr Jameson: Individually with a counselor. I think we've already

2086
03:14:18.900 --> 03:14:28.170
Dr Jameson: Determined that will probably be helpful for you and it is for almost everybody, including I mean counselors and doctors go to counseling do so it's not it's not

2087
03:14:29.100 --> 03:14:44.760
Dr Jameson: It's not a unique situation at all. And then as far as follow up with me that happens in this in the context of weekly groups that we we do with it's me and then patients and accounts in a drug and alcohol counselor typically so

2088
03:14:46.170 --> 03:14:46.950
Dr Jameson: We

2089
03:14:48.810 --> 03:14:51.300
Dr Jameson: You know we do like a quick who needs refills sort of

2090
03:14:52.440 --> 03:15:02.640
Dr Jameson: At the beginning, and then I'm there for the whole and I'm listening. And sometimes, sometimes charming and more than I should have probably better. I will do the refill, sort of, it's sort of a combination

2091
03:15:03.690 --> 03:15:03.990
Shane bailey: Okay.

2092
03:15:05.070 --> 03:15:05.550
Dr Jameson: Visit

2093
03:15:07.890 --> 03:15:08.940
Dr Jameson: We start out with

2094
03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:17.910
Dr Jameson: Well, sometimes not even a full week at a time. We started with weekly prescription and as you, you know, meet all your

2095
03:15:19.050 --> 03:15:26.910
Dr Jameson: Requirements to show up and you know participate. We eventually after a few months will extend that to every two weeks and then

2096
03:15:28.020 --> 03:15:31.110
Dr Jameson: Ultimately, as much as a month at a time. If you really

2097
03:15:32.490 --> 03:15:35.490
Dr Jameson: made a lot of progress and, you know, kept kept you

2098
03:15:35.970 --> 03:15:41.370
Dr Jameson: Kept yourself in line and you're going to do blood work have you already gone to the lab.

2099
03:15:41.640 --> 03:15:43.200
Shane bailey: No, no I but I will

2100
03:15:43.500 --> 03:15:44.460
Dr Jameson: Like you know about

2101
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:48.840
Shane bailey: It. I gotta get back to work. But our thing. Okay, I'll be able to do it tomorrow. The next day,

2102
03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:58.560
Dr Jameson: Perfect. Um, and then after that, we'll do monthly drug screens, which they actually mail you a cup so you don't have to keep going to the lab every month. It's kind of nice.

2103
03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:04.620
Dr Jameson: Because we do it right on screen. And it's a cup that has the built in testers, so we can just, you just hold it up when we look

2104
03:16:06.600 --> 03:16:15.660
Dr Jameson: So explain that more in detail. There are weekly surveys, they email you where they asked you variety of, you know, how, how are you doing kind of questions I guess then we we just

2105
03:16:15.930 --> 03:16:26.970
Dr Jameson: Kind of like track over time and look for trends and they're really into data analytics and stuff like that, which kind of interesting, but it doesn't mean you have to fill out surveys every week, which some people don't enjoy

2106
03:16:27.900 --> 03:16:38.070
Dr Jameson: And then, um, I guess the last thing is to figure out what time works best for you as far as group I obviously you work like nine to five, pretty much.

2107
03:16:38.430 --> 03:16:46.350
Shane bailey: Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, yeah, I leave, I leave my house around 530 I usually get back about 530 well okay

2108
03:16:46.770 --> 03:16:48.420
Dr Jameson: Do you get a lunch hour

2109
03:16:48.990 --> 03:16:52.830
Shane bailey: Yeah, well, we sometimes. Sometimes our vegetable. Okay.

2110
03:16:53.130 --> 03:17:00.150
Dr Jameson: So because I have two groups on Wednesdays, but ones at 10:30am and ones at noon I don't doesn't sound like that's going to be

2111
03:17:00.750 --> 03:17:01.800
Shane bailey: I wouldn't be able to hear

2112
03:17:02.100 --> 03:17:06.240
Dr Jameson: And then I have Tuesday evening.

2113
03:17:09.180 --> 03:17:11.040
Dr Jameson: I have a five.

2114
03:17:13.050 --> 03:17:13.800
Dr Jameson: Or

2115
03:17:15.060 --> 03:17:18.390
Shane bailey: 615 613 would be fine.

2116
03:17:22.620 --> 03:17:24.240
Dr Jameson: But Tuesday evening.

2117
03:17:26.040 --> 03:17:27.300
Dr Jameson: So that would be

2118
03:17:28.500 --> 03:17:34.830
Dr Jameson: And then anytime you have any sort of visit or appointment or whatever. You go to the virtual clinic, which is where you started.

2119
03:17:35.400 --> 03:17:36.240
Earlier today.

2120
03:17:37.290 --> 03:17:44.520
Dr Jameson: They'll check you in and then shoot you. The number for whatever meeting room you, you're going to be in that day, our group meeting changes every week.

2121
03:17:45.420 --> 03:17:46.470
Shane bailey: You know, just want people

2122
03:17:46.590 --> 03:17:52.830
Dr Jameson: Randomly showing up if they haven't you know you know whatever paid or done whatever they're supposed to do it.

2123
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:56.730
Dr Jameson: So just, you know, we have a couple

2124
03:17:58.020 --> 03:18:09.690
Dr Jameson: Guidelines or whatever rules I guess for group. One is that we ask people not to smoke on camera because some people are quitting or have questions don't need to be watching somebody else puffing away.

2125
03:18:11.100 --> 03:18:17.580
Dr Jameson: And then we asked you to have headphones or earbuds or something which is more for privacy of your fellow

2126
03:18:19.530 --> 03:18:20.310
Dr Jameson: Group roommates.

2127
03:18:21.630 --> 03:18:23.220
Dr Jameson: And I see you're in your car and you know

2128
03:18:24.360 --> 03:18:37.590
Dr Jameson: Unless I mean I, you know, hypothetically, someone could be sitting next to you anyway. So we just do it as a courtesy and also to cut back on background noises and stuff like that. So other than that. There's not a lot of we just hopefully you're in a quiet place where you can

2129
03:18:38.670 --> 03:18:45.360
Dr Jameson: Pay attention for for it's about it goes usually not longer than an hour, sometimes a little bit shorter than that, but approximately an hour.

2130
03:18:46.050 --> 03:18:59.250
Dr Jameson: And they asked you to check in. I am throwing a lot of stuff at you, but they asked you to start your check in at least half an hour before the group actually starts. I don't know how much time you spent waiting today in the virtual clinic, but there can be

2131
03:18:59.490 --> 03:19:00.570
Shane bailey: 1015 minutes. Yeah.

2132
03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:07.350
Dr Jameson: Sometimes it can be you know if there's 10 people all checking in, for the same group. And there's two or three of them.

2133
03:19:07.890 --> 03:19:16.440
Dr Jameson: You know you can own and somebody didn't do this and I didn't do that all you need, you know, sometimes it's a little time consuming to get everybody squared away so

2134
03:19:17.220 --> 03:19:34.230
Dr Jameson: I mean, in your case, you could even like while you're driving home or something you could sign in and just wait on hold and talk to them, you know, and you know, and then have the code, you can do it before half an hour to. I mean, but no less than half an hour. I guess is what I'm saying.

2135
03:19:38.160 --> 03:19:38.580
Are you there.

2136
03:20:15.570 --> 03:20:18.600
dictate the Risa and TV shows back up.

2137
03:20:20.340 --> 03:20:26.910
Dr Jameson: Here to today to discuss her results from last month, which was positive or buprenorphine but also for math.

2138
03:20:27.480 --> 03:20:45.630
Dr Jameson: She acknowledges that from time to time, she just loved math, typically with her one of her ex husbands who comes by periodically. He had been staying with them for a couple weeks and offered offered it to her and she states. It's not one of them. He does very regularly and she's not

2139
03:20:47.820 --> 03:20:53.850
Dr Jameson: Necessarily it's just go out of our way to go find it. She did not feel like it.

2140
03:20:54.990 --> 03:20:57.930
Dr Jameson: Prime's her for wanting to use any other substances.

2141
03:21:01.350 --> 03:21:14.190
Dr Jameson: And she's you know willing to cut back or eliminate eliminate that I am in fact she does admit there. She doesn't notify me that there will likely also be math on her system. This coming month

2142
03:21:18.630 --> 03:21:24.480
Dr Jameson: Mental Status fiscal normal or UD severe plan patients forthcoming and

2143
03:21:28.770 --> 03:21:36.120
Dr Jameson: Appropriate, we discussed the potential risks physically medically of using math and also just the sort of

2144
03:21:37.470 --> 03:21:39.630
Dr Jameson: slippery slopes that can that can ensue.

2145
03:21:42.540 --> 03:21:45.660
Dr Jameson: Ideally, it would not be used at all.

2146
03:21:47.850 --> 03:21:48.420
Dr Jameson: We will

2147
03:21:49.920 --> 03:21:57.810
Dr Jameson: Obviously, see this month, but hopefully going forward, there will no longer be positive tests for math in her in her samples.

2148
03:22:00.930 --> 03:22:03.660
Dr Jameson: Then we have Shane Bailey.

2149
03:22:04.920 --> 03:22:07.110
Dr Jameson: I'll be this phone died or something happened.

2150
03:22:16.620 --> 03:22:18.900
Dr Jameson: Who presents today for initial

2151
03:22:20.250 --> 03:22:21.150
Dr Jameson: history and physical

2152
03:22:24.540 --> 03:22:25.650
Dr Jameson: His opiates.

2153
03:22:28.410 --> 03:22:38.640
Dr Jameson: Problem began with prescription payments, after some injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident and some surgeries that ensued.

2154
03:22:40.290 --> 03:22:56.760
Dr Jameson: Ultimately, the prescriptions were discontinued and he transitioned to purchasing pills and eventually to heroin for supply as well as cost reasons he has injected in the past but no more recently, he's been smoking it

2155
03:22:58.170 --> 03:23:01.260
Dr Jameson: In a period of sobriety. That was

2156
03:23:03.660 --> 03:23:04.140
Dr Jameson: Sort of

2157
03:23:05.520 --> 03:23:13.500
Dr Jameson: Forced when he was incarcerated over the period of a year he had severe symptoms for about a month and then more

2158
03:23:14.220 --> 03:23:25.560
Dr Jameson: Mood and energy level symptoms for probably seven months after stopping. He was released about a year ago and was clean for about four months. But at that time was living with his sister, who is

2159
03:23:26.220 --> 03:23:35.070
Dr Jameson: Also an addict and eventually he returned to use. He's currently using about a half a gram a day.

2160
03:23:36.180 --> 03:23:39.150
Dr Jameson: Just cut back a little bit from previous

2161
03:23:40.290 --> 03:23:41.760
Dr Jameson: Is withdrawal includes

2162
03:23:43.440 --> 03:23:44.460
Dr Jameson: Diarrhea

2163
03:23:45.990 --> 03:23:49.050
Dr Jameson: anxiety, insomnia, restlessness hot and cold.

2164
03:23:51.630 --> 03:24:01.950
Dr Jameson: But he acknowledges that he's has underlying anxiety chronically anyway and feels that that's part of what he's been treating from the beginning.

2165
03:24:04.050 --> 03:24:05.130
Dr Jameson: He is

2166
03:24:07.440 --> 03:24:27.750
Dr Jameson: Has not been in treatment previously he heard about our program through a friend who's been using Suboxone he has never tried it himself. But he's understood, he's heard some about how how it works and past medical history, and I tried to put that all in there.

2167
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:36.060
Dr Jameson: He does have jumped out childhood trauma, both from an abusive father and also he survived.

2168
03:24:37.290 --> 03:24:49.380
Dr Jameson: A fatal car wreck that killed one of his friends when he was 17 they were all trapped in the car for at least an hour before they were rescued.

2169
03:24:53.370 --> 03:24:55.290
Dr Jameson: Even relating this episode.

2170
03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:00.390
Dr Jameson: Is it creates some significant

2171
03:25:01.620 --> 03:25:03.750
Dr Jameson: emotional response.

2172
03:25:06.450 --> 03:25:11.970
Dr Jameson: Mental Status tearful at one point relating his

2173
03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:16.080
Dr Jameson: Products accident, but otherwise.

2174
03:25:17.670 --> 03:25:18.360
Dr Jameson: Normal

2175
03:25:21.300 --> 03:25:22.440
Dr Jameson: Maybe a little fidgety

2176
03:25:24.150 --> 03:25:27.420
Dr Jameson: physicals normal assessment or UD severe

2177
03:25:29.460 --> 03:25:32.730
Dr Jameson: Plan think he's a good candidate for

2178
03:25:34.560 --> 03:25:40.410
Dr Jameson: medication assisted therapy. He's certainly got a physical dependency at this point.

2179
03:25:42.150 --> 03:25:43.260
Dr Jameson: We discussed the

2180
03:25:44.370 --> 03:25:48.120
Dr Jameson: Mechanism of action and the possibility of

2181
03:25:49.740 --> 03:25:54.270
Dr Jameson: Specific precipitated withdrawal, particularly given the

2182
03:25:55.800 --> 03:26:01.890
Dr Jameson: frequency with which they're spending know in the in the current heroin supply

2183
03:26:05.010 --> 03:26:06.540
Dr Jameson: We talked about

2184
03:26:07.620 --> 03:26:10.710
Dr Jameson: Timing of first dose and

2185
03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:18.270
Dr Jameson: The structure of our program.

2186
03:26:24.480 --> 03:26:29.670
Dr Jameson: It's appears to me that he's got some significant anxiety and

2187
03:26:30.840 --> 03:26:35.970
Dr Jameson: Probably PTSD and certain he will benefit from

2188
03:26:38.430 --> 03:26:41.370
Dr Jameson: Concurrent individual counseling.

2189
03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:55.980
Dr Jameson: We can use hydroxide Xen and Clonidine initially to try to help him through the initial phase stages of withdrawal until a table to begin Suboxone

2190
03:26:57.630 --> 03:27:03.270
Dr Jameson: I'm going to have them start with the typical induction protocol two milligrams every 30 to 60 minutes

2191
03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:07.530
Dr Jameson: Until up to eight milligrams

2192
03:27:10.650 --> 03:27:17.190
Dr Jameson: And then up to twice a day. He'll begin group next week and Tuesday.

2193
03:27:19.470 --> 03:27:23.160
Dr Jameson: Evening group, he's going to go to the lab tomorrow.

2194
03:27:24.390 --> 03:27:25.140
Dr Jameson: And
