00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.990
Sandee A: I'm not doing too good.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.880
Sandee A: I fell. This morning when I got up and I have to go to the emergency room and get checked out.

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:43.740
Sandee A: I was starting to get into find out for sure what time the important that was because my orthopedic said if I did in fact break my hip this time that prolonging surgery could cause irreversible and unattainable damage.

7
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.800
Sandee A: So I'm scared.

8
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.490
Richelle Direny: What so um so what's going. I know you're supposed to have surgery tomorrow. Right.

9
00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:02.610
Sandee A: Yeah, the moves been postponed until Friday because the place that we ran into the U Haul from

10
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:20.760
Sandee A: Does in town moves, only they won't allow you to go more than 100 miles. So we have defined another U Haul that would allow a one way trip. And I don't know how the wires crossed, but they did.

11
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.830
Sandee A: So,

12
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.880
Sandee A: I got confirmation last night from my daughter in an email that we do have the truck for one way of Friday at 11 o'clock.

13
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.950
Richelle Direny: The same day as your postpone surgery.

14
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.490

15
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.790
Richelle Direny: Surgery was supposed to be tomorrow. I thought

16
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.860
Richelle Direny: Or your move was supposed to be tomorrow.

17
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.770
Sandee A: Right, my move was supposed to be tomorrow, but because of the U Haul mess up. We can't take the

18
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.040
Sandee A: M. O.

19
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.050
Sandee A: Now the move this Friday. Will we get to track that we can take one way

20
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.370
Sandee A: And it's over 200 miles so

21
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.390
Sandee A: You need to get more rest.

Promoting

59
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:42.420
Sandee A: Well, after I spoke to the doctor and realized how serious it can be. I'm going to the hospital. Believe me, but I'm still not completely dressed. I don't have any pants on.

66
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.670
Richelle Direny: And it's very painful to do that right

67
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:10.080
Sandee A: It's very painful to move errands to top it off, I get an aide that comes in three times a week, and she didn't show up this morning. So did you

68
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:19.410
Sandee A: Get that help yeah I called and they said it's because of the move and they thought I was moving tomorrow. So they want to have been terminated my services.

69
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.470
Sandee A: I was ever

70
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.740
Sandee A: On Monday, Wednesday and Friday. They just went ahead your

71
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:32.940
Richelle Direny: What your move with force was set for tomorrow. So then they got terminated prematurely, you still need to dance.

72
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.970
Richelle Direny: Yeah and if they hadn't come here today, they would have helped you.

73
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.410
Richelle Direny: In your clothes on.

74
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:44.070
Sandee A: Yep, that's the way it's supposed to happen. They come and they help and get the shower and they helped me get dressed and

75
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:59.490
Sandee A: I mean that's been going on for a long time. Like I I'm disabled and I can't move. I mean, you know, that's why I was on all the opiates and I'm 63 years old. This body is wracked with pain.

76
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.450
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so, um, so you caught you. So you spoke to your doctor first thing this morning, then

77
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.100
Sandee A: I should have went to the emergency room or right away, but I'm kind of stubborn bowhead

78
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.790
Sandee A: And I don't like hospitals.

79
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.800
Sandee A: And after having that double bypass in December.

80
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.370
Sandee A: still fresh in my mind. I don't really want to go.

81
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.680
Sandee A: Not even the best of health.

82
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.460
Sandee A: Trying to fix me one piece at a time, but

83
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.280
Sandee A: It's hard, you know,

84
00:07:52.230 --> 00:08:04.620
Richelle Direny: Hey, okay yeah i mean i listen, I get it in our time yes is definitely important. But I think your health overall is is much more of a concern, um,

85
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.640
Richelle Direny: You know, and if you're i mean i know

86
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.960
Richelle Direny: Maybe two years ago. I remember when my grandmother fell

87
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:21.630
Richelle Direny: She is selling the bathroom and she was having she was in a whole lot of pain, no matter what you did. You picked her up, you try to

88
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.490
Richelle Direny: She was a pain.

89
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.830
Richelle Direny: Got around the bed, no matter what we did. She was in excruciating pain.

90
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.690
Sandee A: At done that I fell in the bathroom do and that is not pretty scenery.

91
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.920
Sandee A: And I got

92
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.440
Sandee A: stuck between a toilet in the bathtub.

93
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:46.020
Richelle Direny: That's how she does how she fell, and she had gotten stuff. And when she had fell because she's you know I want to say she's

94
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.610
Sandee A: I fractured

95
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:58.590
Richelle Direny: her and she went she felt it. And when they finally call the doctor or they they had to take her to we were on family vacation. Actually, and she

96
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:09.660
Richelle Direny: When she went to the finally went to the doctor. They had said she um she broke her hip. She had broke it really bad. She had like pretty much cracked it in half.

97
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:20.760
Richelle Direny: That's why she was in so much pain and her her threshold for pain was so high was like it was really bad, but the fact that you know we achieved stayed

98
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.210
Richelle Direny: Should went through this like a whole 20 because we were at a hotel. And so, but you know

99
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.880
Richelle Direny: It ended up that you know she eventually. So that's why I said, I understand.

100
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.740
Richelle Direny: The importance, you know, your health is

101
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.810
Richelle Direny: Way more important than anything else. Your health is more important. So, you know, and I heard not wanting to go to the hospital or not wanting to be there, but

102
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.570
Richelle Direny: You know, it's

103
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.810
Sandee A: It's it's necessary. I'm gonna go leave me, but I know I can't go in my underwear.

104
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:07.380
Richelle Direny: Well him. I'm sure they will help you. And besides, remember they take you, they're going to put you in a gown. Anyway, they're gonna take it all back off and put you in again.

105
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:20.550
Sandee A: You know, up here, honestly, up here. It depends on what you were to the hospital. If you don't have any metal on your pants or on your bras or anything. They don't make any change anymore.

106
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.630
Sandee A: Not unless it's heart related or, you know,

107
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.620
Sandee A: Then, then it could take your top off but they usually don't

108
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:38.670
Richelle Direny: Oh wow, and then you're in there also opening. Well, you're in, you're in what Ohio. Right.

109
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.370

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.340
Richelle Direny: Which is next Friday.

113
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.840

114
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.850
Richelle Direny: I'm stuck in nicely. Yes, it's this Friday.

115
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:54.720
Yeah.

116
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.520
Richelle Direny: Yes.

117
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:08.070
Sandee A: Listen, there was something else I want to talk to you about and I can't do it in group. Um, and this is one on one. Um, I have a concern.

118
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:24.720
Sandee A: And it's a acquaintance of mine who actually recommended me to bright heart and she's a lot younger than me. But she's an alcoholic and she drinks every day.

119
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:32.400
Sandee A: She also takes Suboxone. And that scares me. She tried for

120
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:39.540
Sandee A: well over a year locally to get Suboxone because she has had

121
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.420
Sandee A: Her pain comes from

122
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.380
Sandee A: A bad accident. She was in she broke her neck.

123
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:52.050
Sandee A: But that being said she drinks every day all day.

124
00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:03.690
Sandee A: Saturday night there was an explosion, because she also have to wear oxygen and she burned her chest pain in her neck really bad.

125
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.330
Richelle Direny: Guys now.

126
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:13.800
Sandee A: No she didn't know the hospital because she was so intoxicated and she's got Suboxone

127
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:17.610
Richelle Direny: What he was

128
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:24.480
Sandee A: Doing is she's an acquaintance of mine, Rochelle. She actually told me about like art when I

129
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.180
Richelle Direny: Started and she she's in the program.

130
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.470
Yes.

131
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:38.640
Sandee A: And the thing of it is, see, I used to go to the cash doctor, I had to pay $250 a month every month until I found bright heart.

132
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:53.370
Sandee A: And when I would go, they would give me the cup and I did the urine test and they also put this thing on my thumb and it was for alcohol and i don't i'm not during her so I didn't have any worries about it, but with

133
00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:18.960
Sandee A: This with the video. She's able to lie and say she doesn't drink. She fills out the surveys and says she hasn't had anything to drink and before the first part of March before all this pandemic stuff came down, she was supposed to go in to detox from survive or from alcohol.

134
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:25.260
Sandee A: With a local Suboxone doctor who also told her he would do everything he could

135
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.700
Sandee A: To repair her liver, which is also very bad.

136
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:41.760
Sandee A: I would really i mean i don't know what consequences would come to bright are but I mean I just found in you guys. And I think you're amazing.

137
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:54.300
Sandee A: With what you can do, but an instance like that I mean just she had this explosion just Saturday night. I mean, it could have been worse could burn the whole house down.

138
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:56.610
Sandee A: Luckily,

139
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.910
Sandee A: Luckily she just an acquaintance of mine, I, I don't know how the program works or, you know,

140
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.920
Richelle Direny: You said that she she she she recommended Bernhardt and she's a part of Braveheart us, which is

141
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.750
Sandee A: Yeah, that's

142
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.150
Sandee A: What's the person's name is

143
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.710
Sandee A: Sherry young

144
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:25.170
Richelle Direny: Okay, I'll look into the thanks for sharing. And I mean your concerns are very valid. You're right. Because when it's all said and done,

145
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:35.550
Richelle Direny: You know you can't take any medication even Tylenol, you can't consume it with alcohol. It tells you anything that you take always say

146
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:54.870
Sandee A: He is so bad of an alcoholic that she should drink their big tall cans of beer and she gets up through the middle of the night. She says she shakes so bad that she has to during the beers that there are left over stale warm beer.

147
00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:03.090
Sandee A: Just to be right. And I don't think that's it. I mean Suboxone has a narcotic in it.

148
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.910
Sandee A: And she's or

149
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.730
Sandee A: Her fiance told me since she's been on Suboxone she's been following this week, more

150
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:20.280
Sandee A: Obviously lit cigarettes in our hand in her mouth and this I mean she's both be on oxygen. Oxygen dependent

151
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.210
Sandee A: So, I mean, I would. My thing is I don't go to a funeral.

152
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:29.010
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

153
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.770
Sandee A: I can listen. But I also worry i mean

154
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.070
Sandee A: You guys are not going to tell her I called you, are you

155
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:57.960
Richelle Direny: It's well know you you're sharing something or sharing it anonymously. The only thing you can do is just the, you know, the only thing we can do is just monitor and you know if you have legitimate concerns maybe talking to her, and no see what you're doing is just trying to find

156
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:08.280
Sandee A: The best. Well, she told me that when she first came to write our she was honest with said she brings occasionally, which is Hawaii. She drinks every day all day.

157
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.420
Sandee A: And that is what prevented her from ever getting any Suboxone here locally.

158
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:22.260
Sandee A: Now, I mean to talk to her. You can't tell she's integrated

159
00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:30.120
Sandee A: But she doesn't go any longer than two hours without drinking something

160
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.170
Sandee A: That that's every day.

161
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.660
Sandee A: She's already been told her liver is failing.

162
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.810
Sandee A: But her main concern is that next year.

163
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.270
Sandee A: And Suboxone

164
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:09.630
Sandee A: She was in a very bad car accident. A few years ago I get that she's got real pain.

165
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.890
Sandee A: But you can't have her the whole cake and all the icing to

166
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.660
Sandee A: I'm just afraid that she's gonna die. And I'm going to go to a funeral.

167
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.330
Richelle Direny: Okay, um, listen, like I said your

168
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.640
Sandee A: Life thing he didn't tell you

169
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.110
Richelle Direny: I want you to think about it for a moment. What do you think

170
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:31.560
Sandee A: If I didn't think it was writing it wouldn't have came forward but

171
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:44.100
Richelle Direny: In sharing, if you have someone that is, you know, if you feel is at risk. The mere fact is if there was an explosion, where there was

172
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:44.760
Sandee A: A fire.

173
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.570
Sandee A: And she said it was like fireball from the

174
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.070
Richelle Direny: What was anyone there. Did anyone go to check her on her.

175
00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:02.040
Sandee A: Her fiance was there, nice A's are but I mean it could have been so much for I know them oxygen tanks can explode.

176
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.150
Sandee A: And at 14 kids, they're

177
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.120
Sandee A: Living their fiance.

178
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:16.380
Sandee A: I mean it scared me. That's all I can say. I hope I've done the right thing.

179
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.470
Sandee A: To do, because I've tried talking to her, and

180
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.080
Sandee A: She doesn't listen

181
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.870
Sandee A: And she's so young.

182
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:34.230
Oh,

183
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:16.350
Sandee A: Message coordinator about are the medication coordinator was once I do, I'll be at Thursday's meeting, I will need a refill and

184
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.880
Sandee A: I was hoping that Miss Natalie could

185
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:34.650
Sandee A: Go a little longer than the two weeks, maybe three least to allow me to get situated down and try and find a pharmacy, because I've got all of my

186
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:49.530
Sandee A: My daily medications, the doctor gave me a prescription paper prescription to take with me for a six month supply so that I because I still haven't found the family doctor yet.

187
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.430
Richelle Direny: You. So who is that it was a specialist that you spoke to about your file.

188
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.520
Sandee A: Yeah do orthopedic surgeon

189
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.460
Richelle Direny: For your other medical

190
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.760
Richelle Direny: For your other other medical issues. You don't want to a primary you go to all special. I

191
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.650
Sandee A: Have it. Yeah, I have a primary

192
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:34.380
Sandee A: And my primary went ahead and prescribed gave me paper prescriptions to hand carry for the medications, I take daily like my thyroid medication and my sinus medication. So I'll at least have that because I don't have a PCP lined up yet.

193
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.960
Richelle Direny: You're talking about all of these doctors and specialists lined up for when you move to where you're moving to

194
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.970
Richelle Direny: Yes. Okay.

195
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.170
Sandee A: Okay Iver

196
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:55.560
Sandee A: Rochelle. I've already consulted with and have established myself with a orthopedic there in Troy and that's who wants me to go get checked.

197
00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.300
Sandee A: I don't have a primary care doctor there yet.

198
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:07.680
Richelle Direny: I mean, I think the best way you can do that, I believe, is if you were supposed to call um

199
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:25.770
Richelle Direny: I think if you call your insurance company or sometimes like even a premier I know like when I moved from one counts. When to next. What I do is either I'll ask for a recommendation from the doctor that I'm leaving. And to go to the new

200
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:31.290
Sandee A: Location yeah I did ask Dr. G. And he he doesn't know anyone that far away so

201
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.350
Sandee A: I'm kind of hoping like didn't go with my daughter's

202
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:42.570
Richelle Direny: Doctor, but that's what, that's another option and even sometimes like even if you go to your daughter's doctor and they can recommend someone

203
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.730
Sandee A: Because I have a lot of health issues so that that I'm

204
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.040
Richelle Direny: Patients ration

205
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.680
Richelle Direny: Recommendations are always really good

206
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.910
Richelle Direny: Then yeah

207
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:03.750
Sandee A: All right, miss. Um, I'm gonna go ahead and get off here and try to get my hands on and call the squad.

208
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.630
Richelle Direny: Well hold on one second. Let me check that. That's why I said, how long does it take for them to

209
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.680
Richelle Direny: How long does it take for them to arm to come once you you press the button.

210
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.110
Sandee A: Three to five minutes.

211
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.190
Richelle Direny: Oh, it's not that sure. I mean, it's not that long.

212
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.650
Sandee A: No, there'll be here very quickly.

213
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.610
Richelle Direny: Okay, what's your last name is Sandra.

214
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.320
Sandee A: My last name.

215
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.270
Sandee A: As well.

216
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.750
Richelle Direny: As though. Okay. Let me double check. Since you're here.

217
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:48.930
Richelle Direny: Now this is the thing you have group on Thursday, depending. I mean it depending on the direction

218
00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.870
Richelle Direny: That the

219
00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.150
Richelle Direny: It really just depends on the direction that the doctor.

220
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.570
Richelle Direny: Decide to go when you go into the

221
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:14.940
Richelle Direny: When you go into the doctor that determines whether or not they'll release you because like if you have a fracture in your hip or airline fracture or something. They're probably going to want to monitor you were, you know, recommend something for you before you read this shirt that

222
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:27.840
Sandee A: Says edition. That's going to do my surgery is in Troy and I can't have the surgery there unless I get moved or unless it's a medical emergency.

223
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.340
Sandee A: But

224
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:42.840
Sandee A: Your daughter, you know, Danielle gave me her direct number. And she said, no matter what to go ahead and update her after I get seen at the hospital to let her know where I'm at.

225
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.810
Sandee A: Medically and I will do that. I promise.

226
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:53.040
Richelle Direny: Because then they also have to check in to see where you

227
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.250
Richelle Direny: For your medication for your medication to get picked up, remember we're talking about that in group.

228
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.200
Sandee A: For my medication to get picked up. I don't know.

229
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.290
Richelle Direny: About when you get the Suboxone like where do you pick it up now.

230
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:19.890
Sandee A: I just, I have a local pharmacy, it's, it's not. I mean, there's only two of them. There's one in Mansfield morn and bellville and it's called the town pharmacy and so

231
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.030
Richelle Direny: Corporation

232
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:28.290
Richelle Direny: So we're, we're in where you're moving to ensure you would have to find out where there's

233
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.990
Sandee A: I have to find a pharmacy, um,

234
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:38.250
Sandee A: Natalie had mentioned CDs. You said they were ok but Danielle told me that they were really

235
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:58.320
Sandee A: They really have trouble dealing with them. She said, a Kroger would be preferred. I've never had any prescriptions at a Kroger company. So it's all going to remain to be seen. Once I get there. So, and, you know, just be a little easier for me if I didn't have so much on my plate.

236
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:05.700
Richelle Direny: I agree. All right, I wholeheartedly agree, but your daughter, your given that you're going to be living with your daughter, she will be helping you with

237
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.720
Sandee A: Yes, yeah.

238
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:07.650
Sandee A: That's true.

239
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.410
Sandee A: But see what I'm saying if I, if I can.

240
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:17.550
Sandee A: Spread it out a little further. All of the concerns that I have, then I won't be so overwhelmed.

241
00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.150
Sandee A: And that, you know, a month would give me a little bit more time.

242
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:38.940
Sandee A: Yeah, I understand that it also encourages people to come to group, but with me missing that one appointment, because I had that kidney infection. I mean, I set the alarm in my phone now. So even if I do fall asleep. I will hear the alarm.

243
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.970
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. I mean, I think everything will work out hopefully

244
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.740
Richelle Direny: It's not anything major you're able to fulfill your

245
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:56.190
Richelle Direny: Know, to get your procedure done and hopefully I'm

246
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:10.320
Richelle Direny: Just the move, it doesn't get pushed back again. And that's another thing, because there's only limited things that you can do, even with your move having them come and picking up your stuff and being transported from here, from where you are.

247
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:19.680
Sandee A: Well, worst case scenario, if I did break or fracture my hip and I do have to keep me in the hospital. It's already been

248
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:34.950
Sandee A: They will transport me down to Miami county to where the orthopedic is for the surgery. My daughter in turn will have to come up here and get my stuff out of the apartment while I'm in the hospital alone.

249
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:52.170
Sandee A: And as if you look I'm surrounded by boxes I i've been packing for weeks. So this is the cluster mess that I live in all the boxes where there's tacked up to the ceiling so

250
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.840
Sandee A: Everything is ready to go.

251
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.070
Richelle Direny: Yeah, sounds like you have everything ready to go and

252
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.940
Sandee A: I'm trying. I have a little bit of OCD, too. So

253
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.450
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Well, yeah.

254
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:13.020
Sandee A: But I will check in on Thursday, why even if I'm in the hospital. I probably will have my cell phone with me.

255
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.410
So,

256
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.470
Sandee A: I see one Thursday them. Okay.

257
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:24.960
Richelle Direny: All right, Sandy just makes just let let us know even sending it to update a message just updating, let me know that everything is fine. Okay.

258
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:31.590
Sandee A: I don't have a direct email for you I you sent me one to confirm an appointment, a while back.

259
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.670
Richelle Direny: Remember to send me text me that so that message to that number that I sent you the message to confirm our appointment.

260
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:44.070
Sandee A: It's my cell phone number. It's the one on record. Yeah.

261
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.510
Richelle Direny: I know. And so when I had sent you the text, you still have that number, right.

262
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.850
Sandee A: No, I don't have your number anymore. Right. I think I archive did or

263
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.290
Richelle Direny: Message.

264
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.540
Richelle Direny: I send you a message will have it. Okay.

265
00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:58.890
Sandee A: All right, miss.

266
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.410
Richelle Direny: You. All right. Thank you. Thank you.

267
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.670
Richelle Direny: You're welcome. Bye bye.
