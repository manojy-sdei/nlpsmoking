00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Justin, Ellen Williams to 10 Mountain Standard

2
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi. All right.

3
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you tell me

4
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.370
Jay: I'm still throwing up. I just wrote about 45 minutes. Cool. Well, I just ate so

5
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.860
Jay: Hopefully, keep it down.

6
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you're going to need a dentist. After all this to all this vomiting.

7
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.450
Jay: To mosquito.

8
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.770
Serious

9
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, man. All right, let me get in here right up a note.

10
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you, what's the what you got going on this week we able to do any work or what I mean, you're so miserable. How do you get anything done.

11
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.720
Jay: For the most part, I've been kind of been written. The other day I got up, I got up long enough to help my mom to a trainer.

12
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:20.850
Jay: Put some graphics on a trailer and then she had to go to love books. So we had like 15 railroad ties on the ritual. I did all those and then I mow the yard today.

13
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
Jay: But for the most part. Other than that, I'm sleeping. Okay.

14
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like it's it's definitely not mending it's not getting better. Doesn't seem like it's getting any better. So what happened after we had that group, we were doing some brainstorming with with the doc. Did you make a call to your specialist to see if you could know Jim, I

15
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.260
Jay: Did

16
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.380
Jay: They said, I'm, I'm on the call list but

17
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.750
Jay: I'm will call again on Monday.

18
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: To have everything you need for today like someplace. If you didn't need to throw up a little bit of ice. Do you want to get those things.

19
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.330
Jay: Oh, I got, I got some whitewater right here.

20
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.340
Jay: Oh, I'm sitting in the recliner just kind of taken back because

21
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.620
Jay: Mr me a little bit.

22
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your mom thinking all this business.

23
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:25.620
Jay: I don't know, she's tried everything. Try it all kind of the medications and we just can't figure it out. Well, the doctor say it's my liberal, but we're just not understanding one throwing up so much

24
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're on.

25
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Suboxone or sub you ticks.

26
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.540
The boxes.

27
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there is. Um, have you ever had subjects.

28
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.410
Though

29
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.620
Jay: Can I try it.

30
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so

31
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a difference and

32
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you can talk to Dr. Element about it. I don't know if it's because this vomiting. Did it start when you started the Suboxone

33
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.540
Jay: It was around the same time, I can't pinpoint my mom. My mom thinks it's

34
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.100
Jay: I don't

35
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, notice what my question was right. I'm wondering if it is because if it is this simple and it needs you can get your life back. Unlike

36
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go look at it together. We're going to go online, there is a significant difference between the two. Let's go look at it together. Okay.

37
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because I don't want to miss speak. This is outside my lane. This way I can just say, I'm just regurgitating what is right online. Okay. So some of you, Tex.

38
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The

39
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Love.

40
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the difference. Okay, here we go. My look out of here. Let's just see.

41
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want. So your mom has his thinking that it might have something to do with

42
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: With about the onset. It happened about the same time.

43
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so Suboxone and somebody tech, both of which were approved by the FDA in 2002 our drugs developed for the treatment of opiate dependence. They say addiction. I don't like that word right there.

44
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Prior to 2000 when Drug Addiction Treatment Act was passed the primary medication to treat opiate addiction was method. We know that. Let's just go down here to the difference. I'm

45
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. So both Suboxone sorry both sub you checks and Suboxone contain this is the active piece right here.

46
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's when you hear me say, notice that I don't say when you lost take

47
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: A sub I'll say, when was the last time you had buprenorphine. So a lot of times I'll say it very specifically, and I do that for a reason. It's because there are these, these two

48
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Substances so while both drugs were developed at around the same time so so via text was formulated first while it was found to be relatively effective in the treatment of opiate addiction, there was still a tendency to abuse the drug.

49
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on. Yeah, exactly. That's why you guys are on some Suboxone because it has this Naltrexone in it the locks on rather

50
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get to that in a second. Many users sought to inject the drug intravenously, in order to obtain the high they had become accustomed to with heroin.

51
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Because y'all. You know what you do you abuse anything, get your hands on. Right.

52
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what you right that's kind of what an addict kind of mentality as well, if I can.

53
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Start it

54
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't I inject it. Well, if I can crush it. Why don't I inhale it. You know, it just goes, it just ops enough's enough to sort of cross the blood

55
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Brain Barrier as quickly as you can. So

56
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what they're talking about. They're talking about that y'all aren't going to use moderation, you're not going to do it as prescribed. Okay.

57
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So many users sought to inject the drug intravenously, in order to obtain the high they had become accustomed to with heroin and prescription painkillers, they often succeeded in doing so, giving rise to the need to develop another drug to address this issue Suboxone

58
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Suboxone contains both buprenorphine and naloxone whereas some new text contains only buprenorphine.

59
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: naloxone is an opioid antagonists. So here's what

60
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me give you a short, short version here of that.

61
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: These are are obviously have more than 10 opiate receptors, but just for now, you have these guys right here. Okay.

62
00:06:49.440 --> 00:07:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why buprenorphine is called a partial agonist means that the that stuff. You just saw the Naltrexone sits on these receptors and holds it holds the space right there and

63
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: See if I can do it. This is card.

64
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to get an opiate effect.

65
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's sitting on

66
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The receptors. Later on when you're completely done with us.

67
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to taper off. You're on a tape or you're not even on a taper. At this point, but a lot of people are someday maybe you'll say I'm completely done with this nonsense. I want to be on this crap anymore. And then you might just be on the lock. Some

68
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: it'll sit on those receptors, it will inhibit it will mitigate craving.

69
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what's cool about it. So a couple things happen. Um,

70
00:07:49.500 --> 00:08:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't really override the the Suboxone the way you can problem. That's why I'm hesitant to be talking about Sunday attacks, and I certainly didn't mention it months ago why because it has a risk of over use

71
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Same way heroin does or painkillers. So it's scary scares me. I get scared that people will

72
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: abuse it.

73
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so I get scared. Now, I'm not a doctor, I can't make that decision. But if I just look from just the the the mental health part of it. I just look at your behavior.

74
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You come in here. You sound like you're ready to learn new things.

75
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And your doctors aren't really, you know, readily available and you may want to consider talking with him to rule it out, but it does put you in danger.

76
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.700
Jay: Right.

77
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it is a substance abuse.

78
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't have been a lock so let's keep reading. Okay, so you can feel educated around this.

79
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So so naloxone is a complete agonist. Notice how I said Suboxone is a partial agonist. It blocks. Some of the opiate receptors.

80
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but a nap and relax naloxone is an opiate antagonist, which means it blocks the effects of opioids at the receptor sites number my fingers. It was blocking three of them in the Suboxone you're taking this guy blocks this guy blocks all of it.

81
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So you really would not benefit from, you know, side tracking and doing some heroin. You wouldn't benefit from it. If you were on this. You can't benefit much, you can't override

82
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A partial agonist, which is what Suboxone is, you know, it's one of the reasons. One of the things that scares me about the substances. Y'all are on is if you really are hell bent on my concern is overdose.

83
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you're seeking euphoria, you're trying to over ride this stuff that's in it, you could

84
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You could die. And so I get scared I do get scared. And so I really want to hear each day. I'm like, well, how much you doing, what are you doing I'm paying attention to.

85
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What I know about you're sweating. I want to know if you're talking differently if you're drawing I want to understand what you're doing because it's it's a still, you're still in a high risk zone.

86
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You could over okay so Suboxone. So let me just see the locks on was combined with buprenorphine to deter abuses, the medication.

87
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If someone inject Suboxone, the person will immediately go into precipitated withdrawal. So it's going to knock off. It'll knock off the opiates off these receptors and you'll start going into a straw. It'll knock them off the receptors and you'll feel like crap.

88
00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is better. I don't know. Let's see, in comparing subtext and Suboxone there's little evidence suggesting that either medication is more effective in treating opiate addiction. If both medications are used according to prescription under medical supervision.

89
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: buprenorphine in each will work as it should mitigating opiate withdrawal symptoms and reducing cravings.

90
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The main difference between somebody texts and Suboxone is in regard to their

91
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: abuse potential do the tooth to to the President of the locks on Suboxone maybe less likely to be abused.

92
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: As a result, this may be the best choice for those suffering from severe addictions, or those who have been through treatment before and relapse Suboxone. Some of you text should be used as a part of a greater blah, blah, blah. So, this one doesn't go really into

93
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The side effects of just didn't have it in here. Let's type it in. Instead let's just go right into side effects.

94
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:49.890
Jay: So,

95
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not worried about that one. I'm more worried about the one you're on.

96
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.370
Jay: Okay, yeah.

97
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at the first look what it says nausea and vomiting, the first side effect.

98
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa. Uh huh. So Suboxone treatment. This looks like it's the same site American addiction center.

99
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And not another credibility. This is just happens to be at first thing I saw says boxing treatment.

100
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Can include a number of side effects. The most severe, of which are caused by Suboxone status as a partial opioid agonist. That is, you might actually have an allergic reaction to na locks sewn

101
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be having an allergic reaction to no locks them according to the drug manufacturer common side effects are nausea, headaches, sweating numb.

102
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Mouth, constipation, which we know you have painful tongue don't know what that is. Dizziness fainting problems with concentration

103
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: irregular heartbeat insomnia blurry vision back pain, drowsiness.

104
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because Suboxone is a partial opioid agonist. It can cause respiratory depression. We already know about that. But this was the one. Look at that. And this was random I kid you not. I didn't know that this site would have that as

105
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So it made me think about that as I've been listening to you, suffering, how can I not bring this up.

106
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel

107
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Ya know, and I don't know if that's what it is. But if it turns out that you're just allergic to the naloxone and you can have the benefits of, you know, not going into withdrawal and we kept we like checked. How many pills you had, and we were drug testing you more frequently.

108
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: To make sure you're not taking in any heroin kind of thing. So you don't die, you feel me

109
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:30.870
As

110
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, wouldn't that be cool to have to you know to like have your life back without throwing up all this time. That'd be pretty amazing.

111
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.080
Jay: Yeah, it would

112
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.050
Jay: Do you think it's a simple

113
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I've watched it be that simple.

114
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.850
Jay: So it's crazy.

115
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, wouldn't it be cool.

116
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:51.630
Jay: Yeah.

117
00:13:52.140 --> 00:14:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so my hope it is purse might not be. Maybe it's this liver. Maybe it's this other thing i don't know i'm not a physician, but I've been watching for three years.

118
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I just watch right watch and watch and watch and watch and so some little things I pick up on every once in a while, a pattern I see a little pattern here and there.

119
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I'm just wondering if that's what's happening, you may want to schedule an appointment with Dr. Solomon ASAP.

120
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.290
Jay: How do I do that I have me you can

121
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You can talk and say, Hey, Dr. Oliver and you can come in there right away.

122
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can say, Dr. Solomon, I want to talk to you.

123
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: About this idea and you can bring me up. You can say whatever brought this up but probably be pissed off at me.

124
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And he, you know, you can say, Listen, I've, I've done all these other things. Can we see if it's this

125
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what to say. I don't know, this isn't my wheelhouse. I don't, I don't know what what will happen, but if

126
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.860

Yeah.

203
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So how, how, what's a typical day for you as far as how you approach your day. These have been rough because you haven't been feeling well.

204
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when there was more going on you're going out and you were spending time with your girlfriend. There was more interaction more opportunities to practice or not practice new skills, but

205
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we focus a little bit on what it's like to interact with your mom since she's young. She's your primary person that you're talking to, right, or is it someone else.

206
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.150
Jay: No.

207
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It's mostly mom. Okay, so, and typical conversation with her. Does it typically go well, or just end up you guys piss each other off.

208
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:01.830
Jay: Because good

209
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, fine, just leave that alone then pick up communication skills, another time.

210
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.870
Jay: We bumped my head. Sometimes we get along. For most people,

211
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:17.940
Jay: More than her.

212
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Thoughts it so right. Um, let's talk about that. Let's see.

213
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember we were doing that drama triangle thing like oh my gosh I recognize this. This is what my sister was talking about something like that. Is that right, did you say something like that, once

214
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.330
Jay: Yeah, my sister tried to explain it like that.

215
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How often do you talk to your sister.

216
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:46.770
Jay: Every day.

217
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: She's struggling with any kind of

218
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.520

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How did she gets through without it. When she do, how did she make it through.

221
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.150
Jay: It away from me.

222
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Or here in the Bay Area.

223
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about

224
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Changing people, places and things. Have you noticed that you want to hang out with your home movies and your home. He wants you to do things that will get you high

225
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:35.910
Jay: Know, I got a buddy of mine that I hang with I was impressed with you. He just did a 13 years for murder.

226
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:39.240
Jay: Did he do, he

227
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Can open

228
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:42.600
Jay: Up with

229
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Self defense.

230
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.000
Jay: Even though.

231
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: As he turned his life around. Is there anything to that that prison rehab nonsense.

232
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:15.210
Jay: I hang out with him because he was doing good right now he got off the dope. All it does to smoke weed. That's, that's all I do. So I'll go get him will go to the dispensary will get some weed and we'll smoke a couple joints and we'll do that about twice a day.

233
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

234
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The there is an effect just just I think I've mentioned that one to you before that some people do have when they're smoking a lot of weed. They can have that vomiting. You saw that. Right. You did you roll that out at least cut back to see if that hadn't act.

235
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.060
Jay: Yeah, the other day.

236
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:46.890
Jay: I think it was before my group Monday on Monday, I think it was like Saturday or Sunday Saturday and Sunday. I couldn't smoke at all. I couldn't get out of bed.

237
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:52.290
Jay: I was stuck in bed for two days. I couldn't even get up to get water.

238
00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:59.310
Jay: My mom brought me a couple cups of ice and I would let it melt and I would just sip on it. Go to sleep.

239
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:06.750
Jay: Good thing I had a good air conditioner because it was hot and there was no way I was not sleeping.

240
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.530
Jay: I just had no energy. I was

241
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.260
Jay: I felt like I was dying.

242
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so right that day, you said two days or one day you couldn't smoke.

243
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And the vomiting continued

244
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:27.210
Yeah.

245
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The one that it didn't do was the Suboxone

246
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.580
Jay: No, actually I didn't do notice the box and those two days, either.

247
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.680
Jay: Saturday and Sunday. I couldn't, I couldn't take none.

248
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Can take none.

249
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:50.790
Jay: couldn't take nothing I slept all day. That's all I did. I think I was maybe two hours, not of each me that I was awake.

250
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.600
Jay: I thought I was dying. I really thought I was

251
00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.260
Jay: I came Monday, remember I was telling you guys I was doing that. Yeah.

252
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so used to hearing that you're doing bad day. It's almost like it's now the norm. Like, that's how much you're you're miserable and i and i and i i'm sorry for that. I don't want it to be like that. It's just there's something really wrong and

253
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you're following through. You call the office, you're, you know, you're on on call.

254
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

255
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The other thing I mean you're not going to like this, but if you're doing heroin. Right. And then you do the Suboxone you're going to be throwing up. I'm just, I gotta say, at least I gotta say it.

256
00:27:47.220 --> 00:28:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna put you in full kick. So remember the definition. Like if you do take that because it's got the locks and it's going to wait. It's gonna walk off the, the, the, the opiate and then but so I just have to say it because at least, then I know I've said it.

257
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.830
Jay: I've given like three new ways to really

258
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Just say

259
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:10.380
You

260
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you give me you know you don't present like you are. But, you know, any if I'm a decent clinician, I got at least bring it up.

261
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I mean them who they would who would be the full for all dancing around clients up they're using heroin.

262
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I didn't write it out for them.

263
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

264
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the things that you had wanted to do was attend more groups. I don't know that that happened or did you try some. Now, do you know why.

265
00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.460
Jay: Oh, to the truth week I kind of had some things come up

266
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:52.230
Jay: Uh,

267
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.540
Jay: I got it written down.

268
00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:05.910
Jay: Because we changed our group, and that day I had to go home. My mom on the 21st and my mom do t shirt, T shirts.

269
00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:07.980
Jay: In the, in the

270
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.610
Jay: I'm still trying to get out and do stuff.

271
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:14.520
Jay: Today,

272
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I just thought I'd ask this to see if it was anything

273
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:30.750
Jay: Well, I went to check in on Wednesday. Well, I never made it at 130 was late and I just went through with it. Okay.

274
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.770
Jay: Because I think I had texting you told me at 730 they had another one. And I just forget it. Remember

275
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I don't remember.

276
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what I can't remember everything

277
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's take a little look here, we'll do a little cognitive behavior. While we're waiting to hear from from from the doctor.

278
00:29:55.230 --> 00:30:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why I'm not doing some other things, is you're not feeling well. So I'm kind of just going to keep it kind of

279
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of superficial event. Okay.

280
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do my thing you do your thing.

281
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to show you this little list, which is super handy. It's coming. Totally only from the cognitive behavioral

282
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Framework. These are great.

283
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Or if you starting to go into sort of an emotional spiral you're feeling like

284
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This is overwhelming. These can be really convenient.

285
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So 10 ways to untwist your thinking. Let's say you get yourself into a negative thought this is one way to get yourself out of it. First one.

286
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Write down your negative thought like

287
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: For example, what, what's a negative thought that you've had over the last week.

288
00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything, just put a heavy hitter. What would be a negative one.

289
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.450
Jay: Whenever I was running in the tractor. The

290
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.310
Jay: Oh, we're excavating the land in the backfield horses.

291
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.860
Jay: You know, even enough the dirt and stuff.

292
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:20.520
Jay: Yeah. He kept trying to tell me how to drag the dirt knew it was pissing me off because I know how to run the tractor.

293
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so those. So let me tell you what you just described, you told me a story about how someone kept telling you how to do something Brown. Brown and you told me about the emotional response to that, but what you didn't tell me

294
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't tell me what

295
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Your thoughts were, and you certainly didn't tell me what the underlying belief is so let's go there. So watch

296
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:52.320
Jay: My thought was is I know how to run a tractor.

297
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.300
Jay: And what was the other one, the thought process.

298
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it's the belief. So hold on to this one.

299
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I know how to run a tractor. I know how to run a tractor. I know how to run a tractor and yet what's coming at you is how to run a tractor right how to run a truck. I know how to run a tractor. Here's how you run a tractor. So when that was going on.

300
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something that actually caused the emotion of frustration and anger and it was the core belief about yourself.

301
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And his telling you how to do something when you already know how to do it. There's a belief about the self and this is really hard to get to, for people. So just be patient with it.

302
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's an underlying belief underneath all of that.

303
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I am what

304
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.340
Jay: See that one more time.

305
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.720
Okay.

306
00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's an underlying belief.

307
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That actually was a big contributor to that feeling of anger and frustration.

308
00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And

309
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.740
Jay: It was just, I've been taking orders from Monday.

310
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

311
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We're almost there. Wait.

312
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, wait, wait. I've been that we're almost there. I've been taking orders all day.

313
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And now go to. I already know how to do most of these things are all of them. I've been done taking these orders and he keeps coming at me now get to the I Am.

314
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the belief about the self, while all of this is going on. It's building. It's in contradiction to who you are just hard to get to. I am

315
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.400
Jay: I'm morning control.

316
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I am in control.

317
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

318
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.140
Jay: So here's I finally got off the tractor and told him to do it.

319
00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you found a solution.

320
00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you found a solution. So we're going to take, I am in control. Now, here's my suspicion, there's, there's some whoops, there's something else going on.

321
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see if that if it's this one.

322
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: My suspicion is it's, it might be the belief that might need a little bit of twisting around is

323
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to be seen as in control. I, I clearly am and I have to be seen that way. See me I'm doing it the right way. I have to be in control.

324
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know for sure. I gotta tease this out a little further.

325
00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

326
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What would have happened if you stayed seated and he kept coming at you.

327
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.460
Jay: Want to go more frustrated

328
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Because when you really analyze it. All it is is someone making sound out of their vocal cords. Right.

329
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. All that's really all it is on the surface, but it goes through a filter of meaning. It's a meaning filter.

330
00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's where we find out what what Jay really thinks of himself right there. It's when this dude is coming at you, telling you how to do something ordering you to do it. Notice

331
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And you already know how to do it and some

332
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning do you make out of that.

333
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.410
Jay: I don't know.

334
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's catch a thought. Just then, when I said it the way I said it what what ran through your head.

335
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: He's coming at you with orders you already know how to do it. This guy doesn't see you as

336
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Capable

337
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

338
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.410
Jay: I've been going through this for years. With this motherfucker.

339
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.250
I know

340
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is what we get to play. We get to go to a place you may not have gone to before. And this is this is the world and beliefs and and thoughts and this is my comfort zone. So I got you.

341
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We can analyze his behavior. Some other day, but for now we got you.

342
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just say this.

343
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: He's been doing this for years. Now who is this person anyway.

344
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Since your dad, quizzes,

345
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.400
Jay: my step dad.

346
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Got you.

347
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh man, you got years of this telling giving us you use the word orders he gives you orders.

348
00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Sound. Let me hear it.

349
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.070
Jay: Huh.

350
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: When he tells you to do something. Let me hear how it sounds.

351
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:14.580
Jay: Like he's real conversations. I just didn't when you do something, you gotta do it like this. You can't do it like this, because this and this and this.

352
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:25.860
Jay: I'm like, Damn, I'm 32 years old, I think I have a duck a digital form and I have been leveled out land before I ran his tractor and loaded up

353
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:32.790
Jay: He didn't even know I used his tractor and I cured all this shit up. He didn't even know it.

354
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.470
Jay: I guess the other day was the first time that I drove nothing

355
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oops, I realized you're not even looking at me and probably stuck with this piece paper.

356
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we're going to play with this little, little bit. We won't get all the way through this exercise, but I want to, I want to go in here for just a moment. I got a real glimpse at what it's like to be sitting in stuck next to him.

357
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

358
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:02.670
Jay: Yeah.

359
00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on, I want to, I want to see something

360
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: If I said

361
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine you spent the rest of your life believing that you were

362
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What is incapable

363
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Seen

364
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not seen

365
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's try that, when he's doing this, you gotta do it like this and it's like

366
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. He's not seeing you.

367
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't know you

368
00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Were getting close.

369
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's insulting to you because

370
00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: He's clueless.

371
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: He doesn't really know you these many years it's condescending. He's up here, you're down here, no matter what, how much you've learned and experience. In fact,

372
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You've done some things he hadn't even done. You don't even know. Whatever, I don't know, making it up.

373
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But still he keeps this position of one up. He keeps it there, no matter how how you get he's up there condescending and talking down he speaks to you. He doesn't ask you do you already know how to do it. Um, do you feel you know whatever he just assumes no you don't.

374
00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now when he's condescending to you and he is acting like he knows you, but he doesn't. What do you believe about yourself in that moment.

375
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.510
Jay: I know better. I just get frustrated and don't want to be around you.

376
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not there yet. The, I tell you. These are hard to get to and you have a lot of really great solutions you walked away. You know how to use skill. So what you do real quick. As you don't sit with sitting with a belief very long, so we can't get to it. You go to solution.

377
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.470
Jay: Dealing with him for a long time. I just don't need to get to me no more.

378
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Weight

379
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.220
Jay: Or go do my own thing.

380
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:30.900
Jay: Before I let him get under my skin, you know, to me, right.

381
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: When he used to. Yeah. So let me go there. Then when he used to get under your skin when what he thought

382
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: matter to you.

383
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.600
Jay: What he think matter.

384
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: When he used to talk to you like that when it used to matter when you gave him any what he said any value at all when it used to affect you.

385
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember

386
00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.580
Jay: I listen to him a little iPad.

387
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.080
Jay: But I'm just not. I'm not gonna be around him. Whenever he

388
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:16.440
Jay: Gets in those moods like he's better than everybody like he does no wrong he makes no mistakes. He's just one of those type of people he's annoying be around when he gets in those moods.

389
00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:25.620
Jay: And I mean I could go out there, we could work for 10 hours him not say a word. And I'm great at the moment he opens his mouth and starts

390
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.620
Jay: You know, seeing everything from hindsight, instead of being right there.

391
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.630
Jay: 20

392
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It means something to you though. Jay, do you actually think that everyone on this planet would interpret his behavior. The same way yes or no.

393
00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Everyone 100%

394
00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:48.360
momondo

395
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's one person on this planet. I'm talking about everybody. You think everyone would interpret his behavior exactly the same way.

396
00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:59.250
Jay: As I do

397
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.920
Jay: Uh huh. Yeah, if they if they grew if they're in my position know if they're just meeting him know.

398
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:05.760
Jay: They're just thinking

399
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.960
Jay: They're gonna think he's more because he is he, he knows what he's talking about.

400
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.310
Jay: But you don't get to see her and poke holes in

401
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.050
Jay: Them, you know I'm saying

402
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I, oh, I know what you're saying, I'm still trying to get to this core belief, but I'm seeing

403
00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Some time slipping away.

404
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's in

405
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I think a core belief is and I'll change because these are these are solutions.

406
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: When I think I'll do with you with cognitive, behavioral, so I'll just start with the core belief.

407
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do a worksheet on that with you so you can kind of see what I'm talking about. But I was just about to pull that up. And then I saw Dr. Solomon responded

408
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And he said, that is a great thought, oh, he said, Good, he said, that is a really good thought period will consider for Monday, period. Thank you for that explanation.

409
00:42:54.630 --> 00:43:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've already got the opener. So that means now when you bring it up, he already has kind of expecting it. I betcha, um, I would like the topic to be at the end. Um, I have some clinical reasons that I think it's a good idea. I kind of want to keep an eye on my other clients to

410
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a big change. This would be a big change. So let's do it right at the end or right before, like if you could get in there like five minutes before the session starts. If you can feel it and hopefully I usually get their medium minute after

411
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I might end

412
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, yeah.

413
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's smart. Okay, so that's a good sign. Right. He didn't. He didn't get defensive or anything funky. So that's a good thing. And maybe he'll have this whole weekend to think about it.

414
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

415
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I just see something

416
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just assumed you'd already done some of this, these things before, but I'm

417
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking, no.

418
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:00.570
Jay: Choice.

419
00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The oh here we go let's do this show this one instead.

420
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: These untwist you're thinking, so I'm just going to back up a little bit.

421
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To this, let me show you what I was doing. So you can kind of you'll get a sense what we've been doing today where she tried to get me to understand this is what I was up to.

422
00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So our core beliefs, everyone looks at the world differently, two people can have the same experience yet have very different interpretations of what happened.

423
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I could experience your step dad is very doting and helpful constantly reminding me of how to do something. Thank goodness, because I have a terrible memory. I'm so grateful. I could

424
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I would probably be like you and I probably get pissed off, and I would feel insulted, but I could

425
00:44:55.470 --> 00:45:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: core beliefs are the deeply held beliefs that influence how we interpret our experiences. Think of core beliefs.

426
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a pair of sunglasses, everyone has a different shade that causes them to see things differently. You've grown up with this man right so you have been shaped and conditioned a particular way.

427
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So they give you an example here. So let's go through this one you meet a new person and think about asking them to go out to coffee if your core belief up here is the green

428
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: core belief. I'm not worthy.

429
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Your next thought would be, why would they ever go out with me.

430
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, of course, your behavior is going to be to not ask. You're going to go. You'll chicken out right

431
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at a different core belief. Let's look at the purple.

432
00:45:50.280 --> 00:46:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You meet a new person and think about asking them to go out for coffee and you think you probably these these core beliefs. By the way, are kind of like the operating system of a computer, you're not actually con, you're not actually conscious of them.

433
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They're running the whole time. So anyway, you don't think about the operating system. You might think about an app, you might click on it, but you're not thinking about the operating system of a computer, right.

434
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what our core beliefs are they're running everything but we're not paying any attention.

435
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So in the person that has this core belief of I'm not worthy. Basically, ultimately, I am not okay. I'm not good enough.

436
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but if I'm sorry the this purple one is I am worthy. So they have a positive sense of self and they think a we might have fun if we go out together. And then the behavior is going to probably be the last.

437
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The last is personality coffee. Okay, so let's push down a little bit here. Can we scoot down. Where's my scooter. Nice. Good.

438
00:46:55.830 --> 00:47:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Nose coach. Okay, well just stare at this thing and many we're now we're down in here. Many people have negative core beliefs that cause harmful consequences to begin challenging your negative core beliefs, you first need to identify what they are.

439
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Here are some common examples.

440
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm unlovable.

441
00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good enough. I'm a bad person. I'm stupid. I'm ugly. I'm abnormal I'm boring. I'm worthless. I'm undeserving

442
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Which ones out of all of these, for example, is like, ooh.

443
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Now one. I don't. It's that was that could be me. I don't like it. But what if it is like which one stood out to you.

444
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.450
Jay: I'm a bad person.

445
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

446
00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know which one stood out to me that I was thinking, you might be thinking, Is this I'm deserving that stood out. I thought, I wonder if Jay thinks that way deep down

447
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:07.950
Jay: Maybe

448
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you're thinking. You're thinking, I'm a bad person at my core I'm

449
00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I might not be deserving of all of the riches, like the goodness of the wonderful things that this life has to offer. I'm undeserving

450
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if those are running some of your decisions.

451
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, maybe, but we found one. I'm a bad person. So let's just picture. So this is where I was trying to kind of nudge around earlier trying to see if we could find a core belief.

452
00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's, here's what I'm suspecting and we'll kind of end with this because we're at the top of the hour.

453
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: If I, if I have a core belief. I'll take it on. Okay. Over here you know I like to role play. So if I at my core know

454
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a bad person.

455
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And if somebody tries to tell me something.

456
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I already think I'm bad

457
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to interpret what they're saying. As I'm bad, and it's intolerable. I'm already on maximum overload of I'm bad, and I can't take anymore. I can't hear it. And so I have to leave.

458
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Or get stoned.

459
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

460
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's not, I'm mad that just happens to be one of the things that was printed on this form. Do you know what your core belief about yourself is do you think it is. I'm down anything, it might be something else.

461
00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.390
Jay: Does pretty good things.

462
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, good people have done bad things your friend did a bad thing.

463
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he a bad person.

464
00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well he killed somebody

465
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So, go back, go back to you.

466
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you believe about yourself. I'm a bad person.

467
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.400
Jay: Yeah, I mean, I've done some good things.

468
00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So, who's your friend. Are you a bad or person than your friend.

469
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:27.090
No, no.

470
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.420
Jay: I'm finally trying to get my life together instead of

471
00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:34.830
Jay: Trying to think highly of myself. It's

472
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.720
Jay: Not easy

473
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So if it's true that you see yourself as a bad person and its underlying decisions along the way, you're probably going to be really intolerant. If you perceive. Remember that filter. It's like

474
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean that's what someone said, but if the filter is this operating system. It filters everything from the outside world.

475
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the lens that you view everything through right everything

476
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: If everything on the outside is a potential you're bad you're going to be defensive to it and it's going to be perceived as a threat to the self and you're going to want to leave. Get out of the tractor and go get stoned.

477
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It will need to be addressed. And I'm glad this came up because I never would have thought that this was something you had inside. I never would have guessed that if we hadn't done this activity.

478
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I never would have thought that because you don't look like that you kind of like you're open to this idea, you're like, Okay, I'll go to this. And hey, guys. And how about this and you present open in here right

479
00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how come you don't get defensive when I start talking about something you already know how to do though.

480
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:02.700
Jay: Really

481
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:03.840
Really

482
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I bet I will.

483
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wonder if all see defensiveness, and you I wonderful see anger, because it's bound to happen.

484
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, you know, you know, stuff and I don't know what you know, and so I might start saying something to be like

485
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:25.350
You know,

486
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.720
Jay: It's not like that.

487
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.210
Jay: That bad

488
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this is how I wonder, so maybe let me check in on the I'm a bad person. How true is that from one to seven seven being absolutely true. How true is it bad.

489
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:45.300
Jay: Money more I'm doing good. No.

490
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.630
Jay: I'm striving to be a good person.

491
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So in between. I'm bad, and I'm almost a good person. What are you then.

492
00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:58.200
Jay: I don't know. I don't know. I'm trying to rectify all the bad things that I do.

493
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:07.260
Jay: And that's all I'm trying to do to be a better person than I was when I was getting high. Yeah, stealing, shoot.

494
00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: At the core typically is I'm not enough.

495
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's typically when I do all this investigation and we move around we poke around. And we investigate investigate look all around, most people get to, I'm not good enough.

496
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one that gets them. And so then when a step dad says something, it hits that buzzer. And we're like,

497
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I already think I'm not good enough. And now I gotta hide you can't see I already know how to do this. It usually hits that button.

498
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of play with sit with that a little bit this week this weekend. If you are awake and want to do it. Just think about

499
00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What sponsoring I think about it like a sponsoring belief might be filtering how you're interpreting the world when someone's talking to you. Hey, my mom's talking at me, she's like, did you remember to do that.

500
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, how do I interpret her reminder through a filter of what

501
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good enough. I'm born level and fantastic person. I wonder if I was my filter. How would I interpret her reminding me

502
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Or my dad step dad says something I already know how to do and some wonder how I would filter that differently if it had a different filter. If I was interpreting the world differently. Something to think about.

503
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just saying.

504
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well we got

505
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: No seconds left.

506
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice it's important for you here today. What do you notice about you.

507
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.110
Jay: I don't like working for my step then

508
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.350
Jay: Look good, other than being sick. I had a good week. Okay.

509
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, so let's schedule another appointment. And then, of course, we'll have this discussion on Monday. And I sure hope it's just that simple. Well,

510
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't that be great.

511
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, didn't he increase the dose. Was he you that he did that with

512
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.030
Jay: No.

513
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it wasn't you, somebody else. I remember I was surprised. Okay, so you do pretty I am completely booked.

514
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless we put something in here that I can't see.

515
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Grief

516
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you be amenable to being on my own call this just in case I get a cancellation.

517
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, after what time are you open to getting a text what after what time

518
00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:08.550
Jay: Well, let's do around this time room three my time.

519
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but what about all day.

Jay: you text me on be okay.

521
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm getting out, meaning if I get a cancellation. Are you typically sleeping tell a particular time.

522
00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:24.660
Typically

523
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.400
Jay: I'll make sure I'm up by nine o'clock every day.

524
00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll just say I put you right now. I've only got two people on my own call list, but I've got after nine I just put after nine, so I won't call you my my six and 7am no show

525
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I am ok

526
00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. And I'll keep my eye out for other people, if they cancel. I'll reach out to you and get you in there.

527
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:51.540
Okay.

528
00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's keep our fingers crossed that it's just that simple. Maybe somebody

Gwenevere Abriel: Will be man. That'd be nice. All right. I'll talk to you.

530
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Bye.
