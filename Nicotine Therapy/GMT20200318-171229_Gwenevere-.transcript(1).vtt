10
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's take a little extra time. I know you just sort of coming on board here.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can find a place on the counter maybe put a little something so you can rest this this phone on the counter. So you can just take your time, no rush.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.330
Ashley Bitakis: They can be

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Tried

14
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: To create a little

15
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Shelf. So it doesn't slide around but smart.

16
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.720
How are you in this

17
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.790
Ashley Bitakis: To be the reason I moved to motel. So there's been a lot of buzz about the coronavirus so

18
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.480
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, so we had a lot of extra

19
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.220
Ashley Bitakis: I guess.

20
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:16.200
Ashley Bitakis: Traffic when it comes to maintenance coming in earlier in earlier so haha yeah sorry sorry about missing. Missing Roberts call, but I have you rested, I think, does that work.

21
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. Okay. Okay, so

22
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.120
Uh huh.

23
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The name that you're using, when you check in, you're admitted under Wiley.

24
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.200
Ashley Bitakis: Great legal name. I haven't changed my

25
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.750
Ashley Bitakis: legal name to marry name yet.

26
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you check in mentioned that because it might confuse them. And as you can tell when you're when it's really busy.

27
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to use a name that it's going to be easy for them to find your record and check you in until you eventually you're going to probably change. Change it. That's fine.

28
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's just a little confusing for them. Oh.

29
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.590
Sorry.

30
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, and mentioned that name say it's this or you could hyphenated when you say it no Wiley that I'm just make it easy for them so that your check in process can be easier.

31
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.380
Ashley Bitakis: Okay.

32
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm pretty sure medications attached to today, so I

33
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Am a little distracted. Just because I'm writing in a note here and

34
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.130
Ashley Bitakis: Therapy and we're meeting.

35
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.700
Okay.

36
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me hear a little bit

37
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: About some context of life is your

38
00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Being able to stay at this hotel in jeopardy. Is there any threat of having to leave and within the next day or two. I just want to check in on how much chaos is right nearby.

39
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:18.720
Ashley Bitakis: Know we really stable in our living environment, even though we're both employed at this moment still James's in your family who's very supportive of her situation and

40
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.860
Ashley Bitakis: Financially can help us out. So

41
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is what you just said, We're both really stable.

42
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be a slight exaggeration.

43
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you

44
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.790
Ashley Bitakis: Are living environment and

45
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I know hotel and you're homeless. So let's, let's just slow down. You don't have to say anything to fluff it up with me. Okay. It's been a while since you know you and I have connected but

46
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just say what it is.

47
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: His parents are paying for what, how are they, what did they funding. What are they okay with

48
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.450
Ashley Bitakis: Their parents just mom dad passed away, but okay.

49
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.620
Ashley Bitakis: Okay with paying for motel.

50
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:22.170
Ashley Bitakis: And that's pretty much it. She doesn't. I mean, are we had a storage unit with all of our belongings that we couldn't afford to to pay. We kept it with as long as we could and they were going to auction off all of our stuff and she

51
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:36.300
Ashley Bitakis: Had found out about this through his other brother, and she paid that just on a whim can ask because she's doing so much for the room, so much for the room or on a weekly so

52
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:46.350
Ashley Bitakis: She, she did pay for that, but I'm primarily she made a deal with us that she has no problem with paying for a room.

53
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:55.470
Ashley Bitakis: The remaining very incredible. I said no other handouts would be given me. So it's very kind of her to have saved her stuff.

54
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And so how are you guys eating.

55
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:10.410
Ashley Bitakis: I do get food stamps. Oh, yeah. And then I got approved for my Tanis as well as cash assistance per month for child support.

56
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:24.150
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, so that at least you at least have but they they become that we get it when I when that comes in. We've only been getting it for one month. So just finally started to come in.

57
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:39.000
Ashley Bitakis: But when it does come in we paid for two weeks of our room on our own to give his mom kind of a break. Yeah, and that's why she is supportive because she knows that we're trying and then we're trying our best interest thing we can and

58
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.070
Ashley Bitakis: So,

59
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: All right there. And when we last spoke, you were able to sort of on that there's been some self medicating behavior when we last met in group. Have you been able to just take what's prescribed. Are you still taking more

60
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:10.260
Ashley Bitakis: Sensitive to. So, you know, I, admittedly, I took it took three know to to scientists were uncomfortable.

61
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.010
Ashley Bitakis: Into is what I've been taking okay

62
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do it again. You doing fine. Hang in there. I know it's weird, you know, when people are using they're used to miss truth telling so it feels weird to actually, you don't actually have to not tell the truth. You can just lay it out in here. Okay.

63
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In group you're able to own, you know what I was taking three

64
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were going to run out. I did run out. I don't know what you did. And there's some pieces that I still want to understand about how you fill in the gaps there. But let's just look when the last time I saw you was that on last Thursday in group that sound right.

65
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.470
Ashley Bitakis: That sounds great. Okay.

66
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've had quite a few days in between.

67
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you run out of medicine because you've been taking more than the two strips a day.

68
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:16.560
Ashley Bitakis: Well, yeah, he didn't eventually run out and just talking was left a day I was left to day without so it was a day short

69
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: When. Just tell me when you ran out of medicine.

70
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.570
Ashley Bitakis: That would have been what

71
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.460
Ashley Bitakis: Was it

72
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Today's Wednesday.

73
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:46.500
Ashley Bitakis: I think it was Saturday. And then one day she don't remember. And then I had gone to the pharmacy to pick up my medication and they wouldn't give it to me. And because my insurance will cover it until I picked it up on Monday.

74
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:53.370
Ashley Bitakis: Okay. So going into yeah because they had already gotten a certain amount of medicine.

75
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.480
Ashley Bitakis: And that didn't make sense because if I had only at the terrorism.

76
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.520
Ashley Bitakis: But had only taken to who then I wouldn't, I wouldn't have been sure

77
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's the reason. But I just wanted what I'm doing right now is checking, not on addictive behavior, none of that. All I'm doing is trying to see, physiologically, how many days my client.

78
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Has been taking medicine. So I want to just check it. I know you're having a hard time with the days you're doing your best, and I get that. So just hang in there. So here's what I'm hearing so far.

79
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We had maybe. So let's say Thursday.

80
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking, you would have gotten a new order, but they may be wouldn't have let you pick it up. That's what I'm guessing. Is that right,

81
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.850
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, I think, I think it was Thursday when she had placed

82
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I can look

83
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do, I can see in here. Let's go look at it together.

84
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:51.720
Ashley Bitakis: Isn't you whenever she place another order. I don't, I can't remember for with that same day or the next day after to go pick it up.

85
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.940
But

86
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It was on Thursday.

87
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.990
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah okay so

88
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:15.300
Ashley Bitakis: I think I might have. I might have gotten to the scene. Every Friday to the pharmacy. I can't. I honestly can't remember what it was, but I know I came up short. So I wouldn't have, therefore, is I was taking more than prescribed to

89
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's just look at this together because we can do this together because we don't have to. We can just do it. So here we go. What we see is here in the blue.

90
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: At this march 12 is Thursday.

91
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: 14 films should have covered you for eight days.

92
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.530
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, so that prescription. I still

93
00:10:48.210 --> 00:11:07.440
Ashley Bitakis: Haven't I still haven't picked up because they wouldn't they wouldn't have if I if I was on track with my prescription taking them to the to then I would have been fine to pick it up on Monday, and I would have still had kinds of number me until then I see, yeah.

94
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.920
Ashley Bitakis: So prescription, they still haven't picked up because they wouldn't let me on Monday, and then

95
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's what I can't see in here because it says September 2009 September 26 I can't see what preceded this I this is an imperfect is there.

96
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.410
Ashley Bitakis: Any words you are using it open here.

97
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:32.700
So,

98
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.510
Ashley Bitakis: My new prescription. She had ordered

99
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.880
Ashley Bitakis: Have remained at my pharmacy because me they told me my insurance.

100
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.000
Ashley Bitakis: My insurance wouldn't allow me to pick it up any earlier.

101
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.650
Ashley Bitakis: Okay, so

102
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

103
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture that it's Thursday, you've come into group and you've owned I have taken as much as three strips a day.

104
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And Thursday moves forward. And then it's Friday, then it's Saturday. Let's just stick with

105
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The day you realize maybe I guess on Saturday, that she didn't have enough medicine.

106
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do

107
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:35.070
Ashley Bitakis: When they realized I didn't have enough medicine and then commit after going to the pharmacy and I couldn't pick it up until Monday.

108
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: To take on Saturday to get through it.

109
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:45.270
Ashley Bitakis: Um, well, I, I, I'm pretty sure I was out by then. So

110
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:47.820
Ashley Bitakis: Or

111
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.180
Ashley Bitakis: I know Sunday didn't take anything for sure. I know I didn't have anything to take a to take anything

112
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.400
Ashley Bitakis: Saturday.

113
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.300
Ashley Bitakis: I either have I really can't remember either had

114
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.010
Ashley Bitakis: I either had one left or you have any left in either

115
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's move on. Let's go to Monday. Hold on. You're doing great. I know this is hard. I'm trying to see how my my clients doing okay.

116
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm not there, see what you're doing. So now I know for sure we have confidence. There was no medicine. There was no buprenorphine and you did not just say that you scored percocet heroin you filled it in with math.

117
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This would be the time to say that, what did you do on

118
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:46.830
Ashley Bitakis: Sunday. No, I did not take any any, anything to replace that specifically

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: To get through Monday you did some residue math. We did a joint

137
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Package do to get through Monday.

138
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.920
So Monday.

139
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:13.050
Ashley Bitakis: There was like a little promotion going on at the restaurant or James. James works and his family were short

140
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:23.370
Ashley Bitakis: So on Monday we had gone down there CW. Is there like a local TV station, whatever, whatever, and the cooking up giving them like a bag of weed so

141
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.380
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, so from Monday, Tuesday,

142
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.710
Ashley Bitakis: Pretty much kind of covered

143
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.990
Ashley Bitakis: covered them.

144
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.660
Ashley Bitakis: Covered me. You know, I didn't really feel. I didn't really feel

145
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:47.880
Ashley Bitakis: You know, like sick as I would coming, coming off of heroin, because I haven't

146
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:57.000
Ashley Bitakis: I haven't done done here, you know, and done done here went to to get like sinker shaky or anything like that. So,

147
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's not accurate. Ashley. The, the kick off of buprenorphine.

148
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I am told is worse. So I hear what you're saying, but at the same time, I don't know, there's something. There's a piece of information kind of missing, but I'm hearing you.

149
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are telling me I was able to get through with weed, then those are the facts and those are the ones that I'm going to, I'm going to take. Okay, those are facts.

150
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But the notion that there's no withdrawal associated with chemical dependency buprenorphine.

151
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That ain't that ain't grounded in reality.

152
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That is a really uncomfortable withdrawal experience for people

153
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:44.940
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, I really didn't feel as as the movies with drew up with drawing right okay

154
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.320
Ashley Bitakis: So that's, I haven't seen you.

155
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How you got it through. So let's move on.

156
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I have now an understanding of how

157
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You have survived.

158
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: These last few days.

159
00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think it's safe to say that you are not stable. You're not

160
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Not chemically

161
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

162
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: The efficacy of the psychotherapy is greatly diminished by the fact that you're not stable. So don't don't expect too much from what we're doing in here. I don't expect much to stick

163
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to stay right on the surface on just sort of functional domains of life. Okay, just wanted. That's why I'm talking about employment.

164
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm talking about substance use. I'm just checking on hotel who's funding it. We're just sort of starting with basic functioning. Do I have a place to live, how are you eating. You told me and

165
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think there's going to be any issue for you, picking up your medicine. I just can't imagine that it would. Um, are you selling the strips.

166
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.010
Ashley Bitakis: A nurse anyway shirts.

167
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to do you think, remember, I mean, the problem with the fact that you've been using weed is it doesn't sound like you've been in so much distress, aka withdrawal that you're going to remember

168
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I have to snap to I can only take two of the strips. I can't take three or I won't have enough like sometimes is that negative reinforcement, the discomfort that helps people remember. Oh my gosh, I have, I can only take two, I can only take two, I can only take two

169
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope that it helps. I hope you can remember to only take two and not take more

170
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope so. We'll see.

171
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Next piece. So we have a residence covered. We have where the food's coming from

172
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: James family owns a restaurant. Are you saying yes he's unemployed, but that he can pick up shifts in the kitchen or us saying

173
00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:03.810
Ashley Bitakis: He gets its own cash. I mean, it's all cash his brothers and manager. There he have he actually worked in December, sharp when they were all quite younger when his dad was so life is

174
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:11.070
Ashley Bitakis: So brings a lot of his child back in the Brain Stuff. But, um, his brother has been a manager there for years and

175
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.140
Ashley Bitakis: His mom actually printed his brother Stevie's his name and

176
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:24.810
Ashley Bitakis: Asked if James could pick up any, any kind of shifts, just to help with anything you know bussing tables, whatever, and

177
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.720
Ashley Bitakis: It's downtown. So they needed security, more than anything, and

178
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:41.040
Ashley Bitakis: The guy just totally big guy. I kind of thought that'd be perfect, you know, any mean to take a recursion there. And then we really, you know, do you could use it so

179
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:55.560
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, that's that's overall his position. There's security typically it's Thursday, Friday, Saturday. But again, like Monday. They had a functioning is able to pick up a shift Monday, but he's just, he's just paid cash and it's just you know his brother doing when he can help us.

180
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.250
Ashley Bitakis: So technically he's an employed by the books.

181
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

182
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:00.900
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah.

183
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So between you and I, the world will work. It is he's employed and it's part time and we'll just leave it like that, okay, because

184
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I just needing a meeting to hear where money's coming from either where the money for the weed or money for food, or I'm just, I just, I need to understand whether you're, you know, I just need to understand it. So I have a better understanding now so

185
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.370
Ashley Bitakis: In your own. Okay, got it.

186
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

187
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: His continued substance use.

188
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you said that he stopped, but doesn't mean people don't restart. You still have paraphernalia around that means the doors still open that pipe is still around. Wonder why it's still there and not gone out of the motel room.

189
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:58.950
Ashley Bitakis: Or when I mean with the idea that just in case you know it's us together, we need to use it again.

190
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.240
Ashley Bitakis: Okay. Is that because you

191
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to upset him or you want to make sure the doors open for you in case you want to use that again.

192
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:18.840
Ashley Bitakis: You know, it was really easy for me to say no, not my thing. It's really not my thing.

193
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:21.570
Ashley Bitakis: You know,

194
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.870
Ashley Bitakis: So I guess I didn't not

195
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.920
Ashley Bitakis: reinforce the idea of that not being a potential

196
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you haven't said anything. Let's try again. You're so good with words.

197
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I am too.

198
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

199
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to walk out throughout the pipe, what would happen.

200
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.940
Ashley Bitakis: I mean I wouldn't get in any trouble.

201
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to say what wouldn't happen. I also know you know rainbows won't come out of our

202
00:21:58.890 --> 00:21:59.400
Ashley Bitakis: Bugs

203
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know what would happen.

204
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.710
Ashley Bitakis: Pretty if I were, if I were to throw away the pipe.

205
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You do what would happen.

206
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You could predict it pretty well.

207
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.340
Ashley Bitakis: You know, and

208
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.000
Ashley Bitakis: I don't know what he would say,

209
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So James would say something

210
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:25.830
What do

211
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:28.860
Ashley Bitakis: We say

212
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Say thank you

213
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.400
Ashley Bitakis: Maybe today where

214
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:50.070
Ashley Bitakis: He's, he's been clean for what's going on today would be going on the second day. OK, so maybe thank you think

215
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be what what might it also be

216
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.110
Ashley Bitakis: Whom like a 10 minute thing.

217
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is aggression is conveniently channeled when he's running security. If it is a channel. There were might get expressed, if you were to have some aggression or might land.

218
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.210
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, definitely with each other with myself.

219
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: With myself. So could you like that myself thing is, is do you could you say what might happen. So if I threw out that pipe, what might happen.

220
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.990
Ashley Bitakis: He he he might get upset with me or you might just be upset.

221
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:42.870
Ashley Bitakis: Overall, because the idea of having the comfort of it being there and him having to spend money. We don't have one. Another one.

222
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:46.740
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah.

223
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's a little different way of speaking than using the word myself is in present time it's first person, it's a little bit more accurate. So, um, let's continue along that course.

224
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, is it possible that we're really in in sort of a harm reduction phase.

225
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Of your recovery right now that just keeping you from going to heroin is all that we can ask of treatment right now.

226
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.100
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, I heard her reduction.

227
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:26.970
Ashley Bitakis: So then

228
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't accidentally overdose on heroin. That's harm reduction.

229
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.500
Ashley Bitakis: So can you ask your question again.

230
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: How committed are you to staying clean and sober for the rest of your life.

231
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's give it a number 10 is completely committed and zero is

232
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Not at all.

233
00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:59.970
Ashley Bitakis: All right, I would say I'm a solid. I'm a solid, solid

234
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:05.910
Ashley Bitakis: Eight, for the reasons of I

235
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:22.800
Ashley Bitakis: I'm committed I'm committed in the sense of I have lost everything I see, I see my reality, especially not using I'm going to have lost everything because here we makes me so incapable know with my kids that kills me.

236
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.990
Ashley Bitakis: And then I have I have those fears and those doubts that

237
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.880
Ashley Bitakis: burn me in a way it makes me a better person.

238
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.970
Ashley Bitakis: Which doesn't make any sense. But

239
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Heroin makes you a better person.

240
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.330
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, I mean,

241
00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:46.110
Ashley Bitakis: I have these thoughts that it does. It makes me a better person makes me more.

242
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.230
Ashley Bitakis: Easy to be around.

243
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.120
Ashley Bitakis: Um,

244
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.970
Ashley Bitakis: So it takes the way it really does take away from the commitment.

245
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.530
Ashley Bitakis: And

246
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.180
Ashley Bitakis: We

247
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.640
Ashley Bitakis: Let me change.

248
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me change the wording what you're doing right now. You're doing a great job. And now you're starting to get a little bit closer to some truth because you're starting to feel

249
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Why it's actually important what you just did was touch on the commitments going to be whether you navigate things like the pipe, whether you take the medication to strips the way you're prescribed that that's going to be a

250
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Commitment to the universe, it'll show up it'll either show up, or it won't. But what you're talking about right now is in portent just now, you talked about why it's important. You've lost everything.

251
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you digress a little bit with the self identity thing and all that aside for a second. But actually,

252
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be motivated, you might have found a motivation, you have lost

253
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Your kids.

254
00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know what that means.

255
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, you're not wisdom that much. I know, but I don't know what you mean by youth loss.

256
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that mean,

257
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.570
Ashley Bitakis: Well you know me, my grandma don't get along.

258
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.620
Ashley Bitakis: I do. Sure.

259
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

260
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:18.150
Ashley Bitakis: And you know through through this so that hurt me still get on her and I are able to

261
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:29.730
Ashley Bitakis: You know, say, hey, because Anthony wasn't in school for like about a month and a half. And I was working with different resources trying to figure that out. And it's just

262
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:45.780
Ashley Bitakis: Putting myself aside my feelings aside and knowing that what's best for him and Levi certain school would be to have as my grandmas. So just that's the only way her and I can manage each other's just on that note, but

263
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a story I want to understand what

264
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.140
Ashley Bitakis: You mean

265
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you lose custody of your children.

266
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.190
Ashley Bitakis: No, nothing.

267
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

268
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: All you are is away from them.

269
00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, or is away.

270
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.470
Ashley Bitakis: Just it just goes

271
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And that will change. It will change, you're going to get them back.

272
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:11.160
Ashley Bitakis: Back.

273
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going, they're going to be near you.

274
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, something happened in the last episode of care. My now all along the way. I was saying I was keeping everyone informed, I will watch Ashley closely.

275
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: She does not meet outpatient level of care. She seems to meet either residential level or intensive outpatient and I tried to meet with you twice a week because I'm trying to make this work for you. It didn't and you're here again.

276
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you have lost even more.

277
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder how much more you'll have to lose before you realize

278
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do this on my own.

279
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And really get the treatment that you need when you're in the treatment that you really need. There's no way you have a pipe.

280
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The motel. That makes sense.

281
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not

282
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Quite right. Now I know you can't see it. I know you're just on the short term, I don't want to piss off James I just want an easy breezy. And I want to do with that. Now I get that intellectually

283
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's doing your recovery a disservice to not really embrace what recovery can do for you what sobriety can do

284
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think you're really on the fence and it's okay I'll hang out here with you. We'll do the best we can.

285
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think we're in harm reduction mode right now. I don't know that you're going to be able to take in a lot of the work that we do.

286
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're in a very much a survival mode.

287
00:29:52.050 --> 00:30:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm concerned, I think that you would benefit from a higher level of care there. I do have you thought about an any point, hey, I need to get away from these people from James from everyone, and get myself healthy, had he even had at one time we had the thought.

288
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.230
Ashley Bitakis: You're actually

289
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:20.370
Ashley Bitakis: Doing actually talks about that and he had asked me if I would

290
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:25.140
Ashley Bitakis: He was very, very dainty very telling him to

291
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:40.920
Ashley Bitakis: Ask him. He said, you know, if I were to go to like say yes, like at a facility, not necessarily for rehab, but for behavioral health for like two weeks, and it was like, well isn't that reality is your 70s rehab.

292
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.840
Ashley Bitakis: And it wouldn't want to go to Vegas and so him bringing that up was the only

293
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:54.660
Ashley Bitakis: Only kind of ever thought about going to get impatient kind of care facility. And then my mom had actually

294
00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:05.550
Ashley Bitakis: Her husband's really abusive and she had stayed with us, like two or three days or motel room and she was telling me she was going to go to rehab and how AND I WAS THIS IS ONE Eastern crack since I was

295
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Young. I remember

296
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:17.250
Ashley Bitakis: And so for her to tell me she's quitting. And you know what, it doesn't mean a name, but for her to tell me she's going to rehab meant something to me. And of course, you go back to your husband, but I'm

297
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:22.440
Ashley Bitakis: Even me, I didn't, I didn't even think about myself going to rehab or

298
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:32.850
Ashley Bitakis: The only time I ever thought about is when James kind of mentioned that kind of stuck with me like whoa main concern with me and it was a very, very, very, very

299
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think he said not

300
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: For why why the just for mental health and not for chemical dependence. I don't know why. That part was put in there. Why would that be more interesting to you, then you're addicted to to to heroin. Why would he say it like that.

301
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.370
Ashley Bitakis: are resistant to it. I don't

302
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.860
Ashley Bitakis: Know, because it's like I've ever heard of a facility where you just go two weeks.

303
00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.060
Ashley Bitakis: There is a

304
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.710
Ashley Bitakis: Few days.

305
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's like yet. But what ends up happening is there's there's mental health or residential facilities people

306
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, continue to be unsafe.

307
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: To themselves or others. And so, I should say.

308
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.310
Ashley Bitakis: No, no way.

309
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.860
Ashley Bitakis: I don't know, is there specific

310
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what your answer to me was this, I did entertain it I entertained it for a little tiny bit of time when James mentioned it. How long did you entertain it like a second or how long would you say

311
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:51.330
Ashley Bitakis: No, I mean, I would say for me after him, saying that I ended up like taking a shower and kind of just having like time for myself.

312
00:32:52.800 --> 00:33:06.990
Ashley Bitakis: So it's a kind of sat with me for several hours and kind of thought about it like me know being in Albuquerque and being away from state. Again, it's not about that and

313
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:16.290
Ashley Bitakis: Then he thought about well all communication we closed off. If I were to go to rehab and then he thought about. I don't really get a chance to talk to the boys anyway.

314
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.050
Ashley Bitakis: You know, so you're going to get to play with the idea of kindness. That was me.

315
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.630
Ashley Bitakis: Or for a couple hours.

316
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see if you can catch it. What scares you about doing that because something snapped you out and even continuing it for five hours are actually researching it, something contradicted

317
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The idea of going, what was it, Dina

318
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:48.390
Ashley Bitakis: I think I mean going and then coming back to nothing. I mean, they come back to

319
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:53.250
Ashley Bitakis: That even this and and even my current situation. I'm a hotel her

320
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.640
Ashley Bitakis: Husband and my kids.

321
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So your husband would leave you

322
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.900
Ashley Bitakis: I don't, I don't think you'd ever leave me.

323
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Understand why do you say nothing. He would be living somewhere would still be married. Why do you think you come back to nothing.

324
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:18.180
Ashley Bitakis: That's just how I see is how I see it happening if I were just to go for

325
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.410
Ashley Bitakis: You know 30 days even which isn't a long period of time.

326
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.680
Ashley Bitakis: I mean, if it does when you were he would go about you would go this bomb in Vegas. It's only going to know where it was, but

327
00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:34.530
Ashley Bitakis: I felt like it would be. And it was just so blank and darkly the thought of.

328
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.530
Ashley Bitakis: Not having

329
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.410
Ashley Bitakis: anybody or anything to

330
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:43.770
Ashley Bitakis: Come back to your anywhere to go, maybe

331
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you see that you have somebody to come back to

332
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you would come back, different

333
00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.250
Ashley Bitakis: I think it would come back, different. Yeah.

334
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you want to be with James If you were clean and sober.

335
00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.280
Ashley Bitakis: Um, you know, I

336
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:14.070
Ashley Bitakis: I, I, I would want to be the chain is clean and sober.

337
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.480
Ashley Bitakis: I am in a word I a

338
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.320
Ashley Bitakis: CS not necessarily ever been together ISIS.

339
00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.960
Ashley Bitakis: You know, or her dynamics of our marriage have changed so much and even just our friendship has changed so much and

340
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:41.040
Ashley Bitakis: We use it when I've ever really been able to count on innocence. I don't know. I don't know if he would want me clean and

341
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

342
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it right there.

343
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: There may not be anybody there. He may not want me unless I'm using

344
00:35:51.330 --> 00:36:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Maintain this which is tolerant of his degree of abuse and substance use whatever you only, you know, the stories. If you don't tolerate anymore. He may not want you

345
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.390
Ashley Bitakis: Would have this specific dependency, you know, it couldn't

346
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.580
Ashley Bitakis: Yep. And that's, I mean, that would be that would be very scary for him because I've

347
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Scary for

348
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you mean we're talking about you here.

349
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You might have to take a look at the people that you're surrounding yourself with people in a residential facility will probably say what's going on here.

350
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you surrounding yourself with people that want to your growth and development and you have to take a look and it's hard to see when we are afraid of being alone.

351
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When that dominates every decision that we make.

352
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But here's what you don't know. Actually, you don't know how you're going to feel you haven't changed had a chance to be this clean person.

353
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, long, long, long time.

354
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't know what you don't know.

355
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what those 30 days. Those 60 days they give you that chance to rediscover Oh, first it's scary. It's hard. And what is he leaves me. What if he doesn't love me anymore, then you get through that and you're like, well, wait a minute, I made myself. Wait a minute.

356
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, maybe he never really love me. Oh, wait a minute, who care, you know, we don't know what the progression would be, but she never get a chance to do it if you don't give

357
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Sobriety and a chance

358
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:45.090
Ashley Bitakis: If he's a reason or me sober. He's never know. We

359
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.850
Ashley Bitakis: We didn't meet

360
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.290
Ashley Bitakis: Whenever

361
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.620
Ashley Bitakis: I wonder, it is a very scary book.

362
00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When you don't have to do it. All right, now that I'm introducing it to you because you didn't meet level out here before and you're not meeting it right now.

363
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.980

Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted

366
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you would benefit from a residential level of care.

367
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just let me know. So let's just take it step by step. I'm glad you made it here today. I'm glad you picked up my call.

Gwenevere Abriel: I try to text to get a heads up. If I don't hear from you. I kind of changed a little bit of my approach.

378
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.540
Ashley Bitakis: I was so busy, you're so busy and I gotta be okay.

379
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't hear from you. Then I offer that spot to someone else.

380
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.820
Ashley Bitakis: And then also

381
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.480
Ashley Bitakis: You know, entertaining the idea of residential treatment. Where would it go

382
00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, how about how about we do this. That's beautiful. You mentioned that I have found New Mexico to be a challenge.

383
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:22.980
Ashley Bitakis: But there are people

384
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: They do go places. So let me let me

385
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Place. One of them is called

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: A hoy recovery. That's over in Espanol Ah, but there are a few. So you're entertaining it licious

387
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get some information that's that'll be our first step. How about we do that we'll get ourselves educated. Okay.

388
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to if you have time, you can flip your card over and you can call your insurance provider, even if it's Medicaid and say, Hey, I'm looking for a resident substance abuse program.

389
00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you could say, mental health, but honestly, I think you need residential substance use program and say hey yeah say residential don't use rehab that

390
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the words you want residential level of care.

391
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: For and you want to say the substance. Sometimes they they have a different protocol on different programs for the different substances and just let them know that

392
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a co occurring disorder with with the heroin and methamphetamine. What's your primary drug is is the heroin, you're on an MA ti medicated assisted therapy. That's what this

393
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.230
Ashley Bitakis: Is right now make a

394
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Program. And you might say it's, I can do this for a little while, but I was in it before I had a relapse and I think I need residential, what is my coverage.

395
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me three names of places and the phone numbers. And if you want to make those calls that might be a great first step for you to at least get yourself informed doesn't mean you're going in. It just means now you know

396
00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so our next appointment.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.970

398
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.230

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.220

402
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Same way we did this. I know it's not ideal.

403
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.180
Ashley Bitakis: But interesting. OK.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.990

Gwenevere Abriel: Just

413
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Real quick, closed a new question. Did you pick up the one that was ordered on the real quick.

414
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.260
Ashley Bitakis: No.

415
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me just write that. Hold on. She did not care.

416
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: One.

417
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.730
Ashley Bitakis: I'm I'm literally going to improve my shoes and go up the hill and get it now.

418
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:25.440
Okay.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:27.270

Gwenevere Abriel: Pay

424
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is not would not cover it. Now that might mean that she's not going to order another one. Okay, right, because that doesn't make any sense.

425
00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so just just keeping her hands up. And then we get to talk more tomorrow.

Joshua Lopez: Yeah yeah yeah

448

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's a little delay. All right, I'm

449
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry I'm late. This in session with someone, it just couldn't couldn't enter it on time. I'm

450
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna get an open has anything significant changed any of those big things like same employer kids are healthy, probably, what, staying with mom or they stay with you, where are they

451
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:50.670
Joshua Lopez: There with me right now. I'm still working within Romeo's I get them when I'm off. So my last day of work I pick them up that evening when I get out and then the day before I go to work back with their mom. So hey,

452
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You seem sad though, what is there something on your on your mind now.

453
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.450
Joshua Lopez: I'm a little bit. I can just have mixed emotions.

454
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:10.830
Joshua Lopez: For the past month and a half or so what we're seeing in the end it's a hotel, you know, just trying to get everything together.

455
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.310
Joshua Lopez: Moving into an apartment tomorrow.

456
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:27.630
Joshua Lopez: Which is exciting. I'm like, happy to find out a place to call home. You know, first time in nine months so excited, but also kind of kind of sad, I guess.

457
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:35.460
Joshua Lopez: Seem just seems more real. Now you know i know you both are moving on.

458
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:41.400
Joshua Lopez: So it's like a mixed bag of emotions. I'm happy, I'm excited.

459
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.590
Joshua Lopez: Sad. Yeah, I'm a little bit of everything.

460
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:49.050
And make sense.

461
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.940
Joshua Lopez: It's exciting you know to finally have a place to go home. I'm

462
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:05.370
Joshua Lopez: Just like I said, it just seems kind of surreal like

463
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:08.460
Joshua Lopez: You know, just

464
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.110
Joshua Lopez: Just that

465
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:12.150
Yeah.

466
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So Joshua put put this phone down prop it up.

467
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just me. Put it down. It's rested there.

468
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.140
Let's just have a seat.

469
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.800
Joshua Lopez: There.

470
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe you haven't been able to tell anyone that other side, you know, for the kids. You have to look strong and you have to

471
00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Act like it's all good. All this this move is all exciting but

472
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: To give yourself, just a few minutes to sort of

473
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Just dip into that sorrow that grief of having to feel in real time that you're not moving in with your wife. This isn't a fresh start that this isn't

474
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't that

475
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What those awareness is

476
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Just free associate what what are things that pass through your minds that you have someone that being me. I can hear you.

477
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:55.080
Joshua Lopez: Know,

478
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.850
Joshua Lopez: Not being able to share it with

479
00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:07.290
Joshua Lopez: 13 years I get all

480
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:11.880
Joshua Lopez: The way but it felt like

481
00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:27.330
Joshua Lopez: Real like you did I really not shared it with anybody. How do

482
00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.530
Joshua Lopez: You know a friend or

483
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:34.200
Joshua Lopez: Somebody

484
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.350
Joshua Lopez: About being positive about it. No.

485
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.370
No.

486
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:47.400
No.

487
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:55.860
Joshua Lopez: No, we've been done for a while now and I know we're not getting back together.

488
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:58.350
Joshua Lopez: But it is

489
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.020
Joshua Lopez: I don't know why, but

490
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.740
Joshua Lopez: Really kind of set in

491
00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:14.550
Joshua Lopez: started paying off the deposit already getting closer to the actual date is like it said in that

492
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:18.120
Joshua Lopez: This is it, you know, this is

493
00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.600
Joshua Lopez: How it's going to be for a while.

494
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.140
Joshua Lopez: For a long time. I mean, I don't know how long.

495
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Mind go. You don't have to preserve opinion from to worry about my opinion of you mines not changing. I already know you are a good strong intelligent loving, man, that's not going to change.

496
00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Change.

497
00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are grieving.

498
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't get a chance to do it with your children and you don't get a chance to do it at work or with your parents with your brother, but you can do that with me.

499
00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You can let that out.

500
00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: yourself permission to touch that sorrow, even a little bit

501
00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:29.040
You

502
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:34.980
Joshua Lopez: Know,

503
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.880
Joshua Lopez: The best thing to move forward and get myself together because I've

504
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.080
Joshua Lopez: Already done a lot and I

505
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:54.600
Joshua Lopez: We spoke about taking credit for that month already or taking those steps. Yeah. And then, even though

506
00:51:55.950 --> 00:52:01.710
Joshua Lopez: You know, like I wish I would have done this sooner wish I would have

507
00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:06.690
Joshua Lopez: Me much more valuable sooner.

508
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.480
Joshua Lopez: It's exciting because

509
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:22.440
Joshua Lopez: I followed your advice money advice, my credit, and I, I see it. You know, I see it happening in about six months, I see benefits that are going to be coming

510
00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:28.440
Joshua Lopez: But again, I wish, I wish I had heard that, you know. Uh huh.

511
00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:32.130
Joshua Lopez: And i mean i

512
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:39.720
Joshua Lopez: Have a hard time grasping why feel like that is part of me feels like she

513
00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.140
Joshua Lopez: Really doesn't deserve to

514
00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:48.240
Joshua Lopez: Or doesn't deserve for me to feel like that, you know,

515
00:52:50.520 --> 00:53:00.720
Joshua Lopez: She didn't want it to be happier on her own, which is fine. It's just, I don't know why I do something they don't know why to

516
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.980
Joshua Lopez: Hold on, and wish I could share these things with her as

517
00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.080
Joshua Lopez: We know it it doesn't do me any good to feel like that.

518
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:19.440
Joshua Lopez: You know about bettering myself now.

519
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:26.820
Joshua Lopez: I am, you know. Oh, yeah. Okay, let's see.

520
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:43.860
Joshua Lopez: Okay.

521
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you should be. But you're not. This is complex stuff. I don't have that judgment, what you're going through. Makes sense. It makes sense to me.

522
00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: There's real logic to it. I, I know as you're in it.

523
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You say a lot of why why why why right it's confusing for you. I should just be happy.

524
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't surprise me. You're, you're having to let go of an image that you had about how life would be

525
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't add up. How could something so

526
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad

527
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: motivate me to go accomplish these things. And now I've lost this thing that motivated me. I can't go tell this thing.

528
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: About my accomplishments. Is it my fault that it's gone to begin with. And that's just touching the surface of the complexity of what you're going through. It's not black and white. So don't give yourself a hard time about these mixed feelings.

529
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What else comes up.

530
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:03.870
Joshua Lopez: Wanting to share it with somebody you know

531
00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:07.980
Joshua Lopez: Everything that you share. Yeah, absolutely.

532
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So later on when we have talked and you feel heard and understood I can give you some psychobabble I can give you some of that. But the truth of the matter is it's it's not. I've been throwing that out you for a while.

533
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to live through it doesn't matter how much I give you great psychology about why we do these things.

534
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You still have to wade through the thick mud.

535
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.220
Joshua Lopez: Of grief, we

536
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, I don't want to give you some story and make you think, Oh, well then, I will. I'll skip over all this sorrow, you're still going to have to wade through it or of course you could escape into drugs.

537
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Other addictive behavior.

538
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so instead, let's do it with grace.

539
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And, cry, cry and say, I love deeply and maybe maybe this maybe this time.

540
00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: When I fall in love or pay attention to some things that maybe I didn't pay attention to before. That's all.

541
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where the growth can be

542
00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What was I not paying attention to. Before that, this time a hold on tight a hold on to myself.

543
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be where the growth plate right on that edge.

544
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:48.510
Joshua Lopez: I agree 100% with that. I mean, I know there were

545
00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:52.740
Joshua Lopez: Things that I just

546
00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.240
Joshua Lopez: You know, I know. Now I work to

547
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:08.340
Joshua Lopez: Love again that I would learn from my mistake. You know, nobody's perfect. I probably make new ones, but I know

548
00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.990
Joshua Lopez: It would be more in tune with what I was doing and

549
00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.930
Joshua Lopez: The cause and effect of it.

550
00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:27.390
Joshua Lopez: I've learned not to beat myself up too much anymore like a part of me feel does every now and then, like,

551
00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:36.060
Joshua Lopez: You know, I wish I could have paid more attention or wish I would have seen it.

552
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.940
Joshua Lopez: I wish I wouldn't have made those mistakes but you know we can't change the

553
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:45.720
Joshua Lopez: Word.

554
00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.470
Joshua Lopez: Try to use that as motivation.

555
00:57:51.630 --> 00:58:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Joshua, there's no one who could have said to you, I believe in you. You couldn't hear it. I've been screaming at the dogs been screaming at your wife. It didn't matter. You couldn't hear it inside

556
00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you get that you had to be kicked out like on your ass to understand like to be shown in real time. You've got everything it takes. There's nothing missing in you. We couldn't preach it. We couldn't do it.

557
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's nothing wrong with you for that most people are like that. We just this a particular composition of whatever the recipe was around childhood and parenting and blah, blah, blah, that that's just the way it had to be for you had to be like this.

558
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: No one could have gotten the message across.

559
00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To go out there and knock on doors, even when the doors say no, you get up and you do it again. No, you get up, you do it again you know you you were forced to have to do it.

560
00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So what that's the recipe. A lot of people are like that because we're scared. We're all scared. We doubt our confidence.

561
00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You share that with everybody.

562
00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.790
Joshua Lopez: That comes up with all mixed bag of emotions.

563
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:30.090
Joshua Lopez: Okay, now I'm moving forward now doing what I need to do with

564
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:35.490
Joshua Lopez: Learning to love myself I'm learning to take care of myself.

565
00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:47.190
Joshua Lopez: But part of me just also feels like what if I do ever find that, again, you know, what if I don't ever care for somebody like that again.

566
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.310
Joshua Lopez: Just, you know,

567
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:54.810
Joshua Lopez: I don't think a lot more time i knew i just scratched the surface.

568
00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:57.690
Joshua Lopez: But a part of me is

569
01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:02.970
Joshua Lopez: Burns to be

570
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:04.680
Not alone.

571
01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand.

572
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:09.180
Joshua Lopez: You know, I just

573
01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:10.980
Joshua Lopez: Missed

574
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:24.750
Joshua Lopez: somebody to talk to. Miss after my low, we would not work at 3D stretch and I'm tired. I just, I miss coming home and having somebody to talk to.

575
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:25.770
With

576
01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:32.820
Joshua Lopez: Miss the little things like holding the hand or waking up next to somebody or

577
01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.160
Joshua Lopez: You know, it just miss a whole give me know

578
01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, yeah.

579
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:47.820
Joshua Lopez: I worried that I will find that again.

580
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:51.660
Joshua Lopez: I know it's probably normal. But I did.

581
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.680
Joshua Lopez: It alone.

582
01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:59.430
Joshua Lopez: And I just kind of doubt.

583
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.800
Joshua Lopez: What ability to find that, again, just not just in my own confidence.

584
01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:09.270
Joshua Lopez: This lack of time lack

585
01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:13.830
Joshua Lopez: Of opportunity. I literally

586
01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:26.760
Joshua Lopez: Work and though the days that I work, I can't go out. I can't hear anybody then as soon as I'm done working I pick up my kiddos with them. The entire

587
01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.380
Joshua Lopez: Time. And then if you wanted to work. I

588
01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:37.920
Joshua Lopez: Don't see an opportunity to everything like that, you know,

589
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.000
I know

590
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: This is this

591
01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: This is interesting because to me. This doesn't feel any different. You use the same reasoning that you used for not having confidence to go out into the world and

592
01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's the same. It's the same reason he used to tell me all the time. I don't have time. I'm very busy. I'm cleaning I'm cooking and taking care of the kids, I'm driving them places. I'm taking them to

593
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: To their doctors appointments, who would was a big one for you. Was I don't have the time.

594
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen.

595
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't the time to start a new relationship. Anyway, so the loneliness is one thing I get that part.

596
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But there is there's a phenomenon going on. And this is where the psychobabble comes in.

597
01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Romantic love has this

598
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing about it. It's You complete me romantic love it's it's actually a disorder of this developmental stage when we're younger and it's a phenomenon of your my other half. We need each other.

599
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And when she's not there with you.

600
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: A part of you is missing.

601
01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you and you look like that look like a part of you is missing the part that knows how to say

602
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're wonderful you're smart enough, and you're good enough. You gave that away in romantic love. I told you this was psychobabble stuff right

603
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there it is. And now you wonder, can I ever have it again. Well, what if you don't go after that fist, there's another kind of love and it's mature.

604
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't this all sweeping consumption. It's I hold on to myself I value myself and I with someone who is her own self. She loves herself, she doesn't need me, she chooses me

605
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Chooses me isn't dependent on me and I am not dependent on her it's mature.

606
01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that sounds while it's not from romantic comedies and it's not from novellas

607
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But developmentally it's more sustainable. We don't get angry at them for not appreciating us like it's it's a mature kind of love and I don't expect you to know what the heck I'm talking about and we won't even talk about it for a year.

608
01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's out there.

609
01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not the

610
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Same as this all consuming thing that we do when we're in our teenage years, or in our early 20s. So sweeps us away just feels like nirvana.

611
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not sustainable.

612
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we get lost that piece that we gave away and said, Well, I need you because you're, you're the part you're my Social Confidence, or you're, you're the one that sees me that I'm wonderful, but I can't give it to myself, you gave that away.

613
01:04:55.140 --> 01:05:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This time, and that's why this moment so hard. I think you're left having to hear your own voice of confidence that you're good enough smart enough handsome enough playful enough, funny enough charming enough intelligent for all of it. You have to do it all yourself.

614
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is hard for you and it's been hard.

615
01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:19.800
Joshua Lopez: You know,

616
01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to grow that muscle, you're not going to grow it if you fill it in with someone else who feeds your ego now.

617
01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: At the same time, you're also contradicting what I'm saying. You're also addressing credit working hard. You're doing the hard work of developing that atrophied muscle.

618
01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right that self confidence, you're actually doing a lot of the work because

619
01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You still have your job if you really wanted to do the like the I'm not good enough thing like i'd my confidence isn't good enough. You wouldn't show up to work.

620
01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Plenty of people decide to go back to drug use, they go, I can't do it. I'm not good enough. Some people can just can kind of give up on themselves.

621
01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not. So I want you to appreciate how hard you're working here you're having to do a really serious piece of identity growth because you don't have this other piece of you.

622
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you go running for it again. This same phenomenon will happen and that's when I say words like hold on to yourself. Joshua. And do you know, do you know what you let go of when you were with her to realize this time a lesson learned. Do you know what you will not let go up next.

623
01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the part that's kind of like

624
01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Only you're going to know how to name that I know mine. He knows his she knows her because we went through that growth experience.

625
01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't give it away to someone else, because you think that's what love is.

626
01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to you what you want.

627
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think this takes some time.

628
01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:22.290
Joshua Lopez: Did stop my video. Just because you're giving me some valuable information and it kind of was breaking up here in there so

629
01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe it. I was seeing something too.

630
01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

631
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead.

632
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.170
Joshua Lopez: No, I'm just saying, I hope that this is it because I don't want you to think I turned it off for

633
01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:36.000
Joshua Lopez: Him.

634
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:38.490
Joshua Lopez: Yeah.

635
01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:43.920
Joshua Lopez: Definitely tried to pick up on this because like you said, it is kind of

636
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.720
Joshua Lopez: Kind of

637
01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:56.160
Joshua Lopez: Different from, you know, what I've known in my life. So I'm trying to understand it more. And the more you talk about it.

638
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:59.820
Joshua Lopez: The more I can try and understand it.

639
01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:06.030
Joshua Lopez: And that's why it's important that I hear it. Clearly, there were a little part that I

640
01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:07.980
Joshua Lopez: It broke up.

641
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

642
01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:10.830
Definitely

643
01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:12.900
Joshua Lopez: For sure.

644
01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you take pride in how hard you're working. This is the sit difficult moment.

645
01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that is a little irrational, meaning it the thinking goes into the future and predicts a negative outcome. That's the part that's not kind of grounded in reality you don't know you're not going to find someone to mind is saying.

646
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have it right now we don't have it right now. And we never will. That's all it's doing is saying we don't have it right now.

647
01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And what the brain does is it says, Well, if we're missing something now. Well, then we surely won't have it in the future. It doesn't that that's the wrong part of the brain to be listening to

648
01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I mean by irrational. That's sort of the limbic system up here. Isn't there another part of you that says, of course, I'm going to find someone just haven't met this person yet.

649
01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't there a little glimmer of it's just as likely that you'll find someone is not find someone isn't it like maybe I will isn't there even that thought like maybe I will

650
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.920
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I mean,

651
01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:34.410
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, I

652
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:35.910
Joshua Lopez: Just don't

653
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:36.570
Joshua Lopez: Know,

654
01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:40.050
Joshua Lopez: I don't really feel it at the moment, I think.

655
01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.540
Joshua Lopez: Loneliness system.

656
01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:45.450
Joshua Lopez: You know, and I just

657
01:09:46.530 --> 01:09:47.040
Joshua Lopez: I just

658
01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:49.650
Joshua Lopez: hate to say it, I feel lonely.

659
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No kidding. Absolutely. I get it.

660
01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But it isn't forever.

661
01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. That's what I mean by the irrational. It means we take this moment, and we call it what it is and it's brave of you to call it. It's Dan, I miss the affection. I miss the atom, boys. Yeah, we go nicely done, you're so cool is a wonderful, of course, we missed that.

662
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense. But what's happening is that confusion that this feeling will last forever.

663
01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Not even the loss real death, loss of a parent right even that doesn't last forever. That feeling around an event changes, it will change, but you're just getting into it now. So, this is this is painful.

664
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But your brains confusing the president with the future you, you and I don't know what the future is going to be

665
01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:58.260
Joshua Lopez: Definitely

666
01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:04.950
Joshua Lopez: I think I buy into it too much.

667
01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.030
Joshua Lopez: You know cuz your imagination run wild.

668
01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:15.060
Joshua Lopez: It does. You know, I know.

669
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:21.120
Joshua Lopez: When I pick up the kids are cold and always going off and all this stuff like

670
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:23.760
Joshua Lopez: You know, you start

671
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.710
Joshua Lopez: You start thinking, you know, she met somebody you know

672
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.060
Joshua Lopez: Okay, why, why doesn't she feel lonely.

673
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:41.490
Joshua Lopez: Which I know I need to not fit in those things you just worry about

674
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:43.290
Joshua Lopez: What I'm doing

675
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:45.660
Joshua Lopez: But

676
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's name it is that jealousy, To. Is there another piece of it. That's also like

677
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Jealous, too.

678
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.590
Joshua Lopez: Absolutely, absolutely. Okay.

679
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.790
Joshua Lopez: For as long as we're together, long as we've been apart.

680
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:18.660
Joshua Lopez: No i a i can't help it, but I just thought of her with somebody else does. Still, still drives me insane.

681
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:25.500
Joshua Lopez: You know, and I don't know if there is, I don't know if there isn't. I don't know.

682
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:29.460
Joshua Lopez: And I don't dare ask

683
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:36.480
Joshua Lopez: What did I would say I like to know if there is a doubt. I don't want to know now.

684
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to do you any good.

685
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it is preoccupies your mind and yeah

686
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.010
Joshua Lopez: Yeah, that's another reason why

687
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:54.210
Joshua Lopez: sometimes be a little more bearable.

688
01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:05.670
Joshua Lopez: No credit like this enough ever felt lonely that she not ever miss me. I mean 13 years and he walked away pretty easily.

689
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.590
Joshua Lopez: Here I am, nine months later, and I'm still

690
01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:13.560
Joshua Lopez: having a rough time letting go.

691
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So Joshua, the part that you have to correct me if I'm wrong, because I could be missing pieces but out here as an observer. She looked like she was pulling away, a long time ago. Was that just me.

692
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:31.620
Joshua Lopez: Know, I've, I've heard that from other people as well.

693
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So she's been letting go. She's had. It's not just these nine months. It's been a while.

694
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You see what I'm getting up

695
01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not saying that feels any better. I mean, that

696
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:50.520
Definitely

697
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, I'm just rip it all the band aids off today are and I

698
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.070
Joshua Lopez: Know it's true. I mean,

699
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:04.320
Joshua Lopez: There were times when we're together that it just felt like she was already

700
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:14.310
Joshua Lopez: To me it feels like when we finally split up and she kicked me out. It felt like that was the best she had been planning for a while.

701
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.320
Joshua Lopez: You know, it really hurts to think about that, but

702
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:26.040
Joshua Lopez: You know, I talked to my brother, he, he said he's seen it for a while.

703
01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:36.540
Joshua Lopez: You know, and I just sometimes I wonder how I did it see it, you know, what was that close this situation and I didn't get

704
01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:46.320
Joshua Lopez: That also goes in with that lonely feeling that, yeah, it's been a month, but it's really been longer

705
01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.150
Joshua Lopez: than I thought.

706
01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:49.950
Joshua Lopez: You know,

707
01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:54.420
Joshua Lopez: Before we broke up out this way.

708
01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.340
Joshua Lopez: I remember

709
01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You were because some of our conversations were around, you know, wanting to spend time with her and she was with her family downstairs or upstairs. I can't remember which direction think shaver down camera which side but

710
01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:16.200
Joshua Lopez: We all live by us, we would put down was everywhere.

711
01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Everywhere. So my memory is

712
01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That you you had some loneliness, even when you were with her. That's my memory.

713
01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.080
Joshua Lopez: Do

714
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But you may not have called it that you may have been irritated instead with her sister, why is she not, you know, maybe went toward more towards irritability and anger versus

715
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.920
I'm lonely and

716
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wanted let's shift gears for just a second. Can you just list out to me.

717
01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me the qualities

718
01:15:54.660 --> 01:16:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me some positive qualities. This is going to feel like it's out of the blue here but forgive me. What are some positive qualities of your mother.

719
01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:08.160
Joshua Lopez: Kind of hard right now.

720
01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:12.180
Joshua Lopez: Right now.

721
01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll start with those, then let me have the negative qualities of mother, let me start with those

722
01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:19.590
Joshua Lopez: Stubborn it

723
01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:30.180
Joshua Lopez: doesn't always happen right, you need to listen. Okay. Yeah.

724
01:16:34.170 --> 01:16:34.650
Listen.

725
01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:39.870
Joshua Lopez: Very

726
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so if she was stubborn about something you believed in you might not notice the stubbornness check and see if it's around a particular belief system, she has. So really, really check on that.

727
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see what I'm getting out.

728
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That's conviction. If someone has conviction and we we match up with them really well and we don't notice it because they happen to share the same conviction.

729
01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there something she stubborn around a particular theme that really pisses you off.

730
01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:19.140
Joshua Lopez: My kid. She wouldn't

731
01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.580
Joshua Lopez: Listen to me into my kids like

732
01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.980
Joshua Lopez: Whole lives we move in for a few months, and

733
01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:33.060
Joshua Lopez: She like she knew what wasn't better for them.

734
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:44.580
Joshua Lopez: A lot of things that I tried to tower, like with normal for my kid. She was convinced it wasn't normal

735
01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I don't hear from you don't hear

736
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: She's disrespectful. I don't hear she's judgmental. So when I say those was your truth.

737
01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:15.510
Joshua Lopez: disrespectful one I do agree with. I don't think like my mom really respected me as a father.

738
01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:18.480
Joshua Lopez: He respected me as a man

739
01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: She showed that to you.

740
01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take the Father. That's going to be real familiar because you were just probably talking about it. How does she show you

741
01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't respect you as a father.

742
01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:44.850
Joshua Lopez: Not listening to me when I read our

743
01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:46.560
You know,

744
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:52.110
Joshua Lopez: I don't know, like we clean it. I mean, I know like examples of

745
01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me examples, my kids.

746
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:55.140
Call

747
01:18:56.430 --> 01:19:01.170
Joshua Lopez: When like if. Is this the one that stands out the most is Christmas Eve.

748
01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:05.070
Joshua Lopez: Was running around this open. He started coughing

749
01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:23.610
Joshua Lopez: She laid him down with that boy can read something wrong with him out a respiratory thing. I went I kept on oom a calm them down. He was fine. Look, he's fine. It's Christmas Eve. You know, I'll take them to the doctor, but it's Christmas Eve. I'm not taking them right now.

750
01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:27.000
Joshua Lopez: Other open and you could take them and really

751
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:36.180
Joshua Lopez: You know, and I just like it's Christmas eve know but they're open to take them in and

752
01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:48.330
Joshua Lopez: I finally was just like, I'm not fighting with you on Christmas Eve today. This is a sweater on the doctor. Of course, he started to cry because what he wants to go to a doctor's on Christmas Eve.

753
01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You ended up taking her to the doctor on Christmas Eve.

754
01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:56.790
Joshua Lopez: No, no, I, I was bout to I was going to become

755
01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Doctors crying. Your daughter's crying.

756
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.880
Joshua Lopez: It's my son and

757
01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:13.080
Joshua Lopez: He doesn't want to go. And then she goes in there and she's like, Don't do this to him, are you doing this to him. And it's like,

758
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:20.760
Joshua Lopez: I'm not doing this to him. You're insisting that I take them and get you off my back. I'm going to take him.

759
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:29.730
Joshua Lopez: She's like, all of a sudden pinning it on me. You know, I'm running. It's Christmas Eve and

760
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:34.830
Joshua Lopez: I'm did this a lot. Why was there like a lot. Wow. Okay.

761
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So real quick, I just want to check and see if it's around a theme was it always around

762
01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The health of someone or did this way of being.

763
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What I would call an overreaction

764
01:20:51.150 --> 01:21:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that overreaction only around medical and health care issues or was it in other domains of life, like your spiritual beliefs, your financial status. Your cleanliness. I'm your marriage. You see what I'm getting out like there's a lot of different domains.

765
01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This overreaction oh my gosh she's got a respiratory always going to have, you know, that's an overreaction and notice yours was just

766
01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Calm and you checked on your son, you use reasonable, you know. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Everything okay and he was fine. You didn't overreact. And you didn't under react.

767
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm asking you is if her is that behavior, she demonstrated was it in other domains of life, or only around the medical health of people

768
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:58.440
Joshua Lopez: I think a big part of it was like medically with my kid. Okay. It wasn't just that there were other other things for me.

769
01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:02.640
Joshua Lopez: When I first moved out and we first divorce decree.

770
01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:12.120
Joshua Lopez: Kind of like an overreaction like oh she seemed somebody out and we knew it, and you know, like just a lot of things.

771
01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:15.300
Joshua Lopez: You know, like

772
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:18.990
Joshua Lopez: Always you if D on

773
01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:41.130
Joshua Lopez: To me, that was usually action. I told her I was going to handle it. I told her I was taking care of things. And again, she didn't respect my decision to that respect the way I handled it and she took matters into her own hands and made everything 10 times worse.

774
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:50.130
Joshua Lopez: And this was a theme, since I moved in there. It was a theme that was ongoing from the very beginning.

775
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:53.550
Joshua Lopez: When I finally had enough. And I just left.

776
01:22:55.620 --> 01:23:02.070
Joshua Lopez: That was, that was pretty difficult because I didn't really know where I was going to go. I didn't know what I was going to do.

777
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:14.460
Joshua Lopez: Means for like a week it's practically living out of my truck, but I just couldn't take it anymore that I'm going through. I just started this new job.

778
01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:16.950
It just

779
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:27.570
Joshua Lopez: I couldn't you couldn't take her over reactions anymore because things that I normally handled rationally. It was starting to kind of

780
01:23:29.490 --> 01:23:34.950
Joshua Lopez: Trying to eat her it was reacting with her and not just wasn't helping my situation.

781
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:44.520
Joshua Lopez: You know, and it's probably the best thing. Yes, I've been struggling and making pretty good money and I find myself broke because of

782
01:23:45.450 --> 01:24:02.880
Joshua Lopez: Everything that I'm doing you know staying in the extended stay hotel was expensive heavy to do everything positive, all that stuff. It's been really hard. It's been a, it's been a really rough two months, but it was necessary and needed to get out on my own and needed to do all this stuff.

783
01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:16.920
Joshua Lopez: And ultimately, I feel stronger for it because I am getting my own place. I am doing this and it does hurt me that I'm not talking to her at same time. I just feel like

784
01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.270
Joshua Lopez: She wasn't ever going to respect.

785
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.660
Joshua Lopez: me as a person to

786
01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:26.970
Joshua Lopez: You know, it just

787
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:29.910
Joshua Lopez: Couldn't do it anymore.

788
01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:44.430
Joshua Lopez: And it does her, you know, that's your mom, you need to be angry with them. You, you need to have these feelings towards them, but the same time I just

789
01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:47.850
Joshua Lopez: Don't

790
01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:56.580
Joshua Lopez: Don't think she was ever going to respect me and i would i did i had to do it just like I had to do it, you know.

791
01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:00.690
Joshua Lopez: To turn my back. I had to walk away to

792
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's rephrase that Joshua

793
01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a real quick before we do the rephrase, has she basically always been like this, as you were growing up, blowing things out of proportion.

794
01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.240
Joshua Lopez: Believe so

795
01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on to that.

796
01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That means, and I'll put it on over here. If I grow up in an environment where my primary caregiver completely blows things. I have a cold.

797
01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And she thinks it's pneumonia, I get a d minus in math.

798
01:25:42.420 --> 01:26:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: She grounds me for three months and says, I'm failing out of middle school I kiss a boy and she calls me a slut and has me see a psychiatrist. Now here's what happens to a young person. So I'm modeling. What I am suspecting may have happened to you.

799
01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch my identity. When I'm

800
01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: My identity, meaning I know who I am. I know what I think I know what I see. I know what I believe.

801
01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's in question all the time. I don't get to trust my own judgment, not when my object. My parent continuously doesn't mirror reality.

802
01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make sense.

803
01:26:41.610 --> 01:26:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So take that if that's true, if that's kind of what that was. Then you go out into the world.

804
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, my ears are really congested today. You go out into the world and you fall in love with it with a hate to say it but it's another object. It's a person

805
01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you give away your self evaluation your identity again and you base it on what this other person says about you to now watch. Guess what you are alone and you don't have that.

806
01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling you what's real, you're left with, you know, the neat thing is that you did when you moved out in your mom's house. I don't care if you're sleeping in your car. I would rather you not go fucking insane, you understand

807
01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd rather you sleeping that car. Your kids were in there with you too, because you won't have to go crazy. You have the risk of going crazy in that house Joshua

808
01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:49.560
Joshua Lopez: And I do feel like I was going crazy. They're really do some of the stuff that they did was just, it was absurd.

809
01:27:49.830 --> 01:28:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but I'm but I'm it's clinical I don't use the word I use the word crazy because my clients understand that when someone says one thing

810
01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is your son is sick, you should take him to the hospital. Joshua your under-reacting look at this poor boy. And then when you actually try to do it.

811
01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: They then criticize, you're doing it at their level of overreaction you have nothing to do but go crazy because they're contradicting themselves.

812
01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's just one example. And if that was happening. You had a young little mind at age 1011 age seven at 15. There's no way you knew what to do with those contradictory bits of information that's crazy making

813
01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why people go nuts. Oh, like they want to get out. They want to get me out of here. So I'm glad you left and you left at a very young age, when you were young, too.

814
01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's cuckoo.

815
01:28:55.350 --> 01:29:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I say that I got other words to describe what your mom was doing. She's doing the best way she knows how but you're the consumer of that that has messed with identity self esteem, self confidence. That's messed with it because your object which is your parent

816
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Was not a consistent, reliable rational mirror of how you were seeing the world you needed it bounced back then you do it, you do it for your kids, don't you, they say, hey, look. Look, I did a good job and they show you something they did.

817
01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't say, Well, you're not an artist. I mean, come on, you can do better than that. You don't do that. Do you

818
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you go, oh look, you work so hard on it. Look at the pretty red and blue and you use all the colors. I was great.

819
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You mirror back as the object for them kind of what they're going through, you're basically saying to your children. I see you

820
01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Your reality is real and therefore they get to grow up with. It's called ego strength, your wording would be confidence they get to believe in their reality they believe in themselves.

821
01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And they guess what

822
01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: They can go out into the world and they have their own opinion.

823
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I can understand you. I think just in this tiny and I don't even know the full story, but just this little tiny story that you're telling me when I asked you to give me a list.

824
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Has given me some insight into a possibility about why it's so hard for you to hold on to your truth right now.

825
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the identity. The ego strength was not developed when you were younger, and you're doing it now.

826
01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no one there to say you're doing a good job you're you're you're okay. You're all right.

827
01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get that it feels the more than just lonely. Like, it feels intensely lonely.

828
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, yeah.

829
01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, but it will pass it will pass in the way it's going to pass as you keep calling it this and you say, all right, this is how I get there.

830
01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to trust again and again if I'm hungry, I eat if I'm tired. I sleep. If I want to wear a red shirt today if I assess my children as having they need to go to urgent care. Why then, I'll take them each time you do what your intuition tells you you are building your ego strength up

831
01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:32.190
Joshua Lopez: Okay.

832
01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be minute after minute and this

833
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:34.650
Joshua Lopez: Feeling

834
01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Of loneliness will pass it will, and you will have you there, and you will be a much more mature stronger man inside. I think you're gonna like who you are when you get there.

835
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But I get. I get how lonely, it is right now, but it's not a reflection of your value.

836
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not. It's just that you don't have this this ego strength piece. It's different. You don't you you take you take me because I'm the only other person in the room.

837
01:32:13.410 --> 01:32:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an earned piece. I had to learn that

838
01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I know if something happens here. I will be okay. But I had to have that that ego strength develop when I was younger.

839
01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: For me to know I'm lovable.

840
01:32:31.470 --> 01:32:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be loved and I can give love again even if this whatever this is here this relationship that's over here. What if it falls apart. For whatever reason, I'll be okay.

841
01:32:47.700 --> 01:33:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about it like this. Joshua. You remember over the years that you and I have been working together. I would say two things I would give another way to approach a day or a relationship or how to approach something and you kind of said yeah yeah yeah

842
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Not now. I don't have time right

843
01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of remember that. Yeah. OK.

844
01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm still that same person. My suggestions haven't changed my approach to the world hasn't changed. So if I have any street credibility with you.

845
01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Rely on that maybe the other side is just out of reach. It might be just, just a month from now might be right over the hill. It might be two weeks away.

846
01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, I don't know how long. But it's right there. I have faith, you will get there. I know things are going to be okay.

847
01:33:53.100 --> 01:34:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's gonna be okay but you just don't know how right now. All you're feeling is the sadness, and I know that sadness will pass

848
01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You just get up and you follow your gut. You weren't raised in an environment that reinforced your intuition on what's right for you who do know, you know, because that's what got you out of this house this last month or so because you refuse to go crazy for your mother.

849
01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad.

850
01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're going to be there for yourself, you will. It's gonna be all right. I know it doesn't seem like it now, but it's gonna be okay.

851
01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna be quiet. Get off my soapbox here.

852
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I get on a roll. You sure don't want to

853
01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Finger caught in there.

854
01:34:56.010 --> 01:35:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are you taking it. Now, what are you hearing how is this landing with you.

855
01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:11.550
Joshua Lopez: Just kind of reinforces what I tell myself when I get really bad, like this is going to pass you will

856
01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.280
Joshua Lopez: You're on the right path.

857
01:35:15.690 --> 01:35:22.620
Joshua Lopez: You're, you know, you're bettering yourself just kind of reinforces it feels good to hear from somebody else.

858
01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:23.940
Joshua Lopez: You know,

859
01:35:27.090 --> 01:35:29.670
Joshua Lopez: You know, and I do honestly believe

860
01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:37.080
Joshua Lopez: Though these last two months have been super hard. And I do believe I did the right thing at times. I'm like,

861
01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:40.800
Joshua Lopez: Question, am I bad person, you know,

862
01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:47.400
Joshua Lopez: Not talking to her, and just cutting her off at the same time, I do believe it was

863
01:35:48.450 --> 01:36:01.890
Joshua Lopez: It was what was right for me. And a lot of the times when they make decisions like this. I don't think of what was best for me. I'm too busy worrying about how did I hurt the other person they, you know, how are they feeling

864
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:05.100
Joshua Lopez: Lately I just feel like

865
01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:08.310
Joshua Lopez: Enough.

866
01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:15.870
Joshua Lopez: That enough that it's time I just start worrying about how it affects me

867
01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That

868
01:36:21.450 --> 01:36:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it right there. You just caught it, you caught that distinction psychobabble aside, you caught it. And the way you do it is

869
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to worry about how my mother fields, I have to trust that this was in the best interest of my sanity.

870
01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I had to go. I trust it. I believe you. If I only had to hear a little tiny bit.

871
01:36:48.420 --> 01:37:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: A little tiny bit. I would go nuts in that environment. I'm so sensitive to hypocrisy. If someone even says a word that doesn't match something they said last week. I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

872
01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Like right everything with me. It's got to be all like congruent and lined up how our body feels

873
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What is our feeling was our thoughts right everything right, notice I'm always like, let's get it in line. Let's get into line is that consistent with your core values. Well, what do you think, Well, what do you feel so in an environment where there's mixed message people go crazy or they

874
01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Do drugs.

875
01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they write they move out they have children early they overwork right the whole addiction stuff. The any any compulsive behavior. We want to escape that

876
01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what you're doing right now is not escaping. Notice how hard this is you're not escaping from the difficulty of having to own the fact that what you saw was real.

877
01:37:52.320 --> 01:38:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It was real mixed messages. You've got to follow your gut every day. It's, I want to do what I want to do. You're not going to become a narcissist. I'm not worried about you becoming a selfish person Joshua, you're not going to become that

878
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All this is doing is building what's called ego strength, you have some underdeveloped ego strength, you're going to build it up so that when someone comes along and and very persuasive.

879
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You can still hold on to your own opinion, your own preferences for things you get that

880
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to it.

881
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, I like the sound of this. I like it more of what you want. Every time it starts to get sad and lonely, you go to, what's something that would make me happy right now a lock.

882
01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to put on layaway a new pair of boots. So when I send another $5 towards in another $10 I want to look at something pretty. Maybe I'll start to get some some pretty things in here that I think are cool, like I wanna on a black leather couch. I know what you things are

883
01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Shift right shifted

884
01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:04.380
Joshua Lopez: It's funny that you say that because

885
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:19.650
Joshua Lopez: One of the ways that my buddy recommended I feel my credit with the recommended furniture store where they don't base anything on credit they go off of your bank account and your income and what like get the positive that bank account.

886
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:33.600
Joshua Lopez: And the great part about that is, is they're not using your credit to give you credit but you pay your stuff on time. You pay it off earlier something they report that to the credit bureaus to to your score.

887
01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:43.380
Joshua Lopez: Is one of the things we my daughter did last weekend we went to that printer store to check it out because I didn't know how it works. I didn't know any of that.

888
01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:50.790
Joshua Lopez: You know, and it was it was nice because we went through them were like we like this dining room table.

889
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:59.580
Joshua Lopez: You know, this is what we're going to get for the apartment next to the couch. Next is is this, you know, and that's kind of

890
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:08.790
Joshua Lopez: Right now it doesn't seem like it because I stretch myself so thin with deposits and activations and just everything it all added up

891
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:20.460
Joshua Lopez: But next week is my big paycheck, or my long week of work on that next Thursday. I'm going to fill out their application. I'm going to go get a dining room table.

892
01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:27.870
Joshua Lopez: It's going to be seeing that slowly but surely, my first week I might not even have very much furniture there but

893
01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:44.190
Joshua Lopez: Within the month, month and a half. I hope to have it decorated the way I would like my style mighty my a unity me and then also I call her my little humble there Ashlyn has been like told you she didn't like my rock and a lot of this.

894
01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:53.340
Joshua Lopez: So I made sure that she knows her in the law when it comes to picking something out. I don't just say, Oh, I like that when even though I do

895
01:40:53.940 --> 01:41:08.280
Joshua Lopez: Like hey Ash. What do you think about this one, compared to this one. And of course she's like, Dad, I really liked what you picked out, you know, our appliances are black, because that's going to match this is you know what i mean i just I'd make sure she feels important to

896
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:18.090
Joshua Lopez: You know, because I feel like not only have I been through a lot in through a lot so so those strings, as you call it,

897
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:23.670
Joshua Lopez: Also in the part of it, so she can build a string as I'm building my

898
01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:33.960
Joshua Lopez: Like a lot of this stuff. You said it means the verbiage me. It's been a little different. But I think it's just laid groundwork for in the past.

899
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:51.330
Joshua Lopez: Now that you're repeating it is kind of making more sense. And you know, I have been definitely want you to know I do listen and take a lot of the stuff you tell me your give me advice on and I'm putting it into work and you know I

900
01:41:52.410 --> 01:41:53.070
Joshua Lopez: I'm getting there.

901
01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hear it. I'm excited about the credit. I'm really excited because you did you sounded optimistic, like I'm putting into place this stuff. I know it's a big chunk of money that you're putting into this deposit, but

902
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It. I would say in the next few months.

903
01:42:15.810 --> 01:42:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You get you tell me what it's like. Then you tell me when you're

904
01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: investing money where you want it to go when you start to when you keep checking in with credit and you check in you, it starts to go up each month, it's going to

905
01:42:28.530 --> 01:42:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to keep going up and then you're going to have things you need, you're going to be able to

906
01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of keep building this home putting things in the home, you're going to be able to pay for certain little things for the kids, not too much right want to still reserve some stuff for saving and for you in this early part of healing.

907
01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing it. I think what you needed today was just

908
01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You doing it just right.

909
01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.420
Joshua Lopez: You know,

910
01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.090
Joshua Lopez: It does mean a lot. I mean,

911
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:06.630
Joshua Lopez: You know, it's like if they're

912
01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:09.360
Joshua Lopez: Traveling but

913
01:43:11.010 --> 01:43:18.060
Joshua Lopez: You don't know it because you're so close the situation that you with loneliness kind of overshadowed

914
01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:29.130
Joshua Lopez: But yeah, I like I said it wasn't just all bad. It wasn't my mixed bag of emotions wasn't dominated by one thing I think it just sat in

915
01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:43.320
Joshua Lopez: The past couple of days is a little bit stronger. But, you know, leading up to it. There was so much excitement. There's, you know that it's a mixed bag. There's a lot of different emotions, but there were there were just negative ones. There were definitely some positive one.

916
01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:51.540
Joshua Lopez: And the kind of got reinforced today, which, you know, positive ones always should get reinforced more than than negative one. So,

917
01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you know that about yourself, it means that you can create opportunities for it. So the more you're talking about that with friends, the more you're talking about it in a group setting, the more you say it in here. Just want to make sure

918
01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing what any reasonable person would do right now you share it. They say, oh yeah, heck yeah

919
01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: don't rob yourself of that, it means we do need to say our things out loud, and then it bounces back. Yep. That's what I would do, man. Me too. Me too, me too. And I think you've got a friend.

920
01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now that's going through a separation. I'm hoping he's a good influence. I think you're working out.

921
01:44:37.410 --> 01:44:38.790
Joshua Lopez: And he definitely is.

922
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:44.970
Joshua Lopez: He's the one who's giving me advice and building credit. He's the one who kind of reinforces that

923
01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:54.480
Joshua Lopez: You don't need anybody. You just need to you need yourself in any mean, and that's where he got in, like, I can see it. We start hanging around a few months ago.

924
01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:02.100
Joshua Lopez: And recently I can see his confidence is when I, I can see you know to mean and just He'll. He'll call me out of the blue.

925
01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:10.650
Joshua Lopez: You know, every now and then you'll be like, Hey, let's go hang out. Unfortunately, sport for cancel, but it was like, Hey, let's go have a beer and watch the leak or team.

926
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:14.340
Joshua Lopez: Stuff like that. But then he also would call me in the middle of the week when

927
01:45:15.150 --> 01:45:22.620
Joshua Lopez: You know, we both have worked at the next day he just like a man. Just checking up, you know, how are you doing you know hey how's the apartment search going are

928
01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:30.510
Joshua Lopez: We able to check out. Credit Karma, or just like you know i mean it's not just only hang out and do this. It's part a little part of that, but it's also

929
01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:40.290
Joshua Lopez: Hey man, how you doing, you know, mean just, I don't know. He's been a real positive influence, aside from having a beer to on the weekend. He doesn't do drugs. He doesn't

930
01:45:41.610 --> 01:45:45.510
Joshua Lopez: condone that kind of stuff, you know, he's got two little ones, though, that

931
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:55.800
