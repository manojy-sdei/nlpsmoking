Alyse: Like that, like, was there, like from nine o'clock in the morning till nine o'clock at night like first time I've been to my mom's and

10
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.580
Alyse: A year or more. Well, what it says what last time we broke up, which is pretty much been since last summer. So about a year, almost

11
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.490
Yeah, I can really

12
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.550
Alyse: Yeah.

13
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.500
Richelle Direny: When you were saying over there.

14
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.940
Hey,

15
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.430
Alyse: Yeah, that was that was back in summertime, because I remember I met with my Help Me Grow worker at the park and it was more. So it's, you know, about a year.

16
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.050
Richelle Direny: Time goes by.

17
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.450
Alyse: I know. But yeah, it's yeah it's but so i i'd say

18
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.260
Alyse: Hyphens about maybe July or something like that. So yeah, just about a year. But, uh,

19
00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.360
Alyse: I continue to pack my stuff, you know, like I was going to move out. And I think as once he saw more boxes.

20
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.820
Alyse: Coming up with more stuff being packed he I guess he took me seriously. And it freaked him out.

21
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.220
Richelle Direny: Oh, so you did that just to do that or you

22
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.450
Alyse: Know, I did it because I was really, I was really going to leave like I was like, listen.

23
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:33.150
Alyse: Obviously, whatever is going on between us isn't working. No more like you want to do whatever you're doing are going through a midlife crisis, and I'm not going to sit around and be treated like I'm a piece of shit when I know I'm not like

24
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.170
Alyse: The stuff around here between business and kids and this and that, like, kinda like

25
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.650
Alyse: The gift giving myself enough credit, like I caught myself. Short all the time on like how hard I work and the things I do

26
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.920
Alyse: And I only seem to remember this stuff. What I want to, like, this isn't a constant thing in my mind like I think because I get to that point of like

27
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.870
Alyse: spasming crying and this and that and feeling like life's over because it's like

28
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:20.340
Alyse: Hold on. First I'm letting somebody else like tell me what I do and don't do you know what I mean. And I know damn well that I work hard. I like to try to think, sometimes I don't. Or, you know, like I like i said i I set myself short a lot, but it's

29
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.690
Alyse: Like when I really sit down and think about it, it's like, damn, like, because if I wasn't here, he'd be paying somebody to do this stuff. You know what I mean.

30
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.440
Alyse: He'd be he'd have to find somebody that he trusted me and his house around all that stuff with his children, and so on and so forth.

31
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:43.560
Alyse: And you know, it's like I'm going to ask that, like, yeah, I mean, you might not get along. Sometimes whenever else but you're not going to tell me like that. I don't do this or I don't do that.

32
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.030
Alyse: And I just think that like you said. He goes, I felt like, um, you know, like

33
00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:01.980
Alyse: For I was like talking to my Help Me Grow burger. I said, You know, I like I used to do everything for that man like literally like shower his ass, Rochelle.

34
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.810
Alyse: Like everything and then once I had the babies and I had to take care of them.

35
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.030
Alyse: He didn't get any of that attention anymore. You know what I mean like that individually like that attention like I wasn't even sleeping downstairs. I didn't sleep downstairs for four months.

36
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:29.010
Alyse: So we, I guess he just he like he said the other day, he goes I felt like like I didn't need you for a little bit like I didn't need to. As much as I used to not like well, have fun thing and that's the way you act because that's turned on, on true

37
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.130
Alyse: I don't know, like

38
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.970
Everything seems to be fine.

39
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.920
Richelle Direny: Um, when it's all said and done, it is going to be

40
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.360
Richelle Direny: It is going to be

41
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.940
Richelle Direny: A situation where

42
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:05.880
Richelle Direny: Like we said the jealousy, which, as I've always said to you, everything like what would the the the arguments that you guys get into the fusses that you guys get into

43
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:14.790
Richelle Direny: A lot of it is coupled with guilt, um, you know, and it's not jealousy jealousy in the sense that

44
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:23.850
Richelle Direny: You know, in a relationship, the men can get jealous of the children because in their eyes, like you said they were getting all of this attention.

45
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:33.210
Richelle Direny: On interrupted attention. No one was taking your attention away from them. Now, children are involved, you're pouring everything about you in them.

46
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.830
Richelle Direny: And they're only getting maybe an hour if that most out of date of your time. So then they become very jealous of the children.

47
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.350
Richelle Direny: And it's not that they don't love the children. It's not that they're saying that you shouldn't, but it's just like

48
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.910
Richelle Direny: You know, in their minds do what they're seeing these that this child this individual this person.

49
00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:06.540
Richelle Direny: Is getting all of her attention. So just like a child who throws a tantrum. They eventually throws an adult size tantrum. You're looking at this adult sized tantrum and you say you should know better than like that.

50
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.700
Richelle Direny: But you have to look at. You remember like what I always say to you, don't just look at what is the behavior that is being presented in front of you.

51
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.370
Richelle Direny: Look what what is fueling that behavior.

52
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.840
Richelle Direny: What is where is the source of that behavior coming from what is causing all of that.

53
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:35.040
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like, even with the infidelity. You see him treating you a certain way, then when it comes down to the come down, you realize there is somebody else in the picture you are out there doing something. So if you make me feel

54
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.950
Richelle Direny: If you come in and you pick a fight with me. You make it all about me. I will never stop.

55
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.080
Richelle Direny: To pay attention to that.

56
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.580
Richelle Direny: You're doing your dirt and you got your thing going on. You will never stopped to think about that.

57
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:59.280
Richelle Direny: Simply because you're so focused on the behavior. The adult science tantrum, that is going on in front of you and you're only going to address what is going on in front of you, instead of stopping and saying, hold up.

58
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.160
Richelle Direny: Where is this really coming from because I know

59
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:12.690
Richelle Direny: I'm a damn good girlfriend. I know I'm a damn good mother not only to my children, but to your children as well. I'm a damn good housekeeper. I'm a good I'm good at all of but you know what

60
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:19.980
Richelle Direny: If I lower your self esteem and if I make you feel bad about everything that you're doing. You will never stop to do the

61
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.070
Richelle Direny: Printing and that's what's been going on.

62
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:31.470
Alyse: Yeah, because I mean not even that. I mean I guess I can see to where I'm like that. Like, I feel that same way I feel about a sign. I'm like dude.

63
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:39.660
Alyse: You work with your kid all day. You know, I mean you guys around each other from five in the morning until late and like

64
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:52.830
Alyse: You that You know what I mean. But you're calling him to go out to lunch with you when I haven't left the house, then you know what I mean, right. I can see where my wrong was cool, because the I love how I act like a week later I you should have known. This is how it's going to be

65
00:07:54.090 --> 00:08:02.250
Alyse: But it's like you know i i was the same way. Like that's, you know, a lot of this came to be a part of it on top of, like, you know,

66
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.460
Alyse: Whatever, it's like you're around your child all day. He's a grown ass man like

67
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.530
Alyse: What about me.

68
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:18.450
Alyse: You know, like, that's been a major problem and I have some huge resentment against the funding for whatever but

69
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.620
Richelle Direny: How's his son.

70
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.450
Alyse: Like 22 or something like that are grown ass man.

71
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.380
Alyse: Sorry, high

72
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.160
Richelle Direny: Water

73
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.420
Richelle Direny: What do you mean that you feel the same way about his son, and what was

74
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:41.490
Alyse: A while about like the attention you know like how he could feel that way. Maybe about the babies about like me and the attention with the baby.

75
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.830
Alyse: You know that, like, I'm not giving him enough all their contention, because I have two little human being. They can't care for themselves.

76
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:58.020
Alyse: Well, I look at it this way, you care for your son or not. And that means grown and he can care for himself. Like I just

77
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:09.420
Alyse: It's I can instill like I Can I catch myself like the booth and attitude when his name comes up, or he is around or this or that it just

78
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.430
Alyse: To me is like sodium annoying like we've the kid alone. He's

79
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.020
Alyse: You know,

80
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.020
Alyse: So I don't know.

81
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.010
Richelle Direny: I mean, as I said, you know, if, but then it's recognizing it

82
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.080
Richelle Direny: It's recognizing it and it's adjusting the behavior because it's one thing to

83
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.940
Richelle Direny: It's one thing to recognize it and adjust it. But you have to be aware of the behavior.

84
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.980
Richelle Direny: Um, you have, you have to really truly be aware of the

85
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.670
Behavior.

86
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:53.520
Richelle Direny: You know you're with his son, his son is hardly ever around. Is it that he's around all the time and he takes up all his time and energy with the sun. What is the story.

87
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.190
Alyse: Well, I mean, they work together. That's enough time spent in general.

88
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:15.900
Alyse: But then after work, you guys are going out to lines or on your days off, you're going to pick them up to have them go do this with you or that and now it's not even just the sun. It's a son's girlfriend, too. And it's just like, I mean, find some new friends or something like you're like,

89
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:17.910
Alyse: I just

90
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.540
Alyse: I just see it just too much. I don't know, I, I'm

91
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.550
Richelle Direny: Everything that we've ever

92
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:32.280
Richelle Direny: Totally fine and everything we've ever talked about, I've gone through, I have this question.

93
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.380
Richelle Direny: What can you say you have

94
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:43.890
Richelle Direny: Learned in this time or skills that you have gathered knowing what you know about yourself, knowing what you know about him.

95
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.040
Richelle Direny: What are some things that you can say that you can do to

96
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.910
Richelle Direny: To help you to get through.

97
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.490
Richelle Direny: These moments that you have with him.

98
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:16.260
Alyse: Or with how things have gone that I need to really separate myself. I, I feel that by your we are to use. Can you stop complaining about nothing.

99
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.870
Alyse: Sorry. Hold on, I'm

100
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:29.820
Alyse: Lord, sorry. I finally moved them into their bed after four months. So they've been sleeping like through the night, but they are up super early in the morning anymore.

101
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.130
Alyse: So I'm

102
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.440
Richelle Direny: You know, back in your bedroom.

103
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.060
Alyse: Yeah, I moved back downstairs. After, after almost five months.

104
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:51.390
Alyse: But it's, it's nice because I'm like last night. If I will know woke her up, she probably would have slept through the night again like they've been almost sleeping through the night, maybe waking up once for a bottle.

105
00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:12.030
Alyse: Oh, I'm catching up on sleep. I miss for a long time. Um, okay, so definitely he's he's too strong headed of a person. And so am I. Even if I'm wrong. If I'm right, it doesn't matter is if I get that, if I want to be right, I'm gonna make myself right one way or another. Right.

106
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:24.420
Alyse: And so, as he and we we go back and forth like it's just like that fire with a, you know, we still are a little bit of spit out a little bit of fuel in there and it gets bigger and bigger, bigger, and then it blows up.

107
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:36.810
Alyse: So I've come like I gotta separate myself either go to my mom's go to the store give myself a little bit of time to cool down. You know what I mean, because I started getting pissed off and I start

108
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:44.760
Alyse: Want to add to that fire. I don't even care what comes out of my mouth, but the truth is it's fake. It doesn't matter to me as long as I say something to hurt someone's feelings. I'm good.

109
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.160
Alyse: So definitely you know

110
00:12:48.450 --> 00:13:00.240
Alyse: We obviously can't talk very well. One more in bad moods are arguing so that space also gives us time to cool down. You know, I mean, because we can be

111
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.920
Alyse: This that whatever and then 20 minutes later, you know, talking normal like it's no problem.

112
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:20.010
Alyse: So it's really just like you said about recognizing either. I've had a bad day with the kids, I'm stressed out. I'm tired. He's had a long day he's this he's that so you're already quick to jump off the deep end.

113
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:27.060
Alyse: You know when you're in those types of moves to begin with. So it's really like it yourself. Right. Like the other day.

114
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:39.060
Alyse: I had a bad day with the kids and before he got home I like had to tell myself like okay at least like go I hid myself in the bathroom for a little bit. I let the babies cry for about a couple minutes, you know,

115
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:45.540
Alyse: As I was just over it for the day I got already Todd was short with everybody crabby

116
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:55.890
Alyse: Och myself in the bathroom for about 10 minutes put on my earbuds listen to some music, and I was fine fine enough for him to come home and not know that like I was having a bad day because

117
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:03.000
Alyse: I've learned after these almost three years that after a day of work. He doesn't want to come home and see me in a bad mood like

118
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.810
Alyse: If I'm in a bad mood when he gets home and just really ruins everything. So no matter from bad mood or not. I

119
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.920
Alyse: Put on my Levy's and you know it just

120
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:21.180
Alyse: Learn the things sometimes got to do to make the situation. Okay. At the end of the day, you know, like

121
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.230
Richelle Direny: Be the bigger person of all your time even though even though you're not your reaction to it is not saying

122
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:40.740
Richelle Direny: I agree, or you're just pretty much before the the forest goes ablaze. Your outing you're stopping the fire the forest from blazing. You know what I mean. And that's literally dude.

123
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:49.050
Richelle Direny: You're stopping yourself from ruining the rest of your day you're stopping yourself from ultimately snapping at the children.

124
00:14:49.440 --> 00:15:01.440
Richelle Direny: You're stopping yourself from the destruction, the possible destruction to this relationship because remember when you get an argument. It's not just about this one little itty bitty thing now you don't

125
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.120
Richelle Direny: Kiss me on number. Remember

126
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:14.250
Richelle Direny: What I didn't address what you were this morning, then a couple of weeks. Talk about last night. Oh, and remember, a week ago when you piss me off when I found out she was hooking up with that. Should we talking about now.

127
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:20.970
Richelle Direny: You see, you see, everything is going to come off because now you're it's like it's almost like

128
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:29.220
Richelle Direny: From a physiological standpoint, like, now you're it's almost like the pumping machine has started your blood is boiling

129
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:41.970
Richelle Direny: Every all the juices. Everything is turning within you and now you are fully charged. Now we're not now that you're upset. You're not walking away, my friend, you're staying here because you don't got me started.

130
00:15:42.480 --> 00:16:01.590
Richelle Direny: That's what choosing to let me ignore. Let me walk away. Let me calm down. Let me get level headed so that when I'm level headed and I could think straight. I could put my point across. Because going into a shouting match. It's not going to work and doing that's

131
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.400
Richelle Direny: Ultimately, and

132
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.120
Alyse: And the funny thing is you know how you're like,

133
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:16.710
Alyse: You know, to keep it going. And then so like he goes to walk away because he's like, I'm not doing it today. I'm not doing this argument I'm done with it. I'm like, oh, let me break the window because here if I break the window, then you'll stick around and play some more with me.

134
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.630
Alyse: You know, I mean, it's like, it's this disgusting cycle and

135
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:30.630
Alyse: Is and it's like even, even within the past few days, like, um, you know, our normal conversation and and you know you'll be like a

136
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:41.130
Alyse: You know he'll say something and I looked at him like I thought we were in talking about that. And he's like, well, there's nothing else to talk about. I'm like, get out of here. Like you have amazing we talk about any and everything all the time.

137
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:47.010
Alyse: You know what I mean, like, we're not two people that sit in a room and don't speak to each other. There's always something to talk about.

138
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.310
Alyse: It just steering away from like that negativity like like your

139
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.580
Richelle Direny: Arguments, the most

140
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:12.750
Alyse: I'm like, when I I mean I feel like it has it always boils down to something like either I'm stressed out with the kids. After weeks of not going anywhere, doing something. And I'm like, begging for the man's attention like Hey, hello, notice me

141
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.560
Alyse: Can I run with you to Home Depot. Can I, you know what I mean.

142
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.810
Alyse: For me it's just about that attention factor.

143
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.680
Alyse: All I really need you to do every now and then is, hey, you're doing a good job.

144
00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:31.920
Alyse: Or hey I appreciate you, you don't. Not the OH here, let me bring you home. This or let me buy you this. I don't care about that. It's just the simple acknowledgement of

145
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:41.880
Alyse: Hey, I see you and I know that you're trying or, you know, like this whole thing was school when I originally told him I was going to school. He was like pissed off about it.

146
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.240
Alyse: When did you see. And when I started

147
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.040
Alyse: I started to say

148
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.890
Alyse: Okay, um,

149
00:17:51.120 --> 00:18:01.170
Alyse: And you know, when I told him last week about it. He's been pissed off. And then, you know, when we started when we, you know, started talking and passionate thing up things up. He's like, I thought

150
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.660
Alyse: You know, he's like, I just want to tell you I'm proud of you. And I was like, what, and he's like, yeah, he goes

151
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:19.230
Alyse: You know, I just thought that maybe you were trying to get it, you know, go to college and better yourself and leave me and I'm like really like it's not even about that. It's about trying to better myself and then trying to help you out.

152
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.700
Richelle Direny: But in that moment. So okay, so these I'm teaching

153
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.340
Alyse: This okay okay teacher

154
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:33.270
Richelle Direny: In that moment, what spoke loudest, not the content. But what was speaking the loudest in that moment.

155
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.690
Alyse: What is recognition. Oh, I don't, I don't know what

156
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.920
Richelle Direny: Will you think spoke the law I he said I thought

157
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.240
Richelle Direny: Oh,

158
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.530
Alyse: You're gonna leave me.

159
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:59.850
Richelle Direny: You're going to leave. You're going to better yourself and now you're going to leave me. What do you think spoke about is right there, which makes me think that's what speaks loud. That's what speaks very loud in a lot of your arguments.

160
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.520
Alyse: Like the, the better yourself.

161
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.380
Alyse: Believe you

162
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:10.680
Richelle Direny: Know he thinks that you're going to better yourself from where you are right now what you're doing right now.

163
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.500
Richelle Direny: And he is going

164
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.270
Richelle Direny: You're going to leave him.

165
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.570
Richelle Direny: So you're going to get better than him. And you're going to leave.

166
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.400
Richelle Direny: What word

167
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:22.710
Alyse: Better

168
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.720
Alyse: You're speaking is

169
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:30.210
Alyse: Purity. Oh, oh, I didn't know where we're going with that. Yeah, I

170
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.190
Alyse: Mean, because that says like as soon as he said that I thought in my head like

171
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:44.700
Alyse: Really because my mom always says he's very insecure person, but he carries himself with such a hard way. You know what I mean, but

172
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.670
Richelle Direny: I can mask it

173
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:56.910
Richelle Direny: You're. That's what I'm saying what I'm teaching you remember we started off with, you have to understand what fuels of persons rage.

174
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:17.580
Richelle Direny: Don't go. It was just in front of you. What is fueling it from behind what is giving it the strength, a car can a car has no power if you put no gas in it and step on the gas to fuel it to push it forward. Think about that he is. It sounds to me what you're saying is, he's very insecure.

175
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:28.440
Richelle Direny: And so fear for for everything he's done. He gets into these little petty arguments these arguments that for you. You're like, What were you coming from with this.

176
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.180
Richelle Direny: He's very insecure. So even though you keep telling him Harrell.

177
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:48.660
Richelle Direny: I love you. I love you, that I'm putting up with your crap you're doing all the things that you're doing on the outside. I'm taking care. I'm still even home taking care of your kids. What makes you think that I am not going to still love you, and stay here.

178
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.170
Richelle Direny: Did he asked you to marry him. At one point,

179
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.700
Richelle Direny: Yep. So then

180
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:15.060
Richelle Direny: For him because he's so insecure insecurities is not allowing him to see all the things that you are doing to say that whatever it is that I'm doing. It's not just for me, but it's for us all. BECAUSE HE'S SO INSULTING

181
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.900
Richelle Direny: You understand the thing everything he does. It's because

182
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:26.460
Richelle Direny: Of insecurity. He's so insecure of himself. He thinks that. So even in

183
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:36.690
Richelle Direny: Calling you names or putting you down and saying, oh, you know, get out and this that and the other. But Oh forget it. I don't want you to get out all of it is his insecurities.

184
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:47.610
Richelle Direny: He feels like he's not, he's not worthy. And he feels like one day you're going to go out, you're going to find somebody better than him. You're going to be all of that is his insecurity.

185
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.540
Alyse: Sounds about right. It makes sense. Definitely really does.

186
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:10.260
Richelle Direny: So when you sit in here. It's like you're trying to have this logical conversation with a person who their insecurity is so much that they have no way of making that penetrate into their brain like

187
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.460
Alyse: Like what I don't like. They hear it but the candor China.

188
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:23.460
Richelle Direny: Did you hear it but they can't, it's two things I can hear what you're saying, but you have to, you have to ask the question. Do you understand what I'm saying.

189
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:41.010
Richelle Direny: Well yeah okay if you understand. Tell me what you understand because now you know how deep you get with the conversation how far you go with the conversation or or even if you have to kind of reel it back and find a different way, so they can understand what it is that you're saying

190
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.970
Richelle Direny: He knows what he has

191
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.480
Richelle Direny: He knows what he has

192
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:59.070
Richelle Direny: And he doesn't want to lose it. So he finds different way to make you feel less than at all times.

193
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:20.880
Alyse: You know, Mike. Mike said this to me the other day and she said she said when we guarantee me. Whoa, this week. He loves you. She goes, You just like swimming. You feel like you're less than like makes you feel like you're not worthy or not worth anything. So he has control over yet.

194
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.270
Richelle Direny: That's a person who is so

195
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:24.870
Insecure

196
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:32.100
Richelle Direny: A person who is so insecure himself because guess what if I make you feel remember feel

197
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:43.920
Richelle Direny: If I make you feel like this and if I make that feeling so big and so prevalent in so that it that you can't see past how you feel, guess what.

198
00:23:44.670 --> 00:24:00.180
Richelle Direny: You will never strive to do better. You will never strive to want more because you sit in this mode of depression you sit in this mode of i can't i can't do any better than out for myself. Think about a person who is in a domestic violent relationship.

199
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.630
Richelle Direny: It's all about power and control.

200
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.270
Richelle Direny: It's all about

201
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.220
Alyse: Believe

202
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.860
Richelle Direny: You I make you believe it. Yeah, yeah.

203
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.200
Richelle Direny: You know you all believe it, but if I

204
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.350
Richelle Direny: Put enough if I say it enough, you start to believe it.

205
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:27.270
Alyse: Yep, yep, yep, yep. Been there, done that yet. It just went extinct upon you in a different form or in a different way. You don't quite catch it, you know, I mean,

206
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:34.260
Richelle Direny: You always have the best in everything I do. I have to be creative donor, if I'm a scheme, you know,

207
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:40.380
Richelle Direny: I see if it's never gonna feed them steal from you. The same way you don't always have to come up with a way

208
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.570
Alyse: That's true, that's true.

209
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:56.550
Richelle Direny: If the first one. He came through the front door and he got you the second time he gonna find the side door and then eventually you gonna say, All right, well, we can't be walking through this door. We don't have to find another way

210
00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:58.530
Richelle Direny: To get him. Yeah.

211
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:00.570
Richelle Direny: So,

212
00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.520
Richelle Direny: Go ahead.

213
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:13.620
Alyse: So, I mean, obviously that's not my. It's not my place to work on his insecurities. That's not my my doing great, but

214
00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.530
Richelle Direny: You stroking

215
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:21.180
Alyse: Memories that

216
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:28.590
Richelle Direny: You can't. You can't fix a person who doesn't want to necessarily be fixed. All you can do is do what you're doing and

217
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.020
Richelle Direny: Do what you're doing because you're not doing anything to make him feel otherwise.

218
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:44.010
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, I always tell you. You remember in the beginning, and you've tried it once, and you said you actually had success. It's like you speak to his ego.

219
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:55.920
Richelle Direny: You tell him you speak life into him and say, hey, Harold. You know, you're a good dad you're this, you're that you speak to him in that sense where he's like, hold up, what's going on here.

220
00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.680
Richelle Direny: What you want you going back to school and saying, what is it that you said you were going to go to school for again.

221
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.790
cosmetology

222
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.730
Alyse: No, no, no, my associates of science and business administration.

223
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.210
Richelle Direny: Okay, in what you're doing now like even running the business.

224
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.670
Alyse: Yeah, pretty much.

225
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.440
Richelle Direny: Okay, so

226
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:23.670
Alyse: Just kind of teaching me better and and learning. You know, like I'm learning about insurance right now.

227
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.310
Richelle Direny: I'm trying to put out a man

228
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.070
Richelle Direny: Look, so

229
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.800
Richelle Direny: You have a business.

230
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:46.710
Richelle Direny: That you're helping him you're doing the administrative part of the business, right, because the way you explained it to me is that you do. He does the work. But you do the books and you do every you handle everything else. Right.

231
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.510
Alyse: Yeah.

232
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:57.510
Richelle Direny: I don't know if it's because you're you're where you are. You seem to every move. You're, you're freezing like your connection is not that great.

233
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:58.110
Oh,

234
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.350
Alyse: I just, I don't want to be around.

235
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.630
Alyse: Kid down here.

236
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.600
Richelle Direny: Okay, no.

237
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:20.100
Richelle Direny: Now with what you're saying this is what you do for the business. So you say you guys have a roofing company and you pretty much, you take care of everything else he pretty much just goes out, he gets the orders and he goes out and he does the job right.

238
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.970
Alyse: When

239
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.150
Richelle Direny: The guys come to you, you cut the check and you do all of that.

240
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.140
Alyse: Yep.

241
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:34.890
Richelle Direny: All you're doing is just, Hey, well we have a business together. So I thought it best for me to understand how to run the business from the administrative and

242
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:46.020
Richelle Direny: I'm just going to school, just to get a degree and to get better understanding of how to run this business at the end of the day, it's not benefiting me it's benefiting both of us. And this business that we're building

243
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:52.110
Alyse: And and that's the first thing I said when we started talking. It's a, you know, I just want to say, you know, I'm proud of you.

244
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:59.040
Alyse: And I hope that you understand I'm doing this because it's going to do nothing but better when when roofing Link, it's going to

245
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:08.010
Alyse: Teach me the proper things I need to know and therefore I can start off, you know, doing this properly, and then I can go back to school for like a bachelor's in business, you know,

246
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:19.980
Alyse: Like I'm just trying to do a little bit of something, you know, like, to me it's like I've overcome so much. I just want to damn college degree. I don't care what kind of college degree don't care how I get it, don't care what

247
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:28.860
Alyse: bachelor's, master's, whatever. Just give me something, and I'll be happy for now. You know what I mean, that's like my that next accomplishment for me.

248
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.570
Alyse: Um, and I was like, that's all I want to do is make it better for us.

249
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.630
Richelle Direny: And how did he respond to that.

250
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:46.770
Alyse: These. Oh. Oh, I thought, and that's when he started with the. I thought you were going to do this to get better and leaving. And I'm like, No. I said Harold.

251
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:54.030
Alyse: Why don't you get, I will spend the rest of my life with you and if I'm able to, that's my point life. I'm not trying to

252
00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:09.090
Alyse: I don't want to be with anybody else. I don't want to go soul search and I don't want to find this. You know what I mean. And I mean, I'm sure. Like, he says, that's me alive on Earth. My life with you. It kind of goes in one ear and out the other. Because, you know, it's hard to believe. Sometimes

253
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.620
Alyse: You know,

254
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:15.180
Richelle Direny: I think he has his own. I think he has his own demons that he's battling

255
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.830
Richelle Direny: With a different place.

256
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.070
Richelle Direny: You remember he has a lot of grief and loss, the loss is loss of his mother.

257
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:31.500
Richelle Direny: Here it is that he's raising his children had their mother is not involved in, even though you're helping and you're doing what you're doing.

258
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:39.150
Richelle Direny: They're still that dealing with his children and everything that they're going through, internally, because their mother is strung out on drugs.

259
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:51.960
Richelle Direny: There's a whole lot. I'm sure there's things from his past part which is part of the reason why he's in such denial about the his alcohol use, and what he uses to cope with it.

260
00:29:52.440 --> 00:30:07.350
Richelle Direny: I mean there's dairies he's having to work to be able to take care of you and six children. So there's a whole lot on his mind, not knowing how to effectively coping cope with that. And did you, did he, what did he grow up with a father.

261
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.690
Alyse: Figure. No, no, no.

262
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.670
Richelle Direny: That's another big deal then

263
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:18.750
Alyse: The one that was there that step father beat them. I mean ball I taught yeah beat him for years and then Harold beacons, so

264
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:25.800
Alyse: It was, yeah. He had a really messed up childhood, I'd say, I thought, mine was bad. My God.

265
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.910
Richelle Direny: So you're dealing with a broken individual

266
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.320
Alyse: Yeah, I didn't say

267
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:32.400
Alyse: Merely

268
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.000
Richelle Direny: It who fails to admit that he's broken on the inside.

269
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:37.290
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

270
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.230
Alyse: That yeah yeah

271
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.390
Richelle Direny: So he he. I mean, and I'm not by any means, telling you to condone

272
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.010
Richelle Direny: certain behaviors.

273
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.280
Richelle Direny: But Aaron knows that he doesn't want to

274
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.970
Alyse: Yeah, I mean I guess like yesterday, I believe that, too, like I

275
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.610
Richelle Direny: Give you know, listen, you might woman at home.

276
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.560
Richelle Direny: She just my thought on the street.

277
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.170
Richelle Direny: But that doesn't mean that I'm okay.

278
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:19.230
Richelle Direny: I'm going because then I'm leaving myself open to you giving me any crap. You know, so he knows that he doesn't want to leave. I think that because he's so good. He's so insecure, he feels that

279
00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:33.210
Richelle Direny: To find happiness, he needs to do these things that he's doing it also tells me that Harold doesn't have anybody supportive or positive in his life to tell him, yo. I mean, I know what you're doing. But you need to stop.

280
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.070
Alyse: Yeah.

281
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.200
Alyse: Barely do

282
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:48.450
Richelle Direny: Who's those positive people, men whose those other positive men in his life male figures that says to him.

283
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.790
Richelle Direny: You're going down a bad

284
00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:51.180
Alyse: Path.

285
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.680
Richelle Direny: You're about to lose everything.

286
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.950
Alyse: Yeah, I mean, doesn't have any really there might be one or two, but they're not

287
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:10.170
Alyse: Anything special. I mean, then, for him. He's a grown ass man. He's a, you know, and that's the thing. It's hard. It's like you can't teach like you can't teach an old dog new tricks kind of thing.

288
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:18.870
Alyse: That man is set in his ways, period. He is the way he is whatever he's been railroaded many times of for by women.

289
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:26.640
Alyse: Children's mothers ex girlfriends, whatever, you know, like that's why he is like the way he is with his stuff like

290
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:36.000
Alyse: Like the last lady of the last row. He was what he was willing for like five years and he was at work, she ended up like

291
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:45.090
Alyse: Sneaking money from the account and like saved up like 70 $500 brought a U Haul and cleared out the whole house like

292
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:53.730
Alyse: Like took everything. And this is his kids house like this is his house like he has his in my house. But at the end of day. This is this man's house. And this is just me and stuff. You know what I mean.

293
00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.060
Richelle Direny: So somebody in this house they cleared out everything

294
00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:05.820
Alyse: Yeah, everything that was here, gone. I mean, from pots to like washing powders, said she, improves the furniture.

295
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.120
Richelle Direny: If she was able to do that in the day.

296
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:17.580
Alyse: He was at work, and he goes to work at five in the morning and he's gone until you know whatever time depending on what they're doing. So it's possible.

297
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.760
Alyse: But it's like, you know what I mean. That's why he's so like

298
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.730
Alyse: Watch you overweight his money, you know,

299
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:32.790
Alyse: And then certain things like you know he'll say this, that, and my money. This is I've been with you for two years. I asked you for damn tampons.

300
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:39.180
Alyse: That is, they can have money for can bond climb money for that. You know what I mean, like, I just don't go free range shit.

301
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:48.390
Alyse: Because it's I still look at it as purely it's not mine. It's just, and he hates that more than anything. When I asked for stuff. And I'm like, well,

302
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:59.670
Alyse: I guess partially you shouldn't treat me the way you do when it comes to money. I've never taken a penny from you, you know, I mean, then, once he found out I was on Xbox. And I was like, Oh, you're stealing from me. I'm like, what

303
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:07.320
Alyse: Why would I be stealing from you, Link. You know, that's just was his little things.

304
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.420
Richelle Direny: At one point, this he he rested.

305
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:18.480
Alyse: Yeah, well I guess he thinks, because I'm on them that I must be on other stuff or something like that. And so therefore, I was like, listen.

306
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:29.970
Alyse: I can track every penny of whatever. I mean, to me, I can piss away $100 in a day, like it's nothing. That's just life guy go to the store to dollar tree and I can spend $100 just I'm stupid shit.

307
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:35.370
Alyse: You know, like I don't I track everything I track you can look at my bank account, everything

308
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:44.610
Alyse: And that's what pisses me off is like, I hate when somebody I hate when you try to act like I'm not trustworthy like I've done something wrong. See him in that way. Yes, I've lied to you I'm sorry about that.

309
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:50.910
Alyse: And I already knew this was going to be a thing. Remember I told you. Oh, he's gonna say I learned about this. What else did I lie about

310
00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:51.930
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

311
00:34:52.410 --> 00:35:07.320
Alyse: And it's like I and I specifically lied to you about this because of your reaction that I'm getting now that I knew. I've gotten and and that wasn't fair like that's not fair to pass that judgment on yours or to think like that of me because of whatever but um

312
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:25.440
Alyse: He's just, he's very like it's a control and his control it. So it all revolves around control and I let him have that control. And when I try to take control back. I've noticed is when there becomes a little bit of a problem.

313
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.760
Richelle Direny: You know, that's why I'm trying

314
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.490
Richelle Direny: To take the control some. I mean, don't try to

315
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.630
Alyse: Have to like get my own control correct like

316
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:40.470
Alyse: Findings, I can be in control over right like like the man have some control. He's the man. That's what they did.

317
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:50.070
Richelle Direny: At the end of the day, he's a man and by design by nature. A man is in control, no matter how much we want to think that they're not

318
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:58.500
Richelle Direny: A man is always in control, no matter how much you have this woman movement to say we're all equal. We're not

319
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.690
Richelle Direny: A man is all control. That's just how it's designed for a man to be in

320
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:17.790
Richelle Direny: Naturally, a man a stronger than a woman in many different ways. You're his evil. You're there to help him. You're there to encourage him, you're there to speak life into him.

321
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:28.290
Richelle Direny: And he's there to protect you. He's there to push to shelter you to provide for you, like, That's the role for a man and a woman in naturally

322
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:43.710
Richelle Direny: The same time when he seeks to launch control. Now, that's when he lose sight of what naturally. He was made for because now you're trying to get too much control. Now you're trying to dictate every aspect of my life.

323
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:54.600
Richelle Direny: And that's not right. How can I speak life into you. How can I encourage you, how can I do the things that I need to do in my role as a woman, when you take all of it away from me.

324
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.040
Richelle Direny: To say I'm frozen or you're frozen.

325
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:10.830
Alyse: Know somebody tried to call I thought were there painting. I thought the unplugged the Wi Fi box but trying to call in like pros, the phone.

326
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So did you hear what what what when

327
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.500
Alyse: I got the

328
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.180
Alyse: The dictate part

329
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.870
Richelle Direny: Well, now I was saying that when they're trying to

330
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:31.320
Richelle Direny: dictate to you, basically. So it was I said a man is always in control, naturally, a man will always be in control.

331
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:47.370
Richelle Direny: No matter how much we try to take that from them. A man will always be in control. We have to come to some place where we understand that and we accept how nature was designed it to be for a man and a woman, a woman is there to encourage

332
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:59.280
Richelle Direny: To support to speak life into them. If a woman is there to do what you're not what you're doing, naturally. What comes naturally to you is to help them.

333
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:06.240
Richelle Direny: You're the host, the one that you tend to the house. That's why children always comes come to you before they go to their dad.

334
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:13.110
Richelle Direny: That's why children are more drawn to you because when it comes on to this castle. He builds the castle.

335
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:21.930
Richelle Direny: He puts you in the children in the castle you maintain the castle and everything in it that's naturally what comes to you.

336
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:33.930
Richelle Direny: What naturally that comes to him is to build it and to maintain its four walls and to ensure anything that you say you want. Naturally he tries to figure out

337
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:43.140
Richelle Direny: I need to be able to provide this to her everything she says she needs. I need to figure it out. What overwhelms them is when

338
00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:49.080
Richelle Direny: They can't and they don't know how to. And so they get really stressed because oh my god

339
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:59.370
Richelle Direny: Elise she needs a, b, c, d. How am I going to provide it for her. The children are this, how am I going to do this. That's what comes naturally for them to do for you.

340
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:09.960
Richelle Direny: You now you're the thinker. You're the one that you think about everything you try to sort out everything and you can do that all in one minute that it's going to take him a couple days to try to figure it out.

341
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.910
Richelle Direny: You're like, he says, at least I don't know you hurry up and you think about something, you're saying our hair.

342
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:24.780
Richelle Direny: How about we try this. So you speak life into him you encourage him you empower him and he goes out there and he tries to if you've ever watched movies.

343
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:40.050
Richelle Direny: Like with kingdoms and all the different things naturally that you'll see, that's exactly what they do. Um, but this is this is how, if you've ever watched what was that show that my husband used to watch. I thought it was a little weird, King of France.

344
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.030
Alyse: Oh, I know your

345
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.250
Richelle Direny: Game of Thrones.

346
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.700
Richelle Direny: Yes, but just like if you look how everything

347
00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:55.740
Richelle Direny: The king always went to the queen, the Queen, they don't show you all the time, but the queen always encourages and tells them what to do, and help them to process it.

348
00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:06.060
Richelle Direny: Before they laid out the law that's naturally what we're made to do so, therefore, when a man tries to take and absorb all the power away from you.

349
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:23.280
Richelle Direny: They try to take away what's naturally belongs to you. Then what happens, they start to fall apart because what am I gonna do with all this power. What am I gonna do with all this power I can how can I handle all this power because half of that stuff wasn't meant for you to have

350
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:31.200
Richelle Direny: It really truly wasn't meant for you to have. I am as a woman, I'm only given so much power and control.

351
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.770
Richelle Direny: As a man, you're only given so much power and

352
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:42.270
Richelle Direny: Control the reason why I have it as a woman, and you have it as a woman, so that together we can be a powerhouse.

353
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.390
Richelle Direny: To maintain all of that we've built

354
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.440
Richelle Direny: We lose sight of that sometimes

355
00:40:49.830 --> 00:41:02.490
Richelle Direny: Yeah, because of what society. So maybe for you in you speaking to him and trying to encourage him is for you to let you know. Together we can be a powerhouse.

356
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:08.640
Richelle Direny: That's what I'm wanting to work towards together. Let's be a powerhouse.

357
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:18.330
Richelle Direny: I do what I do on this and you do what you do on that and I don't want to necessarily go out there and stand on the roof and try to do what you do. I don't

358
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:27.570
Richelle Direny: But I like the business end of it. And I like to maintain that he doesn't want to come home and having to take care of everything in the house.

359
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.610
Richelle Direny: Naturally, you do that.

360
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:31.590
Richelle Direny: All I'm saying is Harrell.

361
00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:43.680
Richelle Direny: You're doing what you're doing. And that's overwhelming and I listen I give you a whole lot of props you out there getting baked in the sun, your stress. You're tired, you're this I'm home little

362
00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.870
Richelle Direny: Notes and everything.

363
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.800
Alyse: So,

364
00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.770
Richelle Direny: Him to come together maybe once a week.

365
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.210
Richelle Direny: Every other week.

366
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:57.960
Richelle Direny: And let's together just remind ourselves what we mean to each other and how important each of our roles.

367
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.320
Alyse: Yeah.

368
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:03.780
Richelle Direny: It's a hard thing to sell to him.

369
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:24.870
Alyse: It is, but then in that. And that's where that comes in with, you know, like I where I started to feel not appreciated is after you know naming a few weeks you know you doing you I DO ME. WE DO EACH OTHER together, but we can't do each other together outside the house.

370
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:37.590
Alyse: You know, I just come over overwhelmed with it because it's just a lot. It really is between not just the kids, but just stuff going around in here and you know all this other songs and got it.

371
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:49.410
Alyse: Now I'm trying to fit school into this and it's like, and I'm always trying to better and I can't seem to me at least better. So I get frustrated with myself. You know what I mean.

372
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:50.880
Alyse: Like

373
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.430
Richelle Direny: You know what, just attend to my you said that you grew up.

374
00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.790
Richelle Direny: Though your parents were were addicts in your

375
00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:00.450
Richelle Direny: Own way.

376
00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:02.730
Richelle Direny: You grew up with your mom and dad right

377
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:13.410
Alyse: Yeah, but I grew up in a you know they're alcoholics their attics, they were fighting. I mean, a lot of times I guess in my childhood I wish they would have split the hell up.

378
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.070
Richelle Direny: Because

379
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:23.430
Alyse: You know, it was just like a never ending say I mean even to this day at 32 years old, my parents been married for 40 years and they're miserable is how the other

380
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:28.050
Alyse: Whatever because people

381
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.420
Richelle Direny: When you compare that to Harold

382
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:31.590
Oh,

383
00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.270
Alyse: That probably would have been like a fairy tale Liam, you know, I mean,

384
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.150
Richelle Direny: But because his was worse, right.

385
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:44.580
Richelle Direny: Yeah, when his biological. But remember, this is you're seeing this, but this is your

386
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.150
Richelle Direny: biological mother and father who are still together to this day.

387
00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:51.540
Richelle Direny: No matter how dysfunctional. They may be

388
00:43:53.490 --> 00:44:00.240
Richelle Direny: I'm sure after 42 years, you were saying, Hey, you guys need to split up and they're saying, What are you talking about, this is our. This is we're okay.

389
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.890
Alyse: Yeah yeah

390
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:11.460
Richelle Direny: But, Harold. Did you get that. Yeah, it was a mom and whatever man that was in house that was not his biological father

391
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:24.120
Richelle Direny: Because when it's all said and done as much as his children respect to you, whenever they want to. You're not their biological mom. So the connection is different.

392
00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:33.690
Richelle Direny: The appreciation is different. It's going to take a while for them to get to that point where they now look at you and say,

393
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:42.750
Richelle Direny: Even though you're not my biological mom you've taught me a, b, and c. And for that, I love you and I respect you and now take away

394
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:54.270
Richelle Direny: The step mom from it and just look at you as Mom, it's going to take a while for you to for them to get there because innately we are drawn to who we know we're connected to from in the wound.

395
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.960
Alyse: You understand, yes.

396
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.820
Richelle Direny: So that's what it is. He, he has no idea

397
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.070
Richelle Direny: What it looks like

398
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.850
Richelle Direny: To be in a in a loving home when a mom and a dad.

399
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.380
Alyse: Yeah yeah

400
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.170
Alyse: I guess even says

401
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:19.800
Alyse: He'll even say like, I don't, I don't want my parent my children growing up late. That's why he works. He doesn't does what he does, because he doesn't want his

402
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:34.380
Alyse: children growing up the way that financially like that way. But also, in a way, in the sense that, like he doesn't want them to live in a household. That's always always arguing or that's always violence or there's always alcohol or there's always you know what I mean, like,

403
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.250
Richelle Direny: But then he's doing some of it. He's doing the exact thing that he doesn't want. Yeah.

404
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.030
Alyse: Yep.

405
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:45.390
Richelle Direny: But you're still blinded by one year so blinded that you don't realize, so it's so it's

406
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:55.860
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes we say I want to, I want to raise up my own family, very different from what I grew up. Well, you are kind of doing the exact same thing.

407
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.950
Alyse: That you want to do can't give what you haven't been shown

408
00:45:59.130 --> 00:45:59.670
Alyse: So,

409
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:10.410
Richelle Direny: You can't. But that is but also how about you stop and look at what is it about your family that you didn't like growing on and that's what you change.

410
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:24.360
Richelle Direny: When you make it very general and you're trying to change the whole thing, you end up doing the exact same thing in comparison to looking at what you didn't like. And that's what you focus on changing

411
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:31.020
Alyse: That's weird. I'm glad. Thank you for saying that if I took one thing away from that. That's this is what I will be right there.

412
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:43.650
Alyse: Because I've always wondered like the whole general like I've always said that, like, I don't want my son, growing up, like, you know, I mean the are doing this. And then if you ask Xavier it's we argue all the time, constantly which isn't true.

413
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.800
Alyse: But, you know, kids only see whatever but it's like

414
00:46:47.370 --> 00:47:02.160
Alyse: I guess I've never looked at it that way, it's, it's like to specify something and work on that, you know, you mean like, Oh, well I wasn't shown much affection. Okay, so then therefore I concentrate on that and then do instead of looking at the whole picture that was over so awful.

415
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.900
Richelle Direny: And it wasn't going god awful. It wasn't because you know

416
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:17.850
Richelle Direny: You could, you could sit there and say there are good things about your parents. There are good things about their parents, their good things that they did, but you have to focus on what was it that you really didn't like

417
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.930
Alyse: Yeah, yeah. Just because that one thing. Everything was horrible, which isn't true, but

418
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:23.580
Alyse: That's not fair.

419
00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.020
Alyse: Actually, it's not fair.

420
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.000
Alyse: It's not fair. No.

421
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:31.080
Richelle Direny: Because there were so god awful but yet you still around them.

422
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:43.860
Alyse: You still and and in the plane thing. It's like, I'll even say like, Oh, and my childhood like was shitty and my mom looked at will look at me like white yeah your childhood your childhood was so shitty Elise and I'm like,

423
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:58.650
Alyse: Well, how are you not seeing what I saw. Oh yeah, you were high level time. But that's not even if it's just a little things that I pick through that makes everything so bad. Whereas you know like there's kids that go through way worse and children and

424
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:04.080
Alyse: Then I'm sitting back talking about my horrible life of their life's really bad. So, I get it. Yeah.

425
00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:10.860
Richelle Direny: Everybody has a story to tell, but it's amazing. And there's no one that can see here and say that they had a perfect

426
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.880
Alyse: Childhood

427
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.800
Richelle Direny: Because there's something in it.

428
00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.670
Alyse: That you like

429
00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.340
Richelle Direny: Like, like I always

430
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:23.070
Richelle Direny: Where we as parents we say, Oh, you're going to eat your vegetables and because it's good for you.

431
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.820
Richelle Direny: And then you said behold of when you you don't even like investing

432
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.300
Richelle Direny: Or you give something to oh

433
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:37.260
Richelle Direny: No, I don't like that. Why you don't like that because when I was little, I was forced to eat it.

434
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:37.860
Richelle Direny: So why are you

435
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.460
Richelle Direny: Why are you forcing these children to do what you don't even like to do

436
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.170
Alyse: When so funny.

437
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.060
Richelle Direny: So that's how you

438
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.340
Richelle Direny: That's how you find that one thing

439
00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:53.040
Richelle Direny: That you know even to this day, you still when you think about it, you hate it. That's what you work on

440
00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:59.670
Alyse: Don't want my children hearing and be like, Oh, look at this. This is the easy pass right there me

441
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.790
Alyse: For sure.

442
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.820
Richelle Direny: That's what you, that's what you look at. That's, that's how you you work.

443
00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:12.090
Richelle Direny: On changing and you once you've mastered that skill.

444
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:18.810
Richelle Direny: But honestly I think at some point in time, he will have to come to that place where

445
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:22.470
Richelle Direny: He, he needs to get help.

446
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:27.210
Alyse: Yeah he does it. I mean, it's gonna happen, happen. I mean,

447
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:36.360
Alyse: Listen. Nobody's perfect. No relationships. Perfect. But if you're able to point out where you need help and you're willing to try to help it, and why not you know i mean like

448
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:43.530
Alyse: I know he's a busy man and I know the first thing that you know isn't thinking about, it's all hey let's get some counseling or something but

449
00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:49.500
Alyse: If you want a relationship to work and you want it to work properly. You have to put in the effort.

450
00:49:49.980 --> 00:50:01.050
Alyse: And in this case, the effort is me going to get some counseling, so we can learn how to talk to each other better so we can understand that. Oh, we can identify this is one of our problems. We need to work on this.

451
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:15.150
Alyse: It's like, you know, try it, just trying to be like something with something, you know, it's it when he wants to do what he'll do it. Until then, it's what it is when we work our way around it and figure out how to do it on its own. You know what I mean.

452
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:19.080
Richelle Direny: And it is going to take a while so that it takes men some time.

453
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:20.970
Richelle Direny: Hunger

454
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.780
Richelle Direny: To get to that place of being willing to speak.

455
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.010
Alyse: Yeah, because, you know, like it's

456
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:37.110
Alyse: It's hard, so you know when the I try like he started, he said something the other day is like, well,

457
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:47.820
Alyse: Like you started being more like touchy feely, and I'm just, I was like, kind of weirded out because in general on the very affectionate person, but since I've been with him.

458
00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:53.730
Alyse: And he's not affectionate like he's not physical. You know, unless you're just having sex with something

459
00:50:54.360 --> 00:51:01.260
Alyse: So like he started like rubbing my leg, the other day and I like went to like back off from of, like, what are you doing, but then I taught myself, like, hold on.

460
00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.690
Alyse: You're gonna like he's going to take that the wrong way.

461
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:14.550
Alyse: And I even had to tell him like, Listen, I'm not trying to senior and it just is a little different for me. We've had together for two years. You never want to rub my leg or kiss me out of nowhere. You know what I mean.

462
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:23.250
Alyse: So for me, those things are boring. That's weird. I don't. It's just going to take me you know a little bit to acclimate and I'll be fine. But don't take it the wrong way.

463
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:31.590
Alyse: And I even hesitated saying something like that because I don't want him to, you know, I don't want him to think I'm doubting him like I tried to

464
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:37.230
Alyse: Think before words come out of my mouth anymore because I don't want to interrupt what's going on.

465
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:50.430
Alyse: I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, or the one that this like I he said something about not being the cell phone bills and I like my heart drop and I'm like oh my god already paid. I'm like, he's gonna freak out. You know what, at least like stop worrying so much

466
00:51:51.480 --> 00:52:01.560
Alyse: You know what I mean, like, I'm always worried about what somebody's going to think what something's gonna stay how they're going to ask how I'm going to make them feel when I should be worrying about how I make myself feel, me, me, me, me.

467
00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:06.840
Alyse: Like there's time to be selfish and there's times not to be selfish and I always screw that up.

468
00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:11.910
Richelle Direny: You could do. You could do your own counseling session. From now on, my friend.

469
00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:15.390
Alyse: You're my counsel you tell me about the life for so

470
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:16.710
Alyse: How's Florida.

471
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.230
Alyse: You having problems with them four legged creatures.

472
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:25.830
Richelle Direny: You know, I haven't really seen much I'm not, I'm not trying to go out here to see you.

473
00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:26.940
Richelle Direny: Here they're probably

474
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.120
Richelle Direny: Mean that one picture. Oh, yeah.

475
00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.230
Richelle Direny: Actual video

476
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:42.510
Alyse: Yes, I saw, I was I was literally I just screenshot, because I would lend me tendency like that. I'm like, Okay, I was like I had to, because we have eyes. I was like, listen. That's why I know they're listening in on us.

477
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:49.920
Alyse: How is How funny is that that we just talked about that, then I opened up my Facebook. And that's the first shift that's on there is an iguana crawling up a man

478
00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:53.250
Richelle Direny: I think that's what that one was a bearded dragon, wasn't it

479
00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:56.040
Alyse: I think so, yeah, yeah.

480
00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.750
Richelle Direny: That one was a beard. It does, and then

481
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:01.560
Richelle Direny: What I've seen the video with a little girl is showing. And he's like, hold on.

482
00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:02.400
Richelle Direny: Hold on. All right now.

483
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:07.530
Alyse: And then they put it on him and he's you didn't know

484
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:12.270
Alyse: I'm like, Oh, I can see your shell right now sitting outside in the cab, what are

485
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:14.190
Richelle Direny: You talking about you wouldn't even come close to me.

486
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:16.110
Alyse: Like you're

487
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:19.620
Richelle Direny: Practicing physical distance in like, I will. I will.

488
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.260
Alyse: Throw you

489
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:27.960
Richelle Direny: Throw you across the Wichita, we go with that. Why do you even have it in your hand is

490
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:35.880
Alyse: Hilarious. I was watching a video on from Ellen DeGeneres, she was live with pain, you know, pink, and her son. They both had co that

491
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.530
Richelle Direny: Oh, they did.

492
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:42.000
Alyse: Yeah. And she's like, you know, on she talked about, you know,

493
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.780
Alyse: About how people are talking ship because she was able to get tested.

494
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:55.410
Alyse: And she was like, you know, if I was in people's position. I feel the same way, but the same time, like, you know, said my shoes. If you're able to get a test and you know your son has 103 fever and

495
00:53:55.890 --> 00:54:09.750
Alyse: Just having chest pains and throwing up and diarrhea diarrhea wouldn't. Why wouldn't choose get one to, you know what I mean, it broke my heart because it was like, I think for somebody, you know, we always celebrity this celebrity that but like she was probably in her Ross form, you know,

496
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:13.770
Alyse: You saw it was like she was human and a real person.

497
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:30.510
Alyse: And I don't know, it made it so real. And the thing is that they even asked her, like, where do you think you got it from. And she's like, I don't even know. Because we were self quarantine before they were, we were told to do this. They were self quarantine back in the beginning of March.

498
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.120
Alyse: So I don't know. I

499
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.500
Richelle Direny: Just this this

500
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:39.630
Richelle Direny: It's quarantine. I mean,

501
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:45.690
Richelle Direny: They tell you to South Korean team. They tell you but then there. People still getting in. So then it's just like

502
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.470
Alyse: How, yeah.

503
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:47.490
Richelle Direny: It's possible.

504
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:53.610
Alyse: Well, I'll tell you, I think, Ohio. Here we're making big strides. We've already hit the curve. And it's been going down.

505
00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:10.170
Alyse: I don't know. I think the governor gears, taking the proper steps to start social distancing before he really needed to enter like cut all the main things out before they needed to be. And with that being said, I think we're we're doing well.

506
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:16.200
Richelle Direny: Let me ask you for your school what you you go weekly online. We

507
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.510
Alyse: Okay, so I am

508
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.310
Alyse: You have to at least

509
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:22.200
Alyse: Check in

510
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:24.690
Alyse: If

511
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:33.720
Alyse: You have to at least purchase like go on website. Like, I'm like, I'm like class website 15 times a month or something like that.

512
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.390
Alyse: Um, I mean I have like

513
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:45.360
Alyse: So they give you these things called fast tracks on there basically tests to be able to test out of certain subjects like I did a fast track last week for

514
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:54.330
Alyse: Communications and I test it out of it. So I don't have to take that class I'm doing on college math right now and hopefully I'll test out of that.

515
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:59.400
Alyse: So those are less classes, you have to take. But, uh,

516
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:18.810
Alyse: I know I like have to take accounting. I have to take. Um, I think it's called macro economics. I have ethics. I have an algae run business or algebra and something Accounting one and counting to a spreadsheet, like all kinds of stuff. Um,

517
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:21.030
Alyse: Yeah.

518
00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:31.650
Alyse: So yeah, I don't I just go in every day. So I go on the website every day, at least, that, you know, it knows that I'm there. So it looks proper from not mistaken, you have to

519
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:33.330
Richelle Direny: Know,

520
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:43.950
Richelle Direny: My little one just pumping came in. Oh, you're fine.

521
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:50.820
Alyse: How old for, oh my God, she's like my nephew, my nephew's for needs a little good

522
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:52.110
So,

523
00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:55.470
Richelle Direny: Today there's no school today because it's Good Friday.

524
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:57.960
Alyse: Well, you guys are in school. Anyways, right.

525
00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:03.870
Richelle Direny: Well online schooling. Remember, everybody's doing online schooling.

526
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.200
Alyse: Do they have to go online and actually they talk to somebody or no.

527
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:18.030
Richelle Direny: So some, some of them. There's maybe one of to my daughter one or two classes that she does face to face, but everything else they upload it to the system. And then they do an online.

528
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:25.170
Alyse: See our kids are on a format. Anyways here. They're basically all their works on iPads, they do see saw and all that other stuff.

529
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:40.350
Alyse: So their, their work formats already iPad to begin with. You know what I mean. So they don't do any of the human interaction like face to face with teachers, which I think they should, they should fit in on the classic in English class and have to learn it. You know what I mean.

530
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:54.030
Alyse: But I feel bad for mine because everybody's screwed up nice and well the the the two weeks that they were out before you know spring break it and fourth quarter or third quarter. And so when that shift starts back up.

531
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.740
Alyse: Because I'm at the point where you can only repeat so many times.

532
00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:05.130
Richelle Direny: How are they able to do. You got well for kids, they're in school, so

533
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:05.820
Alyse: So,

534
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:21.420
Alyse: You have the old computers. No, no, they're all on it. So they they're like I said before that. It's cool. They don't even have like real books like they might have a math book or English books, but everything is online so they use their iPads, all the time, regardless

535
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.010
Alyse: Okay, you can give me a minute until I'm often here and I'm going to go get a coffee and I'll give you get you a milk.

536
00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:32.700
Alyse: No wonder why Mr probably

537
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:42.780
Alyse: I can't leave five month old babies here by themselves, Mackenzie, I'm on the phone. Let me finish. Please. That's what

538
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:51.000
Alyse: I'm yeah so there. Everything's on on you know they they have to check in, they have to

539
00:58:52.470 --> 00:59:02.970
Alyse: Send their daily attendance, like a worksheet and by three o'clock and then everything else is due by 11 o'clock that night for by like Friday or something like that, um,

540
00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:13.920
Alyse: So yeah, but they're i mean they're loading them will work. And don't get me wrong, this isn't like a walk through the park, but they got like 10 works a day like 10 worksheets a day to do

541
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.600
Alyse: So, I mean, they're getting yeah they're getting

542
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:19.080
To work.

543
00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.280
Richelle Direny: But then are they out for the rest of the school year.

544
00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:37.890
Alyse: You know, I, we don't know yet. So they've extended it tell me first. Um, but, I mean, what's the point of going back. I mean, first, first of all, you are possibly you know contaminating more people because although

545
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.660
Alyse: It's not like by May 1 is just going to disappear. It's still going to be there. You know what I mean. So what do you do open up the schools for a month.

546
00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:58.320
Alyse: And let these kids go to school and possibly get sick and get their families sick again. And then, you know, have an outbreak at school or do you just let them do this homeschool for the rest of the year and start off fresh next year.

547
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:09.900
Alyse: But then you think like they've missed out, you know, we have snow days here and stuff like that. So that's only a certain amount of days out of the year like usually my kids went back last year in September.

548
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:22.620
Alyse: You know, this year, they're going to be going back. Damn. In the beginning, August. You think you know like when are they going to change this all it's weird. It's just like the world's been put on hold and you don't know what's gonna happen that

549
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.070
Richelle Direny: That is true. That is true. You really do. I

550
01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:26.700
Alyse: Feel like

551
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.240
Richelle Direny: It's touching go, you can go and

552
01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:32.460
Richelle Direny: I'm looking at your

553
01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.380
Richelle Direny: You we've always worked on like identifying your triggers to

554
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:48.540
Richelle Direny: Like maybe your, your triggers to your anxiety that ultimately leads into the arguments between you and Harold right

555
01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:49.350
Yeah.

556
01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:57.930
Richelle Direny: Like what are some things like now to be more to be more aware of

557
01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:10.350
Richelle Direny: What do you think you can work on like for to at least to work through not getting yourself all worked up where you feel this over this intense feeling of wanting to leave.

558
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:22.860
Alyse: Well, my anger, of course. So, and I think my my anger stems from fear like usual mostly to do

559
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:34.500
Alyse: And like with my anger, like I said, the whole the distancing myself from things like even if it's the children if it's him if it's something getting myself away for a little bit.

560
01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:54.030
Alyse: But before you know like even, even if I get to that point, you know that point. Still a lot for me, you know, that's like a lot of stress. A lot of anxiety. A lot of mine racing and all this extra stuff that doesn't even go along with it and adds to the saying this app. So it's like

561
01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.240
Alyse: Should have

562
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:01.290
Alyse: So I need to

563
01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:13.410
Alyse: I guess I I like I need to start to like recognize with myself when when when I start to feel that way you get what I mean like I need before

564
01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:24.630
Alyse: So instead of realizing, oh, this is the way I feel now, then it's you need to recognize this is the way I'm starting to feel, how do I stop it from getting to 10. You know what I mean.

565
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:29.070
Alyse: So,

566
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.480
Alyse: I mean, it really just has to do with a lot of

567
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:37.350
Alyse: Like reckon like recognizing

568
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:44.220
Alyse: I don't recognize the how I feel. A lot of times, you know what I mean I don't recognize I'm angry. I don't recognize I'm fearful.

569
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:50.850
Alyse: Because I just act on those things instead of like taking

570
01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:54.300
Richelle Direny: Inventory and look to see what is causing it. Yeah.

571
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:57.240
Alyse: Me and that inventory. We've never been good step forward as

572
01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:58.110
Richelle Direny: Well for me.

573
01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:07.080
Richelle Direny: And I think all of us because we're so we're I think by nature. We're so impulsive that we just react.

574
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:15.390
Richelle Direny: Instead of just taking a step back and saying, Okay, before I react to this, you know, where is this coming from

575
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.120
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's a clear path.

576
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:26.910
Alyse: A lot of things have been said and he says, you know, a lot of like his, his anger comes from me, accusing him of doing things, and he doesn't do them.

577
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:39.060
Alyse: Like I told him, I said, What would you think if I went out after you know got drunk went out to a bar, what would you think what would you think if I got drunk out to a bar and then my phone will shut off.

578
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.970
Alyse: What would you think if I got drunk went out to a bar, my phone shut off and I didn't come home, till five o'clock in the morning.

579
01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:53.010
Alyse: You know what I mean, like, look at it from my side. Why would I not accuse you of screwing somebody you know I mean why would I not think that that's what you're doing.

580
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.780
Alyse: And then so i don't i never accuse him of cheating on me.

581
01:03:58.860 --> 01:03:59.970
Alyse: Unless he's drinking

582
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:07.080
Alyse: And I'll take that that accusation from nine months ago, and I'll still run with it today.

583
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:15.630
Alyse: Remember that time when you went out when I was pregnant, and you didn't come home and somebody called me and said this, which was which you. Sorry. Well, guess what.

584
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:26.160
Alyse: That's why I do it. Like, I mean, okay, you found out I was on Xbox and will, and then some stupid kid from the donut shop sent over a donor for me. Woohoo.

585
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:38.160
Alyse: That's twice. I mean, I'm not trying to go tit for tat but week I can hold up both hands and feet on the street that you've done since we've been together, you don't. I mean, like, I'm not trying to like

586
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:45.450
Alyse: Make you feel some certain type of way, or like downgrade or whatever but

587
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:54.420
Alyse: Two little hiccups with me, compared to the 22nd with you. I mean, come on now and then you wonder why I accuse you of the things I do

588
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:56.640
Alyse: Mm hmm. You know,

589
01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:58.620
Richelle Direny: It's all about awareness.

590
01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.440
Richelle Direny: It's all about awareness and I think, like you said,

591
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:16.380
Richelle Direny: You have to, you have to stay focused on you and you can't worry too much because when you say, So focus on him, then you forget what your goals are and what you're supposed to be working on. You forget how to practice your own self control.

592
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.700
Alyse: You free if

593
01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.400
Richelle Direny: You're so focused on him.

594
01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:27.480
Alyse: Yep. And I lose it. And then that's where all that's when all this shit starts to blow up like I have to

595
01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:38.370
Alyse: Like I just need to worry about me, where we talked about was it you that I talked to you that I say I don't love myself like I don't think I love myself anymore like I used to. Was that us

596
01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:47.250
Alyse: Yeah, yeah. You don't mean like I have to find myself again I have to love Elise before I can love Harold before I can love

597
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:52.740
Alyse: Xavier. You know what I mean, like, I can't give love that I don't have for myself.

598
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.270
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm.

599
01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.310
Alyse: And that's where you go. Yeah.

600
01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.460
Richelle Direny: And how are you going to start loving yourself again.

601
01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:15.510
Alyse: Well i don't know i a lot of it has to do with recognizing my worth knowing that I'm worth something, and then I'm a benefit to some blank. My I'm a benefit to me, I'm a benefits, my children. I'm a benefit to him. You know, I just have to not only say it, but I gotta believe it, you know.

602
01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.520
Alyse: That's all I have right now. No emails. I just know I have to

603
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:29.190
Richelle Direny: That's it. That's where you start. That's leave it right there. That's it. That's all you do recognize your worth.

604
01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:46.470
Richelle Direny: You know, speak life into yourself speak positivity into yourself. Tell yourself every day that you're worth it. You're a smart, beautiful woman, you're strong you speak those life into yourself, then you'll start loving yourself again, then you'll know how to love someone else.

605
01:06:47.970 --> 01:07:04.530
Richelle Direny: You know, it's what is love yourself know love others as you love yourself, well, how can I love when I don't really know how to love myself. So yeah, that's where it starts, but get. And I think if you just make that your goal to work on for you.

606
01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:11.580
Richelle Direny: And not stay focused on on Harold and and or even on the kids in terms of what it is that they're doing.

607
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:28.140
Richelle Direny: You won't lose sight of what your goal is for yourself, understanding how to love yourself all your imperfections, because none of us are perfect all your everything that you where you are, to this day, even with the history that you have in your past still loving you, for you.

608
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:35.640
Richelle Direny: And then you will learn how to love Harold, your children, his children and

609
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.730
Richelle Direny: You know, and I'm going to stop saying his children because at this point. Like, I think it's they're all your children because

610
01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:42.180
Alyse: Everything.

611
01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.550
Richelle Direny: You're doing, you're not treating them any different.

612
01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:57.270
Richelle Direny: Than you're treating your own. The only thing that you do different is just say that there has children but outside of that everything you do. You do. As if that they're your biological children. So, you know,

613
01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:11.850
Richelle Direny: Once you start loving yourself and you speak life into yourself and you teach yourself how to, you know, respect yourself you know know self worth, and your value, then you can start teaching the girls. The same thing because you are their biggest example.

614
01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:23.370
Richelle Direny: This is your time going back to what we talked about parenting and recognizing what is it that you didn't get from your own when you were growing up, or what you would have liked what you didn't like

615
01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.630
Richelle Direny: This is where now you look at your from a woman's perspective.

616
01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:37.500
Richelle Direny: And you say, you know what, even though my mom was physically there, but I wanted her to love me this way I wanted her to speak life into me this way I want. I think it would have made.

617
01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:50.040
Richelle Direny: It would have made a difference in who I became. And so knowing that Pete having that piece of knowledge. Now you can import this into summer in rain and Mackenzie is a girl right
