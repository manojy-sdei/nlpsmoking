Okay.

57
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.330
Michael Hoefer: All right, great. And can you tell me a little bit about what brings you into treatment today.

58
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.110
Dave: So I been an oxy code on and

59
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.390
Dave: Xanax user for about seven

60
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.170
Years.

61
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.780
Michael Hoefer: And by in those last I got into recovery about a

62
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.560
Michael Hoefer: Year ago

63
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.210
Dave: And

64
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.880
Dave: I had multiple relapses

65
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.660
Michael Hoefer: Along the way,

66
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.540
Dave: And

67
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.280
Dave: I think I went back into treatment at the end of March.

68
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.910
Dave: Because I was in IoT tricking

69
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.290
Dave: Three many mentors.

70
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.820
Six months before that.

71
00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.300
Dave: I got about 30 days of sobriety and then another 40

72
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.280
Dave: Days and then I have relapsed and I went on a run for

73
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.670
Dave: About

74
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.840
Dave: Four to six months and I'm really tired of the cycle.

75
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.130
Dave: I

76
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.310
Dave: Don't like, you know, using oxy coat on.

77
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.820
Dave: And I'm looking for a way that I can.

78
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.200
Dave: live my life without the dependence of

79
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.600
Dave: Oxygen and and Xanax and

80
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.880
Dave: Because of my anxiety.

81
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.160
Dave: And depression.

82
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.830
Michael Hoefer: I

83
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.150
Dave: Kinda

84
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.470
Michael Hoefer: I'm using I'm using

85
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.200
Michael Hoefer: oxy cotton to function.

86
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.710
Dave: And I that the downs that go along with the times that I've tried to stop.

87
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.740
Dave: The withdrawals have been really bad and I'm

88
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.220
Michael Hoefer: Really bad

89
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.810
Dave: I just can't seem to be able

90
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:55.500
Dave: To stay sober for an extended period of time, you know, I'm I want to do this for a lifetime.

91
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.970
Dave: Like you know and setting goals and I can't seem to reach more than you know.

92
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.770
Dave: A month or two at a time, one

93
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.280
Michael Hoefer: At a time.

94
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.810
Michael Hoefer: And what happens at that month or two time points that kind of happens that you go back

95
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.890
Dave: So it seems like I just can't find

96
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.040
Dave: Find like a sense of joy or contentment. It's almost like

97
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.870
Dave: Like when I initially

98
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.360
Dave: Initially have good gotten sober in the past.

99
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:30.120
Michael Hoefer: In the past, it's, it's a good, kind of like a particular thing. And I'm all done.

100
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.030
Michael Hoefer: As soon as that wears off.

101
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.430
Dave: You know that 30 days 90

102
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.070
Dave: Days, I, I just, even I go I go into a meeting in a meeting.

103
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.800
Dave: I've done group therapy.

104
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.420
Dave: The meditation. You know, I tried a lot of coping skills.

105
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.740
Dave: Right. It just seems like

106
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.360
Dave: Something's missing inside. I feel like

107
00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.740
Dave: You know I'm missing just not fulfill. I just, and that's why I use it gives me a feeling of

108
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.390
Dave: Well, being so I know

109
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:04.860
Michael Hoefer: He's feeling

110
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:05.760
Michael Hoefer: Well, being

111
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.820
Dave: But obviously, when that wears off it.

112
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.410
Dave: Obviously the well being goes away and then I have a lot of sense of guilt.

113
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.310
Michael Hoefer: Goes away.

114
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.470
Dave: I can't get I can't get myself motivated to, you know, we're

115
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.020
Dave: Both a parent, my family, you know,

116
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.350
Michael Hoefer: We're

117
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.750
Dave: I just don't have the

118
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.820
Dave: I don't, I can't see any incentive

119
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.330
Michael Hoefer: To do things, it doesn't it doesn't seem like

120
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.670
Michael Hoefer: It doesn't. It doesn't seem like it's

121
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:39.600
Dave: It's leading anywhere. It's almost like I'm like I'm searching for something and then it just doesn't

122
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.480
Michael Hoefer: Doesn't. Gotcha. Okay.

123
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.410
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, and how

124
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.190
Michael Hoefer: You know, how do you use the oxy cotton on when you use it.

125
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.230
Dave: It's

126
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.520
Dave: It's so

127
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.940
Michael Hoefer: I'll usually wake up in the mornings I haven't had anxiety.

128
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.570
Dave: Anxiety and I take it to kind of get going.

129
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.030
Dave: To do my daily routine.

130
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.110
Dave: I get to work.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.050
Dave: Helps it gives me a real sense of

132
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.240
Dave: Energy, it gives me a lot of energy.

133
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.350
Dave: So I use it for them. I'm usually using that information was an x.

134
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.190
Dave: Because x

135
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.620
Dave: As I come down, I get it, and

136
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.000
Michael Hoefer: It balances valid balances out so

Michael Hoefer: Very frustrating. Yeah, it can be it can be very demoralizing what you're what you're really trying. But if something is not connecting or something is, you know,

499
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.010
Michael Hoefer: You know, you're getting

500
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.670
Michael Hoefer: A month or two, but like, you know,

501
00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:00.000
Michael Hoefer: Kind of just a heads up practice figured out, kind of, what's the best structure.

502
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:06.720
Michael Hoefer: And so I have, I have a, I have a couple of it is. But before we talk about like a plan.

503
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:18.660
Michael Hoefer: I just, those are the main questions. I need to ask for the intake. I just wanted to check in and see if there's anything that I left out that you think is really important for me to know or if you had any questions for me Facebook.

504
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:20.550
Michael Hoefer: So far,

505
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.910
Dave: No, I just know people

506
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.370
Dave: For

507
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:27.060
People

508
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.700
Dave: Who are

509
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.430
Dave: In recovery that have been on methadone or and people that have been

510
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.070
Michael Hoefer: 10 years

511
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.440
Dave: oxen and weren't able to get off.

512
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.080
Dave: And said they didn't get the worst.

513
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.120
Dave: I've ever had.

514
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.370
Dave: But I've also

515
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:47.970
Had

516
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.530
Dave: Come across a lot of people that have gotten sober across a

517
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.620
Dave: Lot of people records at a time. It's very short.

518
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.390
Dave: relapsed and

519
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.560
Michael Hoefer: Died and then relapse and I know

520
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:11.400
Dave: It's, it's been really hard for them to manage and I known four or five people that have taken Suboxone treatment seems to work for that.

521
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:18.390
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, so that's it that's in that state. But there's a couple of

522
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.850
Michael Hoefer: More. So I think one is

523
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:37.650
Michael Hoefer: You know, we recommend no matter who it is that, you know, you take Suboxone and stay on it for a while and usually that's a minimum of a year, but even for some people it's ideally a couple years and

524
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:47.430
Michael Hoefer: Then that allows you to get, you know, a certain amount of recovery time under your belt, but also built on the other social supports and things in your life so that

525
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:56.790
Michael Hoefer: If you had someone want to do a trial off of you have a good family relationship you have a good job, you have silver friends through you know whatever mutual support group your call, but

526
00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:03.570
Michael Hoefer: You got your anxiety in a better place. And then at that point trying to come on goes a lot better. Yes.

527
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.830
Dave: I mean, that's the goal is to eventually come off. I just

528
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.320
Dave: Sick of going back and forth. You know, I

529
00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:15.540
Dave: I just want to string together some time and if it's something to help

530
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.050
Michael Hoefer: You know,

531
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.400
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, absolutely.

532
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:29.220
Michael Hoefer: So that's what you mentioned is another important thing we know if people stopped too early or just detox or whatever.

533
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:42.000
Michael Hoefer: The data, the medical research clearly shows that 90% of people relapse to back to all be used within a year's time and a significant percentage of them die. So it's really risky to not be

534
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:51.210
Michael Hoefer: You know, it's really risky and dangerous to not be in treatment, but also not to be on some medication for an extended period of time. So, yeah, yeah.

535
00:32:52.260 --> 00:33:01.980
Michael Hoefer: So with that being said, I think, you know, I think you have, you know, you certainly have an opioid use disorder. And I think you are really good candidate for Suboxone

536
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:11.970
Michael Hoefer: I once we're done talking tonight. If you're interested, I can just feel we're done a few minutes, I could put it in electronic prescription for you to pick up

537
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.880
Michael Hoefer: One week supply the medication, which is the most I'm allowed to give you based on the intake.

538
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:18.870
Okay.

539
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:26.970
Michael Hoefer: I do there is good data that shows that actually higher doses of Suboxone lead to better outcomes.

540
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:33.420
Michael Hoefer: better outcomes. I need less relapses and less people less dropping out of treatment.

541
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:40.290
Michael Hoefer: Okay, so for you. I would recommend that you take at least 60 milligrams of Suboxone a day.

542
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:48.840
Michael Hoefer: Seems to be kind of the threshold of the sweet spot of the research that people get a better response they stay a treatment longer at that knows

543
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.680
Okay.

544
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:59.460
Michael Hoefer: And so you can either take that all the morning or you can take, you know, will be giving you a milligram tablets and you could take one in the morning and one in the evening.

545
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.280
Michael Hoefer: Either ways, fine. Okay. Okay.

546
00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.310
Dave: And they're like, eight hours, eight hours or

547
00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:12.870
Michael Hoefer: So it's very interesting thing with Suboxone the anti addictive effects last about 24 hours but

548
00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:20.670
Michael Hoefer: The pain of the pain affects last about six, eight hours. So if people struggle with pain issues at all. It's better to split it up.

549
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:30.630
Michael Hoefer: twice over the day if you don't really have paid it. You don't really dated when you take 60 milligrams, that it's easier to just take it in the morning and forget about it.

550
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:34.530
Michael Hoefer: Okay, okay. Either way, I can do that. Yeah.

551
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.310
Michael Hoefer: So that's that. I think for your generalized anxiety.

552
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:49.020
Michael Hoefer: Which is clearly a big trigger for relapse in you and for lots of people, I think you're on a good medication regimen right now.

553
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.050
Michael Hoefer: But go on very low doses of

554
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:54.840
Michael Hoefer: Those medications so

555
00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:02.490
Michael Hoefer: If you're still a lot of anxiety. My advice would be for you to increase those doses. OK. OK.

556
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.190
Dave: So the Gabba pending was prescribed

557
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.180
Dave: Prescribed by

558
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.510
Michael Hoefer: From

559
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.610
Dave: When I was in treatment. And so my presumption is going to run out. I

560
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.360
Michael Hoefer: Gotta run I'll

561
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.100
Dave: Not gonna have any lab.

562
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.970
Michael Hoefer: Have any lab. Yeah. So I'd be willing to give you some of those prescriptions.

563
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:31.740
Michael Hoefer: So, so I would recommend if you're if you're taking the guy with pension, you're still anxious, you're not feeling sedated when you take it. I think we should go up to 16. I mean, we think we should go up to 600 milligrams three times a day as

564
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.640
Michael Hoefer: You don't have to take it. If it's not, if you don't need it. But if your end

565
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.210
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, yeah, I got pill. Take it three times a day. Okay.

566
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:39.570
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

567
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.520
Dave: I've been taking it as needed.

568
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:50.940
Michael Hoefer: Okay, good. And then we got to get this search lean up to, because you know 25 milligrams is really not going to do much.

569
00:35:51.240 --> 00:36:03.660
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, yeah, the doses of which sertraline org for anxiety are actually higher than the doses, they work for depression. So you should really be on a minimum of 100 milligrams of that medication, you know,

570
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:10.860
Michael Hoefer: Easy enough to it over time, but I'll be I'll prescribe you some 50 milligram tablets of circling

571
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:22.890
Michael Hoefer: That I want you to start taking start take 50 milligrams. And then after a week if you don't feel if you feel fine. No side effects. No, you're not numb, then you should go up to 100 milligrams

572
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.300
Michael Hoefer: Ok ok ok

573
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:33.900
Michael Hoefer: And then the quality is fine. That is also useful for, you know, anxiety, and you can take those as needed. Do you need a refill of those as well.

574
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:35.520
Dave: No, I have

575
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.570
Michael Hoefer: No, I have those

576
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.760
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. Okay. And then I would. And then I don't want to do too many things at once because it's

577
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:47.130
Michael Hoefer: You know, then you never know what's going on. So I would leave it at that right now for the meds.

578
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:57.030
Michael Hoefer: Okay. Um, and then I think the real big things with generalized anxiety are exactly the things you're already doing. But just hammering those in absolutely no caffeine.

579
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:04.920
Michael Hoefer: As much exercises you can do. I mean, you know, it's hard. Was sheltering in place, but as much exercises you can do that will help

580
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.150
Michael Hoefer: If you can spend time in nature, especially when

581
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.430
Michael Hoefer: Things lift up. That's the you know hiking or just spending time at parks or

582
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.440
Dave: Is really high gain by being

583
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.740
Dave: By

584
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:25.650
Michael Hoefer: Those yeah yeah all of that. I mean, just that should be not just exercise that should be that should be considered like another prescription for you. Another

585
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.510
Michael Hoefer: Minute or mental hair. Yeah.

586
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.920
Michael Hoefer: And then, you know, as far as the other stuff, you know, I would encourage you to look into.

587
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:41.070
Michael Hoefer: Depending on I think two types of mutual support groups that might work well for you.

588
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:54.030
Michael Hoefer: Are and you may have already aware of these event of these but smart recovery which has like a CVT based principles for addiction, which can also be used for anxiety I think would be a good group for you to consider.

589
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.350
Michael Hoefer: A 10 yeah yeah

590
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.510
Dave: I was going to a Monday night Monday night.

591
00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.850
Michael Hoefer: Mr smart. Okay.

592
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.400
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. And then there's also have you been to recovery Dharma meetings.

593
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.720
Dave: Yes, in Santa.

594
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:16.860
Michael Hoefer: Cruz. Yes. Okay. Cool. So you're aware of those two. And right now, you're probably where they're all fine, but there you can go online meetings all day. Anytime.

595
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.060
Michael Hoefer: There's also

596
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:25.500
Michael Hoefer: There's also a website that you may already know about in the rooms calm but they are like a clearinghouse that has a lot of meetings all day.

597
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.150
Dave: Yep. I've checked this out.

598
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:32.370
Michael Hoefer: Check those out. Okay, great. Alright, so, you know, I'm not an ideal all the stuff or

599
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.130
Dave: Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yes. Okay.

600
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:47.400
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, um, and that's what I would do for right now, the next steps for our program are one of our care coordinators will call you in the next couple days and

601
00:38:48.150 --> 00:39:01.410
Michael Hoefer: And talk to you and then get you connected. And so I'm just doing intakes for the program right now so you will be connected to a continuity or an ongoing therapist and an ongoing physician.

602
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:14.850
Michael Hoefer: And you'll and most of it is group based you know most of our care is weekly groups with other people who are in recovery and and using buprenorphine. But there's also some opportunities for individual work as well.

603
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.020
Sounds good.

604
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:18.810
Dave: Sounds good.

605
00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.950
Michael Hoefer: Good. Okay, I think that's enough information.

606
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.600
Dave: Right now. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

607
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.720
Dave: No. So I'll just check in with someone

608
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:38.460
Michael Hoefer: Someone will give me a call next week. I have another meeting and I have another meeting. And, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Okay. Yeah.

609
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.120
Michael Hoefer: I'll be able to pick up

610
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.950
Michael Hoefer: Tonight. Yeah. Yeah. Which pharmacy. Do you want me to use

611
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.950
Michael Hoefer: McKinley, okay.

612
00:39:53.970 --> 00:40:07.260
Michael Hoefer: Cool. All right. Just the other thing I want to, I do want to make a brief mention about the Xanax um I you know I highly encourage you to try to avoid using Xanax as much as possible. It's

613
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:16.740
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, it's really effective, you know, acutely but it actually long term can make anxiety much worse and

614
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:36.420
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. And yeah, it's just, and you should also know that you know the having taken as long as you have it sometimes takes up to, like, a year and a half for your or longer for your anxiety levels to fully stabilized, but they will get better. Yeah, you can get a long term sobriety together.

615
00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:51.060
Michael Hoefer: But it's just you know you're a young, young guy. And if you continue taking Xanax your anxiety levels you know are going to get are going to be, you know, are going to have a very much lower chance of getting better.

616
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.770
Dave: Over to yeah I would definitely

617
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:53.490
Dave: Not want

618
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.580
Michael Hoefer: To take that. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.

619
00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.980
Michael Hoefer: All right, well,

620
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:14.160
Michael Hoefer: It's been really nice talking to you. Sorry. I haven't been able to like look you in the eye and have a more interactive talk, but, um, I really wish you the best of luck and I welcome to our program and I'll put in those prescriptions as soon as possible.

621
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:14.970
Dave: Sounds good.

622
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.530
Michael Hoefer: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

623
00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.790
Michael Hoefer: All right. Sure. Take care.

624
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:18.600
Dave: You too.

625
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.830
Michael Hoefer: Bye bye bye bye
