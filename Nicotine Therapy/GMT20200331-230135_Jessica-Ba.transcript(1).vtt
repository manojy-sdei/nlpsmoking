Robert Russell: Hope for the best.

12
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what's going on in New Mexico or they put anything in place.

13
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.870
Robert Russell: Like they have, like, like, like the main store like yeah like like the main stuff like like doctors offices and like

14
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:34.680
Robert Russell: Things like that can stay open and no other stores are closed down and stuff like and I got like some capacities that are in place, but you can only take so many people in the store at a time.

15
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.960
Robert Russell: You can only buy like so many items.

16
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.660
Robert Russell: At a person today, stuff like that.

17
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're doing that here, too, in Florida.

18
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.510
Robert Russell: Yeah, so they're i mean they're, they got a little bit of precaution going, but I think they need a little bit more

19
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Definitely. Definitely a lot more

20
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.160
Robert Russell: To get done just man, but we'll see. Hopefully it just

21
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.040
Robert Russell: Goes way said 14 days right

22
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.050
Robert Russell: Is like

23
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.300
Robert Russell: Having like

24
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's hard to enforce the 14 days because not everyone staying home so

25
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.530
Yes.

26
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.970
Robert Russell: That's what we need, we need a two week or like a two and a half week does a lot now everybody has, has it stay home I'm great.

27
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, because then the virus would definitely come to a stop.

28
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.810
But

29
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, I guess the government's hesitate to do that.

30
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.510
Robert Russell: lose too much money. Yeah, I think that's what it is.

31
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would you like to talk about today, any current stressors frustrations.

32
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.990
Robert Russell: Not I'm not gonna stress. I'm doing pretty good actually. I just chillin yeah look

33
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For you.

34
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.820
Robert Russell: This I talked my girlfriend ally and then like hanging out my baby and then

35
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:07.020
Robert Russell: Then my brother. I often help now. He's a little bit stressed out because he just got out. So being, how, how can you stay level helping him out. Jim, and then

36
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.740
Robert Russell: What's nice is it a listen to music work and

37
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:23.910
Robert Russell: Hang out my kids, but it's all, it's all day activity. I got it takes up all my day working and taking care of a baby and and plus the school's out. So the other kids at home all day too. So, yeah.

38
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, headache, all around.

39
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.050
Robert Russell: Yeah, but they keep moving to keep it busy so yeah

40
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.270
So,

41
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's, let's discuss what happened in group last week.

42
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.510
Robert Russell: All right.

43
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was your, what was your perception about that experience.

44
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.770
Robert Russell: Of my work for me what happened for me and group.

45
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Do you recall with

46
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.390
Robert Russell: No, I know. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying, like a plane.

47
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:03.450
Robert Russell: Darrell a group in general like with anybody also just personally me personally, but I just think I, for one, I'm not a good talker. I don't have like

48
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.520
Robert Russell: To just talk to

49
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.670
Robert Russell: Anybody just like having a little conversation. Like, I don't have like I get frustrated. Like I do get frustrated

50
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:24.090
Robert Russell: Really bad and then like if I'm speaking about something like I know to be 100% true and my heart are I believe it to be 100% to my heart. At least then I speak like with a lot of passionate and like like

51
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:33.000
Robert Russell: I don't shut up. I don't listen and I just say I gotta say to them. And so, but I got it, I got back four or four communication skills.

52
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I

53
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:52.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I was able to witness in group, some of the things that you've talked about in the past with your challenges with communicating, you'll have a valid point. But the delivery comes off aggressive and then the emotions you know tackle on so

54
00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:01.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When I told me about i'm not i haven't experienced that. And I did see it in group. So I understood the intention because of what we talked about

55
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.670
Robert Russell: Last weekend, right.

56
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:16.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, people will just really work the program. They'll definitely benefit, but when you get caught up in the semantics of generic and vice versa, it just it deters you from your long term sobriety now.

57
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.740
Robert Russell: There's a piece of defeats the purpose because there's

58
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.850
Robert Russell: Other places.

59
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:29.190
Robert Russell: Other places to go. We were they like to get on thrash or it's easy to blow smoke up that so to sit at this one spot.

60
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:42.270
Robert Russell: This for that long, and not be your only problem you only have one problem. You don't have like a different home every week, you just have one problem. So understand, like, what, it's all right. I mean, to each their own. I just

61
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.980
Robert Russell: How

62
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you think the group member receive your

63
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your statements.

64
00:05:51.450 --> 00:06:04.140
Robert Russell: I think is, I think, pretty quite as much why I know that I want to take us back like if I can help it. I added like a mouse, but I think that I hope that he took it like in a right way or wrong way.

65
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:19.110
Robert Russell: And I mean, not like to be mean or nothing like that or like I know more than anybody or like like my like my input is there and need to be listened to. Yeah, I just got poor communication skills and then sometimes like to give advice, though.

66
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:35.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I, I was able to witness that because what I saw at the beginning was all the information that you've been holding for so many groups to just release. And then at the end of the group and you engaged. Again, it was more settling

67
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:46.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what I want us to focus on an ongoing communication because the the coin, the content of what you're trying to communicate is accurate.

68
00:06:47.010 --> 00:07:06.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But because one you already have a high pitched voice, we add it with the delivery, people can get. Oh my gosh. And so I witness that include. So let's think about thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and how they all interact to leave for to that response.

69
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.110
Robert Russell: So I

70
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:15.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Had the ongoing thought about this group member and another group members and just kind of being manipulative, not really.

71
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not really working the program the way it should be. So that

72
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:35.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can get the benefit and also so that you don't have to deal with listening to these things during the group time that's important for you as well. You're taking away your valuable time from your family to come in for something that can be beneficial.

73
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:47.760
Robert Russell: But you're in the right people complain that and then I look at it through the eyes like because I used to be like lit the person listening to someone say that like good people that really want to be there, like, go on, you know, happy to be here, like that.

74
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:58.740
Robert Russell: Like I remember like hearing that actually like a lane. Like, I don't know, but I was like true for there's people that want to be there like an everybody nobody's there because they have to be there because they're going to die. If not, they're like,

75
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:04.620
Robert Russell: Yeah, be there by choice. So, definitely. That's why I come from, like, on that definitely

76
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You made a very empowering statement that everyone is there by choice.

77
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.040
Robert Russell: Brown and so

78
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:20.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The thought was that, and then the feeling behind that of the consistency of the group members showing up. Was that frustration of

79
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:36.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Come on. And so the behavior that was witnessed was that frustration that came out. And so what got lost in translation. Was it the content, but the frustration.

80
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:45.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so how you said that, then what happens is you keep talking. And it's hard for you to stop because now you release is that frustration that still wants to be released.

81
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.220
Robert Russell: Yes, so

82
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:59.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you were to imagine a place to put all that bottled up frustration where and you only have the key, no one else had the key, where would you bottle in place, all of that frustration.

83
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:10.110
Robert Russell: I think, I think I have a real good I think. I don't think my problem is like learning how to bottle stuff up. I think either kind of bottled up my whole my whole my

84
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:18.900
Robert Russell: Whole life. I think my phone and keeping my bottles categorize and put in whatever in whatever model and whatever another follow up stuff.

85
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:25.020
Robert Russell: And then releasing pressure on them all because my mom just specialized specialized that boom. It's slow

86
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:33.630
Robert Russell: But I could like if I can breathe or Burt my models and organized and I think that would help me out a lot.

87
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.270
Robert Russell: I know I do know how to

88
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.130
Robert Russell: Like me, I can take a lot, a lot, a lot. It's just, that's my problem is is

89
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:49.140
Robert Russell: Knowing how to knowing a positive way to take it in. So I don't release it in a negative way. Okay. Okay.

90
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:56.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you said that you will want not just a container you will want different containers that can separate the different

91
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:10.770
Robert Russell: Right, because that's just the type of person that I am, I am, because I'm like a real organized and like I got OCD. So, but that'd be like the best way to explain it, but our looks like one big bottle and it is sticker different sides of the walls, I guess, I don't know.

92
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:24.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the way I envisioned it is the story motion right you lock it in the box. And whenever you get into that place of frustration, you use that imagery to go to that box where you can say

93
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:34.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, I made my point. The rest of this frustration I have. I'm going to put it in this box and locking up because that will help with the stopping

94
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.700
Robert Russell: You made your point right stop.

95
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:46.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's what I was envisioning, but I'm curious to hear about your imagery of several different bottles and and how you would categorize it. What would be in those different containers.

96
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:54.870
Robert Russell: I'm just like, I'm just saying, like, for bottling stuff up like cuz like emotions like people Kabbalah, you could bottle up stuff like

97
00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:06.210
Robert Russell: Like your irritation with coworkers or your irritation with family members or your are like you're maybe you're doing a project guilty. Something you get in here and it looks like over a long period of time.

98
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:11.850
Robert Russell: Or what are your sobriety, or whatever, like, just keep that pattern.

99
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:23.190
Robert Russell: That category like for a person like me who overthink things and dump the same personally for me like that overthink things and and then my biggest thing is like my perception of how

100
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:35.280
Robert Russell: What people are saying I like I i take it for everything as like I'm defensive like everything like I have to be on my defensive like if someone's just a little ladies first time meeting or whatever, like

101
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:46.980
Robert Russell: Like nine times out of time. I'm like, I my guard like this because like my, my mind is going. Now because I guess I still am a little confused analyzed. But that's what I mean like, I'll just put like a focus on

102
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:57.630
Robert Russell: That one model and learn how to control me that way. I could just, that's my problem is trying to control 100 things at once, and then I can and then I get frustrated. But if I can learn

103
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:08.160
Robert Russell: To put them like what's prioritize them. What's more human, and then I'll just talk that's that's like, like that's like, just like the first step of the staircase to just try to get my style.

104
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:18.300
Robert Russell: Not so frustrated matter thinking everybody's out, arguing that you mean that everybody's out there trying to burn somebody or just come off a yummy. Yeah.

105
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:35.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm I'm understanding what you're saying now because you're saying that not to take likes frustrations that may be with coworkers out on family members, not projecting those frustrations on other people. So that's why I

106
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.110
Robert Russell: Gotta separate

107
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.690
Robert Russell: Yeah, that's the part of the year.

108
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:53.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I you can see I shared my screen with you, cuz I'm curious to know if you could think of the last time that you had that experience of frustration.

109
00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:01.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In that moment, where would you rate yourself if you see here. Let me zoom in a little

110
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:07.560
Robert Russell: I got it, yeah. Oh man, like, just for like my last recent time like I just stretched out.

111
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:16.140
Robert Russell: Of, like, I don't like i don't i that's the, that's the big about me, my, my thing is from zero to 100 like I don't

112
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:32.280
Robert Russell: Like, and it's whenever I'm stressed out about whatever it's like that, like, and it's like it's like if I'm we're tired like a like a work and I haven't said yet, then it's a little bit more because I'm tired of more irritable, but so I give probably would have been highlight very anxious

113
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.880
Robert Russell: He's not like almost screaming, he said.

114
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What

115
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:38.940
Are you thinking of

116
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.100
Robert Russell: Like

117
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.760
Robert Russell: Let me see. Last time I got

118
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:47.880
Robert Russell: All whenever

119
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.520
Robert Russell: A school

120
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.440
Robert Russell: Called my

121
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.360
Robert Russell: Call me and my girlfriend her son, and we went down there.

122
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:10.560
Robert Russell: And they said that because when he was playing and tickling and not listening and they said they are. They're saying, well, they're not going to call it parents and we're just going to call the cops if y'all. Listen. And so my girlfriend. My girlfriend told

123
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.720
Robert Russell: Our son will, you know, you're in trouble and you're going to get a spanking when you get home.

124
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that is supporting all that

125
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:26.580
Robert Russell: Yeah so. And yeah, so that stuff. And then I just very kind of stuff. Say anything comes up or something like

126
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.770
Robert Russell: That was the last time I got like still like

127
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:33.540
Wait.

128
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.660
Robert Russell: Oh wait, you know, I've tried to my social security card. The other day too. And I probably wouldn't bring food.

129
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So after something with your social security card.

130
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:52.890
Robert Russell: Yeah, I remember, the other day I get my social security card online. You can't go in there and I'm trying to do my taxes, that's fine. And yeah, and

131
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:58.890
Robert Russell: I was. And at the time I was doing it the deadline had had been hadn't been moving on to school and

132
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:08.310
Robert Russell: In a few days. So I was I was, I called him, I suppose, credit card in that dude kept on telling me to do it online and stuff and

133
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:17.400
Robert Russell: An online process to get through the first step it all ask you is what your first name is your middle initial your last name your social security number and your birth date.

134
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.180
Robert Russell: And then to get there going, and it wouldn't even let me get past that screen and kept on saying that I'm putting in invalid information.

135
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:31.980
Robert Russell: So I called them to try to talk to me and I had a sound hold every time I talked to him for about 3045 minutes and it was like

136
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:45.300
Robert Russell: I don't know, I feel like the website. I think the website was just there, so they can get people off their phone line determined determined for their from their phone lines for a couple minutes. Yeah, but I kind of, I kind of got a little bit a

137
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.080
Robert Russell: Hostile over the phone.

138
00:15:51.510 --> 00:16:03.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the way you described, that was it was it was progressive you know you started off with making the phone call and then each hold it. Just progressively, you know, got worse.

139
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:04.380
Robert Russell: So,

140
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:11.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where would you say you were when you first picked up the phone and make the call when you realize you were having issues with with the

141
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With the online application. Where were you at

142
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.240
Robert Russell: A. I was just I

143
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.260
Robert Russell: guess you could say like alert and awake like

144
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:27.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: At a 10 okay yeah so you were here. You were either 10

145
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:35.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then when did it escalate. A little higher. What happened next to make it go higher than attend

146
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:49.560
Robert Russell: whenever, whenever I asked if there's any other possible way that I could talk to somebody out besides what i'm talking with because I know the questions and answering answering aren't getting answered and

147
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.190
Robert Russell: And then they went pretty much told me that

148
00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:00.810
Robert Russell: She was that like there was nobody else to talk to that she was doing to the road and if she could help me. Then I couldn't get help.

149
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.010
Robert Russell: And I, that's what made me. I'm pretty mad because

150
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.470
Robert Russell: She didn't want to let you know mean not even not just even to talk to another person. I got that.

151
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.870
Robert Russell: I got a little bit of a confrontation with us. Like, that's why.

152
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:22.830
Robert Russell: I did. I got I got, like, like, like the big respecting so like when it goes to that point, I take it, like as like

153
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:33.000
Robert Russell: Like dishes checkers is probably I think a little bit crazy by taking a disrespect and then I go off of that. And so I live in my respects and if I start being a little bit belligerent

154
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So. So the plan is I'm being disrespected

155
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.040
Robert Russell: Again, I said, Yeah.

156
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:41.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

157
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.380
Robert Russell: I guess that's the foundation of it. Yeah.

158
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Then you have the thought and then the feeling is what

159
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:53.940
Robert Russell: Give an excuse of it. The feeling is, it's just I don't like the feeling. This is just, I'm always I feel like

160
00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:01.350
Robert Russell: I'm mad. I definitely different always feel like angry definitely angry. You're not angry like our

161
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.140
Robert Russell: Angry but

162
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.210
Robert Russell: When I don't know how like what you're angry about like so, like, it's like I'm

163
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:16.920
Robert Russell: Trying to figure out what a man. It's crazy, because I get mad about nothing. So, and then make a time I'm trying to figure out why I'm mad, but then I know that

164
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:27.450
Robert Russell: Because I'm Clenching my face, or because I'm mad or something or that there's someone I think someone trying to dishes Becker is trying to diss or you're doing something on purpose or something like that.

165
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, good. I like how you describe the clinching of the fish because what I was going to say next is

166
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you feel it in your body so

167
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:43.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is what you'll be doing to progressively work on that anger management and he said, as one of your goals is to see

168
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:54.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What actually lead you to go from zero to 100 because a lot of people say that but I honestly don't like that it progressively escalates, the way you said

169
00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:01.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our, our levels of frustration or like those calls that you experience it. You start off

170
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:09.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, very level tempered. Someone says something and that feels like that. First person to say sorry I can't help you live a chance for you to someone else.

171
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:26.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then the next day chaplains you transfer it to someone else, you have to explain it all over again. Take it progressive. That's how we act in our everyday situations when we get triggered with the thought of being disrespected, and then anger is it's progressive

172
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.110
Robert Russell: You start off

173
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:36.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Probably add a zero or 10 you're fine. Or, like you said, if you have very little rest, you're probably at a 20 or 30

174
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:59.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then someone probably gives you a look. And so now that 30 has jumped and then after the look, there's a comment and because you've already been out of 30 it can jump so, sir. Whole idea between behind the subjective unit of distress scale is to help people to identify

175
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:14.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What exactly what happens when they jump through different temperatures and if they can stay at a certain temperature, it makes them think well what am I doing to keep me at, for example, a 60

176
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:25.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the past, I would have jumped to a 90 but I'm feeling like I'm at a 60. So what is the self talk that I'm utilizing to keep me from getting to that.

177
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.950
Robert Russell: Does that make sense. Yeah.

178
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:40.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So any experience with the the color when you call it about the social security and just using that as an example to bring it home.

179
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.340
Robert Russell: Is that

180
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:54.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where you found yourself that you were getting to the point of I'm being disrespected, you would already know. Okay, Robert whenever I have the thought of being disrespected my next feeling is anger.

181
00:20:54.750 --> 00:21:04.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what top, could I introduce so that I cannot have this thought of being disrespected, what could you have said yourself to a place that

182
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm being disrespected

183
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:19.410
Robert Russell: And I could just remind, like I do, if I could, something I could do is to remind myself that guy remind myself that I'm the one calling them and I need help. If it's a situation like that where I knew need to help or whatever or

184
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:31.470
Robert Russell: Then to just remind myself just remind myself I remind myself to a lot that I am I am not it on before, not me no more that I'm dad, and I'm a civilian like whoa.

185
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:42.480
Robert Russell: I think I could read it and i can i gotta keep I remember like it's different, different out here like like I really never really understood, like the whole continents concept of institutionalization

186
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:50.010
Robert Russell: Like, even though I hadn't had it for a long time, like until I executives really like this is like really chose this recently.

187
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:57.000
Robert Russell: Until I really started thinking about like myself and hype and acting and I really want to do good and not go back and

188
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:08.010
Robert Russell: Then trying to break it down like what's making me have problems what like is angry or sad like emotions and then like what how having to talk and do all this right now so

189
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:09.930
Robert Russell: I think that

190
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.540
Robert Russell: The more and like this come a long way. So I know it works so

191
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:23.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. So you gave a lot of self affirming statements that okay this is where I am. I'm not in jail.

192
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.830
Robert Russell: I've come a long way.

193
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.700
Robert Russell: You know,

194
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm asking them for help. So, you know, why would they want to disrespect me

195
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.360
Robert Russell: Exactly. This is keep it.

196
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

197
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.300
Robert Russell: Just keep common sense as always think, don't, don't think you rational rational thought

198
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:53.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is what I talked about in group. Last night I said that sometimes are distorted pat on patterns of thinking, have become so automatic we repeated them so much. So they actually become automatic thoughts.

199
00:22:54.330 --> 00:23:05.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, that's why it's been this transition for you and it's been a struggle because, you know, probably even before your incarceration probably had some challenges with

200
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Feeling destroyed or being angry.

201
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.930
Robert Russell: And so

202
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:29.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so your body what automatically regulate to a fight response activating that central nervous system and so your thought would be disrespect my feeling would be anger and then the behavior would be aggression yelling etc and

203
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:43.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The more that since got activated, your body will respond. Okay, the thought came up again that robbers being disrespected, let's activate that central nervous system and going to fight mode.

204
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:54.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because your body responded over time for so long to that now you have to retrain your body to not have that fight response.

205
00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:10.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To to activate the parasympathetic nervous central, central nervous system, which is more calming and relaxing. The way to do that is to replace the thought replace the feeling so you could change the behavior.

206
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:11.640
Robert Russell: Right.

207
00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.170
Robert Russell: Slowly but surely I definitely am definitely

208
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:17.610
Robert Russell: Yeah.

209
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:29.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what I want you to do is this week to to love the fact the feeling and the behavior. This is what we did in group to this is what we're working on.

210
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:43.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So identifying you recognize your trigger is disrespect. So we'll work on that whenever you hear or feel the fat of disrespect coming up. I want you to love. If the automatic feeling is

211
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anger, like you said, or if it changes.

212
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: ever been a time that you felt that you thought this respect and you felt sad.

213
00:24:54.330 --> 00:25:07.260
Robert Russell: I mean, there's definitely been times I felt disrespected and and and Bella even scared probably cuz I mean places that I've been like you got it. Like, and I'm not a very big person so

214
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:15.630
Robert Russell: And then plus. And so I'm saying, and to make them proud of nothing but it's just fact and to make it to be like

215
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:26.490
Robert Russell: Have made it like how I made it and where I made it for as long as they made it and to come out like this the same way I went in, in a sense, it's, it's a

216
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:32.250
Robert Russell: It's a good accomplishment. But that's for that lifestyle for on Biggs, and for like

217
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:44.850
Robert Russell: pieces of crap and people that value that stuff. He will that take time that people like I used to be that used to think that there was that there. That was my only are that that get if I did gave 10 years when I get it back.

218
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:51.510
Robert Russell: Down and I mean like all my time on also danger option down in like it was just

219
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:58.590
Robert Russell: Like, I guess, I guess I can say, cuz I was young, I hope. I know, but I just definitely grow up and change my thought pattern so

220
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:05.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. What do you think, what do you think made you adapt to changing that thought pattern.

221
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:17.460
Robert Russell: This my kids, then my kids and my family might like my family like my immediate family got a bunch of family but I gotta ask, and a cousin, and my brother and they just always

222
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.660
Robert Russell: Like when I got out they were always there and like you just

223
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:33.450
Robert Russell: That's just, I gave that a little bit of hope and I mean that someone that don't don't don't give up on you. That's why people like they don't give up. I mean, I mean, or something like that expanded it has helped me out. I guess in contact got tired of being locked up and

224
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:43.230
Robert Russell: Realizing that every time I'm going to do something for a home you are with the only that it was just probably just so they can get out of trouble. I have something to tell him. Yeah.

225
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:45.390
Robert Russell: Well, yeah.

226
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:52.080
Robert Russell: Then, plus I stopped doing all kinds of drugs to so that that may have a party to that to

227
00:26:52.290 --> 00:27:03.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The drugs and response activating the there's the sympathetic response that is the fight, flight, or freeze. And then there's the parasympathetic that's more fully and relaxing.

228
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:04.890
Robert Russell: So why

229
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:14.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Were people that have the anger management, you want to activate that cooling relaxing nervous system. Often, and that that helps to the self talk

230
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:15.930
Robert Russell: You know, right.

231
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:26.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Early yourself what the opposite is what your brain is telling you and I liked how you share that there are times when I felt disrespected, and the feeling wasn't anger. It was here.

232
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:38.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's good that you have the various feelings in reaction to the thought. Um, when you're at home, you know, in the relationships, how we play it.

233
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:55.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: play a part, to know our children. They try us sometimes so you know when they have to disrespect or when your when your partner says something, you feel disrespected, you know, maybe you're you're feeling his anger, but it probably doesn't go well with

234
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:06.180
Robert Russell: Right. Yeah, it's definitely the idea, and that's a big thing that helped me out so much because I always always always have had, like,

235
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.580
Robert Russell: A good connection with my kids and then like even like my cousin say there anyways is like

236
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:21.960
Robert Russell: Because I tackle the guideline because of my institutionalization I even started get locked up when I was really, really young and I went to like mental institution to like Matt was like young and so

237
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:28.800
Robert Russell: So like I was just like my soul. I was stuck like a Institute like institutionalized. I got a young age. So

238
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:39.240
Robert Russell: I guess got along like whenever I was 18 and stuff like that. I still was like a kid in my head I was like a little child going to be like a night wasn't didn't have a job and

239
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.890
Robert Russell: I would just be a bone and see my couches and

240
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.100
Robert Russell: Stay with my family for free.

241
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now look at you working adult responsible adult

242
00:28:53.910 --> 00:29:04.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And active parent, you know when when that call came in. It was admirable that it was you and your child's mother that went to the school. It wasn't just her showing up.

243
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.060
Robert Russell: You were president

244
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, some some fathers or even mothers would have said, all right, one person is going to be there.

245
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.260
Robert Russell: But the fact both of you went

246
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Together says a lot about how you guys parent your children.

247
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.510
Robert Russell: Exactly.

248
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:29.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even though you were you knew you were activated and your, your distress scale was rising, you still know that you needed to be there to advocate for your child.

249
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To write

250
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:42.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To be that example for your child to protect your child and also to let the score know that what we're not going to do is, you know, try to make threats about means of my child.

251
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.040
Robert Russell: Right exactly that you were

252
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Able to communicate them effective way because they were apologetic at the end.

253
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:54.630
Robert Russell: Yes it did work and it worked out off and it did work out because like I said, I can now I was able to when

254
00:29:55.020 --> 00:30:02.100
Robert Russell: I did take a walk when all it was going down. They came over here to talk radio get all hyped up and say, I'm just gonna take a walk and I'll come back and then I came back in school.

255
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:08.970
Robert Russell: Like had been had been like pie like even like 30 days ago, I wouldn't know how to do that. Yeah, yeah.

256
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:17.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's what this. That's what this just distress Gail helps you to realize what it is that you did differently so that over time. Bill Koch.

257
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:29.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To the next time you feel disrespected, you may think, last time I felt this level of distress. The last time I was a 90 I decided to take a walk. Let me try that again and see if it cools you down.

258
00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:40.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And more than likely it's going to work because you're able to see in the numbers that I was at a 90 I took that walk after you took that walk. Where did you drop down to

259
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.460
Robert Russell: Always good. I can probably drop down all the way

260
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:47.580
Robert Russell: To like a 10 or 20

261
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.330
Robert Russell: But could I was gone for, like, I went for a little walk through fire when you're 30 minutes so

262
00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:00.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and it doesn't matter the duration. You went you pulled up but and you came back.

263
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:01.920
Robert Russell: So that

264
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:13.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That was very effective anger management right there that yes, even though I'm walking away. I'm still coming back to the issue and I'm still going to address it, but I need to regulate myself right now.

265
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:21.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, you probably felt the same way your body that gave you that signal that you are being activated. Where did you

266
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.270
Robert Russell: Learn your body extract pacing pirates are painting and then get. I get hot warm

267
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:36.060
Robert Russell: And then I talk fast I talk fast and then I tripled my work class good like excited or like, I want to say something like

268
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:43.110
Robert Russell: I just, I try to say everything I want and then all the words that come at once. I sound like a stuttering stammering or maybe that

269
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Also happened in group. So you see

270
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your body will mirror the exact same thing.

271
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:59.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Each time, so the beauty of that is that you get to catch it right away because you already know how your body's going to function.

272
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:10.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then you can take the opportunity to okay are you know what's happening right now. I'm getting activated. I'm increasing my distress scale to a 90 I need to reduce

273
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:21.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You do that. It's like, you decide. Let me take the pot of boiling water off of the stove. Let me put it to the back burner where there's no key. And what happens to that pot of boiling water.

274
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.600
Robert Russell: Right, it cools down south boiling. Exactly.

275
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:35.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this is what you're going to do it takes lots of imagery and thought stopping to get to this point but I definitely believe that you're more than capable of doing it because you've done

276
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:36.990
Yeah.

277
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That was good. Do you have any other questions.

278
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:44.310
No, ma'am.

279
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.530

00:38:46.770 --> 00:39:03.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I have another six o'clock. So what I'm thinking is I'm just going to do our meeting for 30 minutes and see if that person if that person pops in. I'll just ask that person to wait about 30 minutes. Okay.

297
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:10.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. All right. Just give me one minute. Let me grab my phone so I can be in contact and, in the event he shows up. OK.

298
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.790
Robert Hammond: OK, no problem.

299
00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:39.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how have you been, it's been like it's been a long time since we last spoke

300
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.920
Right.

301
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.340
Robert Hammond: A couple weeks ago right

302
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.760
Robert Hammond: still staying away from that one.

303
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me about that. She tried to come back.

304
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.570
Robert Hammond: Yeah, she did all those things, but still a they'll my ground so

305
00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:06.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what is holding a brown me, how did you communicate to her that we engage in that

306
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.550
Relationship.

307
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:18.000
Robert Hammond: Basically I told her I didn't want to be hanging out with her anymore, things like that. I stopped trying to help her.

308
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:26.340
Robert Hammond: So that when I got her because she had she was constantly calling trying to get me to help her do something

309
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, how you feeling about that.

310
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.420
Robert Hammond: Yeah.

311
00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:36.810
Robert Hammond: I think it'll actually help or more in the long run.

312
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:51.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, that's what boundaries boundaries is an opportunity to protect yourself and also gives the person an opportunity to practice healthy behaviors. So this is going to help her to identify

313
00:41:52.410 --> 00:42:09.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know how to operate in her future relationships and what will and will not be tolerated. This teaches you that you can be able to exert discipline and saying, no, this has been hard for you, your friends, you said take advantage of you.

314
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:15.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The girlfriend was. And so how has the same no experience been for you.

315
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

316
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.770
Robert Hammond: It just, it always be good for me good for everybody else up

317
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:28.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what other relationships healthy exercise the privilege of saying no.

318
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.850
Robert Hammond: Just read some friends asking for help and stuff.

319
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.400
Robert Hammond: You know when I got other things to do.

320
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.150
Yeah.

321
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:37.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

322
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.980
Robert Hammond: You know, you could tell it. So I'm gotta kind of Webster thinking that I was supposed to drop everything just for them.

323
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:53.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how, how has the whole pandemic. How have you been adjusting with everything that's been going on.

324
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.500
Robert Hammond: Honestly, I'm still trying to adjust. I

325
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.320
Robert Hammond: I still go out and everything.

326
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.320
Robert Hammond: Try to find work and all that.

327
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:09.480
Robert Hammond: So, which is like more scary. Now, you know, try to make a living.

328
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.940
Robert Hammond: So I'm doing anything I can like right now. I'm actually building somebody a harness

329
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:17.460
Robert Hammond: The dog.

330
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was good that you

331
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:28.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this is the thing I was thinking about this today that the beauty in being self employed, is that you make your own schedule.

332
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:35.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can be flexible. You don't have to entertain anyone in regards to really have to go why you can't, you know, be there.

333
00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:50.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But then the downside of situations like this where you don't have the protection of, you know, a system that can keep you employed and really having to get creative and think outside the box to make ends meet.

334
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.000
Robert Hammond: Right.

335
00:43:54.480 --> 00:44:01.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So have you been, you know, keeping your, your anxiety and check in. Okay, doing those little check ins with yourself.

336
00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:07.620
Robert Hammond: I kind of had like a couple of panic attacks when they weren't they weren't that bad.

337
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so

338
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When was the last time you experienced that.

339
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.770
Robert Hammond: That was like, about two days ago. Oh, what happened.

340
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.610
Robert Hammond: I don't know, it was, it was weird. I just started thinking. Next I know my mind started wandering

341
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.540
Robert Hammond: Going out to different things and I started panicking.

342
00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.090
Robert Hammond: Thinking about buying and all that.

343
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My dying.

344
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:34.350
Right.

345
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you mean, like, what if you die or wanting to inflict that on yourself.

346
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:42.300
Robert Hammond: Know what have I done

347
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.060
Robert Hammond: Yeah, like didn't sickness, although

348
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:50.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh yeah, everyone is it is it regards to the coronavirus

349
00:44:51.180 --> 00:45:09.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. Nothing practically everyone is having that fear, you know, God forbid I catch it. What is how my body respond to it. So it's normal to have this anxiety. But I'm curious to know what makes you say was a panic attack versus anxious thoughts.

350
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.450
Robert Hammond: Just the fact that I started like hyperventilating, like, sweating like crazy.

351
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:20.130
Robert Hammond: Like I was traveling to rule. Yeah, yeah.

352
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.710
Robert Hammond: So,

353
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:27.630
Robert Hammond: I know I hate when I get like that because it's hard for me to start calming down like after that.

354
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:28.440
Yeah.

355
00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

356
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:40.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, I know that there's been a lot of people that are experiencing so stresses doing this point and this is a tool that I've been using

357
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:55.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To help people regulate when they get anxious. So this is a subjective unit of the stress scale and they helps you to identify in those moments of distress exactly what level you're at

358
00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:08.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the benefit of putting a number to it is one, it separates you from just saying I have anxiety. It gives it a number and it makes it more manageable to play with.

359
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:19.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, and then it helps you in overtime to see what coping skills, what self talk you put in place so that you don't continue to

360
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:33.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: rise in temperature. So, two days ago when you started having these thoughts. Tell me, moment by moment, like when that thought first occurred, what what temperature. Were you

361
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.400
Robert Hammond: Surprised by like a

362
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:50.940
Robert Hammond: LIKE I HAVE YOU LIKE ABOUT about 70 so I was all cool cool then once it started it started going up like as a about like 10 degrees at a time. Okay.

363
00:46:51.720 --> 00:47:03.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you say you started at a 7070 says you were already quite anxious, you're already distress that was interfering with your functioning and you started to feel some symptoms in your body.

364
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:06.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

365
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.430
Robert Hammond: When I first when I first started, it was

366
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:09.720
Robert Hammond: Like

367
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'd say about 40 4040

368
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.750
Robert Hammond: Okay, so let's

369
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:28.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Our anxiety, which is probably what we're all on right now. During this time, we're, we're probably at a 20 to 40. Um, and so when did it shift from a 40. What was the next step. But what temperature was it at when you went to the next.

370
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:37.710
Robert Hammond: The next word that that's when I started freaking out a little bit because I started getting knowing that I had this anxiety and that's it went up to about like maybe 5060

371
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:47.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you started revealing moderating side they started feeling signs that you weren't actually anxious. What were those signs.

372
00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:52.680
Robert Hammond: That's when I started reading like I started getting like the shakes the

373
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:59.280
Robert Hammond: Like the vision started going like, like everything was like cartoonish typing.

374
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:03.000
Robert Hammond: Oh, wow. Wow. Like you just feel like, like I'm not really

375
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:06.660
Robert Hammond: Like I'm not there. Yeah. Like, it's like a dream or something.

376
00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:14.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we got to have a 60 didn't get any higher than 60

377
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:20.640
Robert Hammond: No, because by then I knew I was in a panic attack and I started doing the coping.

378
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:22.830
Coping

379
00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:29.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm thinking, based on the fact that you said you had the blurry vision.

380
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:44.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Everything seemed like a cartoon, and you were sweating. That seems a little like a 70 or 80 but you're saying there was a 60 so that tells me that maybe this wasn't your worst experience of a panic attack.

381
00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.170
Robert Hammond: Oh, no.

382
00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:51.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even that you see how that number helped me to say like

383
00:48:53.190 --> 00:49:01.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For someone that never expect a panic attack, they probably will put that at 100 but you put that at a 60 and that helped me to see that.

384
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:17.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This must have been nothing compared to the other anxiety, panic attacks you experience some curious to know what kept you from getting to that 90 because you already had the had the science here.

385
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:27.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was it the science that huge you to calm yourself down or was it the it's the ongoing experiences of having panic attacks that made you calm down.

386
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:36.390
Robert Hammond: Why just because I hadn't before and I knew that there are no okay the fact that I know that again really die for them.

387
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:37.440
Yeah.

388
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:41.730
Robert Hammond: Like I can, I can actually pass out and stuff like that but

389
00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:44.430
Robert Hammond: You know,

390
00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That in that moment that I can't die from this

391
00:49:49.290 --> 00:50:00.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, good. I like that self talk. Robert, because that also tells me, then the past we experienced panic attacks like most people, they think I'm going to die.

392
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:10.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because it's so scary, but because you've had the lived experiences. Unfortunately, of these panic attacks you were able to rationalize

393
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:21.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And beat that destroyed thought that was telling you you're going to die. What she did. Robert, and I'm not sure if you're aware of it, you activate it yourself talk

394
00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:32.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's self talk then activate your parasympathetic central nervous system, which is the one that's coming and by you telling yourself. I'm not going to die.

395
00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your body probably received that message and started to calm down just a little

396
00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:40.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was that your experience.

397
00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:46.110
Robert Hammond: Right. Yeah, that's exactly what's happening, like a shirt. I started more relaxing a little bit more. Mm hmm.

398
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:59.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the reason for that. Robert, is because everyone ready a panic attacks, depression, substance abuse, anger management. We all have thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

399
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So thoughts and feelings control the behavior.

400
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:08.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But so when you had the thought of anxiety.

401
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:20.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the feeling of fear or anxiety, your behavior was your body that reacted to panic attacks.

402
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:30.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's go into fight, flight, or freeze of reasonable. So, but instead you told your body, calm down. You're not going to God.

403
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:46.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then it said, Okay, let's stop the fight, flight, or freeze let simmer down the amygdala and let's tap into the parasympathetic central nervous system that's going to pull ourselves back

404
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:52.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To you believe that nice simple statement could activate all of those things in your body.

405
00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.490
Robert Hammond: Yeah, cuz

406
00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:01.710
Robert Hammond: I know, it's crazy. I remember when I read a book about read all the panic disorder and let

407
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me.

408
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:03.030
Robert Hammond: And I was like, what

409
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:09.120
Robert Hammond: And it was talking about that what you said about that. Yeah.

410
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:20.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what's good for you. Robert, is to continue to use that self top of saying not gonna die. What else did you tell yourself.

411
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.580
Robert Hammond: To try to slow my breathing.

412
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So did you do that, did you start taking

413
00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:32.670
Robert Hammond: Deeper breaths. Right, I'll do the 10 second breath that hold it.

414
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:35.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The belly breathing.

415
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:36.810
Right.

416
00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.510
After you experience the time

417
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.100
Robert Hammond: Yeah, actually, uh, I called up a while I started texting. One of my friends just talk to him.

418
00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.280
Robert Hammond: You can get me out of that state of mind. Yeah.

419
00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Happen into your social support system.

420
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:03.630
Robert Hammond: Right, right. I didn't tell him I was having a panic attack ready

421
00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, they don't need to know all the time. Sometimes

422
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You just need connection in that moment.

423
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:28.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because fear creates a lot of isolation fear makes you believe that you're all alone that no one else understands what your experience. And so by you tapping into your social supports that took away that feeling of

424
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Feeling alone having it here.

425
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was going on. What were you doing when that panic attack happened.

426
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:44.910
Robert Hammond: Actually, I was just watching TV. You know, I started thinking about that, you know, the whole epidemic.

427
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.730
Robert Hammond: And then it started leading me to start thinking about everything. I read in the Bible and stuff.

428
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

429
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Were you watching the news.

430
00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:01.170
Robert Hammond: No, you just had one of those little flash mornings you know about things like an update.

431
00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:03.660
Robert Hammond: Day all alert.

432
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.810
Robert Hammond: And then I remember, I got a text.

433
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.590
Robert Hammond: From somebody where they're showing all the tanks that they're going in.

434
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, what, what, what did you read in the Bible that made you

435
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:24.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Call today. This is areas of distress.

436
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:33.570
Robert Hammond: Just about like the Book of Revelations where it talks about that the Senate trumpet and all that. Yeah.

437
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.820
Robert Hammond: And then I'll just bring it all together, like how Trump got elected president

438
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:41.580
Yeah.

439
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So all of those things, all of those experiences.

440
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:59.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Seeing it play day by day and it's it's impacting your daily function, you know, you're trying to look for work. It was already hard to find work and now just intensifies the job search for you.

441
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:20.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And and now your body's being activated by distress. But what I'm hearing you you activated that parasympathetic central nervous system by doing some belly breathing doing that positive self talks to defeat the destroy thoughts and then connection with someone so support to you.

442
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:30.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want to invite you to use your imagination of the here and think about in this space of distress.

443
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:37.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To see if you could also as an additional support. Think of a protective figure

444
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This person could be real or imaginary

445
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:51.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what this protective figure would represent is whenever you get in distress. It's something that you can go to as an additional anchor.

446
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.470
Robert Hammond: By God,

447
00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:04.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That could be a protective. Yeah, that could be a protective figure. So the way that resource in would you would work is

448
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:08.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Robert is feeling distress, who started out of 40

449
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:15.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Robert starting to feel that he's getting a little more anxious, it's creeping up to 70

450
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:20.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, no, no, no. Robert started talking so he's got himself down to 50

451
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:26.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He goes to call his, his social support the person doesn't answer.

452
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:38.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now the protective figure which for you, you identified as God and you got that real quick. There's some people that they really struggle with trying to figure out who that person will be

453
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that tells me you have a strong connection.

454
00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:43.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Already you go into God

455
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:48.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You may think of different Bible verses that you dread.

456
00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Different Bible characters that exhibit strengthen that moment.

457
00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:55.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you would say

458
00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Another self affirming statement.

459
00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:07.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this is giving me just access to multiple resources to help you with Tommy anxiety.

460
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:12.840
Robert Hammond: Right.

461
00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:16.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you think that's something you would be able

462
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:16.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To apply

463
00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:25.860
Robert Hammond: Yeah, those are actually things that I do, actually. I didn't even step that I was doing them. Yeah. Okay, so you're protected figure

464
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:34.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So now we're going to expand our team. We talked about how you regulate your body talked about your social support.

465
00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:47.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So your team is going to consist of your wise figure, you're protected figure in your nurturing figure who are already identified God as your protective figure who would be your life speaker.

466
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:53.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: real or imaginary something or someone that represents wisdom.

467
00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:57.330
Robert Hammond: Go with the same one.

468
00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.140
Yeah.

469
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, nurturing figure

470
00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:06.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is something that would bring comfort.

471
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Make you feel secure.

472
00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:19.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Real imaginary. Some people say grandparents and people say, blankets, anything that just makes you feel cozy and comfortable.

473
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.490
Robert Hammond: I say the medication.

474
00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:25.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, we can't use that one.

475
00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:33.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Person that's activating it addictive state.

476
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.250
Robert Hammond: You don't want that.

477
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:55.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's fine because this is this is a new skill set that will be building is something to think about real or imaginary. The first time I did this, I have to think for a while to

478
00:58:56.490 --> 00:59:09.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, so with the nurturing figure. Some people think about people that they were really connected to that may have passed away, or they think of different

479
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:14.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People different objects.

480
00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:25.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, but it would be something that you feel could talk to you in that moment or comfort you. So I know I mentioned the example of the blanket.

481
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:41.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But if the blanket was like, say, your baby blanket that you remember carrying around, you know, from when you were a baby. You remember what color it was. You could seal kit bag nurturing figure from it because you have those positive memories connected to it.

482
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:52.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think that represents a positive memory of connection support.

483
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.770
Robert Hammond: Remember we know one of my exes.

484
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.020
Robert Hammond: ended up passing away.

485
01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With remembering her happened to your depression.

486
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:17.370
Robert Hammond: Yes, we had great times together. Oh, okay.

487
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.690
Robert Hammond: Was like nothing bad. Oh, good. Okay.

488
01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:28.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I just wanted to make sure that these figures are safe spaces for you to tap into. And they don't introduce other

489
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:46.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Feelings for you, other than nurturing. So if that is what it is for you been good. So God represents your wise speaker, you're protected figure and your ex girlfriend represents your nurturing

490
01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:49.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: loving, nurturing about that relationship.

491
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.270
Robert Hammond: That she was, she was always ever me

492
01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:00.240
Robert Hammond: You know, whenever I need help, or anything. Just, just there to give me that push

493
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:06.570
Robert Hammond: You know, everybody else kicking me down. I was beginning. She was building me back up.

494
01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:19.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I want you to try this on the next time.

495
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:29.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you feel a moment of stress. I want you to think of the thought the feeling and the behavior.

496
01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:33.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I would want you to write down

497
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:39.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is Robert thinking. And then what is Robert feeling

498
01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How is Robert behaving.

499
01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Assess that every day until we me

500
01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:51.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then tell me if you notice any patterns.

501
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Does robber have a lot of thoughts of

502
01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:56.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fear.

503
01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:06.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, catch those patterns when people may identify, they have the thought pattern of them rejection or

504
01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:12.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And and then with that rejection, the feeling becomes hurt.

505
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so the way they may be. Hey, just by being angry.

506
01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:33.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And if they would allow that over time they would be able to say, you know what, I realize that when I'm angry. It's really more so because I'm hurt. So what if I communicated to someone that they hurt my feelings, instead of just getting angry.

507
01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:42.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This tool would would be helpful to can help you to manage those feelings of anxiety.

508
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:43.980
Okay. OK.

509

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Remember last time. A few weeks ago, when we spoke, you talked about finances and help with getting some type of finance financial support to help out with that. Where are you in that process.

536
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.890
Robert Hammond: Radar, like I said, have you been struggling just to make it right now.

537
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:08.550
Yeah.

538
01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:10.530
Robert Hammond: So,

539
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.470
Robert Hammond: I still haven't reached out to him.

540
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:20.250
Robert Hammond: I was actually going to put a post up. See if and get her attention.

541
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.600
Robert Hammond: So,

542
01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:26.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would you post

543
01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:33.300
Robert Hammond: Basically saying if she could get old. To me free talk. Okay.

544
01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.690
Robert Hammond: Try to keep it simple. Yeah, right.

545
01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:45.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you want to be absolute abstinent from using. How long have you been playing

546
01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:51.870
Robert Hammond: What is it being just it's just blowing smoke on me. So what

547
01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:53.970
Robert Hammond: Three weeks, four weeks.

548
01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Are blowing smoke it caused you to relax.

549
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.550
Robert Hammond: Well basically I mean it was in my system.

550
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:04.500
So,

551
01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:12.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And and building a relapse prevention plan that's what we've been working on.

552
01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:24.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Identifying thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and thought stopping what triggers certain responses from you, um, you said you want to update your resume.

553
01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:27.840
Robert Hammond: Right, I already got that one done. Okay, good.

554
01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:32.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think of things that you like to do that make you happy and make you laugh.

555
01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:36.690
Robert Hammond: Right, like boiling and all that. Mm hmm.

556
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:57.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in your relapse prevention plan you identify emotional triggers relationship triggers events relationship sugar. I have is the girlfriend that you're you're with. But she's gone. So that's good. You remove the trigger.

557
01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Event situations.

558
01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:12.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was more so like talking about your son, but I seen a shift, even when you talked about your son. Now you have a little more hope when you talk about it not as the prestige and we're in the past.

559
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me.

560
01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:21.420
Robert Hammond: I would say, anger, but

561
01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:26.130
Robert Hammond: I had a controller liked where I could get out of a Broadway.

562
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:30.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Healthy called

563
01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:32.430
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

564
01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:39.810
Robert Hammond: Well, like, once I do get angry. It's like, I know I have a tendency to like blow up like quick. Mm hmm.

565
01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:41.970
Robert Hammond: So,

566
01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:52.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Skill I showed you, because a lot of people tend to tend to think, especially people that have anger management, they often say

567
01:07:53.850 --> 01:08:03.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They go to zero from 100 real quick. And that's not true. What happens is there's different levels.

568
01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:12.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That activates these responses to you, don't jump from no distress, all the way to the highest level possible anxiety that you ever felt your life.

569
01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:25.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It doesn't happen. So one of the things to do, because people use that that statement I go from zero to 100 real quick. It's almost like a justification statement for the anger.

570
01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:37.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And people don't realize that seen that it's almost like it's a statement to the world of saying don't take me off. It's almost like an intimidation factor.

571
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:38.790
Robert Hammond: Got tipped me off.

572
01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I'll go from here to here.

573
01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:49.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's not true. That's not who you are. There are different things that needs Robert to elevate and Roberts already identified

574
01:08:50.550 --> 01:09:03.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Through his physiological symptoms. His heart racing is shortness of breath. The sweating Robin are waiting realizes, okay, I'll go from zero to 100 I go from zero

575
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.250
Robert Hammond: Maybe 1230

576
01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:14.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then from a 30 to about a 50 and if I find myself getting into a 60 or 70 I can bring myself back down.

577
01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:29.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's way more manageable then going straight from zero to 100 that leaves no room for accountability of being able to adjust your anger and being able to work on it.

578
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:42.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So reframe that statement here. We hear somebody say it remind them that actually you don't. There's different triggers if you identify that can help you to not go from zero to 100

579
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:55.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I hope this scale helps you to to put that a correlation and and really help you to see the numbers to see that you are definitely in control. You had been in control.

580
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:59.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of stopping this this distress for yourself.

581
01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: doing a good job.

582
01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:11.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we have emotions. The anger, the self soothing behaviors yourself top

583
01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You been going to group. You've been coming to individual

584
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any new goals that you want to add to your treatment plan short or long term.

585
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.140
Robert Hammond: Oh, what was that

586
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:30.780
Robert Hammond: I'm still working on the smoking.

587
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:35.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Smoking. Okay. Are you working with the

588
01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:38.220
Robert Hammond: Yeah, okay.

589
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:41.430
Robert Hammond: Let's add that work on quitting smoking.

590
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:47.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any other triggers that you've

591
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.730
Noticed

592
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:57.210
Robert Hammond: I know like I like smoke alarm or like right before I go to meetings and so forth.

593
01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:58.650
Robert Hammond: Okay.

594
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:03.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's that anxiety. You told me about you get anxious about speaking in groups.

595
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that

596
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.110
Robert Hammond: Will help you to

597
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:15.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The next time you about the group before you go check in with yourself, say, Where am I from zero to 100

598
01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:22.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then when you log into virtual clinic, see if that number goes up a little bit.

599
01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:27.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you log into your group room, see if the number increases.

600
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:36.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Increases then be curious to find out what's leading to the increase and if it doesn't

601
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Find out how committed

602
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To empowering us

603
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:45.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, okay, yeah.

604
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:46.590
Robert Hammond: All right.

605
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.060
Robert Hammond: Okay, okay.

606
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:52.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay.
