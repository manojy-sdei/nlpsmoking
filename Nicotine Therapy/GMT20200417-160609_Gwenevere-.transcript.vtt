32
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:28.680

Kelli Ottnat: Just for God's love.

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

45
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.160
Kelli Ottnat: And well, when it was good. You know, when it was good and and then

46
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.050
Kelli Ottnat: And then went bad from this, from this point.

47
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.310
Kelli Ottnat: I feel like

48
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.020
Kelli Ottnat: Guys kind of put me here with all these reminders.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Reminders doing for you. What, what are they doing for you.

50
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.840
Just

51
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.710
Kelli Ottnat: Healing and reminding me that

52
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.890

Okay.

54
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.180
Kelli Ottnat: Good.

55
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it

56
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a color of a wall. Is it the way the sister in law spoke to you, is it what what are all the signs that are saying see

57
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.650
Kelli Ottnat: It's the, the sound of the water. The river running. It's the

58
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.650
Kelli Ottnat: It's the home then

59
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

60
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.780
Kelli Ottnat: The same floor plan.

61
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.530
Kelli Ottnat: The ceiling tiles.

62
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You things for good.

63
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they went bad. Now, I don't know, those stories you have them vividly in your mind, but I don't know what they are. It would probably be helpful for me to understand things for good. I remembered and I knew, and I was aware of, I'm loved and then something. My bad.

64
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What caused that bad.

65
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.520
Kelli Ottnat: This was just the point that I

66
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.390
Kelli Ottnat: Was able to really

67
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.260
Kelli Ottnat: branch off.

68
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.260
Kelli Ottnat: And I guess from

69
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're saying

70
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:37.800
Well,

71
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.990
Kelli Ottnat: Kind of, you know, I started

72
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.990
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, I wasn't really under my dad's we give me more.

73
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You were becoming independent more independent you are spending more time with your peers. Tell me what you're feeling let's let's stay with the moment. What's going on right now. What is that

74
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Done missing. Dad, what is that

75
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.840
Kelli Ottnat: He's been my saving grace really

76
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:49.950
Okay.

77
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.440
Kelli Ottnat: I do feel

78
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.620
Kelli Ottnat: Some pressure to

79
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.630
Kelli Ottnat: To leave him.

80
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:11.730
Kelli Ottnat: And

81
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:24.420
Kelli Ottnat: Kind of let him do what he wants to do and have me do what I need to do for for my kiddos.

82
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

83
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a conflict, doesn't it.

84
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.880
Kelli Ottnat: I'm at peace with that it's gonna it's gonna hurt.

85
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.100
Kelli Ottnat: Okay.

86
00:10:42.240 --> 00:11:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you doing this alone. Are you talking with him. Scott, I'm in a conflict. You saved me. I'm so grateful and I need to do what I need to do for my kiddos. I'm in conflict. I don't know how to have both. Are you talking with him, are you doing this all alone inside

87
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.520
Kelli Ottnat: Or we don't talk about it.

88
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And hear yourself saying it to me. So what we should have a witness

89
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.710
Kelli Ottnat: You just so so key on exactly how I've been feeling

90
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

91
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought so.

92
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

93
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

94
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They both love right they're both gratitude and

95
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't quite see how how this path.

96
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're both on it on this, this direction you want to go how how Scott can join and

97
00:11:53.100 --> 00:12:02.370
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, there's, there's no way of of thinking about the next step. It's and I'm really having to just

98
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.680
Kelli Ottnat: Live in the moment and as each thing happens just

99
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.530
Kelli Ottnat: Be myself and

100
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.230
Kelli Ottnat: And do what comes next.

101
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How's that been going are you liking the outcome. Does it turn out when you pay attention to intuition. Okay, I'll handle this minute this minute went well I handle that with grace, here's the next one. Oh boy. That's a hard one. And now I'm doing this. Are you liking the outcome.

102
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.040
Kelli Ottnat: I am

103
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.830
Kelli Ottnat: I am

104
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.630
Kelli Ottnat: It's, I feel like I'm I'm able to

105
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:52.020
Kelli Ottnat: To really grow and and be in my feelings and be okay with them, you know, I'm I am okay with him. I don't have to make myself be okay i'm i'm just okay

106
00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get to see more of those feelings were normally write a second time I've gotten to actually see you in them.

107
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you're feeling and you're surviving and

108
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not turning into a puddle, and you're you're you're moving through those feelings.

109
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're human. You're going to have feelings.

110
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we have to grieve.

111
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: When we love deeply, it means

112
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: The loss is massive. But we love. Anyway, we got to do it.

113
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the deal. That's the deal. You're going to feel them both and we do it anyway. That's the mess of being human.

114
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're in it because you cannot you love and are grateful to Scott and yet.

115
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be away from him. I don't know.

116
00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a little curious about the option to not talk with them. What gets in the way of being able to share what you're sharing here or what I had guessed how come you don't get to talk about that.

117
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:09.750
Kelli Ottnat: Um,

118
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.380
Kelli Ottnat: You think I'm good at being evasive or

119
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.340
Kelli Ottnat: I learned from him.

120
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.530
Kelli Ottnat: So,

121
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.140
Kelli Ottnat: He's

122
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:26.940
Kelli Ottnat: He's just

123
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.790
Kelli Ottnat: He's so smart and

124
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.550
Kelli Ottnat: Here.

125
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:44.100
Kelli Ottnat: I don't know my answers my questions don't get answered. So I've just kind of quit asking questions.

126
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.370
Kelli Ottnat: And I've learned to

127
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.120
Kelli Ottnat: I've learned that it's probably better that way, not

128
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.880
Kelli Ottnat: Not to ask so many questions.

129
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do sort of observational investigation. Then when you left and went to Louisiana. Did you go without him.

130
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened when you came back.

131
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.030
Kelli Ottnat: Um, when I came back, everything was

132
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.440
Kelli Ottnat: The way it was when I left.

133
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: He didn't say a word. Just oh you been gone for a month.

134
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.900
Kelli Ottnat: He was, he was happy to see me, he, he will come to me you know he was

135
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.920
Kelli Ottnat: told me how much

136
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.910
Kelli Ottnat: Our puppies miss me and

137
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: He he messed up. So transferred it to the puppies.

138
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.090
Kelli Ottnat: He did tell me he missed me

139
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no anger. He were you talking with him over the phone while you're in Louisiana.

140
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.020
Yeah.

141
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about it. I feel pressure to leave him.

142
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.800
Kelli Ottnat: I just, I feel like as much good as he's done me

143
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.530
Kelli Ottnat: Like his son is with us right now and

144
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.200
Kelli Ottnat: It's been kind of messy.

145
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.290
Kelli Ottnat: And he's one, you know, we

146
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.930
Kelli Ottnat: His brother in law ended up having a heart attack yesterday.

147
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.470
Kelli Ottnat: Were living on their property.

148
00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.930
Kelli Ottnat: And things just got out, it really out of hand.

149
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:08.910
Kelli Ottnat: And that was part of the stress for his heart attack. So he's he's asking his son to leave and go back to Texas.

150
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.480
Kelli Ottnat: And I'm just wondering if

151
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:18.630
Kelli Ottnat: Well, I asked him, I said, Scott. If I was out of the way, could you help Levi.

152
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.650
Kelli Ottnat: Anymore. You know, if I wasn't here.

153
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.920
Kelli Ottnat: He told me know that he wanted. You wanted us you know he wants to leave it leave

154
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.360
Kelli Ottnat: But I'm just sitting back and observing and

155
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.980
Kelli Ottnat: Trying to figure out if that's if that's really true.

156
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's interesting. So you did ask a direct question. You got an answer, but then you don't believe it.

157
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it safe to assume that Levi, you've mentioned someone before I think it was him this young man may have a substance abuse issue going on some acting out behavior.

158
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically with substance use, as you've seen this population. Maybe note in yourself for someone you know we lie we cheat. We steal to the people we love how you take advantage of them.

159
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And when we're in active addiction was he engaging in some of that behavior was Levi doing that.

160
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:29.850
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah.

161
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that have to do with you.

162
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.570
Kelli Ottnat: See, I was

163
00:18:49.800 --> 00:19:01.440
Kelli Ottnat: I was feeling pressure to leave so that he could help Levi. But then again, I was I was also like my, my intuition told me to to stay because I could see

164
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.950
Kelli Ottnat: I didn't want Scott to go down.

165
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.050
Kelli Ottnat: There, I could see Scott was tired and

166
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:25.770
Kelli Ottnat: And I felt like I needed to be around to make sure that he did stand firm on on protecting himself, but I don't know if he needs me to do that.

167
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So stand firm. Are you saying not use math. Again, I'm confused just helped me on that stand for

168
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What got it so

169
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: They are taking care of Scott's recovery Scott's taking care of yours is that the basic agreement.

170
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.130
Kelli Ottnat: Pretty much.

171
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:51.870
Kelli Ottnat: Looking at it.

172
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: As a simplified way. I know I don't mean to disrespect it. I know how how meaningful, that is he saved your life and

173
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I get that, but it puts us in a bind it means

174
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I doing for another what they can do for themselves. Am I enabling have I been enabled, it's

175
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to do for me what I can now learn to do for myself.

176
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where we grow into our, our strength in recovery. Right.

177
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't lose the gratitude of course you can be grateful. At some point someone has to do that.

178
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Address the hemorrhage, you know, we're bleeding out I've passed out. How am I supposed to hold myself, you know, it's like someone needs to kind of wrap that up and

179
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, we have a little bit. Oh, wow. Okay, so that's been addressed.

180
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's done well. Then there's you making sure you take the antibiotics, making sure you go to physical therapy, making sure you get rest and eat nutrition. You just need a friend, a coach.

181
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Along sidelines needs a friend to coach on the sideline, no matter what this is. This is our journey we've got to walk it we've got to do the do the deal ourselves.

182
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: He's got to do it. Otherwise, how does he say to himself. This is my recovery. Now, when you're gone. He's just got himself. What does that say about this strength in in recovery and his resilience. Do you see it.

183
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It's why in here. I don't

184
00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Want people depending on me. I want to

185
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Scale as quickly as I can.

186
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.750
Kelli Ottnat: It's

187
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Things and they're not mine. I learned them along the way. Please take them, share them with something quickly as you can teach them.

188
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Own it

189
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure it's yours modify it to make it your own.

190
00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just here just someone you bumped into you bumped into me once at one point you came back and we're bumping into each other again on this path.

191
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But this

192
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.730
Your journey.

193
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We can be grateful we say thank you. And then we let go.

194
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's you. You're the one that one small step in front of the other has to do this hard work.

195
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you get your son back one agonizingly difficult step at a time.

196
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

197
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're starting to get a glimpse that it's just that it's just feeling these feelings and they're rich with regret and excitement and faith and love and fear and anger, it's right there all happening.

198
00:22:53.790 --> 00:23:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you have to do is meet it with faith and grace and just sit and it, guess what happens to it, it passes.

199
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And then another one comes along, they don't last forever. We don't know that in the moment we think this feels so intense. How is this ever going to pass.

200
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.680
Kelli Ottnat: Right.

201
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It does pass

202
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.310
It does.

203
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to

207
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.430

208
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.240
Okay.

209
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:47.940

Gwenevere Abriel: A joy.

215
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A depression.

216
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: A meanness

217
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.

218
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Welcome and entertain them all.

219
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:39.240

220
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.510

226
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty powerful

227
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Hit your mute button so I can hear you. I muted you along the way. I don't know how to do it and do it. So what do you think what What struck you the most about that.

228
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.130
Kelli Ottnat: It's

229
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.990
Kelli Ottnat: It's substance. It's truth.

230
00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.700
Kelli Ottnat: Spiritually, of course.

231
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.260
Kelli Ottnat: I wish I would have

232
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.650
Kelli Ottnat: Known all this

233
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.090
Kelli Ottnat: From a child, you know, from

234
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.240
Kelli Ottnat: And I'm going to take it as it's not me, but

235
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.040
Kelli Ottnat: It's

236
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.860
Kelli Ottnat: It's good. It's beautiful.

237
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.350
Kelli Ottnat: And

238
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Would have been nice if we if we knew how to meet our feelings. It would have been nice. I wish, I wish you had someone, day after day, that was right there telling you

239
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How you feeling,

240
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And showed you how to be a with embarrassment and shame and what is an adult do with it and and

241
00:26:54.870 --> 00:27:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish this this parent had apologized and had shown you humility and showing you. You don't have to go crazy that what you felt was real. I wish that was the case.

242
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Men that moments over and you're on to get to go play again and then angry and then. Oh, she took my toy. Now, how do I manage that and you are met with a parent that could say

243
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, right. That's a cool one. It's really fun. Sometimes you'll have it sometimes they'll break enjoy it for the moment.

244
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Toys. They come and they go

245
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Or use our things

246
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Enjoy them, but their transients can hold on too tight to them.

247
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But the relationship

248
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one.

249
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the important things

250
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where we put our investment.

251
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: In the relationship. I wish.

252
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Wish during your life.

253
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I was

254
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: taught you that all of your feelings are okay that being embarrassed that one story I've only got one.

255
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the right one to have she humiliated, you

256
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to have met it like I'm not bad for that. This is a messed up my mom is stuff that was a misstep she did something that was in service to her instead of being a parent.

257
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And teaching me something that was a misstep that was her ego that was meeting her need of looking big funny. I don't know what to her friends. That was a missed up huh

258
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish someone was there to have told you

259
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not you. That's just an emotion and it will pass

260
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The more you get to know these feelings, the more you're going to be able to do that for the children in your life.

261
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Just know that if you feel like you're off course again.

262
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why you're doing it so you can teach it right i mean i might be making this up. But I think about, well, why do I bother. Why does anybody bother we pass it along. We hope our next generation has this thing.

263
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That we didn't get

264
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

265
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: unmute yourself. One more time. Someone probably texted

266
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up.

267
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.460
Kelli Ottnat: I'm

268
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.620
Kelli Ottnat: Just thinking about what you said and

269
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.360
Kelli Ottnat: I

270
00:29:52.170 --> 00:30:02.400
Kelli Ottnat: There's two things I want to say how I want to be able to give all this to Jude and I do have this this deep fear that

271
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.180
Kelli Ottnat: But I am learning to let that go.

272
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:16.260
Kelli Ottnat: Because I'm believing that God is putting the right people in his life, even though he lives with his grandparents that he's meeting just the right people.

273
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:17.640
Kelli Ottnat: But

274
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.340
Kelli Ottnat: I did have a. I mean, it used to be really strong that I wouldn't

275
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.130
Kelli Ottnat: Be strong enough to help

276
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.440
Kelli Ottnat: Pull him through

277
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.900
Kelli Ottnat: The sorrow that maybe he was going through

278
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.450
Kelli Ottnat: While I've been gone

279
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: First

280
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to meet that sorrow that just came up a moment ago.

281
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll have to meet your own sorrow before you dare to me someone else's right

282
00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This one, the one where your hand went to your chest.

283
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, of course, part of it is

284
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You need it. Stop trying to control it.

285
00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It happened. It hurts. How will I meet myself, how will I label myself, how will I judge myself. Wait, no, I don't. That's not my job to judge

286
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: let that one go let someone else judge. I'm here to do the next right thing. That's all I've got.

287
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I either learned this lesson now.

288
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we faced with it. Again, if you don't meet your sorrow, Paris, I haven't seen it yet where someone can purely an honestly and I see it in my profession, when they when therapists haven't met their own, how can they sit with someone else's

289
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: How can I say to another. You've got the stuff

290
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't even think I've got the stuff

291
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: How dare I say that

292
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: How dare I I'll give advice, maybe, you know, there's plenty of people little give give advice freely. But have they met their own sorrow, had they really sat with that ugly shadow side of the self, so that they can sit with someone else's

293
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Love them anyway, no judgment, just like Oh, Me too, me too. It's awful. Oh, me too.

294
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You do that that brave work in those moments of reflection.

295
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you will. You'll see in your son, his strength. You'll see it because you'll know it in you. You'll see it in his little cheeks and his and his sweetness and you will just your seal. Stay right there with them. You won't recoil and get small

296
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Will stay there with him. And then he'll see in you you believe it.

297
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll see it and then he'll know it in himself.

298
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It works just like that psychology offers me that explanation. It offers it beautifully.

299
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right object relations. It just gives this beautiful this attachment theory we're little we're helpless. We have no sense of differentiation between the self and other and I have a loving other continue to reaffirm me, I'm okay.

300
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. She says, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm I am okay. I'm okay and then they go off and I live my life.

301
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Very oversimplified, I know.

302
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:38.190
Kelli Ottnat: But

303
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So important.

304
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do that, but you're going to have to meet your own child that own sad broken hearted child inside of you with love.

305
00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Unconditional love

306
00:33:53.670 --> 00:34:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: No If ands, or buts at absolute. There's nothing bad or wrong with your little girl inside nothing

307
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: She stuck on some other self perception.

308
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: After reflect something just complete acceptance of her broken hearted of her disappointment that she didn't get her needs that you have to sit with that grief.

309
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And sorrow. You don't have to do it alone. If you stick around long enough, if you want to do it with me. I'm right here. I'll go through it with you.

310
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're still going to be the one walking that we're here for 60 minutes you got the hard part. You got to meet that little one every time she comes up.

311
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I love her.

312
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.520
Kelli Ottnat: Part of part of the

313
00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.250
Kelli Ottnat: Mess that it happened.

314
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.250
Kelli Ottnat: Last week during the last week.

315
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:04.770
Kelli Ottnat: Was

316
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:20.190
Kelli Ottnat: Scott and leave. I had met a girl and she was schizophrenia. And I thought about you a lot. I was like, Gosh, I wish I knew what you know what going new.

317
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.170
Kelli Ottnat: Try to help her.

318
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:29.220
Kelli Ottnat: She came and she stayed at our place on the couch for about two days.

319
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:30.990
Kelli Ottnat: And

320
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.950
Kelli Ottnat: She was talking to different people, different voices.

321
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:53.940
Kelli Ottnat: And that that was part of the time when I was, you know, I was asking myself, do I need to leave so that and I did, I, I went to work and just left Scott and Levi there.

322
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.440
Kelli Ottnat: With confidence that God

323
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.150
Kelli Ottnat: Would

324
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:12.930
Kelli Ottnat: Do whatever needs to be done, you know, for this girl so that she could. I was hurt because I felt I felt like you know she wouldn't respond to me shoe and answer any questions.

325
00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:19.740
Kelli Ottnat: But I was thinking, what is she doing, you know, she she come from the streets. She had a little ferret with her and

326
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.150
Kelli Ottnat: She was kind of a mess. You know, just dirty and

327
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.990
Kelli Ottnat: I was like, how you know with all this going on in her head how

328
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:39.180
Kelli Ottnat: How is she going to be able to take care of herself and where she can go you know this. You need to stay here. Do I need to go.

329
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.260
Kelli Ottnat: She's at a shelter now.

330
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:54.450
Kelli Ottnat: But how is she going to be able to to get up and go to work and care for herself, you know,

331
00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is going to be sarcastic. However, does she live without you, Kelly.

332
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Look what that does to her.

333
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:08.160
The

334
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Schizophrenia is and some people don't really get this. It really is. It is an organic brain.

335
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.910
Kelli Ottnat: Disease, which means

336
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not because of a family system made this person crazy it is organic

337
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, don't work rationally. It doesn't mean we can't connect with them. It just means that we can't assume that being dirty down for them. What if what being what if being dirty means that it keeps evil spirits away.

338
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoops.

339
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I couldn't hear you but you see what I'm trying to get out the way when you're talking about a cognitive disorder like this.

340
00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your logic.

341
00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: As if it's right. You wanna were she's still human. Which means connection but she's probably acutely aware that very few people get

342
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What her way of viewing the world is even though we think that you were looking away a minute ago that being clean makes more sense. That doesn't mean that's what it means for her maybe being clean is a threat, maybe being dirty protects her from radiation.

343
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't know what the ferret does what dirty what staying homeless does for her. That's where we meet that brain disorder. We don't come in with our preconceived notions of right and wrong, we can connect with people about

344
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me learn more about this is where that choose curiosity over being right thing is really convenient. It means that I can connect with someone who gets a frantic. I'm not going to apply my logic. I'm going to want to understand

345
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you something. She's got a lot of resilience and she could I quickly live on my own on the street.

346
00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, but man, I don't know. I would not like that. But she's got a lot of stuff doesn't she, she knows what to do, how to capitalize on resources, how to how to move from shelter to shelter. How to do. She's managed to get this far, this long.

347
00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: See people strength not there deficiency. She's managed to adapt to a culture in a society that doesn't, it doesn't fit her way of viewing meaning and she's still alive.

348
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: She probably self medicating with various you know marijuana or alcohol or something to try and medicate some some dissonance, but

349
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's organic. That's the main piece I want people to know it's it's not because of the crazy family system. And that's a fairly recent thing when I went to school, they still were teaching

350
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That it was family system.

351
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That cause it's not

352
00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:54.300
Organic

353
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: brain disease. That's it.

354
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What help at all.

355
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.570
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, okay.

356
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: See her strength. What does she already. Do you know how does she live without Kelly Kelly's gonna help

357
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: She'd asked you.

358
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm trying to say like

359
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We can say

360
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what are you already doing. You know what's next, what's up for you, you know, what are you looking forward to tomorrow. How do you enjoy the homelessness. Do you like this. Do you like that. Some people will come and tell you. I like it. I like the freedom

361
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.140
Kelli Ottnat: See, she wouldn't speak a word and

362
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:35.820
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah.

363
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:45.420
Kelli Ottnat: I was kind of sad to see her go because I was just kind of observing her and just doing what I normally do.

364
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.450
Kelli Ottnat: You know, at the house.

365
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.400
Kelli Ottnat: But I was also trying to

366
00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.470
Kelli Ottnat: Kind of protect her sort of

367
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you hang out with the ferret. Did you get to know her, her pet.

368
00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.320
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, a little bit.

369
00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Did she seemed like

370
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:13.770
Kelli Ottnat: She didn't really

371
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: In college,

372
00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.250
Right.

373
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Now how is for us, we come to the end of the hour. How is it relevant to this, this young

374
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Woman, tell me how it's all connected to your, your current struggle.

375
00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.600
Kelli Ottnat: I'm just wondering if if I wasn't there with Scott if

376
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.780
Kelli Ottnat: Maybe he could help her out and

377
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: He could channel his enabling into another woman.

378
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead, he could, he could go help someone

379
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.820
Kelli Ottnat: Well, I mean, just

380
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.820
Kelli Ottnat: I was, I was a mess when I met him and

381
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.280
Kelli Ottnat: Him just being there.

382
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:16.890
Kelli Ottnat: Was good

383
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Kelly, but the tricky part. The part that nobody likes to look at if the recipe is that He's the hero, it means you've got to be the victim in the mess.

384
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess.

385
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to grow.

386
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:44.970
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, I do. I want to grow on with my with Jude. You know, I can't really say kids, but with yeah

387
00:42:46.350 --> 00:43:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's the tricky part. That's where this the solid roles of hero rescuer victim at it. That's where they get stuck. That's how it entered. That's how the relationship started but you want to, you want to opt out of that.

388
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's hard but

389
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: He may not wanted to change. He may need you to stay a mess.

390
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

391
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Or he may turn into the victim and then put you in the rescuer or he may relapse so that you come back, and then you're the hero.

392
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, but that's flip flopping both of them dysfunctional. Sorry, what they are. There's a way out. There's coach okay there's students. There's, I want to learn more. Don't do it for me. I want to do it myself. I want to learn. That's a different role than

393
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take care of me.

394
00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, there's a real difference

395
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I was thinking about you got over there.

396
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants to think about

397
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything I can do.

398
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Or just keep doing what we're doing.

399
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:16.710
Kelli Ottnat: Keep doing what we're doing.

400
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

401
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another appointment.

402
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any medication bridge to today, or you have it all the way to group.

403
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.000
Kelli Ottnat: I have it to group.

404
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Spot I'm gone gone gone gone gone gone. What about

405
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to group.

406
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going on Fridays, or on Mondays and

407
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:48.270
Kelli Ottnat: Fridays.

408
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, so we're meeting today. I don't think that's going to work out.

409
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see people in the same day as a group.

410
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to show Monday.

411
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:00.660
Kelli Ottnat: I'll go to group on Monday.

412
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But your normal group is right right here at 12 o'clock today. Typically not. Right.

413
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that was my error. I don't. I've got clients I forget, I forget work people's groups are you guys to be you're all in one great big half the group. We're all you know it all gets moved in my head. So I'm sorry about that. So here's what I will do

414
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So that makes me think that maybe I should message. Dr. Solomon and say, hey,

415
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to need need enough medicine to get her to to group. But before we commit to

416
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What you just said, what if we, what if you stuck with your group being

417
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You know 12 o'clock, that's fine.

418
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we met at

419
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Two to

420
00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: On Monday.

421
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you just stick with your Friday group April 24

422
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the net next Monday. So it'd be a nice quick turnaround. I would see you quite quickly. You'd have Saturday, you'd have Sunday pass, and then I would see you on Monday. What would that be like

423
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.360
Kelli Ottnat: Okay. Good work.

424
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you can. I'd like to see if we can do some, some of the techniques.

425
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you set the phone down and we can maybe, I don't know if it's going to be desensitization. I don't know what it's going to be. But, see if you can create that scenario, if not that's fine too.

426
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's see what's possible. Alright, so here's what I have. I'm gonna let me do it. Now, before I forget, I forget. Let me send the doc, the message.

427
00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And so to 10 just a few minutes after it'll give me time to just go grab some food. Sometimes I don't get to eat.

428
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't carve out time for it even that 10 minutes can really make a difference. So she hasn't been around for 10 it to 10

429
00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.480

Gwenevere Abriel: How did that happen.

435
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:07.650
Kelli Ottnat: That's still from the doctor.

436
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.080

Kelli Ottnat: So I'm not gonna go to group today.

Gwenevere Abriel: You can do. Here's what I would like. I will tell you, I want to introduce I'd like you to be there. I just, I won't

442
00:48:53.520 --> 00:49:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't bill for it and I'll tell the doctor, not to build either. So what I'd like you to do is be there because I'd like you to hear because I'm going over something today that I'd like you to hear

443
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But I he and I just want bill for

444
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't happen very often but

445
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is a mistake I made a mistake and I booked to on a day that normally you would have group.

Gwenevere Abriel: So you're as far as writing anything down, it'll be 210 next Monday. And again, if you can have a setting.

449
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you have your phone plunk down somewhere. And if we get to it. I don't know that we would get to it, but eventually be nice to have.

450
00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: The option to do some em, Dr. I will get to that are not Kelly. Do you think you're gonna you think you're going to stay a month. Are you going to leave. How long do you think you're going to say. You really don't know.

451
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:07.020
Kelli Ottnat: I'll probably stick. I'm going to stick around as long as

452
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.200
Kelli Ottnat: As long as I'm not told to leave.

453
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:28.050
Kelli Ottnat: There's yeah I'm going to stick around. There's no way that I can just go down to Louisiana and get Jude right away. I just don't have the resources to do that right now. So I am going to stick around for a little while.

454
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would anybody ask you believe what would that wherever that come from.

455
00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Who

456
00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.540
Kelli Ottnat: I guess I'm just afraid to be in the way and

457
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

458
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.640
Kelli Ottnat: Yeah, it's all

459
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The way you talk more about that because that might be

460
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be your imagination, possibly

461
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Might not real. I don't know, let's let's find out more about where you're getting your information on that.

462
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

463
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe that's not coming from directly from anyone. Maybe you're picking up on signs. Maybe the signs aren't really there maybe maybe something else is going on in there.

464
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep talking. I get to see on Monday today to

465
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait it so that was my timing. If the group is at 12 is that in an hour.

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll see you in an hour.
