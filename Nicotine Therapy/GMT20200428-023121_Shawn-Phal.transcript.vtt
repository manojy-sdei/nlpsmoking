00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.570
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

2
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.500
Shawn Phalen: Can you hear me.

3
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.330
Tiffanyg: Yeah, okay.

4
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.220
Shawn Phalen: Hey, I'm Sean

5
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:41.700
Tiffanyg: Hi I'm Tiffany I have one question. How long do you think this is going to take, because I didn't realize my daughter has to be picked up at eight o'clock from work.

6
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.100
Shawn Phalen: Will be done.

7
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.960
Tiffanyg: Okay, okay.

8
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.240
Shawn Phalen: What time do you have to leave together.

9
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.410
Tiffanyg: I don't live far so I can leave like a couple minutes people and that'll be fine.

10
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.160
Okay.

11
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.430
Tiffanyg: Even if I'm a couple minutes late. It's fine. I just

12
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.820
Tiffanyg: Don't want to be more like five or 10 minutes late. Okay.

13
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.690
Shawn Phalen: No worries.

14
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:16.290
Shawn Phalen: This should only take about 20 minutes so we'll just we'll go through it. So I'm one of the therapist separate hearts and I'm just going to be asking you some background questions. Probably what you've been asked before.

15
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.400
Tiffanyg: Just for for me. So I have the information

16
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.420
Shawn Phalen: And then also we can talk about. Have you ever had. Individual therapy before

17
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.750
Tiffanyg: Lots of times. Yes. Okay. And are you seeing anybody right now. No anymore. I was seeing Vinnie Capello at the clinic here, but then

18
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.070
Tiffanyg: Because I had progress so long we just decided I didn't need to come anymore because the group setting with Tony was working well for me without just counseling also

19
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.210
Okay.

20
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.400
Shawn Phalen: Um, so what bright heart is requiring is that each person meet with a therapist at least twice a month.

21
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.910
Tiffanyg: Really, yeah.

22
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.340
Shawn Phalen: So, um,

23
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.140
Tiffanyg: You told me this will be a one time.

24
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.020
Tiffanyg: Boy, man. So

25
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:15.540
Shawn Phalen: Let's just go through this and then we can talk about it. Okay. Okay. So tell me, like, what brought you to break her why now.

26
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.800
Tiffanyg: I've been in the Suboxone program for four years and just transferred over right okay

27
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.990
Tiffanyg: So you've been on Suboxone and it works really well for you. Yeah.

28
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.460
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so what was your drug of choice.

29
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.780
Tiffanyg: Um, well, a long time ago used to be math. And then I went from math to doing pills.

30
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.180
Tiffanyg: And that was what originally got me in the program.

31
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.980
Shawn Phalen: All right, what kind of pills are you taking

32
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.170
Tiffanyg: Like Norco or Percocet.

33
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.530
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, right. And how many pills a day where you take it.

34
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.080
Tiffanyg: Actually, the most that I ever took in a day was 10. Okay, so how long, how much clean time do you have

35
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.490
Tiffanyg: Off of opiates. Yeah, I'm April 10 was my three years.

36
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.020
Tiffanyg: Okay.

37
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.910
Shawn Phalen: That's great, really good.

38
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.600
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. And so you're obviously doing the groups.

39
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.880
Tiffanyg: Yeah I do, once a month with Dr groups, but I do twice a week with them. Tony Costa

40
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.430
Tiffanyg: rica crew. Yeah.

41
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.760
Shawn Phalen: Okay with you on

42
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.530
Tiffanyg: Wednesday and Friday.

43
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.650
Shawn Phalen: How come you doing to

44
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.140
Tiffanyg: Because I've been in the program for three or four years, basically.

45
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.370
Shawn Phalen: Okay. All right, so

46
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.200
Shawn Phalen: All right, so tell me how long, how long have you been using math.

47
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.850
Tiffanyg: On and off. I was like 10 years

48
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:19.800
Tiffanyg: And it would be like a year or two here, there, and then I quit for a while and then I go back to using here and there. Um, it started out because I'm originally, I didn't know I had an underactive thyroid and I was always tired and I couldn't keep up with five kids so right now.

49
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.350
Tiffanyg: And I've had a lot of trauma.

50
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.610
Tiffanyg: throughout my life.

51
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.230
Tiffanyg: Okay.

52
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.270
Shawn Phalen: Have you talked about the trauma and

53
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.440
Tiffanyg: Oh, yeah.

54
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.850
Shawn Phalen: And then, how long have you been taking the pills.

55
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.290
Tiffanyg: Um, I think it was only for about two years okay so

56
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.480
Tiffanyg: Originally originally I had

57
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:52.020
Tiffanyg: Injured my shoulder. I didn't have evidence, but I was pretty sure that my drink got rufino at the bar because i don't i

58
00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:04.260
Tiffanyg: Actually took my own alcohol and mixed drink myself, but I left it on the table to go to the bathroom and when I came back I chugged it and it was only my second drink, and then I literally got like

59
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:22.380
Tiffanyg: Probably eight blocks from where I was. And then I don't remember really anything except for when my cousin showed up and tried to pick me up my shoulder hurt really bad. And he said that he popped it back into place. So originally that's what started all of it. Okay.

60
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.360
Tiffanyg: Okay, honestly.

61
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:34.860
Tiffanyg: That wasn't what got me into the program at the clinic. I was actually trying to quit doing opiates on my own, but I'm

62
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.000
Tiffanyg: One of my daughters was seduced by when she was 12 by a 22 year old male and

63
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:57.240
Tiffanyg: I'm my son stopped that. And then a few months later, my daughter. That's a year and a half, older than her was raped by a 35 year old male, and then a few months after that, the guy who was dating at the time. Baby Mama, excuse me, I'm a child.

64
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.160
Tiffanyg: I have been molested as a child myself. So all of this.

65
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:15.930
Tiffanyg: Like was kind of overwhelming and what had happened was I had taken a bunch of my own prescription medications and tried to overdose, because I reached out to CPS asking what I can you know get help with no return phone calls and

66
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.930
Tiffanyg: My mom thought that I was just high on drugs and said, if you don't get checked yourself into a program

67
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.280
Tiffanyg: You're not going to like the results. I'm like, I don't need to check into a program I need mental health help. And at that time I didn't trust.

68
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:41.580
Tiffanyg: The mental health here because the lady, I was working for was really good friends with the director and I would overhear them talking about patients, which is against the law. You don't talk about first and last name so

69
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.450
Tiffanyg: I had really no other you know outlets, nobody was listening to me.

70
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:55.230
Tiffanyg: Right, so it was really kind of a shitty situation because had CPS phone back any one of those five times that I had called I wouldn't have tried to overdose.

71
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.690
Tiffanyg: So,

72
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.390
Shawn Phalen: Did your kids get taken at all, or did

73
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.520
Tiffanyg: It for six weeks. Yeah.

74
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.630
Tiffanyg: But I, I only gave them the the clinic or not the clinic with the

75
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:23.490
Tiffanyg: CPS people only gave them to dirty test the whole time that I had a case. And I told him it was in the very beginning I had been clean and then I gone to a huge fight with my mom and her husband and I ended up using

76
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.310
Tiffanyg: That time. And then one other time after that. And I told them, you're never going to get another dirty test for me and they didn't

77
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.850
Shawn Phalen: Okay, who has the kids are they with family or was it

78
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.060
Tiffanyg: They were with my mom, but she is married to someone that's registered sex offender. So she couldn't keep them.

79
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:53.310
Tiffanyg: Which the circumstances behind what happened with him. I don't believe he should have went to prison because it was his knees and the

80
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.220
Tiffanyg: She was a pathological liar tried to do it to for the people, people after he was sent to prison.

81
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:12.000
Tiffanyg: He just took a plea bargain, so he could be in his kids his lives when you know when they were teenagers instead of for the rest of his life to be in jail so I don't believe that what happened, but it's still the fact that that

82
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:21.120
Tiffanyg: Made it to where she couldn't have my kids. She never thought about that when she never thought that would make me feel being a child that was molested and

83
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.960
Tiffanyg: That was like the hardest thing for her to get she just wanted to be happy. And it's like, but you don't understand how that makes me feel

84
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:38.040
Tiffanyg: How people look at me when I was molested as a child and now you're married to somebody that has that title and she just the life of her couldn't understand it.

85
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.790
Shawn Phalen: So do you have contact with your mom now.

86
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.950
Tiffanyg: We have a lot better relationship. Now that I've been in the program for longer and

87
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:56.520
Tiffanyg: We there's certain things that we don't necessarily talk about because it's touchy subjects and she's been through a lot because

88
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:10.230
Tiffanyg: Her husband decided to start using to so now she's a kind of seeing that it's not as simple as she thought to just quit because that's what she. Why can't you just wait. Why can't you just quit well

89
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.000
Tiffanyg: It's she

90
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.810
Shawn Phalen: Does she have any addiction issues herself now okay she

91
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.160
Tiffanyg: Never she never been a drinker never smoked pot never done any kind of drugs now.

92
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.110
Tiffanyg: When she was prescribed her prescription

93
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.510
Tiffanyg: Bike it in. She won't even take but a quarter of one at a time. So,

94
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.790
Shawn Phalen: And then do you would have it siblings. Do you have siblings that you're

95
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:44.730
Tiffanyg: Biologically, I have one brother with the same mother and father, and then another brother that has the same dad. Okay.

96
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.140
Are you close

97
00:09:47.370 --> 00:10:02.070
Tiffanyg: No, no, no, what with what half brother lives in Texas. I'm more close to him than my my actual brother that I grew up with, because he is turning out to be a womanizing person just like my dad. Hmm.

98
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.840
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so, um,

99
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:18.840
Shawn Phalen: So how many times have you been in treatment before you got on Suboxone. Have you tried previous times. No, no. So this is really

100
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:27.510
Tiffanyg: Like no, because I i did it on my own and I went, several years without doing anything until I got injured and it wasn't like

101
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:39.180
Tiffanyg: I did it on purpose because my accident the injury was considered alcohol related they wouldn't prescribe me anything and I physically couldn't work a job or do anything.

102
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:54.180
Tiffanyg: Because the pain was so much and and the person I worked for was a physical therapist. So I was even going to physical therapy, and it was still hard to do any of the work and with not nothing for the pain and not able to cope it i mean

103
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.190
Tiffanyg: I bought him off the street.

104
00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.640
Shawn Phalen: Are you working now.

105
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.800
Tiffanyg: No, I have that job for a few years and I'm

106
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.680
Tiffanyg: After

107
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:16.290
Tiffanyg: I think after I got fired I that's when I started to a little bit more pills here and there. And that's kind of, you know,

108
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.300
Tiffanyg: What led things never

109
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.990
Tiffanyg: saw me doing them and told my mom.

110
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.420
Tiffanyg: And she was the one that turned me

111
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.450
Shawn Phalen: She turned you into

112
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.410
DPS

113
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:43.380
Tiffanyg: When when i when i overdose. She thought I was just high on pills and I told her I wasn't, I tried to overdose, because I tried to tell her everything that happened, and she just didn't want to listen to me.

114
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:55.890
Tiffanyg: Nobody at that time was listening to me it was like one of the hardest things to go through. I mean even the cops didn't even physically do a report about my daughter's rape.

115
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:02.940
Tiffanyg: And CPS was even supposed to get to the bottom of it and never nothing ever came of it ever

116
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.570
Tiffanyg: And not okay.

117
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.660
Shawn Phalen: Do you wear. Who do you live with now.

118
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.480
Tiffanyg: Myself and my daughter.

119
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:18.330
Tiffanyg: Okay. How old is she, she is going to be 18 in December.

120
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:20.130
Okay.

121
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:32.910
Tiffanyg: But hardest for me was knowing what I had been through and trying to talk to my daughter about the experiences.

122
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:51.450
Tiffanyg: And how to cope with it and she wouldn't speak to nobody. And because I tried to overdose. I had to tell people why and part of that was because of what happened to her and she felt like I betrayed her. So by me helping myself I'm losing my daughter's trust this whole time.

123
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.930
Tiffanyg: Was really hard.

124
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.630
Shawn Phalen: When did you try an overdose.

125
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.800
Tiffanyg: Oh, it's been over four years now. Okay.

126
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.820
Shawn Phalen: So the

127
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.390
Time.

128
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.520
Shawn Phalen: Your other kids.

129
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.850
Tiffanyg: They're all I only have one other one that's under 18 the rest of them are all 18 now.

130
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.920
Tiffanyg: Okay, where's

131
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.000
Tiffanyg: Anywhere younger one he was with his dad. Okay.

132
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.740
Shawn Phalen: And do you have to contact with them.

133
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.030
Tiffanyg: Yeah, yesterday was the 15th birthday, actually. Okay.

134
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.460
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so any legal issues that you're dealing with now and

135
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.100
Tiffanyg: Actually, I just happen to get a DUI for weed.

136
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:36.900
Shawn Phalen: When

137
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:50.790
Tiffanyg: I like a week and a half ago, and I was pretty upset because I literally had only it was mostly CBD and I'd only taken two hits, but the officer pulled me over because I had my high beams on

138
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:59.010
Tiffanyg: He literally made me do the breathalyzer didn't believe that I hadn't been drinking past the breathalyzer and still made me go give him my blood.

139
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.290
And so they

140
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:14.010
Tiffanyg: Know that they haven't even got the results back. No, he just said because I told him that I had taken a couple hits earlier. He was arrested me for DUI.

141
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.070
Shawn Phalen: Did you get arrested or cited

142
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:24.630
Tiffanyg: No, I went to jail for five friggin hours and I wasn't even stoned. I was so mad because it was late at night. I couldn't see

143
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.120
Tiffanyg: On the road that I was driving down to find the road that I was trying to get to my high beams on

144
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:39.450
Tiffanyg: This car comes up fast, so I didn't look him up fast enough. And I realized is a cop and he flips around so I passed the road that I was going to, and he pulls me over.

145
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:48.120
Tiffanyg: And as we do all these fields ready test and flip flops no jacket. I'm literally shivering. And I'm like, I can't do this and

146
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:57.690
Tiffanyg: Let's see. No, he gives me the breathalyzer, I'm like, am I going to jail. And he's like, hold on just a minute. And he's like, okay, it was zeros, like you said,

147
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:07.530
Tiffanyg: And I was like okay and so I'm thinking, Is he gonna let me go what's going on. Next thing I know, he says, Put your hands behind your back. I'm taking your jail for DUI.

148
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.370
Shawn Phalen: Do you have a card.

149
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.190
Tiffanyg: No, but it's legal here.

150
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:15.900
Right.

151
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.230
Tiffanyg: And I was unaware that

152
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.160
Tiffanyg: You're supposed to wait four hours before driving

153
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:36.480
Tiffanyg: Which seems a little long, because we doesn't even keep you high for that long, and especially if it's mainly CBD CBD is not supposed to be considered the same

154
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:47.040
Tiffanyg: And I specifically said, so what happens is when you get that blood work back though, it shows my levels are super low for weed and he's like, it's not gonna matter.

155
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:56.340
Tiffanyg: How, then, why'd you need to take my blood, you know, it doesn't make sense. I think he was just trying to railroad me because I was by myself, honestly.

156
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:05.700
Tiffanyg: Oh, and not mentioning he asked me what other prescriptions. I was on and the moment that I said Suboxone oh you're coming off of heroin.

157
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:22.950
Tiffanyg: I'm like, I've never touched heroin in my life and it's like he didn't believe that Suboxone can be used for pain or opiates, it's only for heroin. And so the misconception by law enforcement here is horrible. Yeah.

158
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.090
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so you have a court date coming up.

159
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.080
July.

160
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.340
Shawn Phalen: Okay, you have an attorney.

161
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:39.750
Tiffanyg: Not yet, because that's the first coordinate because of all the coven 19 they pushed it out for a while.

162
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:42.780
Okay.

163
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.400
Shawn Phalen: Okay, any other addictive behaviors that you had no no

164
00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:16.350
Tiffanyg: No, it was mainly because I wasn't getting the help mentally and any program that I've been in prior to this did not like actually get down to core feelings and like the dynamics were so different. It didn't really help. And until I saw Tony costs and start doing her program.

165
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:32.700
Tiffanyg: Everything just didn't help me. But now, since I've been with Tony and doing everything with that and and being able to talk freely and not feel judged has really made it so much better. Okay. Okay, good.

166
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:40.200
Shawn Phalen: So are you are you wanting individual therapy. Are you feeling like the groups are good for you.

167
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.420
Tiffanyg: The groups are good for me. I don't feel I need individual counseling right now. Yeah.

168
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:54.060
Tiffanyg: I'd be the first one to tell you I needed if I need it because now that I have other options, you know,

169
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.640
Shawn Phalen: Right. Exactly. Okay. So how often are you smoking weed.

170
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.290
Tiffanyg: Um,

171
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.450
Tiffanyg: Most of the time, just before I go to bed because sometimes I have a hard time falling asleep.

172
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:17.850
Tiffanyg: Okay, I don't usually typically smoke a lot during the day because I don't like I like I just like to be able to feel relaxed and go to sleep. Easy.

173
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.790
Shawn Phalen: Do you have any anxiety.

174
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:36.060
Tiffanyg: Um, I've always thought that I did. But what I was seeing a psychiatrist. She everything she tried to give me what didn't help. I mean, I'm taking 50 milligrams of Zoloft, again, I decided to put myself back on that.

175
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:36.930
Right.

176
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:45.030
Tiffanyg: I was flying for a while without taking it. But then I just felt my emotions and that see that's what makes me want to use is

177
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:57.780
Tiffanyg: When I feel so emotional that I can't handle the emotional emotions. That's what's one of my triggers. So instead of wanting to relapse. I decided why not just go back on the Zoloft and

178
00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.590
Tiffanyg: Well done it.

179
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.380
You know, right. Okay, that's good.

180
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.400
Shawn Phalen: And you've had luck with the Zoloft in the past.

181
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.280
Tiffanyg: Yeah, okay. And who's

182
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.390
Shawn Phalen: Who's the prescribing doctor for you at right her

183
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.970
Tiffanyg: Doctor, Dr. Gross.

184
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:22.560
Shawn Phalen: Okay. Okay. And do you have any questions for me anything you wanted to ask

185
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:31.920
Tiffanyg: Um, if, if, per se. I did want to get individual counseling later on. What I just call in and what I tell boys and girls. How does it work.

186
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.830
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you can just call and say that you want to have an individual counselor. You want individual therapy.

187
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.420
Tiffanyg: Now, what about if there was a crisis situation. Do you guys have those options.

188
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.690
Sometimes we do, sometimes

189
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.870
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. So typically, if you're in crisis. Do you have a record the crisis line.

190
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:52.620
No.

191
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.460
Shawn Phalen: So you guys what county. Are you in

192
00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.810
Tiffanyg: Denmark, I don't. I won't go through mental health, though. Okay.

193
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.050
Shawn Phalen: Hey there should be a crisis hotline.

194
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.960
Tiffanyg: Yeah, it's terminal health which I won't go through that.

195
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:14.190
Tiffanyg: It's very small town, so we don't we have very limited options here. Yeah.

196
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.460
Tiffanyg: That's why I asked, did you guys had a crisis.

197
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.320
Tiffanyg: stuff there.

198
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.750
Shawn Phalen: Yeah we we

199
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:32.100
Tiffanyg: I mean I can always get a hold of Tony if it's super serious and I can't get ahold of anybody through bright heart. I do have that option so

200
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:50.760
Tiffanyg: Okay, but that was like one of my main concerns previously just because I know if something seriously traumatic happens that I will need to talk to somebody. I mean, I, every day I deal with my 22 year old son who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

201
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.850
Tiffanyg: Yeah, because of drug use.

202
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.070
Really, yes.

203
00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.640
Shawn Phalen: Where's he living

204
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:06.300
Tiffanyg: Me technically resides at my mom's but right now he's kind of on the run is a

205
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.870
Tiffanyg: There is in trouble with the law.

206
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.180
Tiffanyg: Well, yeah, he's on

207
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:22.920
Tiffanyg: He's on probation. And then he decided to start smoking weed and drinking again. And just when all this stuff with coven started. He just quit going to everything.

208
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.220
Let's see user

209
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.040
Tiffanyg: Because of his baby mama. Yes.

210
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:38.400
Tiffanyg: He got was somebody that was quite a bit when he was 17 she was 25 and she got pregnant with her fourth child with my son.

211
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:52.710
Tiffanyg: And he she got him into using meth and heroin, but I don't think he really used heroin. Very often, it was more so meth, or if it was mixed it or something, I don't know.

212
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.140
Shawn Phalen: And he's 22

213
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.510
Tiffanyg: You just turned 22 in March. Yeah.

214
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.690
Tiffanyg: Just mental illness running his family, no, not like that. No.

215
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:15.540
Tiffanyg: Medication. Mm hmm. Yeah, but he he started having the issues right when I started the program at the clinic so

216
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.630
Tiffanyg: I like decided instead of holding shit in I was just going to lay everything out.

217
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:35.970
Tiffanyg: And I've been very open and talking about everything with everyone. Everyone knows what's going on. I've been very, you know, felt very comfortable with being able to do that. If I hadn't been able to do that. I don't think I'd be here today. Yeah.

218
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:45.990
Shawn Phalen: Okay, well, I encourage you to continue doing that with the clinic, you know, yeah, you know, keep keep being really honest like you've been

219
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.800
Tiffanyg: Yeah, that will help you. Okay. Yeah.

220
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.370
Shawn Phalen: Okay, well done. That's all I, those are all the questions that I had so

221
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.030
Tiffanyg: Oh, yeah.

222
00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.870
Shawn Phalen: If you ever need or want individual therapy, just let us know.

223
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.830
Tiffanyg: Okay. And who are the counselors for that. Are you one of them.

224
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.130
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. Me, I'm one of them. Yeah.

225
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.710
Tiffanyg: And who else is doing. If you don't mind me asking

226
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:18.900
Shawn Phalen: Um, you know, I'm not sure how many other counselors, they have that are doing individual work. I mean, I know there's probably more than a couple

227
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:21.660
Tiffanyg: Into call

228
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.270

229
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:36.840
Tiffanyg: Okay, yeah, you can just call an ass if you need it. Okay, awesome. I do need to go though because she just called me she's off early.

230
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:39.990
Shawn Phalen: Take care.

231
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:48.510
Tiffanyg: Actually, can you tell me one thing you're no with it. Can you see if it says when my next appointment with Dr groves is

232
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.130
Shawn Phalen: It doesn't show me.

233
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:55.530
Tiffanyg: Okay, I'll just call the virtual clinic and ask them, I think it's the six but I'm not sure.

234
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.930
Tiffanyg: Okay. All right. All right.

235
00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.700
Tiffanyg: Thank you, Sean.
