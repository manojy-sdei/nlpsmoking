Bethany: Hi, how are you

2
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:11.430
Magalie Marcellus: Good. You

3
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.590
Bethany: Are doing very well. Thank you.

4
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.320
Magalie Marcellus: How's the family doing

5
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.450
Bethany: Pretty good.

6
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:33.150
Bethany: My daughter. See where she had to go to the emergency room. She they found out that she's got double kidney infection and one kidney is swollen so large that they're kind of concerned that she could possibly have done some damage.

7
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.310
Bethany: So they're thinking about maybe going in and putting some stints in to relieve some of the pressure

8
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.500
Bethany: I mean other than that, you know, just just kind of a worry with her being pregnant.

9
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:43.860
Bethany: No.

10
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.110
Magalie Marcellus: She had a lot of problems with their

11
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.100
Bethany: first pregnancy.

12
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.980
Magalie Marcellus: Oh wow, it's just a hospital.

13
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.490
Bethany: Yeah, then they let her come home late last night.

14
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.210
Magalie Marcellus: Oh my gosh, I'm showing all

15
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:07.230
Bethany: The she's very tired. And that's, that's another thing her blood pressure. She's been having trouble. She's has a heart condition that they found with our first pregnancy.

16
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:19.230
Bethany: They said that her heart's not pumping enough blood for her and the baby and whenever she stands up she gets dizzy and passes out her blood pressure goes up or pulse goes down.

17
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:34.440
Bethany: I dropped just sorry but yeah everything's kind of backwards. You know, it's like her. Her policy goes up or blood pressure goes down, and it's just having a lot of problems with her heart and blood pressure.

18
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:34.650
And

19
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.570
Bethany: So just taking it one day at a time, hoping everything works out.

20
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.470
Magalie Marcellus: With this nice man bed works.

21
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:53.640
Bethany: Well, she's supposed to be that she's stubborn and she doesn't always do it, she's usually up working around the house and doing things she had to take off work, of course, but

22
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.150
Bethany: But yeah, she's pretty stubborn.

23
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.080
Magalie Marcellus: So one more complication. She has to take it easy.

24
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.190
Magalie Marcellus: Right.

25
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.360
Bethany: That's what I tell her.

26
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:18.930
Bethany: The other night when I took her, she was really concerned because she was spotting and things too. And, you know, she thought maybe it was problem with the baby. But it turned out it was just you know her.

27
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.820
Bethany: Or semester.

28
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.040
Bethany: That's where the blood was coming from.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.520
Magalie Marcellus: Half hour long is she

30
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.470
Bethany: She's four months.

47
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.090

Magalie Marcellus: Bad about whether

Magalie Marcellus: Well, so are you moved into your

66
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.760
Bethany: No, no we we've already been in our own home.

67
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.690
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, good. So that's a big splash.

68
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.700
Bethany: Know. Yeah, definitely.

69
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.830
Magalie Marcellus: Yes, man. You're, you're on area now have to worry

70
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.860
Magalie Marcellus: About the housing situation.

71
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.840
Magalie Marcellus: So you got most of the thing fix

72
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.690
Bethany: Oh yeah, mm hmm. Yep.

73
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.780
Magalie Marcellus: And has the husband on

74
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.060
Bethany: Pretty well.

75
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.100
Bethany: I was a little concerned last couple nights has sugar kind of spiked up but

76
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:55.440
Bethany: I just kind of treated it with the Nova log again because they've got him on the land is at night Nova log through the day.

77
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:14.220
Bethany: For coverage and he kind of spiked up a little high. Last couple of nights, but I don't know if it's just kind of stress of things, or what's going on, but it, it went up on him. And you know, I got it back down. I gave him a couple extra units of insulin and control it, but

78
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.700
Bethany: I was just kind of worried that maybe he had some kind of

79
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.300
Bethany: You know infection viral something going on you know that

80
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:30.630
Bethany: Causes like a because he's been really tired and not feeling good, too. So I'm hoping it's nothing like that. I'm hoping, hoping it's just a fluke.

81
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.110
Magalie Marcellus: Is a steelworker

82
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.540
Bethany: No, not right now. He's like,

83
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.550
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

84
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.400
Magalie Marcellus: So you both.

85
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.330
Magalie Marcellus: You help taking care of them.

86
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.290
Yeah.

87
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:54.660
Bethany: Yeah, I pretty much do the diabetes checks and control it and making keep on it because if I wouldn't he wouldn't do it.

88
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:05.190
Magalie Marcellus: It's a good thing that he has. He has a support because the especially the diabetes, you really have to be on top of it.

89
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.680
Magalie Marcellus: Right, so say stable.

90
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.030
Ryan.

91
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.430
Bethany: Yeah, when I worked in the hospital I were to the hospital for about eight years and

92
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:32.400
Bethany: I'm constantly on to him telling me you know you can't imagine how many 30 year olds that I've seen that look healthier than you, that I've lost their legs are lost their eyesight, you know, just by not controlling their diabetes and it's so easy to control if you just do it.

93
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.540
Yeah.

94
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.220
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

95
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.080
Magalie Marcellus: You're right.

96
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.680
Magalie Marcellus: Sometimes, some people need that push

97
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.360
Magalie Marcellus: Them through

98
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:50.820
Bethany: Then yeah, every time I get on to him, he'll look at me when I get done barking at him and he'll say well that's what I've got you for

99
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.840
Bethany: Watching, I guess.

100
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.360
Magalie Marcellus: Sounds like he appreciate you being on on top. Oh.

101
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.160
Bethany: No, yeah, we've been together 29 years we've been together since we were 15

102
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.380
Magalie Marcellus: You guys have a strong bond.

103
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:17.040
Bethany: Know, yeah. Yeah, we're best friends. Anything I guess been together 29 years and

104
00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.020
Bethany: Worked at it.

105
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:27.270
Bethany: We worked at a plan together for, I guess, about six years and then when he started driving truck. I started working back in the hospital again.

106
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:41.640
Bethany: And he went on the road for about three years and wanted me to quit and go on the road with him and just see the country because I had never really been out of Ohio and I quit work and went on the road with him for about eight or nine years so

107
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.210
Bethany: We, we had a role was really good. Yeah.

108
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.710
Bethany: A lot of people said, I can't imagine being stuck with my spouse in a

109
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.820
Bethany: Truck you know

110
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.590
Magalie Marcellus: A month and working for that long.

111
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.960
Bethany: But I said,

112
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.700
Magalie Marcellus: We have to have a good

113
00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.020
Magalie Marcellus: Connection to do it.

114
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:04.230
Bethany: Yeah, we actually got along probably better in the truck and what we do out of it. And we just work as a good team.

115
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.540
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

116
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.330
Magalie Marcellus: And that's what keeps you guys strong because you have a good relationship.

117
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.070
Magalie Marcellus: So I'm as a program or going for you.

118
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.480
Bethany: Excellent. I haven't had any problems.

119
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:32.490
Bethany: I'm very happy. I just feel like it saved my life really. I really I've said that before. I've always said that

120
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:48.510
Bethany: I feel like the medication. I mean, it saved my life because I would get down to a point that you know you're so sick. You just, you just don't, don't. I mean, death would be a welcome you know i mean you're that sick and I don't ever want to go back to that again.

121
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.100
Bethany: And, you know,

122
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.190
Bethany: So to me it was a lifesaver. It's been a lifesaver.

123
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.180
Magalie Marcellus: And

124
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.670
Magalie Marcellus: Understand, no, we get the

125
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:08.280
Magalie Marcellus: Patient or Surgeries often on. I know there was a recent survey completed back in March, early March.

126
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:16.740
Magalie Marcellus: Shift. I just wanted to confirm how you felt with some of the

127
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:34.770
Magalie Marcellus: The question the statements and how would you felt felt the same way, because one of the question is, he has satisfied are you with the amount of help you receive and it's we have one as the as the score that you

128
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.600
Magalie Marcellus: Selected. So I just wanted to know what was going on at the time.

129
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.520
Bethany: What which

130
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.750
Bethany: Which question. Was it

131
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:54.840
Magalie Marcellus: Is said that has satisfied are you with the model that you receive from the on the program. So one is the lowest so I don't know something was going on.

132
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.560
Bethany: Is that what I

133
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.950
Magalie Marcellus: What we could have a what we could have done differently.

134
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.120
Bethany: Is that what I

135
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:00.870
Magalie Marcellus: Saw you wouldn't

136
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.430
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, it's

137
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.990
Bethany: Just said I think sometimes

138
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.610
Magalie Marcellus: Sometimes that does happen.

139
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.360
Bethany: Because problem. Okay.

140
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:22.020
Magalie Marcellus: Cuz that's why you know we view it with all the patient just to make sure how we can help better if something is not working and what we can do together to

141
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.580
Bethany: Yeah, because I

142
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.050
Magalie Marcellus: Saw points.

143
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.600
Bethany: I've never had a problem. I've always thought it was excellent and research the program and

144
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:36.810
Bethany: The only thing that I remember putting I think like towards the end, ask if there was anything that

145
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:51.900
Bethany: You would improve or could improve, you know, what would it be and the only thing that I've noticed and and I understand, you know, I understand that they're over overly swamped and busy, but it's just kind of a long wait time to get in on the virtual clinic.

146
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.280
Magalie Marcellus: The check in. Yeah.

147
00:18:53.340 --> 00:19:03.150
Bethany: Right. And a lot of times, you know, you're kind of late coming in with. That's why I was a little later tonight coming in and they, they, it took them probably I was on hopefully 13 minutes and

148
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:11.550
Bethany: Yeah, they weren't sure if they had the right number that because they said that your personal number changed, which you know it doesn't bother me, but

149
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:11.640
Magalie Marcellus: I

150
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.920
Magalie Marcellus: had shifted. Oh, no, no.

151
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.130
Bethany: Going to show up this time.

152
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.870
Magalie Marcellus: But, you know, at the fact that I know there's been a bit of a delay and with

153
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.570
Magalie Marcellus: All the things going on in or they may be short with staff as well. So, I get it.

154
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.770
Bethany: Right, right.

155
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.190
Magalie Marcellus: And we

156
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.930
Bethany: And I understand that, too.

157
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.350
Magalie Marcellus: But I know this is always on.

158
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:40.650
Magalie Marcellus: Time is an issue that's always they always recommend to come in a little bit earlier than the appointment time

159
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.450
Magalie Marcellus: And just in case they get swamped.

160
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.750
Magalie Marcellus: With some maybe we'll check in and you just at the time of your appointment and just come in. So the one

161
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.970
Magalie Marcellus: Right. Yeah, I know. It's an

162
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.400
Magalie Marcellus: Ongoing issue they trying to work on.

163
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.640
Bethany: But that's, that's the only

164
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.600
Bethany: Thing that I can

165
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:05.010
Bethany: That I can remember putting down that I had any kind of an issue with but like I said, I understand that you know I

166
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:10.890
Bethany: Like that. So I know people get busy problems, man.

167
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:11.700
Bethany: You know,

168
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.620
Magalie Marcellus: I understand. Right. And sometimes when people are checking the other issue they trying to solve.

169
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.380
Magalie Marcellus: So then, back when delays on the classes.

170
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.340
Magalie Marcellus: Right. And it was things they have to get done in between. So

171
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.030
Bethany: Yeah.

172
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.760
Bethany: That boxing's yeah

173
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.710
I completely understand

174
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:44.280
Magalie Marcellus: And this is why we had that discussion, just in case there is something going on that. I'm not aware of or the program or the staff is not aware of so we can make sure that you know you're successful in a program, whatever that needs to

175
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.600
Magalie Marcellus: Be taken care of.

176
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.080
Bethany: Right, yeah. I don't know why would i would have fit that unless I got it backwards. Did I put the rest of them as as

177
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.790
Bethany: I know everything was

178
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.380
Magalie Marcellus: Fine. Except for that one. So,

179
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:56.610
Magalie Marcellus: Again, maybe just

180
00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.990
Magalie Marcellus: I don't know how

181
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.220
Bethany: It's hard to tell.

182
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:04.980
Magalie Marcellus: This survey is selected, have you go in and do it, or I'm not sure because

183
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.440
Bethany: That's another thing I'm wondering

184
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.790
Bethany: Because it comes in on on our phone and the one that I use in

185
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.460
Bethany: My emails and surveys and things on

186
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.260
Bethany: Is a little older cheaper phone and sometimes it's hard to call a little circles.

187
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:21.270
Magalie Marcellus: So it could have been sad when

188
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.610
Bethany: That happened before. And I'm thinking maybe that's what it was.

189
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:38.280
Magalie Marcellus: It could be because and I still train a lot with that particular question which I'm not sure why is this one. That's give most of the problem with us, but

190
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.350
Magalie Marcellus: Again, just to make sure

191
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.390
Bethany: Ya know,

192
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.550
Magalie Marcellus: That she needs. Okay.

193
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:45.690
Yeah.

194
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.570
Bethany: Yes.

195
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.550
Bethany: There, when you go out

196
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.130
Magalie Marcellus: Places at that time.

197
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:54.690
Bethany: Yeah.

198
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.020
Magalie Marcellus: How's the weather there.

199
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:08.700
Bethany: A little cool, it's probably in the high 60s that storm blew through last night and kind of cooled it down before that it was beautiful was in the 70s mid 70s.

200
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:16.380
Bethany: But it's called it down a little bit. And it's kind of dreary out the sun just did kind of popped through the clouds by about an hour ago.

201
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:17.820
Okay.

202
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.300
Bethany: Easter, whether I guess spring weather.

203
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.600
Magalie Marcellus: So when did you do for Easter.

204
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.920
Not

205
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:27.600
Magalie Marcellus: Ready. Oh.

206
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.160
Bethany: Yeah, stayed home I called my daughter to see how she was feeling, you know, and

207
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.310
Bethany: She ended up getting to come home and they had an Easter egg hunt for Eli that morning that she missed

208
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:38.940
Oh,

209
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:43.890
Magalie Marcellus: Who had the who's on

210
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.060
Bethany: His daddy.

211
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:45.600
Wasn't

212
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.340
Magalie Marcellus: Just him.

213
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:48.960
Bethany: Yeah. Her has

214
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.960
Bethany: He played he

215
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.380
Magalie Marcellus: Kept everything. Oh really.

216
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.580
Bethany: Yeah, I'm pretty fortunate

217
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.100
Bethany: She married a really good guy.

218
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:16.860
Magalie Marcellus: That's good to hear back is very supportive and even though she was India, you still make sure the little one.

219
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.620
Magalie Marcellus: No, yeah, I had a good ISA so that'd be a good partner for sure.

220
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:33.540
Bethany: I wish I worried so much about Otter, because she's so tiny. She's like 90 pounds soaking wet probably five pieces. Yeah. She just said.

221
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:53.250
Bethany: Tiny, tiny little thing and I always worried you know she would get with the wrong guy somebody that be Europe or smack around or but she got with a really, really good guy. And he supported her you know she's in school still and finished her orient degree. She's got her LPN degree and

222
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.530
Bethany: He's really a good guy.

223
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.110
Bethany: So I couldn't have asked for a better son in law.

224
00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.200
Magalie Marcellus: And it sounds like your relationship with your daughter is unproven

225
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:05.940
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, this is

226
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.260
Bethany: A minute, day by day.

227
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:13.740
Magalie Marcellus: Day by day. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, for her to give you the

228
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:20.130
Magalie Marcellus: To allow you to take care of your grandson. So that's a big step.

229
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.200
Bethany: Oh, yeah. Yeah, because

230
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:28.980
Bethany: She's still once in a while my, you know, kind of cop an attitude with me or whatever, if we get to talk him, but we're smoothing through

231
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:39.390
Magalie Marcellus: Well, and I already have their personalities and, you know, things may come up. But is there anything in particular that she's uncomfortable about

232
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.890
Magalie Marcellus: With you being with

233
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:42.210
her grandson.

234
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:50.970
Bethany: I don't think so. I think she's just more let down that you know when she found out because I'd kept it hidden for so long and

235
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.490
Bethany: You know, she just never thought of me like

236
00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:53.790
Bethany: That

237
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.450
Bethany: Because I was always kind of this straight laced with me, you know, and

238
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.030
Bethany: really pushed him to do well in school and

239
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.950
Bethany: You know, do everything right.

240
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.150
Bethany: And work and you know I was always working, never, never missed work and

241
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.710
Bethany: I always tried to

242
00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:14.310
Bethany: To, you know, do good at work and move up and she just never thought of me like that. And I think it kind of let her down.

243
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.000
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, you guys when building that trust.

244
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:34.980
Magalie Marcellus: And that is sometimes. Everybody have their own timeframe as unlike you know she says that you don't want, you need to do to take over yourself in that she can feel comfortable with getting back to things the way they were

245
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.360
Right.

246
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:47.040
Magalie Marcellus: So I know everything's up with the. Did you ever get a chance to work with a census program before

247
00:25:49.050 --> 00:26:02.040
Bethany: They pushed it back until last last email. I've got from him. I'm thinking they said tentatively like may 16 but you know as long as this is going on. It's probably going to get

248
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.050
Magalie Marcellus: Delayed yeah

249
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:08.100
Magalie Marcellus: Because nobody can nobody is a house and build account.

250
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.750
Bethany: Right, right.

251
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.120
Bethany: For

252
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:17.640
Magalie Marcellus: You during oval with this because I know everybody's DeLeon definitely

253
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.430
Magalie Marcellus: A concern.

254
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:27.570
Bethany: Know, believe it or not, I'm, I'm kind of not one of them that runs out my toilet paper and by no I just

255
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.430
Bethany: Day by day.

256
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:43.380
Bethany: You know, I'm a firm believer that it's it's dangerous. I think mail, you know, handling mail that and change and money that's going to be dealing with it, everybody really needs to think about, you know,

257
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.160
Magalie Marcellus: Yet

258
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.730
Bethany: Constantly washing your hands constantly sanitizing and

259
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:54.150
Bethany: You know, just just playing it smart and common sense you know that's that's all I think we can ask or

260
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.470
Bethany: I'm

261
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:03.630
Magalie Marcellus: All about. That's a good answer, because this right now. You can't control what's what's going on. We just

262
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.180
Magalie Marcellus: Exactly. Find a way to adjust

263
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.670
Magalie Marcellus: You know, you're like now.

264
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.500
Magalie Marcellus: Do you guys have to wear masks on your area when you go out

265
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.780
Bethany: And it's it's recommended

266
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.570
Bethany: It's yeah it's recommended and

267
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.800
Bethany: We always do.

268
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.980
Bethany: You know, my daughter always does with a little boy and

269
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.760
Bethany: Yeah. So yeah, just to be say it's an extra precautionary

270
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:33.450
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm. And is your son. I'm not using your husband easy one out. So there's no it's

271
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.920
Bethany: Not very often.

272
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.410
Bethany: He, he's a little more scared of it.

273
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.710
Magalie Marcellus: I wish I can understand

274
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.390
Magalie Marcellus: You know, right, they should be with any kind of underlying condition.

275
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:54.660
Bethany: Yeah, what's a diabetes. And plus he's had pneumonia and things before. So it's better kind of safe than sorry. I mean, he will go out, but he preferred all

276
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.730
Magalie Marcellus: Men and if you don't have to. The best thing is to see how

277
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.900
Bethany: Exactly.

278
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:08.040
Magalie Marcellus: It should be if there's another feminine, but I can pick up certain things on this need medical or things like that. Yeah, which is

279
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.870
Bethany: Which so that's like what was so tough, you know, it was my daughter has kind of taking her and

280
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.570
Bethany: Then sit in the parking lot and waiting and trying to you know wait to hear what's going on and running in and out.

281
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.450
Bethany: Became and began. Right. Well, that's

282
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.580
Bethany: Not even a triage so

283
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.590
Bethany: It was kind of nerve wracking.

284
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:30.030
Magalie Marcellus: But I'm glad she's back on my PC know you can get to see a second

285
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.320
Yeah.

286
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:43.860
Bethany: Yeah, I'm hoping to go out here. I talked to her earlier and told her like to come out and stay a couple days and I said that way. Maybe you can kick your feet up and rest and relax.

287
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.190
Right.

288
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.110
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

289
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:54.180
Bethany: Right then that way. I get to visit with him for a little bit and I can help her get some housecleaning down and some chores done, is she needs to for spring cleaning so

290
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.730
Magalie Marcellus: I had the ship. Oh, my bad.

291
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:05.520
Bethany: She said that. Yeah, she said it wasn't a problem but she'd have to get with Alan at her and see for sure what schedule. He's working and

292
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:12.120
Bethany: Her doctors appointments and they usually go to church on Mondays, Wednesdays and Sundays. So her schedules.

293
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.400
Magalie Marcellus: She's based on a lot of it.

294
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.010
Bethany: Right, okay. So she didn't

295
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.480
Magalie Marcellus: Make it easy.

296
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.250
Bethany: Yeah, definitely.

297
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:29.430
Magalie Marcellus: Well you you offer the help and so she fills the needle and that means you offer it.

298
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.420
Magalie Marcellus: Right. And I know you want to be there to buy whatever support, especially a high position he needs to be rest and more

299
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.480
Magalie Marcellus: With a little one is hard to do.

300
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.620
Bethany: If you have any

301
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.430
Magalie Marcellus: Fear has been

302
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:49.440
Bethany: And that's what I told her, I said with her blood pressure and heart problems and things until they find out what's causing it. You know, I keep

303
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.860
Bethany: Preaching to her, please take it easy, take it easy HTC

398
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:37.170
Bethany: But that just never was me. I didn't do it to kind of escape or party or have fun. You know, I kind of slipped into it with with just

399
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:47.730
Bethany: You know, the, the pain medication that I was on. And then when I lost the insurance, you know, just a second. I had somebody asked for it. And that's where she went from there and

407
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:23.190
Bethany: I had been on fentanyl patches and Percocet tins for about show. Oh gosh, probably four or five years and then I lost my

409
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.490

413
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.450
Bethany: Probably not as thick as what I went through with the heroin. But still you're

414
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.800

415
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:51.180

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:21.570
Bethany: I've always said sometimes it seems like you take 14 steps forward and slide back 15 or 13 but as long as you can keep going. That's what matters because you'll you'll make progress. It just takes time.

424
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.630
Magalie Marcellus: Yes, as long that you don't stay one

425
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.590
Magalie Marcellus: With the negative thoughts or things when things are

426

481
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.910
Magalie Marcellus: But that's part of it is like

482
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.130
Magalie Marcellus: Once you notice that you

483
00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:24.090
Magalie Marcellus: drifting, drifting off and, you know, thinking so much, then that's why it will give you a self awareness.

484
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:30.870
Magalie Marcellus: So they're going to start reminding yourself. Okay, any tool that those thoughts go but it takes practice.
