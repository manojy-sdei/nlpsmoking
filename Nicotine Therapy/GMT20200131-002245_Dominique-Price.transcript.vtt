Huh.

7
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.280
It's

8
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.210
Martin Price: You know, it's basically

9
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.660
Martin Price: Anxiety RELATED TO MY FINANCIAL SITUATION. And then trying to

10
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.510
Martin Price: set boundaries are in this relationship that I'm in and

11
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.770
Martin Price: It's just eat my lunch. Man, I don't know.

12
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.890
Martin Price: Seven a really hard time dealing with it.

13
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.550
Dominique Pozo: So you're considering ending the relationship now.

14
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.910
Martin Price: Well, it's just kind of, I just feel like it's all about money. I mean, I really like her, and

15
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.940
Martin Price: She may or may not. I just feel like her financial needs are so dire that

16
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.430
Martin Price: I can't support her and me at the same time.

17
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.220
Martin Price: You know I told her she could use the business money to

18
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.850
Martin Price: Support her cell phone. She's in school.

19
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.590
Martin Price: You know, but she still wants help from me paying our mortgage and

20
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.580
Martin Price: You know what's happening is

21
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.150
Martin Price: Then I wouldn't have enough money to pay my taxes and I'm already in arrears from

22
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:31.440
Martin Price: So it's just a real difficult financial situation. So I'm just dreading you know meeting with her and telling her all this and

23
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.350
Martin Price: You know, because I think she looks at me like I'm her savior or something and

24
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.820
Martin Price: I just feel like I can't keep doing that, unless

25
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.800
Martin Price: My I'm trying to get a refinance my house and it's just

26
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.770
Martin Price: Nothing seems to be

27
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.930
Martin Price: Working you know

28
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.130
Martin Price: A new insurance company won't cover my medication. It's just like a lot of bad news all at once.

29
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.540
Dominique Pozo: Hmm.

30
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.320
Dominique Pozo: Let's start with a little mindfulness and maybe tend to your anxiety and nervous system and

31
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.560
Dominique Pozo: Maybe bring the attention away from the head into the body for a little bit. Would that be helpful.

32
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.060
Martin Price: Yeah.

33
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.070
Martin Price: Yeah, okay.

34
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.730
Dominique Pozo: So if it feels good to close your eyes. Go ahead and close them looks like it does because you are so just keep them closed and

35
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.960
Dominique Pozo: And just taking a few moments to connect with your breath before anything else and

36
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.270
Dominique Pozo: Really focusing on that. Exhale. So as you exhale

37
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.120
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, dropping any areas that might feel extra tense.

38
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.990
Dominique Pozo: And

39
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:16.050
Dominique Pozo: Just, you know, in your own time. Go ahead and scan your body and see if you can locate a part of your body that feels really soft and spacious

40
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.870
Martin Price: Really

41
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:40.440
Dominique Pozo: really soft and spacious like you know maybe it's the bottom of your cheek or it could be the most silly thing. You know, like the the center of your hand or wherever you can. If you can, can you locate some parts of your body that feels, you know, maybe tension free

42
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.020
Dominique Pozo: If you can let me know.

43
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.390
Martin Price: Really, I'm just pretty wound up

44
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.670
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so

45
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:15.810
Dominique Pozo: How about let's let's switch the ear attention to. Is there some place that you've been to where you actually feel good, like a place out in nature or maybe some other

46
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.320
Dominique Pozo: You know place that you can think of where you've been able to

47
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.730
Martin Price: Really scheme.

48
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.660
Uh huh.

49
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:36.570
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so take your yourself there in your mind's eye, and just through the whole experience, you know, driving up the mountain. I don't know if you cross country skier downhill ski, whatever, but it's

50
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:45.630
Dominique Pozo: It's downhill. Okay, so take yourself to a moment that feels really peaceful and good in that whole experience and to see if you can rest there for a few breaths.

51
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.540
Martin Price: I do like it up there but Excuse me just a moment. I'm going to get a heating pad. It's really cold.

52
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.290
Martin Price: That's it. Oh.

53
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.200
Martin Price: Don't have to worry about that. There, I'm sure.

54
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.520
Dominique Pozo: No, it's so nice. I, I just was in the sunshine and I'm actually on the other end. I'm like, I need the air conditioning that so

55
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.180
Martin Price: Oh do rent or, you know, please share

56
00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.560
Dominique Pozo: Have a

57
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:05.610
Dominique Pozo: Different situation I I live on a friend's property and thankfully I was able to build a home on it so

58
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:14.460
Dominique Pozo: I don't don't own the land. I do on my home, but it's on their land. So it's lease it the land that I built on so it's it's some

59
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.770
Martin Price: Was it expensive to build there.

60
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:24.360
Dominique Pozo: I, I have a tiny home and it's very humble. I mean, it's all like that. There's no

61
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:33.510
Dominique Pozo: I can see all the studs in the, the kind of frame of the house it's oh it's like an open frame structure. There's, it's very simple. It's like

62
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.450
Martin Price: Shoot. When you're in the kitchen. Oh.

63
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.060
Dominique Pozo: Cool. Yeah, I'm not in my home right now. I'm actually

64
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.620
Martin Price: I know I mean

65
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:49.110
Martin Price: Like when we're in group, I can see like the white room exposed white everything's painted white

66
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.030
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's my home. Yeah.

67
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:57.810
Martin Price: Yeah, well I mean I'm seriously this whole financial mess. It's just making me more to

68
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.350
Martin Price: Really just cut them run, you know, just like

69
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.860
Martin Price: Save as much as I can and just sell my house and like

70
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.080
Martin Price: Like

71
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.510
Martin Price: You know, the IRS dad and his constant

72
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:18.990
Martin Price: Need from

73
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:26.220
Martin Price: This growing the relationship. It's like almost wish I didn't have anything. You know, I could just say

74
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.740
Martin Price: You have to go somewhere else.

75
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:45.480
Martin Price: It's really, I'm just super torn between. Am I doing a good thing for some money or am I just enabling them or am I just like paying for love or god it's just like, you know, really eat eating my lunch.

76
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:55.530
Dominique Pozo: What would it be like to just take some space from the whole relationship and rather than question at all. Take a little space and observe what happens

77
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.450
Martin Price: You may take a timeout with her.

78
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:07.230
Dominique Pozo: I wonder. I'm just wondering what what what what comes up for you when I suggest that as a possibility.

79
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.230
Martin Price: Here it's like she's expecting me to come back this weekend and help prepare mortgage, you know, and

80
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.580
Martin Price: That's the pattern. I've established and

81
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:26.940
Martin Price: You know, the business. Money is supposedly coming towards the end of February. And I'm just like,

82
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.270
Martin Price: I'd almost rather just say this. Take it and use it for yourself and

83
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.330
Martin Price: You know, if and when you choose to pay me back, you know, where I live, you know,

84
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.560
Martin Price: I'm just like, no, no negative space and

85
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.780
Martin Price: You know, like I said it for the past few days, like the afternoon comes around and I just get like

86
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.970
Martin Price: These like migraines. I have to start drinking water and then

87
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.180
Martin Price: You know, it's just

88
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:19.740
Martin Price: Like a construction site and just a diet of donuts and coffee and I just need to really start taking care of myself, you know, I learned to love myself.

89
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:29.400
Dominique Pozo: That sounds great. And it sounds to me that your body is really speaking speaking pretty loudly to that something's off, you know,

90
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.880
Martin Price: Yeah yeah I don't feel don't feel very good.

91
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.760
Martin Price: And it's a real drag. Cuz you know

92
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.530
Martin Price: Sometimes we don't talk about money. Everything's fine. But if we talk about money, then it's like, it's all one way, you know,

93
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.800
Dominique Pozo: Well, have you all been talking about that, but it's really starting to not feel good to you.

94
00:10:50.580 --> 00:11:00.660
Martin Price: I just keep telling her that I'm getting sick from all this anxiety about my finances and you know she's like, Oh, I got laid off and December and

95
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:14.730
Martin Price: You know, and then I come back with, well, we've been, you know, you helped in January and you got this business money coming that you can use to support you and your family while you go to school and she's going to get another job but

96
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.310
Martin Price: You know, I don't even live in Santa Fe anymore.

97
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:21.750
Martin Price: And

98
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:32.310
Martin Price: I just can't understand if it's like fear of like breaking up or like guilt from

99
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:39.390
Martin Price: I'm not doing what I said I was going to do in terms of helping her or

100
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.860
Martin Price: I don't know what it is. It's like

101
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.720
Martin Price: I kind of realized my mom really like she was there, she really sacrificed herself and

102
00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:00.270
Martin Price: Here with my dad and our family to keep it all going and she was just a very giving person and

103
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.770
I

104
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.980
Martin Price: I don't know if that like is my family model or why you know

105
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:15.150
Dominique Pozo: Well, it's probably a part of it, and you're, you're so aware of your tendency that I think

106
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:22.500
Dominique Pozo: Sure, it was Model T. But at this point, you, you have the agency to make different choices and do things differently. A few

107
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:36.870
Dominique Pozo: As you're doing as you explore and you know question what. Okay, where am I coming from. What's the motive here. I mean, that's the thing that I think would be helpful is to really get clear on your motivation. Like, what is your motivation in helping her

108
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.030
Martin Price: Part of it like

109
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.440
Martin Price: I care for, like, or, you know, it's just

110
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:54.840
Martin Price: She's very insistent on her boundaries that you know she doesn't want to introduce me to her family until she's good and ready and like, trust me, and

111
00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:11.160
Martin Price: And this is all be, you know, because she was in a she got beat their marriage, you know, she was like, you know, her husband costly criticized her, and in the end he started getting her and then she finally just ran out and

112
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.980
Martin Price: She's just as a you know worked on it.

113
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:25.920
Martin Price: On the trauma and so she just has these huge trust issues and she totally admits it, you know, and

114
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.520
Martin Price: And that led to some counseling and

115
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.620
Martin Price: She didn't feel like he was helping and

116
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.960
Martin Price: I don't know, I just, I think she's just like,

117
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.830
Martin Price: I just don't know if she wants to work on herself. You know, I don't really think she does. Maybe she does. I'm just impatient.

118
00:13:54.510 --> 00:14:09.870
Dominique Pozo: Do you want to bring her to a session with us and see how the dynamic might be, I don't know what the spiritual counselor. You know how he works or what he was presenting to her, but I wonder if you know maybe another angle might be affected with her.

119
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.110
Dominique Pozo: Or she might be more receptive

120
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.430
Yeah.

121
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.850
Martin Price: I just feel like I've already tried

122
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.930
Martin Price: And I feel like I'm

123
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.460
Martin Price: You know,

124
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.080
Martin Price: Looking they're expecting this outcome that show

125
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.990
Martin Price: Dropped her guard and

126
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.910
Martin Price: You know, learn to trust me right

127
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.420
Martin Price: It's gonna be a while, I guess, or I don't know. I'm just like, tired of it, you know.

128
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.760
Martin Price: Just makes me feel like

129
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.470
Martin Price: You know, I'm not, I'm not good enough to come over there or something and

130
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.950
Martin Price: Yeah.

131
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.510
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you

132
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.440
Martin Price: Should be supporting them and her family. Yeah.

133
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:17.910
Dominique Pozo: This makes a lot of sense, Marty. I, I am empathizing, you know, hearing that you're supporting her with financially in a big way. And what

134
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.100
Dominique Pozo: Is acknowledgement and to be

135
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.240
Dominique Pozo: Seen and to be, you know, let into her world more

136
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.130
Martin Price: Yeah, it's like

137
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.390
Martin Price: You know, it always

138
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:39.540
Martin Price: She says a tendency to pull away and then re engage and pull away and it's like

139
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:46.410
Martin Price: I don't know, cats like talking to sentence like a product of the trauma, you know, I, she just

140
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.080
Martin Price: Won't let herself.

141
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:56.640
Martin Price: Get too close to someone, because I guess she's afraid of being hurt or she doesn't trust man or

142
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.870
Martin Price: I don't know what happens to people in trauma. I don't know.

143
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.250
Dominique Pozo: It's very

144
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.930
Dominique Pozo: Like yeah

145
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.900
Martin Price: It's common to empathize with her and it just

146
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.070
Martin Price: won't change.

147
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:15.870
Dominique Pozo: Well, this is definitely i don't i don't really even want to speak too much more about her because I've never met her. I don't know her yet.

148
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:28.110
Dominique Pozo: If there's if there's trauma. She claims it's going to take a lot of work on her part to move through that because there's so many different symptoms from isolation to anxiety to, you know,

149
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.040
Martin Price: Getting she says she like as real low self esteem and

150
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.920
Martin Price: She hates being in crowded restaurants or anything like that and

151
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:54.750
Martin Price: Won't let me have a picture ever because like her ex just kept telling her how bad or acne was that she was this or how she was that, you know, class fan.

152
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.050
Martin Price: And I get it. And I've tried to empathize but

153
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:17.400
Martin Price: You know, every time it's like I knew I want to bring up counseling is it's only like you know I'm busy I am with school you know i just i got laid off and now I'm at school. And that's the other thing I was just trying to get a job and

154
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:31.500
Martin Price: It's just not a very, you know, like, I'll go home to Santa Fe and all. It's about is like being together for a few hours and going by the bank and getting your money anymore. It's just a drag

155
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.570
Dominique Pozo: Hmm, so

156
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:40.050
Martin Price: It's like I'm just letting it happen to myself, you know, and I pray about it. And, like, try and

157
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.050
Martin Price: Look for a sign like

158
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.030
Martin Price: They're really

159
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.700
Martin Price: Helping this person and her family are, you know,

160
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.930
Martin Price: It's just really kind of gotten to me.

161
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.760
Dominique Pozo: I can

162
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.750
Martin Price: I can resolve.

163
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.000
Martin Price: This weekend like take a stand, you know,

164
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.550
Martin Price: That I usually fall apart.

165
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:14.580
Dominique Pozo: Well, one thing, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm kind of sensing some resentment and

166
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.900
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it definitely confusing as you named and

167
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.040
Dominique Pozo: Um,

168
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:30.180
Martin Price: I mean, work is really demanding it and she's had she sees how much I make, and she just like

169
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:37.440
Martin Price: You know, you obviously have the money to help me, but it's not really true, because it taxes and

170
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.620
Martin Price: I mean, I'm starting to do better, but

171
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.280
Dominique Pozo: Then you and I just, I'm not you know that's that's definitely what you're imagining she's thinking yet. I just want. Yeah.

172
00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:00.540
Dominique Pozo: I want to focus on you, you know, there's definitely your part is an enabling her you know your neighbors.

173
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:09.180
Dominique Pozo: Are giving her money. It's something that's now become like expected and a part of the dynamic. So it's just, you know,

174
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.550
It's

175
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.120
Martin Price: You know, it's just not a fulfilling relationship.

176
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.740
Dominique Pozo: So how would it be to just say that I'm not feeling fulfilled.

177
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.060
Yeah.

178
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:34.500
Dominique Pozo: And I

179
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:34.890
You know,

180
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.740
Martin Price: Like just and yes I'm assuming this but she'll just be like, you know what I'm going through, you know, three kids and a wife and a mom and

181
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.750
Martin Price: I lost my job and going back to school and

182
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:50.790
Dominique Pozo: And that's

183
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.890
Martin Price: Her stuff just on and on.

184
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.590
Dominique Pozo: Right, and that's

185
00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:05.850
Dominique Pozo: Her and that is her stuff. So I'm just wondering, what would it be to simply just say I hear that I can understand. And this is what's going on for me.

186
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.730
Martin Price: You know what

187
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:16.230
Dominique Pozo: And this is what's going on. For me, it doesn't negate anything that she said it's not, what's the word

188
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:30.900
Dominique Pozo: invalidating her. It's not at all. You know, you're simply naming what I'm hearing that you're not really feeling very nourished that you're you're needing more on multiple levels. Yeah.

189
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:41.610
Martin Price: I mean, talking on the phone once or twice a day is nice and she's always very encouraging and i i'm very encouraging to her and she basically

190
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:51.210
Martin Price: Sometimes so called us balling. You know, and she just, you know, says stuff like she loves to hear the sound of my voice and I'm the only thing that

191
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.600
Martin Price: helps her feel good and you know

192
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.630
Martin Price: But I just feel like she's going to try and

193
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.100
Martin Price: You know, it's just a very one sided relationship.

194
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:25.200
Martin Price: So, you know, my anxiety. A lot of it is about how to handle that and not cave, you know, they always cave and

195
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.870
Martin Price: And then

196
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.970
Martin Price: You know, just accepting that like

197
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.420
Martin Price: Except the outcome and don't

198
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:44.280
Martin Price: Say a word like project, what's going to happen. We didn't know. I'm pretty sure I know what will happen.

199
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.880
Martin Price: To get angry and I'll give in and give her money.

200
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.760
Martin Price: And that's the way the dynamic works.

201
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.610
Martin Price: I'm gonna get a glass of water too. Okay.

202
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:41.850
Martin Price: I think I've always kind of had a bad time getting out of relationships kind of male and female, you know,

203
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:53.340
Dominique Pozo: I'm not sure if you need to necessarily get out of it. And I did a few red flags came up for me when you said you just want to, like, hit the road and run

204
00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:05.520
Dominique Pozo: I don't think that's really dealing with the hard stuff. So sure, maybe in time you do make a change, yet. I'm really going to challenge and invite you to communicate your way through this and I really

205
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.330
Martin Price: Wanted to be real, you know, and just

206
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:09.630
Dominique Pozo: Like

207
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.570
Martin Price: And not have it turned into like this anger thing.

208
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:22.230
Dominique Pozo: Supportive to have a session and I'm happy to, to, you know, be there as a kind of like a mediator and

209
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:22.770
Martin Price: Yeah.

210
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:33.660
Dominique Pozo: You need that. But just, you know, a witness and be able to, maybe, maybe not even, you know, not break up but just start a dialogue that's really deep and real that's past

211
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:45.570
Dominique Pozo: You know, maybe blaming or getting defensive and taking things so personally it's just really facilitating speaking ones truth from a very responsible way.

212
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:56.010
Martin Price: Yeah, I just, I don't know why I can't do it myself. You know, it's like it's like I have to. It's like I have to deal with all the

213
00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.840
Martin Price: It's like I have to have these conversations like in front of a counselor.

214
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.020
Dominique Pozo: So okay, so I'm hearing you want to keep growing the skills to do it yourself.

215
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:14.400
Martin Price: I don't know what I want to do. I like dreading the whole band. If you want to know the truth. I've been thinking to just canceling the trip.

216
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:22.350
Dominique Pozo: I think that's running away and turning away from it and I don't think it's gonna make your anxiety any better.

217
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.550
Martin Price: Yeah.

218
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.820
Martin Price: It's gonna have a doctor's appointment I have to go to anyway.

219
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:27.690
Yeah.

220
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.770
Dominique Pozo: Well, do you want to role play a little bit, we've got plenty of time we can

221
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.570
Dominique Pozo: I can pretend to be her or

222
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.040
Dominique Pozo: You can

223
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.210
Martin Price: Help me.

224
00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.730
Dominique Pozo: Or you can be her and you can maybe

225
00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:01.350
Dominique Pozo: respond the way you think she would respond. And then all come forward in the way that

226
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:02.370
Martin Price: You are right.

227
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.810
Dominique Pozo: What would, what would feel more natural. And what would you prefer would do you want to

228
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.560
Martin Price: Be here.

229
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.350
Dominique Pozo: You'll be hurt. Okay, so tell me the setup the scene for me. And also it's

230
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.150
Martin Price: Usually will made in like a

231
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.960
Martin Price: We used to meet at my house, but then

232
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:31.230
Martin Price: That's a long story. But anyway, so we will usually meet at a restaurant and can't be crowded. I have to order ahead for you know and like

233
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:46.080
Martin Price: This the seat needs to be away from people as much as possible. And, you know, just that whole thing and then I see her. And I kind of like brighten up, you know, and it makes me happy and

234
00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.050
Martin Price: But then if there's, you know, then it becomes, well,

235
00:25:53.460 --> 00:26:02.460
Martin Price: The discussion always turns to money, you know. Well, God, I need. I'm gonna need you know. Well, I thought I gave you money for that last month and that well.

236
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.530
Martin Price: And it's like,

237
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:11.010
Martin Price: It becomes this list of how much she needs, how much money she needs.

238
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:12.690
Martin Price: Okay, let's

239
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:27.120
Dominique Pozo: Let's start from there. I think this is plenty. So why don't we imagine we're in the restaurant. We're in a quiet corner and you start up her and start lamenting on you know how how hard it is financially what you need and

240
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:34.530
Martin Price: You know, it's like it. Oh, I told you that I needed the money last time to get the mortgage paid early. And so now we have to pay

241
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:46.350
Martin Price: late fees on it. So it's going to be 30 $500 now or 3600 and I couldn't. I haven't gotten a laptop be up for school and I need that and and

242
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.210
Dominique Pozo: What's her name. What's her name is

243
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.390
Dominique Pozo: Michelle. Michelle Okay. Okay, keep going.

244
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:58.260
Martin Price: I'm just pissed at myself that I have to even go through this Dominique, I'm sorry. I just like very pissed at myself.

245
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.030
Dominique Pozo: I just fucking

246
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.690
Martin Price: Loser. Oh, I can't anyway.

247
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:11.190
Martin Price: Yeah, just like I need this. You don't know how hard it is, you know, just kind of laying this whole guilt thing on me.

248
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.310
Martin Price: Okay, be more money than I budgeted to give her and it's just the same old broken record.

249
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:32.070
Dominique Pozo: Let's stick with the let's stick with the role play for a second and just see how it goes. So you were, you were doing great. I interrupted you. By asking her name. So let's see if you could just just finish off the sentence with one more thing and then I'll come in. I do, I'm going to be

250
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.320
Martin Price: Okay, I don't know. She's like,

251
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.470
Martin Price: All right, you know, I'm assuming

252
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.460
Martin Price: That's usually how it ends.

253
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.870
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm know I'm gonna be you, will you finish off her she's

254
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:52.830
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

255
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.650
Martin Price: Okay, no, I just, that was pretty much it.

256
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.130
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

257
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.970
Martin Price: So laundry list of why why why okay so

258
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:12.360
Dominique Pozo: Michelle I I need to just say this when you speak to me about all these, you know, things that you're needing and what didn't work out last month with the money that I gave you my stomach is in knots and it's been

259
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:27.360
Dominique Pozo: This all week and something's not right. I don't feel right. And I need to share this with you. I, I know that we've set up this dynamic where I've been supporting you and I'm hitting a place where it's not feeling good anymore.

260
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:30.300
Dominique Pozo: And

261
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:37.530
Martin Price: Just like, do you know what it's like to be as a single mom with three kids, and I'm taking care of my mom and

262
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.030
Martin Price: I are need 40 $500 in repairs and

263
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:51.450
Dominique Pozo: I get that. And I'm letting you know that this is not feeling good to me anymore. And I'm really needing you to have some empathy for me.

264
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.220
Dominique Pozo: And my situation that

265
00:28:53.460 --> 00:29:05.820
Dominique Pozo: I want have a relationship with you yet. The way that we've set this up. It's starting to not feel good and I'm, I'm feeling it in my body, my stomach is there in stitches.

266
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:20.610
Dominique Pozo: And I don't know what to do. I feel stuck. I feel stuck because I care for you. I, I feel this responsibility and I'm not sure where it's coming from. And I know this is my work to keep

267
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:30.930
Dominique Pozo: You know, sifting through and understanding. It's just what this case so that I do feel this responsibility to help you yet something's not feeling right

268
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.160
Yeah.

269
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:33.870
Dominique Pozo: Can you

270
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.400
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

271
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:45.300
Martin Price: Well, to me, within the studio buker the medicine. You know what I bought it during the day. I feel pretty good and then

272
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.190
Martin Price: In the evening.

273
00:29:52.740 --> 00:30:00.570
Martin Price: I don't know if it wears off or what, but I just kind of like get real negative, you know. So I think it wears off and

274
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:17.310
Martin Price: So I'm kind of on this roller coaster where you know i overcommit when I'm feeling good, you know, during the course of the day and then a night. And then the next morning, I'm just like Israel with myself for doing it, you know. Mm hmm.

275
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.880
Dominique Pozo: I mean I'm just hearing so much anger directed at yourself.

276
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.210
Martin Price: Yeah. Yeah, it's weird, you know, cuz she

277
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:47.190
Martin Price: It's, you know, it's basically not her fault. I was wanting to set up this pattern, you know. And to me, it's kind of like

278
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:57.540
Martin Price: You know, it's like I'm either so afraid of like losing her that I'll do anything to keep her

279
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.350
Martin Price: And there's just this big part of me that

280
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.700
Martin Price: My whole life has just been giving money to women.

281
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:09.540
Martin Price: It's like wives kids. It's just been

282
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.900
Martin Price: You know, I got my daughter got schizophrenia and I just like

283
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:33.180
Martin Price: You know, is accused of enabling your, you know, because I just gave her a free pass and just tried to help her financially for the last seven years. I even finished up school for like taking her online classes and

284
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.280
Dominique Pozo: Oh you finished her school for her.

285
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.480
Martin Price: Yeah, I took like the last four or five classes online for

286
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:48.360
Martin Price: Oh boy, she did the majority of them. She did like hundred and 15 credits and I did 15 credits, but she got schizophrenia and

287
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:56.550
Martin Price: You know, so for the last year, I've shelled out $100,000 and she's finally doing better at this treatment center but

288
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:04.080
Martin Price: Yeah, I guess I just feel like I need to start taking care of me. You know, it's just

289
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.250
Martin Price: It's old the gift gift gift gift gift you know

290
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.550
Dominique Pozo: So is there a point when you

291
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:18.690
Dominique Pozo: Can actually see that you can name to Michelle. This is my limit, I, I'm not going to give more than this.

292
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:31.080
Martin Price: I've said it before and it never holds you know it seems like it's always like, Oh, well, you know, the holidays are really expensive. Oh, the money from the business hasn't come in yet. Oh, you know, it's like

293
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:40.710
Martin Price: It just seems like that, you know, I know. Now it's like okay she signed the papers, the money supposed to come around March or February 20

294
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.240
And

295
00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.860
Martin Price: You. Yeah, honestly. There's a big part of me that just wants to, like,

296
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.500
Martin Price: Not

297
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.270
Martin Price: Like blocker on the phone and just do you know

298
00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:58.560
Martin Price: Then I feel bad. I know I feel bad. Well, that's

299
00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.470
Dominique Pozo: I think that's definitely running away.

300
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.060
Martin Price: Like doing that to people.

301
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.480
Either

302
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:11.490
Dominique Pozo: And I think I'm not going to support that, because I think it's running away and turning away from the thing that

303
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:27.030
Dominique Pozo: I think is your medicine to turn towards the discomfort to turn towards the fear of whatever you're afraid of, you know, and I think blocking someone and just, you know, kind of cutting them off is is actually not facing the fear.

304
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:32.670
Martin Price: No, I wouldn't feel very good. But it'd be a self preservation mechanism, you know, be

305
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.260
Martin Price: Like that.

306
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:41.100
Martin Price: Was the people I talked to her, just like you need to get out of this relationship, you know, it's just not balanced.

307
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:43.980
Dominique Pozo: Just as a

308
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.740
Martin Price: You know there isn't.

309
00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.270
Martin Price: There's just not much forthcoming from her.

310
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.940
Dominique Pozo: Mike, are you willing to do a little bit of drawing I am having this

311
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:07.380
Dominique Pozo: This directive in my mind. So I was trained in art therapy to and I, I'm wondering if you can get a piece of paper, split it down the middle with a pen with a line.

312
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:10.440
Right. Yes.

313
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.530
Dominique Pozo: Do you, do you have a blank piece or

314
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.420
Dominique Pozo: Maybe it's the back of that piece of paper.

315
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.770
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, big. Yep.

316
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.890
Martin Price: Okay.

317
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:39.690
Dominique Pozo: Okay. And I'm wondering if you can do this just draw a line down the middle. And on one side, draw what it would look like what you would look like and feel like if you just blocked her cut it off. No more contact done

318
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:45.810
Dominique Pozo: And then on the other side, what would it look, what would you look look like if you actually

319
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:55.380
Dominique Pozo: Set your limits you named to them and you might, you know, you there might be some time of separation, where you don't speak but you're not

320
00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:06.390
Dominique Pozo: You're not like just disappearing and close around someone you're actually naming your needs. What's not working for you and then saying, This is what I need.

321
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.190
Martin Price: So it's like cutting around versus setting limits.

322
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:17.250
Dominique Pozo: Yes. So can you draw what that both would look like. And I'm curious, whatever comes through.

323
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:19.470
Dominique Pozo: Just

324
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:26.400
Martin Price: Kinda right. I would just feel guilty and then I would feel like I abandoned her

325
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:33.750
Dominique Pozo: So go through this process, take your time and see if any, any images come through to

326
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:46.650
Dominique Pozo: Images. Images yes symbols are really powerful. And sometimes if you just take a moment and start with one. Start with the cut and run just close your eyes before you do anything else.

327
00:35:47.130 --> 00:36:02.130
Dominique Pozo: And just imagine the cut and run shirt, mentally, you know, you'd feel guilty, it wouldn't it wouldn't feel good, but are there any, do you see a picture or, you know, what would your body look like the gesture just really take your time with it.

328
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.470
Martin Price: I don't see any images.

329
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:33.360
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well, then maybe right and I'm going to invite you to write with your non dominant hand, there's a lot that comes through, like, it looks to me that your left hand might be your non dominant hand. Is that true

330
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.610
Martin Price: Yeah, I'm right handed.

331
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.100
Dominique Pozo: So right with your left hand and just right.

332
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:38.970
Martin Price: If I

333
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:46.350
Dominique Pozo: If I cut and run this is what will happen just right. Don't even think about it, let it just come through.

334
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.970
Martin Price: My queue right with my left hand.

335
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.570
Dominique Pozo: We'll just see what comes through, even if it's just one

336
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:55.290
Dominique Pozo: This is tapping another part of your brain. That's why I'm asking you.

337
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:37.620
Dominique Pozo: And then do the same with the other one. If you set limits. What would that look like

338
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.020
Martin Price: I can hardly read my writing.

339
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.550
Martin Price: Okay, okay.

340
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:51.300
Martin Price: Alright.

341
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.660
Dominique Pozo: So can we read to me what you read what you wrote

342
00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:59.700
Martin Price: And I said I would feel like.

343
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:07.950
Martin Price: abandon her and after telling her, I'm not that kind of person I wouldn't do it to her.

344
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:18.300
Martin Price: And then setting limits and say impossible. Impossible to stick to them because

345
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:23.610
Martin Price: Well,

346
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:25.920
Martin Price: Basically because

347
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.380
Martin Price: The guilt trip on me.

348
00:39:43.320 --> 00:40:00.900
Dominique Pozo: I'm gonna I'm gonna invite you. One more time to kind of get out of your head around, you know the outcome because I feel like it's a it's a story that you're you you've thought about a lot and it feels really familiar. So I'm, I'm really wanting something maybe new

349
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:10.350
Dominique Pozo: Fear. Okay, let's so let's go with the fear, will you on that piece of paper right I'm afraid of dot dot dot that's that's really what

350
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.540
Dominique Pozo: Is at the root of it right with my right hand.

351
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.310
Martin Price: I just can't even read my left hand.

352
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:05.760
Martin Price: Okay.

353
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.210
Dominique Pozo: Okay, what did you what came through, what did you write

354
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.610
Martin Price: To cut and run is would be fear that I didn't face my fears.

355
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.860
Martin Price: And then said limits is fear. Fear that show cutting them.

356
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.420
Martin Price: If I stick to one.

357
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.720
Martin Price: Or will have a big fight.

358
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.620
Dominique Pozo: How about can you write if I'm

359
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:43.110
Martin Price: alone.dot.me after we break up or

360
00:41:44.130 --> 00:42:02.040
Dominique Pozo: I mean, I think what I'm hearing this fear of being alone on both ends, the fear alone if you set limits and and you cut and run, you know that. And then there's the sphere of will. Maybe she'll do it and then. So either way, it seems like the heart of it is this fear of being alone.

361
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:08.520
Martin Price: Right. No, I, yeah, I agree. And it's like I'm trying to avoid that pain and yet.

362
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:14.370
Martin Price: It's not our relationship, it's serving me and it's

363
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.120
Martin Price: It's not one that I can see.

364
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.470
Martin Price: Becoming anything in the future, you know,

365
00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.640
Dominique Pozo: You don't. You don't see a future.

366
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:37.560
Martin Price: Not really. I mean, she's 3960 that's number one. She says she likes older men. That doesn't bother her but you know

367
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.310
Martin Price: I'm 70 different story.

368
00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.710
Martin Price: Oh, yeah, yeah. And

369
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:52.800
Martin Price: So I just kind of feel like, you know, I've got like 10 or 10 or 20 years left my life and

370
00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.530
Martin Price: And this is all it's all the

371
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:05.430
Martin Price: You know, intellect versus your heart, you know, my heart would say

372
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:16.770
Martin Price: Keep trying. She's a really good person. I think that's my heart. Then I wonder if that's just fear. You know, I just don't know and

373
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:20.760
Dominique Pozo: And I don't think you'll know until you actually give it a try and

374
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.630
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Oh.

375
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.040
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

376
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.980
Dominique Pozo: And I wonder, you know, if you, you know,

377
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.390
Martin Price: Dominica have tried it before. It's not that I haven't tried this. I just always K, that's my problem.

378
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.780
Martin Price: Do you know what I mean when I say cave

379
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:38.760
Dominique Pozo: I do what I

380
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:44.910
Dominique Pozo: What I am thinking is, it's your, your own you're compromising your own needs for someone else.

381
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.720
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah. And I've done all my life, you know. Yeah.

382
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:51.990
Martin Price: I'm

383
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.940
Martin Price: a people pleaser thing.

384
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.730
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I'm hearing this kind of

385
00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.970
Dominique Pozo: Part of you that's rising up saying, I'm tired of this. I want something different.

386
00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:11.190
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah, I'm tired of it. It's a real driving need in me and I don't know why terrorists, you know,

387
00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.260
Martin Price: Yeah, it's like

388
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:29.190
Martin Price: I remember when my second wife and I, before we got married, we broke up for like five months and I was just a rack. You know, I was going out and trying to meet other women, but I just, you know, Mr terribly and

389
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:42.450
Martin Price: And then she finally wrote and said she wanted to get back together and I just felt like like that. And I was instantly whole again. You know, I had that box checked and so it's like

390
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.850
Martin Price: I know this is a part of me that I really need to work on and

391
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:55.770
Martin Price: Like learn to love myself and be comfortable being alone. And it's like, I guess I should have done it a long time ago, you know,

392
00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:10.260
Dominique Pozo: What this opportunity now when it doesn't mean that you and Michelle will never get back together again it's, it is the fear, though of letting it loose and trusting. Okay, if this is really real and meant to be. We will be back together again.

393
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.360
Dominique Pozo: And if not, then this is what

394
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:17.160
Dominique Pozo: It sounds like a part of us really asking for some time alone.

395
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:23.400
Martin Price: Well, in my mind, like she has just such dire financial needs that she doesn't

396
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.010
Martin Price: Want to justify it because she just has to be with like a guy who makes money, you know,

397
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.320
Martin Price: Otherwise, her

398
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.380
Martin Price: Little world is going to fall apart.

399
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.000
Martin Price: Mean, that's the way I see it, I could be wrong, but I don't think so.

400
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:47.100
Martin Price: So she's kind of living beyond their means. I hope to get into a house and the payment.

401
00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:51.330
Martin Price: You know she'd have to make $1,000 a month to

402
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:58.950
Martin Price: Take care of her family and make the payment and everything like that. And right now, she's making zero

403
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.710
Martin Price: And so it's a real

404
00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:16.260
Martin Price: And so, but my, you know, my response to that is like I'm letting you, you know, here's the business money going please use us to take care of yourself, you know,

405
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.450
Martin Price: But

406
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:27.150
Martin Price: She would rather like keep having me give her money every month to make because that'll stretch the business money further

407
00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:46.170
Dominique Pozo: Right, yeah. Yeah, I'm just going to really encourage you to listen to your body when your body's not right. No, no matter whether it's right for her or not, or if it's rational or read something and you is not okay with the situation. And that's I think that's

408
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.790
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's enough.

409
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:49.560
Dominique Pozo: To

410
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.590
Dominique Pozo: Keep checking, you know,

411
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.690
Martin Price: Yeah, I feel like I'm going to get an ulcer or something and you know

412
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:07.380
Martin Price: A big part of it is like this. I've never been this broke before you know is financially challenged at a really bad.

413
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.760
Martin Price: And

414
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:15.630
Martin Price: I finally got found work again last September, and I've been working since then. And that's really helped, but

415
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:17.190
Martin Price: You know,

416
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.770
Martin Price: I need to get

417
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.300
Martin Price: Some retirement money.

418
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:47.400
Martin Price: And 60 and I just got to start thinking about that, but it's so weird that I'll start like I do agree the like the Gospels in the Bible a lot and it's like just all about denouncing money and denouncing material possessions and just turning to God and helping other people and

419
00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:50.430
Martin Price: You know,

420
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.830
Dominique Pozo: Well, I don't think

421
00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:54.780
Martin Price: That God will take care of you.

422
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.150
Dominique Pozo: I don't think that's working for you.

423
00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:04.740
Dominique Pozo: At this time, because what I'm hearing as you've been doing that your whole life, and you've reached a point where something in you is

424
00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:15.060
Dominique Pozo: Like rebelling against that. So it's not like you're selfish courting person you've been doing this. Your whole life. So I'm wondering if there needs to be a little more balance action.

425
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.100
Martin Price: Yeah, that I just don't

426
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:33.960
Martin Price: It's so literal and so absolute when I read that and that stuff makes me feel good and I read it you know like what are they the Beatitudes. And, you know, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they will be

427
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:41.880
Martin Price: You know, the, the ones to 10 or having, you know, those kind of things were

428
00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:49.830
Martin Price: Sacrifice for others is really a very noble thing, you know, but

429
00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.320
Martin Price: Yeah, it just doesn't feel very good.

430
00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:09.840
Martin Price: And I do recognize a lot of it is like, you know, related to the medication. I make. I don't know if I'm not taking the right dose or what, but it just doesn't last all day. You know, it just wears off. And when I feel

431
00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:12.570
Martin Price: kind of crappy

432
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:31.740
Dominique Pozo: When do you realize or recognize that you're aligning your mind with your body like your things feel harmonious because right now I'm, I'm, what I'm sensing as a lot of confusion, like the mind thinking this thing and the body's feeling. Another way and it's like, what's

433
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.100
Dominique Pozo: There.

434
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:46.500
Dominique Pozo: So I'm wondering where and when do you recognize that you're like, your mind is thinking something in your body follows with a lot of like vitality and strengthen and it's just like it's, there's a harmony.

435
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.270
Martin Price: What

436
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.240
Dominique Pozo: There's harmony. What were in your life.

437
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:53.220
Martin Price: And so when I exercise.

438
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.330
Okay.

439
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.580
Martin Price: That's what I feel good.

440
00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:03.090
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Yep. Sounds like that's the part of you're doing something for your well being.

441
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.230
Yeah.

442
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.900
Dominique Pozo: So,

443
00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.660
Martin Price: I've had this anxiety practically

444
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:14.310
Martin Price: Just seems like my whole life. And I've always had to exercise really hard in order to

445
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.800
Martin Price: Calm it down.

446
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:27.360
Martin Price: And then, you know, but I'm getting older and it's like

447
00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.340
Martin Price: The exercise usually helps my back and my gifts feel better, but

448
00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:44.790
Martin Price: If I like stop exercising, they can really start acting up, you know, but it also aggravates them so like when I joined bright hard it was to

449
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.420
Martin Price: You know, increase the dose of the bell BUCA

450
00:50:52.200 --> 00:51:07.320
Martin Price: To deal with like the hip pain, rather than getting hip replacements and the bulging disc in my back and I'm anything like that. But now what it's become is like you know I'm emotionally dependent on it too.

451
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.130
Martin Price: Because I recognize it. You know, it makes me feel happy.

452
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:17.040
Martin Price: And then, yeah, like I said, towards the end of the day when it wears off. I get kind of bummed out.

453
00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:21.540
Martin Price: When I go into these

454
00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:26.040
Confused spaces or whatever.

455
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:37.770
Dominique Pozo: Martin. What I'm wondering if you're walking away with anything new from the session or any insight or something that will serve you as you know

456
00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.350
Martin Price: It's to tell you the truth. It's pretty much

457
00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:51.450
Martin Price: You know, when everybody starts telling you the same thing that you need to stand up for yourself for some version of that.

458
00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:58.620
Martin Price: It's really weird. That's when I finally did with my second wife, and she split, you know,

459
00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:14.670
Martin Price: Because like my daughter has schizophrenia and it wasn't her child, and she just saw me paying all this attention, having what she doing the codependent or unhealthy relationship, you know, so she laughed, and we got divorced and

460
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:26.850
Martin Price: You know, of course, Michelle is very supportive of the way I deal with Wiley, but if I already said like, oh, I have to give Wiley money this month, instead of you. I got to be supportive

461
00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:27.690
Hmm.

462
00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:30.870
Martin Price: I'm like, trying to keep know

463
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.190
Martin Price: It's like they call it leading with your wallet.

464
00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.360
Martin Price: Well, you know, trying to keep everybody happy by giving them money. Mm hmm.

465
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.970
Martin Price: And yeah, it's just not serving me anymore.

466
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:45.390
Dominique Pozo: Well, I really see clearly that it's not feeling good to you.

467
00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:50.670
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean, I'm just like financially in pretty bad shape and

468
00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.630
Martin Price: You know, I just can't keep giving

469
00:52:59.310 --> 00:52:59.790
Martin Price: So,

470
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.430
Dominique Pozo: So I'm wondering, from the time

471
00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:08.970
Dominique Pozo: That we spent in you know what we've talked to, what are you leaving with

472
00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.850
Martin Price: I mean, I feel better. I just

473
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:23.940
Martin Price: You know, I just feel like I need to be real clear like you're saying and not

474
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:36.900
Martin Price: Like blame her. I gave her I gave, I gave her the money willingly. It's not like I'm expecting it back the business money. I was expecting back, but I'm not counting on it and

475
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:44.070
Martin Price: You know, it's like if she if she chooses to

476
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:51.090
Martin Price: Say, well, I still I can't let down my boundaries. You know, I just

477
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.290
Martin Price: You're expecting me to

478
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.920
Martin Price: Trust you too quickly, or whatever, then

479
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:05.670
Martin Price: Then I basically have to say, then, you know, I just can't handle this anymore.

480
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:10.800
Martin Price: I mean, it's definitely not making me happy. That's for sure.

481
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:20.430
Dominique Pozo: Well, I think these are great places to start with a conversation of, you're not feeling well, physically and you're not really feeling happy.

482
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:21.300
Sad.

483
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:28.650
Martin Price: I feel like I'm going to get a stomach ulcers. Yeah, or heart attack. Yeah.

484
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.100
Martin Price: Okay.

485
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:33.990
