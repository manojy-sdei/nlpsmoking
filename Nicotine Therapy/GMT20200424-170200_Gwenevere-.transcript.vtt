9
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.020
Nicole Roybal: And they don't want to tell them who and then they waited a week to tell them that someone even caught it like one of the workers.

10
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:07.200
Nicole Roybal: So I'm freaking out about that because he works there and I am around him all the time and then going to my grandma's is. I didn't know a lot of stuff.

11
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:23.580
Nicole Roybal: As hard to not go to my grandma's because she needs me and my mom needs you doubt to it's just I don't want, I feel okay fine but people are asymptomatic or whatever. So I'm just, I kinda I'm stressing out

12
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.050
So you

13
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.150

18
00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.640
Nicole Roybal: You know, I'm like, should I not be going to my grandma's today lamb very questions already, wiping down the door handles constantly every time he comes.

19
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.010
home from work, you know,

20
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.100
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, I just, I get scared.

21
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's right for Nicole. There's RIGHT FOR GRAMMA

22
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

23
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: There's right for mom.

24
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's right for Daniel

25
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Who else is there to way right

26
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they different grandma and grandpa.

27
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that basically the same right

28
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.440
Nicole Roybal: Morning or different people. I mean,

29
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to treat them differently with your precaution.

30
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.840
Nicole Roybal: Know,

31
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It will just put them together. We'll just say grandparents.

32
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

33
00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.850
Okay.

34
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

35
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can see that the worrying doesn't, um, because I don't know, maybe it does help you for some people.

36
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The worry means that they're going to take action. But if all you're doing is worrying and you're not changing your behavior, then it's it's kind of a waste. But if we're it gets you to actually be more cautious. Be more careful.

37
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it has some use

38
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just curious how much worrying, are we talking about here.

39
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.720
I'm like,

40
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.960
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, I guess just any do that I have to. I know that my mom when she goes to my grandparents house.

41
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.320
Nicole Roybal: My main where he is, then, of course, you know, very vulnerable.

42
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:07.710
Nicole Roybal: Every time my mom wants me to go with them because I know go with her to go over that today Sean to go with her to go help out. And I guess on those days is when I just kind of like

43
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:19.650
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I'm working the whole time. The whole time until we're going over there while we're there. And then after that, once I come back home. I'm like, I'm okay. But I'm still kind of worried like, what if

44
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:38.280
Nicole Roybal: What if I click on something while I was there, but I mean I go there were a face mask a change my clothes and clean like scrubs that I have and I take my shoes off in the garage and Kate clean my hands all the way up my arms and everything. And I'm very, very, very cautious, but

45
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

46
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't doing that before. So this is a big change before you were going in and just washing hands now all the things that potentially would have this high viral load.

47
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, maybe a shoe or maybe coughing like you're, you know, so you're you're wearing a mask and you're you're washing your hands, you're leaving your shoes and clothes outside away from in here, grandparents are in here.

48
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your mom doing the same thing.

49
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.290
You know,

50
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you're

51
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, what if your mom was doing the same thing. Would you feel less nervous and anxious when you were visiting your grandparents.

52
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So it's not that wasn't too complicated to get to, was it

53
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.520
Nicole Roybal: No, I guess.

54
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I wasn't too hard. So this is about being able to comfortably. Talk to a parent about something you care deeply about. And you don't have a lot of rehearsal at that

55
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't like walking

56
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.960
Nicole Roybal: Around telling her, like, please do it, but she will. She's

57
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.100
Nicole Roybal: The one song stuck in their ways, you know, she won't listen

58
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:16.320
Nicole Roybal: If they do every time we go to the store. I'm like, here I have extra masks clean as we want to squeeze. But actually, no, I'm fine. I'm like, Mom, put it on and she's like, No, I'm okay. I'm like, where the frickin mass. What's wrong with you and she drives me nuts, honestly.

59
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.710
Nicole Roybal: I don't tell her that when freakin mask and don't tell her that she would be like if you

60
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.340
Nicole Roybal: Try to convince her she will

61
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: How old is that feeling. I tried to tell my mom. The right thing to do. And she won't listen

62
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How old How old is that we have some audio issues. In other words, I can hear you. If great is a 10 I hear you out of four, which may mean that you can hear me in a four as well. There's a real possibility.

63
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.010
Nicole Roybal: I can hear you. Perfect.

64
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good.

65
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:01.890
Nicole Roybal: I don't

66
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, we'll see. It's been that way. The last like three sessions. I'm not sure what the difference is. But

67
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:20.280
Nicole Roybal: I'm telling you, I, I go, I like sign into like that whole stimulus checking in before it was saying that they're still processing in today's the first day, it said that it's going to go into my bank account.

68
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.180
Okay, very good.

69
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.560
Nicole Roybal: Okay, but until then this stupid Obama phone

70
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Good thing.

71
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The good thing is is that you can hear just fine.

72
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just challenged. So just means that you might hear Me ask you to repeat things won't mean to but

73
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.340
My

74
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.260
Last

75
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.980
Nicole Roybal: Session, I got it set up right where the speaker wasn't being covered and of course it doesn't

76
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.470
Nicole Roybal: Can you hear me better now.

77
00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll see.

78
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll see. So let's see if we can get me sat down and you're like the, let me see 1234 or five year my fifth client today. So I'm feeling a little nauseous with the camera moving around.

79
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm loving this steady. Cool. Okay.

80
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

81
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an interesting position because there's so many things I want to change right in your world over there like

82
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even know where to begin.

83
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we start from the outside in. And we'll go to your ears dawn.

84
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.830
Nicole Roybal: I still can't hear. It's getting I could hear a little bit more though because

85
00:10:54.450 --> 00:11:11.190
Nicole Roybal: He say when I'm watching TV. I'll be laying on like on this year where the one that can hear out of. And before I couldn't hear nothing from TV like it all. It all sounds and now I could actually hear sound better this year, a little bit here, like the voices, which sounds muffled

86
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:28.830
Nicole Roybal: And so it's slowly getting some hearing back. I am going to look up nurse hotline ratio just called the loveless place but I'm remember it like sent me it's like a chat and I tried to do it. And then it was like, okay, now do

87
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.430
Nicole Roybal: Talk to the doctor, you have a $5 and then you'll get it back. And I'm like, don't have $5 my card.

88
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:44.940
Nicole Roybal: Okay. And if I don't know it didn't work out. But I should have tried harder, but honestly all week. I've been calling the IRS because I need to get an IP pin.

89
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah.

90
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.240
Nicole Roybal: So should I do my taxes and because I got my identity stolen.

91
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.490
Nicole Roybal: And you get one comes from

92
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:54.120
Right.

93
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:03.930
Nicole Roybal: It takes 21 days for them to send it to me in the mail. But if I do it online. I get it right away, but it wasn't letting me do it online. So I call them and

94
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.690
Nicole Roybal: It's just been a headache. Honestly, but they're sending it to me in the mail. Which sucks.

95
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.840
Nicole Roybal: But I mean, as long as they know what's coming.

96
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So bravo. That is not an easy thing to talk with the IRS especially right now. They're very busy.

97
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.620
So,

98
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you persevered and you did it.

99
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

100
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to the hey I need $5 to talk to a nurse. Let's go back to that one.

101
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Who has $5 who has $5 on a credit card that you could use.

102
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:03.510
Nicole Roybal: But honestly, I could just call us and talk to them, instead of having to do that. So I'll just, I'll call them today, and

103
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:16.290
Nicole Roybal: I called it was yesterday and I tried that. Okay. And then I guess I just kind of gave up to this, but today I will call it after session. I love list to place where at my appointment and there's place.

104
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

105
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:26.340
Nicole Roybal: They didn't go to and they even called me then to me and said that they're, they're not doing an appointment right now and that they will reschedule and over everyone's appointments. Okay, um,

106
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.380
Nicole Roybal: But yeah, I had missed that call ball call them today and ask them what they think about it that way.

107
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.220
Okay.

108
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there we go. So one day you spent with the IRS. And now today you can spend a little bit more focused time I'm getting some medical information because

109
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm concerned, I would hate for it to be a loss of hearing that was more than 1% or something. You know what I mean, like, I don't think people even noticed the 1% but

110
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What if an earlier intervention could have been helpful. I don't know. I'm not a medical professional. I have no idea. So

111
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's get back to say it again.

112
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.820
Nicole Roybal: I just find it weird that it doesn't hurt.

113
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I have, I have an air conditioner and it doesn't hurt me. I've had it since I was in college, I don't know what the heck it is. Yeah. That's why I do that hair flip thing all the time.

114
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what that is.

115
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No idea.

116
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've gone to specialist and they tell me mouth guard and all kinds of other crap and it doesn't help.

117
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got three different mouth guards. So next person that says it on this stuff, and in their mouth.

118
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry.

119
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.470
I think I needed to hear.

120
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

121
00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pretty annoying.

122
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Or am I see. Where were we last time. So we were talking last time. He said, I still can't hear nothing but now it's starting to get a little bit

123
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Ultimately when headphones in right here. No pain called primary care on Tuesday, and they told me to wait it out.

124
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: They have nothing to do for me spoke with a medical assistant front desk might not have consulted with Dr. She did not put me on hold client.

125
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Can call again next week and asked to speak with doctor or nurse helpful to hear Dr. Morales perspective, I might have waited too long to take the Gabba Penton feel sweaty.

126
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But hands are cold. Okay. Um, yeah, I wanted to show you something. Your, your taper with the gala Penton. I don't know how this has happened, but it's really kind of behind

127
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.990
Nicole Roybal: Was it when I, when I had messed up.

128
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

129
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.000
Nicole Roybal: Who that was taking

130
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But look how far behind your at 1100 aren't you

131
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Look how far, shouldn't you only be

132
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no, because you would be at 800 right now is that right

133
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: We were off by

134
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought we were only off by 100 milligrams, but maybe it was 200

135
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.270
Nicole Roybal: Okay, that's where it says that's getting 1700

136
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.610
Nicole Roybal: And one of the weeks.

137
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.400
Nicole Roybal: When I said I was getting really sweaty, I

138
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:48.060
Nicole Roybal: She said, I can't wait one more week to go down. But that still doesn't add up. But absolutely, I should get 900

139
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So on March 10 actually was taking 1700 taking 1600 between 393 13 and starting to take 15 on

140
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Year.

141
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That puts this here and this would have been right here 13. This would have been 12. This would have been 11 see right here. You would be at I think

142
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Just add the thousand right now. So I just wonder if you remember to taper this week.

143
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

144
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.800
Nicole Roybal: I did. I went down this week so that 1200 for

145
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well whatever it is you're still plugging along. So just, just wanted to show you, you're not that

146
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.000
Nicole Roybal: Weird. I don't know how that happened. But I promise. I've been tapering every single

147
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Hey, listen, this. Yeah, it's up to you. This is not a mood altering substance, so I'm not, I'm not worried about the the addictive behavior part. This is just because I know you want to come down so

148
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:53.790
Nicole Roybal: I've actually been really, really proud of myself because I've been like remembering and now and behind

149
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah but but but I think it's because we started off wrong.

150
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right here is right in here, because if we were thinking of new 1400

151
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we're off quite a bit. See

152
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We were thinking, it'd be 14 but really you're at 17 so I think it was just the initial

153
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't dose it got screwy. So this whole chart is

154
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll just keep plugging along keep doing your, your we're 100 and I'll keep tracking it over here. Okay, it's going to be this stuff on the right. It'll be over here that really matters. Whatever you're

155
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing

156
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you start to forget we should be able to see it when we meet, and we look at this again. Okay, so nobody

157
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, absolutely.

158
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're taking pride in remembering, um, is it because you keep all the medicine together and same place. How are you pulling that off.

159
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.280
Nicole Roybal: I mean, I just keep it on the nightstand. I'm actually writing for me right now but

160
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:06.450
Nicole Roybal: I'm about to run out of but I called the pharmacy and they said that they have a refill.

161
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's shift gears and start focusing a little bit on you brought something up today, which has to do with

162
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's one thing to have a disconnect with your mother.

163
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's just about an interpersonal communication, but it's another thing to have that disconnect about your mother and then to be thinking my grandparents could get sick.

164
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.120
Exactly.

165
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.560
Nicole Roybal: I'm like she needs it serious and so she washes their hands, nothing but like

166
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:57.060
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, just like with her clothes she just doesn't care about it and it's like you're everything in your car to be dirty. If you could went to the store and I don't know.

167
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:10.890
Nicole Roybal: The handles everything. I don't know. I get so nervous. And I don't think that they take it as serious as I am. And that's why were you so much because it's like I have to worry for everyone else, because they don't take it as seriously as I am.

168
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how it looks.

169
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:22.110
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, they're not worrying that I have to worry for them, I have to tell them do this like please like, you know,

170
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.470
Crazy.

171
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:38.520
Nicole Roybal: Even though Daniel like he doesn't like ever need to just want all day at work when he's at work, you know, so I'm like clean your phone. As soon as you own.

172
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:56.070
Nicole Roybal: Or his ISA yes Lisa exam. That's also something he touches constantly like throughout the day. And he's like, I use sanitizer when they get in my car. And I'm just like, Yeah, but he probably just receive on the way to your car before you send it

173
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.700
Right.

174
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:06.510
Nicole Roybal: To think about these things like they've been cleaning them for him. But if you need to do it. You need to be more awareness and he is he's conscious. He

175
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.230
Nicole Roybal: wears a mask at work and everything, but only because they started making him.

176
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So the part about the part about you making contact with Daniel that's within your control.

177
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Not you're controlling your mother not within your control. But you're saying to yourself, I'm

178
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I don't want to go to my grandparents house maybe telling your mother. I don't want to go. I've been putting myself at

179
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This additional risk level because Daniels out and about throughout the day. I'm putting my grandparents at risk because I'm hanging out with him, so I can't help you today. So what would happen if you said that to your mother just kind of want to know what that would result in

180
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.290
Nicole Roybal: Probably not even go

181
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What does real upset, like, show me what is real upset look like

182
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.150
Nicole Roybal: Nothing shows like just like okay well

183
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.130
Nicole Roybal: Are you sure

184
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.960
Nicole Roybal: I'll be like,

185
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.400
Nicole Roybal: Even sick.

186
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:25.260
Nicole Roybal: Daniel that virus is working and also been caught it, and she'll try to convince me now. So no and then she'll talk to you and like, be like, Oh man, she won't get matched or just kind of like like hadn't like it's

187
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.560
Nicole Roybal: Like okay, we'll talk to you later and hang up.

188
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.670
Nicole Roybal: And then deep inside really be have said, probably not even go to my grandparents. She doesn't want to go alone.

189
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:44.190
Nicole Roybal: And a lot of the town we go. I'll go and I'll cook for them. And my mom will get one of them in the shower or clean the house or like whatever

190
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.280
Nicole Roybal: Or even just sit there and just hang out with them. We just want people to talk to you, you know,

191
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.680
Nicole Roybal: Right. Oh.

192
00:22:54.420 --> 00:23:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now I just learned that real upset, is this. Oh, okay. Well, but you're not even sick and come on, let's go. This you're making a bigger deal out of nothing, or. All right, fine. I'll talk to you later. That is equal sign, real upset that right. Yeah. Okay.

193
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.790
Nicole Roybal: For my mom.

194
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, for mom. Got it.

195
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.340
Nicole Roybal: show respect my choice, you know, but should be like

196
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.670
Nicole Roybal: Herself will be like kind of like

197
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:44.010
Nicole Roybal: Upset I can find another word for it because she doesn't get mad, she doesn't get like angry. She's

198
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.900
Nicole Roybal: Like

199
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:47.820
Okay.

200
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So how strongly do you feel, what is your conviction right your how strongly you feel that's what conduction is right about going or not going over to your grandparents house.

201
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:34.530
Nicole Roybal: Things I do want to go. I really do want to go. I love seeing them and I love helping being able to help them. But the feeling of getting them said, I'm still wants him to like the worry is like probably go seven

202
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, six.

203
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:44.400
Nicole Roybal: I know I'm very cautious and I know I'm being careful. I think it's like you with that made me realize what you mentioned

204
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.870
Nicole Roybal: My mom is what's worrying me. She's not being careful

205
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.550
Nicole Roybal: So let's all go you just stay in the car.

206
00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, that's interesting. Of course, that you're there for hours. So that doesn't quite work almost works, but not quite. Your

207
00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:17.520
Nicole Roybal: Mom hers cemetery bothering her and I got nervous that she was taking any type of way. And so I just went inside, we brought them pizza.

208
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:25.920
Nicole Roybal: And I went inside and just like cleaned up and to my grandma's chat, chat out and stuff because she has this little trash can and it gets full of all her

209
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.460
Nicole Roybal: Bloody pads and diapers and stuff.

210
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.030
Yeah.

211
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:35.070
Nicole Roybal: So we always have to dump that out about the trash can up the toilet and everything and

212
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.080
Nicole Roybal: I got this toilet. So I just like ran through and cleaned everything right click and then left

213
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.870
Nicole Roybal: So you tell my grandparents are really sad that I just like human when set of being able to sit down and talk

Gwenevere Abriel: And

221
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you spend any more time kind of thinking about those two images kind of what is now and what you want in the future.

222
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.790

Nicole Roybal: Like a short conversation. It was just, he came over his lunch. So it wasn't like we got all into depth about it.

244
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

245
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a breath. Just breathe for a minute. Just breathe a little bit

246
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can identify

247
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What you had hoped would be the outcome of sharing

248
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That picture.

249
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:08.280
Nicole Roybal: Well, I'm glad that you actually have like some or even like a plan for future like

250
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.060
Nicole Roybal: Even seeing

251
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:20.970
Nicole Roybal: Any future all like, instead of just looking for actually trying to

252
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.570
Nicole Roybal: Make some sort of a plan if said like, I don't know, like, hoping he would support me more.

253
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.050
Nicole Roybal: Even just not laugh like

254
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if he wasn't. Laughing What would he say, What would he do if he was looking at that picture.

255
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:50.190
Nicole Roybal: I'm

256
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.760
Nicole Roybal: So, well, I would want to say what I know you say if he wasn't supposed to do is

257
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.550
Nicole Roybal: We have to go shoppers.

258
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.060
And

259
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.140
Nicole Roybal: That's what he

260
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.470
Nicole Roybal: Would say

261
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Do you have quiet for a little bit, Nicole. Just sit in the quiet just sit in the quiet. Let it come

262
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Just picture, and it may not be his face, and maybe someone else's

263
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's someone else that you want support from

264
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it's another voice that says a supportive statement.

265
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if it's Daniel just just stay in the quiet for a little bit.

266
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: For now, we've identified it happened you shared it with Daniel. And so we're talking about him, but it doesn't always mean that that's who you really want to hear this information from

267
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So give that imagination, a little bit of room to move around.

268
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's a matter of

269
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Who do you want to hear support from

270
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: He'd be starting there.

271
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.670
Nicole Roybal: I support you and I know you

272

And

273
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:45.450
Nicole Roybal: What are the steps and plans, we should do to help to make sure that you do this and that. You don't just kind of let it

274
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:49.980
Nicole Roybal: Fade away and like I have done.

275
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.320
Nicole Roybal: What can we do to make sure that you stay on this track and try to figure it out.

276
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Clear what I heard you say is support would look like him, saying, I support you.

277
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you can do this. So he also has fade. So he says, I support you. I believe in you, and what are the steps to get you there. I get that right.

278
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

279
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know

280
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.820
Go ahead.

281
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that. I didn't hear any of that. I'm so sorry.

282
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:43.920
Nicole Roybal: Like, like say like, it's always like is me helping him when it comes to like I'm

283
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:55.980
Nicole Roybal: Having to do stuff like that like calling places and making meetings and doing stuff like that. Um, so it's me. That has to do that. It's like, well, why don't you help me out with doing it, instead of just

284
00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.400
Nicole Roybal: sitting over there while I get everything together.

285
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So Nicole.

286
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: wanting someone else.

287
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To parent you you've been doing the parenting.

288
00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

289
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Who is it that needed to step up and do that.

290
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:41.850
Nicole Roybal: Was the thing is he thinks he's the parent because he works, and he pays all the bills. So therefore, he's a grown up. He's more of the front up and he's the parent and the child because he supports all the money and legal bills. So I am the kid. I am the base kit in the world.

291
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:43.740
Nicole Roybal: He is the dad.

292
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.200
Nicole Roybal: But

293
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.220
Nicole.

294
00:33:48.930 --> 00:34:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were growing up when you were growing up, did you notice that you had to take care of your siblings and you had to take on cooking and responsibilities when you were growing up.

295
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: How often did you have to do that.

296
00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.260
Every day.

297
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Who needed to have been doing those things.

298
00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.570
Nicole Roybal: My parents and

299
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.250
Nicole Roybal: I'll let you

300
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's your parents. Right. Yeah.

301
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:31.860
Nicole Roybal: But that's the thing is I'm used to it. So like now I just the way it handles relationship is like, I love cooking. I do a cleaning. I basically

302
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:48.450
Nicole Roybal: Do all like a housewife. I do all that stuff, you know, and so it's like I didn't have any moment. I do everything for you if I don't cook. You don't mean like come on dude. How do you not see the I'm also the parents. Well, we're both like the parents to each other.

303
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let that part. Go. That thing you keep forcing Daniel into let that imagery. You're forcing that to happen.

304
00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.250
Nicole Roybal: Every day.

305
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.740
Nicole Roybal: Not every day or every

306
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

307
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole.

308
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The I want you to

309
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Help me with my next step. The I want you to champion me and cheerlead me and encouraged me. I want you to believe in me.

310
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the real important people in your life that fail to do that for you.

311
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.960
Nicole Roybal: Like everyone believes in a certain extent.

312
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the hope this is a good question, who failed at being a parent, maybe not 100% but could have done a better job, who we talking about

313
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So leave it right there. You find out if that's true. So try it on.

314
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: If it is my parents, right, try that on just try that side on and see if it's true. It's not going to talk about Daniel for a little while.

315
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:17.850
Sorry.

316
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Connections connections not great.

317
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: An open ended question.

318
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you been thinking about and I know and it's not going to be a story about Daniel

319
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you been thinking about as I have been talking about.

320
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have been present defied which means having had to take on the role of a parent, what does it make you think of how old are you, how old is this experience of you.

321
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Having to do all of the organizing the planning the structuring the reminding and the worrying and the preparation. How old is this spent. Don't answer me right away. Think just sit with it. This is therapy. Sit don't have to answer me right away just ponder, it's a big question.

322
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

323
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you had to do over

324
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: If we could only pick one person today to talk about, would it be your mom or would it be your dad that needed to step in.

325
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And get you to do the next steps so that you can reach your goals to encourage you to believe in you to support you so that you can reach your goals.

326
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.570
Both okay

327
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:57.600
Nicole Roybal: She was that time to time, you know, and she pushed me in her weird ways but like my dad never did anything

328
00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.440
Nicole Roybal: And if he didn't do anything. He would just come in and yeah

329
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:03.540
Nicole Roybal: I never taught

330
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: There so so hold on to that just sit there with it. What's the feeling you get when you remember that sitting there and he wouldn't do

331
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You wouldn't encourage surely you and you didn't get to hear. I believe in you. How was your day, and you could do all I believe in you. You can do this. You can do this. You've got this

332
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

333
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: In the chest.

334
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

335
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body remembers over and over, doesn't matter what you do, he's still gonna sit on the couch.

336
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:50.670
Nicole Roybal: Like me and him have a really good relationship and like talk and everything, but

337
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.770
Nicole Roybal: It's not the same. I wish I would have that growing up. Yeah.

338
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So just imagine now I'll bring up Daniel. I'll bring it up.

339
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It is common, nine out of 10 times or 10 out of 10 it's that common, but what we bring into our life.

340
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What our partner looks like to us.

341
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that unresolved dynamic from childhood.

342
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.270
Yeah.

343
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so what you want from Daniel, you said it earlier today is why don't you encourage me

344
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you cheerlead me. Why don't you support me much like the way your dad didn't

345
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.120
Oh god.

346
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. We all we all do that we all do that we all do that because

347
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to repair that early childhood wounding it's unconscious and cold, but we want to repair it. And so we project our father on to our romantic partner.

348
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So all that other thing you were doing just just leave that alone for a little while and get in the way. I will confuse you. I have an unmet need with my father put me first is the unmet need put you first.

349
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter how busy your day was see me.

350
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you couldn't see you

351
00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So here, this person is a Daniel. Don't some other day it'll be something else, but here it is.

352
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you want for him to put you first to care about your goals and to take you seriously.

353
00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And it hurts that once again your it feels like you're 13 your unknown your unseen your uncared for and it's awful. He doesn't know he's having this big impact on you.

354
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.950
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I saw him, he makes it seem like

355
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.980
Nicole Roybal: What do you mean I always put you first. I do everything for you, you know, the bills I lend you money.

356
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, hold on, hold on, you're going to get. You're getting too much into content with him stay in the analysis stay in the analysis, Nicole of the projection of how we humans do that.

357
00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: To stay there, that it is typical and normal for all of us to do that. And why do you think we do it. Why do we humans do. Why do we project our father on to our partner. Why do we do it.

358
00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.330
Nicole Roybal: Because we're looking for that whole you feel

359
00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.100
Yeah.

360
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, if you have shame around that. That's a whole other level of inconvenience. So let it go. It's normal.

361
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's normal to want to heal from a childhood one to want to feel loved the way we didn't feel loved. When we were 13 we want it badly. We want it because it's a part of our development and if it doesn't get resolved, we almost stay 13

362
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We stay stuck.

363
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you're sitting there, smoking weed with your father.

364
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you guys get to talk, but it would cost.

365
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he talking to you about the steps that you need to take. Is he your cheerleader, or is it costs as you have to sit there and smoke weed with your father. Now, you already know I have a bias. So I don't cover it very well, but I don't like that. I don't

366
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I want him to say

367
00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This is bad for your body, you're a young woman it stunting your, your brain growth and you can't learn new things and it's bad for I can give a list your sex hormones your sex life. Like it's messing with a lot

368
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I want him to be able to say to you, sweetheart.

369
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry, I'm doing that. No more not smoking with you anymore and and let's let's get you motivated on on what are you worth the effort. You're talking to the IRS. How can I help and I wanted to help you.

370
00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: With with the whole debt consolidation nonsense and I wanted to say what the heck happened. I remember you are

371
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You are kicking butt you graduated from high school and and you are going to conquer the world like what the heck, let's see. Let's get you back on track. What's the first thing we need to do. I wanted to jump in there.

372
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You with me.

373
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.870
Yes.

374
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish your dad would step in and act like a father and not a buddy, not a smoking, buddy.

375
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But again,

376
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.590
Nicole Roybal: I've tried to tell him what you taught me and

377
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.300
Nicole Roybal: He doesn't believe it. Believe it any of it and like you said.

378
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You're wasting your words, you're wasting your time I'll never and I have never and I never have said, well, you should go tell your parents the facts, your shirt.

379
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:42.180
Nicole Roybal: Haven't. No, I just tried to like, share the knowledge I just learned, you know,

380
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Why

381
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You really think that all of the failed opportunities that they've had to be a good enough parent, you think they're going to want to look at that.

382
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:59.670
Nicole Roybal: Oh no, oh no, I don't tell them that stuff. I have tried to tell them like step up my boss and how maybe there's a problem or whatever.

383
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:17.700
Nicole Roybal: And they get so mad at them that perish, they like, and they especially my mom, she get so defensive and I'm just like, listen to me like actually think about it like, Please, just think about it like you think getting defensive better way to think about it like

384
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.840
Nicole Roybal: a roof over your head, didn't you, and I'm just like, Yeah, but

385
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But, Nicole. You wanted more than a roof over your head.

386
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.440
Nicole Roybal: You know, I just end up dropping it because it just, it doesn't lead nowhere.

387
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right now. You know, you're wasting your words but you know that a real time. I can't warn you, and say you're going to waste your time it's going to piss them off.

388
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:42.690
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

389
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but now you know

390
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You figure that out on your own.

391
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: When she tested it. If you just said to me, hey, should I just go tell me where to when it comes to talking about

392
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:53.340
Them.

393
00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It is true. There they would come to that on their own insight, the same way.

394
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling you, I hear a go. You should cut back on drinking, but for you. You wouldn't know wanted to hear it.

395
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:14.460
You're gonna

396
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna have to come to it on your own.

397
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you'll you'll come to it and I'm we out here. We've got to wait. I can go back and I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm now.

398
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta wait

399
00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I can have great advice. But you guys are going to have to feel it in real time with the truth is for you.

400
00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, with the 10 minutes that we have left. Actually, I won't be able to say that I'll have to jump out and go to run a group. So Nicole. Just take a look at today. Look at what you did what we talked about to send rewind.

401
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The film of today.

402
00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how you felt

403
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice what was an important growth moment. Maybe or an insight or maybe something that surprised you a thought or a feeling

404
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe something else.

405
00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see if you can tune into that.

406
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And see how you to carry yourself today you made sure that you did something in here today where you made sure you got what you needed

407
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:43.170
Nicole Roybal: Well, for one, I didn't realize how upset. I really was about Daniel laughing at my

408
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.600
Nicole Roybal: Newborn, I guess.

409
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:59.130
Nicole Roybal: I didn't realize I mean that upset and then also how you said feeling like you're 13 again every time you like downgrades or

410
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:07.620
Nicole Roybal: Like yeah, what do you said that you know what I mean like that really resonated because I didn't realize I get doesn't feel like a kid again. And then I start

411
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:20.190
Nicole Roybal: I guess I got I got the acting like a kid. But, like, kind of like I get pissed off. And like I said again my anxiety attacks and it really hot around by each so else

412
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:31.200
Nicole Roybal: Noticed that started happening again like a year ago and ever really on me. I got really hot, and like I couldn't handle it and I can agree that actually get out of the room because I

413
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

414
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.550
And so I guess it does kind of take me back to my

415
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.280
Nicole Roybal: Teenage so

416
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there we go that's that's a big insight and you did that all by yourself.

417
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.110
Nicole Roybal: Feeling

418
00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

419
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But what it means because you're willing to look at those pieces now, not the only truth, your family, your friends, they all have their piece they have something

420
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: They have their perspective, but you have every right to your experience of your, your childhood and and you have every right to that you had an experience and it doesn't make them bad parents

421
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't make you a bad girl. It just means it had an effect.

422
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're talking about it if you're willing to sit with it and talk about it, it means that you're not unconscious anymore. It means it's not driving your decisions.

423
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: on automatic pilot you means now you get to be conscious and awake and say, oh, now and you're sitting with Daniel and you notice heat. This is where your choice comes in. I noticed the heat. Oh my gosh.

424
00:50:49.590 --> 00:51:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: My 13 year old is getting activated again right now. And all I want to do is scream and yell and I feel so wronged. HOW COULD YOU HOW COULD YOU HOW COULD YOU THIS IS THE OLD ME. I feel like I'm a kid.

425
00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not 13

426
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And all of a sudden choice comes in and maybe something you and I have said, or somewhere along the line, something will be remembered, maybe that interaction between you and Dan will be different.

427
00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it will be. Hmm. Well, I'm sitting here right now thinking about how I was a kid, this feels exactly like I was when I was 13 me wanting you

428
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To take care of me, it's happening right now. I wanted so badly. It's almost like you're my dad. I want it like my life depends on it. I'm embarrassed. I can't believe I'm even saying this to you.

429
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I need to do it for myself, but

430
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It breaks my heart when you laugh at me.

431
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It reminds me of how I wasn't seen by my dad and breaks my heart.

432
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it won't be that. But you see how when you're conscious. Now, if they can both exist. What's happening a memory in the past and how it's getting triggered in the moment.

433
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, look at this. This is dialing out my response to this interaction with Daniel this long history back here is dialing up the intensity of what's going on here with me and Daniel you're conscious you're awake and if you stay conscious and awake.

434
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what becomes possible as you can name it just like I just said, right.

435
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm kind of expecting this from you that might be too much pressure. Daniel and I'm sorry about that.

436
00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's true. I kind of wish you step in their rescue me and take care of me. I wish my dad has when I was 13, you know. So what

437
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, you see, you don't have that option when you're not conscious.

438
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on, Nicole. So my concern is you just heard advice from a therapist. Is that what you just heard.

439
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:19.500
Nicole Roybal: No, I took it in. I know exactly, I guess. Yeah, the therapist is like

440
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not

441
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's not

442
00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't. So here's my concern we have a long time delay. So I keep talking over you in a really sorry about that. But here's my concern right before I go to really important Nicole, it is very important to me that you not hear me telling you to go tell Daniel. This is very important.

443
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:54.840
Nicole Roybal: I think I just I like I don't think you're telling me to do anything. It's me taking your advice and me trying to put it into how I could transcribe it into my world.

444
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:55.590
And put it on.

445
00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:00.870
Nicole Roybal: How I could try to have that conversation with Daniel next time it comes up.

446
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And the conversation is I'll tell Daniel How I'm actually feeling

447
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. All right.

448
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:24.060
Nicole Roybal: No, no, I don't ever think that you're telling me what to do. And I heard you say that one day know taking your advice and I just tried to put it into my world and how I could use it. I don't ever take your time.

449
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So just, just this last piece.

450
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, you worked very hard in here. Okay. This was a tough one. We went back in time and that that's not an easy thing to do, to look at what was missing when we love our family and to see them as flawed humans. They're not perfect. You know, that's a hard thing to do.

451
00:54:46.530 --> 00:55:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but also go slow. Like, why do we have to apply it right away. You just got it. What if you sit with it. Another week a month. What if you just sit and see if it's really true. Just watch.

452
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just watch. See where it shows up. Why, you know, do you have to take action right away. What if you just sat with this new insight, a little longer just it's fragile.

453
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I will see you in group.

454
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: casualty. Yeah. Are we scheduled for May 1 at 11

455
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: First at 11

456
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then I will see you in group on Tuesday. Do I can message. The doctor that you're here.

457
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:43.830
Nicole Roybal: Wait, why

458
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to know if there is, if I need to message. The doctor that you were here. Do I need to

459
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, okay. Then I will see you on Tuesday morning

460
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

461
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Be good to give

462
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You worked hard today. Thank you.

463
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody
