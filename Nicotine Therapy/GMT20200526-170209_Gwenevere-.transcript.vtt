00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to just do some logistics for just a second, just to bring you just aware of have some changes on my side. I'm working presently from a laptop. I no longer have cell.

24
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Service.

25
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.040
iPhone: So I

26
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I tried last night to do my normal thing where I check in with everybody and say, hey,

27
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think yours got that red exclamation mark. I'm not sure if yours went through.

28
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: To see you didn't get

29
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.720
iPhone: I got your glasses. This morning alone, or do you confirm. You said yes but no

30
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's good.

31
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a good sign. At least something came through. So here's what I noticed. Yeah. So here's what I did at 648 yeah 648

32
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, Good evening. Can you confirm tomorrow's individual therapy at 11am. Oh, and it's, it says not delivered. So that's I'm telling everybody right now.

33
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The norm, where I give a heads up the day before, is no longer in place. It's been an enjoyable courtesy text for everyone, including myself,

34
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So that I know other people are going to be there. I know you guys have benefited from it, but I cannot do that. I've tried using another cell that's a 505 area code apparent what I'm told is I'm in some sort of black phone like where there's like no ping from a tower. So that bites.

35
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to start to make a shift to doing I'll still try to be helpful to everybody. I'll try and go through emails and say, hey, confirming appointment. I'm going to try that and see if if it works, you kind of like it. You're okay with that.

36
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.680
If I give that a try.

37
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.040
iPhone: I should have checked my email.

38
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I didn't, I didn't go there. But that's my shift. I'm going to be making that this week. What else

39
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So that explains, maybe some disconnect. If you have been trying to get ahold of me. It's because

40
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I was flying. I was in an airplane, and then I'm now in this no cell service, which is, you know, I'm so used to just in, I mean,

41
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to have to adjust my my daily routines to now for you. What has this weekend, like

42
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.700
iPhone: Can we start with spring with the meditation today. Would you mind.

43
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I need one to, let's do it.

44
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.440
iPhone: Well, I'm actually sitting on the ground in my yoga mat for

45
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.560
iPhone: So I'm ready. Hold up.

46
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.260
iPhone: My phone or my iPhone battery was dying. So I kind of have to figure out a new arrangement. So I could keep it.

47
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.450
iPhone: Funky swift, a little bit. But, uh, I'm here.

48
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's set. Let's set the intention today with a nice natural exhale just letting the air go out at your own pace.

49
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And one more at your natural pace.

50
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful.

51
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's begin. Some structured breathing. When you're ready, inhaling through the nose on for count.

52
00:05:47.280 --> 00:06:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think we've got an inhale and then we're going to hold it for 4321 exhaling out the mouth for count 4321 and hold it for 4321 inhaling mindfully into the nose.

53
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Making that belly expand beautiful and hold it there for 321 exhale it all out, as if emptying a balloon letting it all laid out.

54
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Flat. Flat. Flat belly fat that's beautiful, and leaving that air out and holding your breath for 321 inhaling through the nose feel that air comes through the nostrils expanding to the top of the line down to the bottom of Milan opening up that chest like that belly expand

55
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

56
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's exhale out the mouth, push it out deliberately getting it all out.

57
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And holding it all out for 321 inhale through the nose.

58
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding it there for 321 last breath with the counting them will exhale as long as breath ever super slow, slow, slow. So, so, so, so, so, so pay attention to how slow, you can deflate that balloon.

59
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: When on your own counting just on your own using that structured breath. I'm just going to

60
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Invite you

61
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: To think about some things are not thinking about some things

62
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Just focus on your breath.

63
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: As much as you can. Being aware that the air is expanding in the lower long into the belly.

64
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.910
iPhone: I just my heart was racing so badly.

65
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:52.740
iPhone: When we first came in just a that I was having a hard time doing the for all the way. And so I'm just now.

66

Gwenevere Abriel: It's beautiful.

71
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.070

72
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.330

74
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.810

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.280
iPhone: Specifically because it seems to be having such a physical detrimental effect on me. Um,

154
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:13.950
iPhone: My inability to stop talking to because Thomas at periods and you know and or even stopped so people can respond

155
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.590
iPhone: Yeah, and it's also obviously a problem for whoever's

156
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.760
iPhone: Receiving so uh yeah

157
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.080
iPhone: So,

158
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, my question was a unique one in the sense that I know the content to work with and you've you've definitely familiar about this.

159
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.060
iPhone: But also feeling. I want to walk away. I want to walk away with

160
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:51.480
iPhone: A with an actual like tangible sense like a feeling like I have a plan and approach, maybe a toolbox to try and actually accomplish that, because I know we've been talking about it, but I don't know. Maybe I need a, like a training session or I just don't

161
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

162
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got that part. But we're almost there. I now know content I now know you want to walk away with a tangible plan and a tool. I can do that.

163
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I may feel like the call.

164
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.370
Of the field.

165
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If

166
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.660
iPhone: You don't. I mean,

167
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.170
iPhone: I've got a plan for next time I'm

168
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:11.070
iPhone: In us

169
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So the feeling is so we'll be able to check in on that or you'll at least be able to check in right as we're bringing our session to a close. We'll check in.

170
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Hope I remember. And if I if I don't, you can remind and say, hey, I kind of feel calm. I've got a tangible plan. I've got this

171
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Technique, I would use tool or technique or skill that I'm walking away with and and i was i had the word confidence in my mind you used calm but I had the word confidence and

172
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:48.750
iPhone: Also this idea in my head to your feeling like a positive feeling about that issue coming into this week. So a call because maybe of my, what is the word you used,

173
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I use confident. I thought, oh, you maybe have confidence about starting conversations with people that. She'll. She'll know how to be she'll be like,

174
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I don't mind talking to this person because I have faith in right confidence that I will be able to hear them and also get my point across. So that's what I thought maybe the a destination might also be a sense of confidence, I now have this

175
00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Scale and yeah

176
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:26.040
iPhone: Absolutely. Yeah, I think that kind of encompasses the column and the positive that I was saying in together. The other confidence. I think the calm and the positivity feelings going to come from my confidence that I have a, yeah.

177
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

178
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, yeah. Do you want me to give you an idea of what to do what we get. But it's a week.

179
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:40.620
iPhone: Yeah, it might be kind of a, you know, trial and error thing to see how it works. But yeah, I feel like I need to

180
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Go play and

181
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.500
iPhone: You know,

182
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think you said role play right

183
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:53.280
iPhone: Yeah training session role play. Yes, let's do it. So this is what, this is my idea and then you can tell me if this works for you.

184
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's my thought since you and I

185
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Since I can meaning provoke agitate I can bring out probably some. What if you're okay with hyper verbal being it's a quick way to say, I don't really like saying talk too much. It just means sort of not being able to

186
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.610
iPhone: Stop.

187
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.180
Yeah.

188
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.290
iPhone: It was my mom and very positive calm circumstances.

189
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.040
iPhone: Yeah, like

190
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.830
iPhone: For laid back, but it's so it's

191
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.060
It's okay.

192
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's my idea my proposition is this I will be able to probably do it with you in here and here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to say, Lauren.

193
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the felt sense right now. How about now. How about now. How about now. So that's what you're going to hear me do we're going to be doing a role play

194
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You probably will feel like talking going and then I'm going to. If it's okay with you. I need permission is I'm going to interrupt you and say,

195
00:18:52.200 --> 00:19:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe something you give me a sign, where I can cut you off. Maybe visually and then I'm going to check in on the say, How's the body. I want to know the register.

196
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what either you're seeing in my face for an effect or how you're feeling in your body. I want the relationship between what you're hearing what you're seeing right and what you're saying.

197
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want all those things. So there's a lot to pick up on. And I'm going to be taking lots of notes. The only part you you kind of need to do is is to a little bit, maybe more awareness in when you're continuing to talk if, like, maybe it's you. You may notice your heart just went out.

198
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Or you might notice the hand started to do something like this, whatever it is that's the somatic awareness. That's what I'm going to be looking for them to be like, Well, what's happening right now.

199
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the reasons the destination again what's the plan in the future is because once you know what that is.

200
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The body responds to stress before you come up with

201
00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: The word to describe the stress response. So I'm wanting your body to be the messenger. That's the one that you're going to be keying into when you're talking to anybody to a me to anyone on, you know, whoever

202
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why I'm saying let's go somatic let me understand what the messages from the body are, but I have to get your permission, because we just got back to kind of

203
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Be until together. So I don't want to hurt your feelings or come across abrupt or rude. So I want to make sure if I interrupt you, that it's welcomed and how should I do it. Can I do this or some little hand signal, something that you would welcome.

204
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What would work for you. That wouldn't hurt your feelings.

205
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for today. Just while we're role playing

206
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.130
iPhone: And I, oh my, my initial thought. We've heard said it was just something like that, you know,

207
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:51.630
iPhone: I don't know, maybe there could be like, Oh, what is that error or whatever, but that's

208
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.190
A little much.

209
00:20:54.570 --> 00:21:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't want visual. You don't want visual you do you think you would hear if I said

210
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.050
iPhone: Yeah.

211
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You would hear me.

212
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, okay, so, so, boop.

213
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:15.900
iPhone: Boop. And a second boo. But if it doesn't seem like I heard it, get a couple seconds later is, uh, yeah.

214
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.240
iPhone: So a couple. Okay.

215
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's, that's what I'm thinking I'm thinking that. So it's happening right now. I want you to tell me what you notice about you to close your eyes. If you can turn inward and let me know what messages are happening. Now what is activated in the body right now.

216
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.890
iPhone: No actual physical or

217
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am. Right in the body.

218
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm right away.

219
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:47.100
iPhone: The bottom of my feet and my palms got clammed up real sweaty and hot

220
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.620
iPhone: My heart started racing and I'm choked up like I could start crying.

221
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:53.400
Yep.

222
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.200
iPhone: Okay, and it intensifies to when you asked me.

223
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:06.420
iPhone: How it feeling in that moment, it's like everything kind of like it's magnified that I'm feeling like that too. So it makes it like yeah

224
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, okay. That's interesting. So I don't want to move too quickly and

225
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's sit with that for a moment.

226
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.460
iPhone: And I'm tense in general. My whole body.

227
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.300
iPhone: The right way.

228
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:25.290
iPhone: And a tense tense body and continues. Everything is continuing to as we're talking about it to

229
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.730
iPhone: Be creasing sweatiness in temperature and

230
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So what if you. What if you would you be okay with getting up because we had some success with getting a little less intensity from face to face contact. Would you feel comfortable kind of walking and stretching or doing something to

231
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Tailor yeah

232
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.910
iPhone: When I'm on the phone. I usually pace it drives me crazy all I'll just, you know,

233
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.270
iPhone: Definite man.

234
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.010
iPhone: Well, I guess I could leave the phone here, right.

235
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.190
Now,

236
00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We can you just take care of your body.

237
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't have the shaking screen.

238
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Okay, so what I want you to do is just as you start to move around just tune into how the feet feel

239
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How the pumps.

240
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that you now have permission to take this body that's messaging to you something important is happening and you're honoring that

241
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And it isn't just having to sort of conform to, you know, sit here and you talk to this therapist. Nope, you get to take care of yourself. Also, that's ever present in this work. In fact, it is paramount that in any given moment you're tuning in to what most creates safety for you.

242
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.690
iPhone: So tense. Once I got up and actually

243
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.060
iPhone: Aligned my body.

244
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:07.380
iPhone: Right position vertical I I feel like I just finished doing a race.

245
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.260
iPhone: around the track my muscles are so tense.

246
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.640
iPhone: Right now, you know,

247
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

248
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.250
iPhone: So nobody's

249
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:22.200
iPhone: Talking when I do that with people. It's like I'm not even aware of how I think my body.

250
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:23.970
iPhone: You're on the right track.

251
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

252
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.840
It's all tied together.

253
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so notice for those shoulders want to do. Do they want to maybe do they want to move themselves, do they want to maybe say something. And this is where we get into sort of right brain metaphoric things like if it, if those shoulders had a voice.

254
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: With that voice be

255
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.100
iPhone: Sitting

256
00:24:58.770 --> 00:24:59.970
iPhone: Like a protection.

257
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.230
iPhone: Like

258
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.690
iPhone: I guess. Don't hurt me.

259
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:07.680
iPhone: Or

260
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:10.770
iPhone: Anything.

261
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Boop up check in how they feeling now, now that you said, Don't hurt me.

262
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Check in how they doing

263
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.800
iPhone: They start moving around.

264
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:33.300
iPhone: In my body started to my muscles relax my shoulders relaxing.

265
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.360
iPhone: And I'm talking, I don't know, it's, it's a little better. I'm standing up.

266
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.330
iPhone: I answer my pocket. So my

267
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

268
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So being present with that we may not move much further from just where we are now. I think you're onto something pretty important.

269
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you're willing to say to me.

270
00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't hurt me.

271
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.470
iPhone: In the voice.

272
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't hurt me. See if you can tell me that you can

273
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep moving around.

274
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.260
iPhone: So you that

275
00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:08.520
iPhone: I need to read

276
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's okay. Tell me in in with the amount of passion and honest truth.

277
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That those shoulders. Shoulders have to say in your message to me. Don't hurt me.

278
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:34.050
iPhone: I don't know, trusting. I don't even know if I could say, I'm afraid to hurt me. I don't even know that I feel safe to say that, as I say it.

279
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:40.800
iPhone: But yeah, so same down on her knees all Morrow direct it's feels even riskier.

280
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. OK.

281
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're doing

282
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:53.490
iPhone: We're taking our last few days of saying as part of I'm so afraid I please don't. I really don't want that was going to add wanted to ask you.

283
00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:15.060
iPhone: Are you really, really do care about you're really not going. Do you know where the the feature the thing. But with that thought that I don't even know that I I'm confident that I'm to phrase even asked God so that it goes long that that Perry I concept goes along with the trusting to

284
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Ask for

285
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.020
iPhone: I'm afraid of

286
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.310
Book

287
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here's a moment to tune into. You see how you're doing. Feel the body.

288
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: As you're explaining. Right. How's it doing houses responding in the shoulders in the hands and the feet in the choked up area. How is it doing as you address this important issue.

289
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.120
iPhone: I'm

290
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:58.680
iPhone: Standing up and I still remember casing, but it's a lot less physical reaction that when I'm sitting, lot less. And I don't know if it's better to come out front view.

291
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:13.530
iPhone: But I think it's partly in case the attentions mostly gone and I don't feel the took apart right away when I started saying those, to be honest, personal things I put my hand. If I just

292
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:22.440
iPhone: My, my hands and feet are still really clammy, but my heart is did not start really going crazy and I didn't get the muscle.

293
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.780
iPhone: I think it's because I'm standing right in front of you now and I'm still

294
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:32.040
iPhone: Yes, city and I tend to slowly going to this.

295
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:33.600
iPhone: Yeah.

296
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.030
iPhone: I don't know. I've allowed myself that position by sitting to begin with.

297
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.140
iPhone: I don't know how

298
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:48.630
iPhone: To do that on a need to get, you know, get all curled up in a way. So, my body is more tense tense New York City.

299
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So just keeping keeping the focus on our original goal. I want to do another piece. So I'm going to do it again. I'm going to ask. I'm going to do.

300
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now check in right here with the hand on the chest because I've interrupted you several times with the boop.

301
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Can see

302
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: See if this part of your body is either beginning to feel safer if it is tight or if it's getting more relaxed and check in, because earlier it was very clear with don't hurt me check.

303
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It wants to see what you check in your in your body. We gotta go metaphor. Otherwise, we're in analysis really go into your body and feel it. See if it needs more safety, just check and see what it needs.

304
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.280
iPhone: Holding myself very tightly now.

305
00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.520
iPhone: Got my over my face and

306
00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.320
iPhone: After five ways

307
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.110
iPhone: I'm holding myself grippy myself.

308
00:29:52.620 --> 00:30:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. And how does it feel in the body without analysis. How does it feel to be taking care of you just the way you need it. How does it feel to that it's okay that you put your safety first.

309
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay that you're comforting yourself soothing. That's what people do is we all self sooth, we find a way right you're holding your own body.

310
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.610
iPhone: What do you mean, is it okay my bio K was

311
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're taking care of you.

312
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:29.640
Yeah.

313
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:31.590
iPhone: Okay, good.

314
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.700
Good.

315
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now check. Let's check in and see if those words that earlier seemed and you gave me all the analysis. I know it's scary.

316
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But your, your chest area was able to express earlier. That's what I wrote down. Don't hurt me. That might be what its messages. And yes, there was more, but let's just stay there. If you're willing, see if it's more comfortable.

317
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Playing it check and see now that you're doing the self soothing, you're kind of cradling yourself.

318
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: See if it's getting closer to being able to let me know that

319
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to be hurt by me see if it's getting closer.

320
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, Kerry.

321
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:28.290
iPhone: Said it from a, you know, very narrative style.

322
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok now very

323
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:33.900
Possible.

324
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

325
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:36.990
iPhone: Over here.

326
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Still scary. What do you think that chest would need to feel safer without analysis, try and catch that first response. What does it need to feel safer.

327
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:06.960
iPhone: I don't know. Probably just time and building trust. It's kind of why I wanted to, you know, take my time with my feelings of switching counselors, because I believe whatever

328
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:16.800
iPhone: If I want to try and build trust. It might take time. So just feel like I don't know. It's Sunday like solving the session. Okay.

329
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, right there. How's the body feeling. Once you said that piece. Did you notice any shift.

330
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:41.250
iPhone: I mean, each time when I start talking, especially if it's

331
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.580
iPhone: More real just call it

332
00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:50.160
iPhone: Yeah, it's I start greatly myself even tighter like

333
00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.400
iPhone: Yeah okay cryptic

334
00:32:53.430 --> 00:33:04.950
iPhone: Tighter, um, it's what I would do to win. I'd be fine for days. This is kind of the physical of what was going on during that time. It's a lot of for be myself.

335
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.400
iPhone: Yeah, rocking myself something

336
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:09.150
You know,

337
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.520
iPhone: Same. Same promotion reaction was

338
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you ever

339
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever noticed this.

340
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This way of self soothing with other people. Do you remember. Do you ever find yourself kind of talking with people and doing this kind of in interacting with other people as well.

341
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:50.250
iPhone: Yeah. And also, oh, raw, like, you know, as I'm speaking yeah I'm aware of it. And I think one of the most obvious physical being aware of. And so when I keep going because I I literally like not I'm starting to happen tonight. They're not feeling or whatever, that would be

342
00:33:51.300 --> 00:34:00.120
iPhone: So yeah, I don't know, but you know, I'm not you've been asking me how you feel. I feel it. I'm not immediately aware of it. No, it's not to like is doing it for

343
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:11.850
iPhone: Like I'm doing that for 510 15 minutes before I actually become aware of my physical were like oh my gosh, I'm like, you know, so no not right away, where

344
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to tell

345
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.090
iPhone: Like it's really

346
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:20.610
iPhone: affecting me where I can't breathe Take a breath properly.

347
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, wake up.

348
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't take a breath. Okay, just I'm doing my best to hear everything as you're moving. So I heard can take breath. What if we're on to something with that. What if that's our marker.

349
00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.220
iPhone: What's that

350
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that I can't take a breath. So let me, let me tell you what my hypothesis is here. I'm thinking

351
00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Because remember, the goal is, we're going to try to find something semantically in the body that marks that anxieties coming up and probably there's

352
00:34:52.980 --> 00:35:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of talking. And so if we can register that quickest, it might be, is it the holding of a breath might be a really clear sign that you're feeling really anxious and might be talking

353
00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.090
iPhone: That's the one I don't notice to like

354
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I

355
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:13.350
iPhone: Bought from for like 10 minutes. That's the last thing I notice I think everything else already been happening. I'm not even aware of it.

356
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's

357
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's too far down the line.

358
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.920
iPhone: Yeah, so forgive her for what we described the

359
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:26.730
iPhone: clammy hands up the heart racing of adrenaline rush. I guess it's kind of a thing.

360
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.190
But so

361
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.070
iPhone: Almost a crazy feeling in my belly.

362
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:39.960
iPhone: A few times, just a little bit like a god, I don't know. You know that and

363
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.620
iPhone: And the tend to tend to not first, I feel, and then slowly as it goes on.

364
00:35:47.700 --> 00:36:02.190
iPhone: In our sessions, whether I'm talking, you're talking cuz I think it's about me personally I continue to more and more curlin. It's like the whole time. So I can. I'm holding myself tighter and tighter getting

365
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

366
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:08.220
iPhone: facing right now though as much as i i'm surprised it's not more

367
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.820
iPhone: Maybe cuz you're cutting me off here.

368
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't

369
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I accidentally cut people off all

370
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It says my internet is unstable. So I might have a problem and I do apologize for that. Again, I'm in this weird place. So let me tell you I've refined that the holding of the breath is too far down the line. We needed an early

371
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This earlier sign. Oh, good.

372
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:54.030
iPhone: It's happening. I'm holding my breath. I know the whole time. Why, because I'm talking. I'm not taking a breath, but I don't become aware of it until I've like my body's like hey do you need to inhale, you know,

373
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.110
iPhone: Oh yeah so

374
00:36:55.230 --> 00:37:00.210
iPhone: It's I don't realize it for further on. I know it's happening from the beginning with everything else.

375
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.440
iPhone: Right, but

376
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's the thing. I know you're not hooked. I know you're not holding your breath for 10 minutes so it probably it might not be. For now, let's say we were just starting here if we could catch

377
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Since the breath is going to force you to remember the body, it's going to force you to do it because it's going to demand that you have an inhale.

378
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

379
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to make it.

380
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:31.740
iPhone: Really, it's like micro wrestling not really taking a concept of taking care of my body deep breathing, which you should be

381
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um, I think we've got some good signals. We could either use awareness of heart racing. We could use queasy. We could use

382
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The all of our tents. We could use. Also, we got choked up we've got all over. We got clammy hands and feet. We've got lots of really cool signals going on that could message. Hey,

383
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Check and see. Now we're going to go cognitive. We just went somatic. Now we're going to go top down for a second. Now we're going to go. These are thoughts. So cognitive for just a moment. Now once. Let's imagine that we're able to accomplish that. And we can catch it and you catch it quick.

384
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

385
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a nice inhale.

386
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, let's say that that's a sequence that's going to play into this. So there's going to be body awareness, there's going to be an inhale and exhale and then

387
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to try and find out the sequence of this might not. I have a feeling it's going to be body awareness cognition and then it's going to be breath. So here's what I'm guessing. So I'm because I'm feeling it myself. Like, what would I do

388
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.950
iPhone: Oh my god Pavlov's dog, you know, the train or an action to train to bring pattern.

389
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:44.760
iPhone: Yeah, right.

390
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm trying to get watch this. I'm going to do it out loud, and then we're going to make it personal for you. We're going to make it something that might work for you. So this is what, this is what I'm thinking. It'd be something like this. So I'm I'm anxious and I catch I catch myself.

391
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: On way up here. I know, because like all my shoulders come up high and I noticed I've really, I can feel like all this

392
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it all this air is sitting up high. And so I catch it and I

393
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I say to myself, this is the cognitive part. This is the self talk that this is a piece of one of the the plan that I want for you today. If we can pull this off is I want you to be able to say something to yourself. And this is where I need your help. Now for me.

394
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say something like, if I'm

395
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Really going to your right me

396
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.720
iPhone: Is a good word for you.

397
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, yeah, of course. Yeah. And then you, you

398
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Are going to come in reaction to mind. You're going to go well I don't like that or that made me think of this. So this is going to be, or this is what one of your does when I'm doing this and I'm feeling anxious I say

399
00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at you. You're trying too hard.

400
00:39:51.090 --> 00:40:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's me like I'm trying too hard. I notice I'm on guard. That's a self talk that I do. I say I'm trying too hard. Now that gets an eye. Okay, that is a trigger for me to remember to breathe.

401
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Now trying too hard for granted. There is I'm trying to get my point across help show off, get attention be approved be liked, like as a human as a human, I might be doing that and

402
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I use as a cognitive self talk, I might say cheese. Okay, you're trying really hard. It's okay, you're okay.

403
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

404
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I what I'd like to do for you is what is something like let's go fast forward 10 minutes you've been talking and talking and talking

405
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever catch a thought like, like, Oh my gosh, I've been talking for a long time. Do you ever catch something like a thought that you have about yourself that we could use

406
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:56.880
iPhone: Yeah, you know, I actually will interrupt my own. I talk actually out loud to myself like my thought process when I'm working things out a lot to an all interrupt my own self and tell myself more and shut up.

407
00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:08.130
iPhone: But also when I'm talking to friends, I'll go. I'm so sorry I can't shut up of suicide. And then, and it's like, I interrupted, like, by the way, I'm aware. I'm doing this. And then I continue to speak.

408
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:18.840
iPhone: But yet, unable to stop, but I just got enough awareness, I'm able to let the person know you're, you know, you're not alone. I have right here with you. I wish I could shut up. Yeah.

409
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've seen you do it with me. I know exactly what you're talking about. You do have this self awareness and

410
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:32.820
iPhone: We're going to go with your thoughts, kind of like the crazy old so that I don't understand. So

411
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I think you actually cognitively understand. I think I'm guessing that the stress reaction is so intense.

412
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: In in the compelling need to continue even though you've started talking. It's just like if I keep talking.

413
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't be this. You remember how earlier when I took a moment. And I said, let's turn inward let's pay attention to what your body's doing and it got amplified.

414
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It was like, then, then I had shoulders choked up bottom of my feet, palms and heart I had all this, this happen, but you know you informed me

415
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's my guess. My guess is that if you stop talking.

416
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You might have to feel

417
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And meaning feel. I'll be using the word as body.

418
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And

419
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The magic in the breath. I can't emphasize it enough. It's like magic. Because right I'm talking. I'm talking

420
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: When I feel this body way up here, tight and I

421
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a breath. And I remember

422
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. I'm okay.

423
00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:44.940
iPhone: Here I am, yeah.

424
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, here I am trying

425
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:51.810
iPhone: Off I lose my, you know, for a metaphor and I need Dutch

426
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

427
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, but

428
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.010
iPhone: Not a question. Sure.

429
00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:56.760
Quick

430
00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.150
iPhone: I such a hard time stopping, do you think, what about a

431
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:09.300
iPhone: Before I even open my mouth with someone to actually

432
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:23.550
iPhone: Maybe even the help me so I'm able to stop once I start to do the breathing started before I even begin speaking kind of precedent with taking at least one nice healthy. Big breath in and out.

433
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. And we're that's a great piece of this, so that's a piece, the purse and I'm almost to that one. That's fantastic. I just wrote that down. And that's absolutely there's one part I want to do that. That is

434
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So this has to do with

435
00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Insight on mines. This is the cognitive part inside our minds. It's almost like

436
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have permission to have quiet.

437
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:59.340
iPhone: Right, because of the stuff our thoughts. I mean, yeah.

438
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, interpersonal it

439
00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If there was quiet, someone could

440
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: could hurt you.

441
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But if

442
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it if you keep talking like I can't hurt you.

443
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:16.080
iPhone: That's a really good point.

444
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Scary. Because then I might attack. I might criticize, I might judge if you just keep going then. And that's where this is this final piece right in here about

445
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You have every right to have some quiet you have every right to take care of yourself. And this is where the deep, deep work comes in in

446
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing where that boundary is where you're protecting yourself in any given second

447
00:44:44.940 --> 00:45:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: With another human because we humans we do hurt each other in any little conversation I i do it i i i i do my very best to show care, but I do, I hurt people's feelings. I don't mean to but I use the wrong words and and i i sound judging.

448
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And it happens.

449
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this part right in there. When you sort of just now when you said, Boy, that might be something right, you said, what, what were you thinking about when it's a big

450
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You from getting hurt.

451
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:25.290
iPhone: Oh well, I mean, you're absolutely right. I mean, I've always I didn't really ever see it.

452
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.350
iPhone: Like just said like I

453
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:43.830
iPhone: Didn't put that together, like I mentioned before, I noticed they got a lot more amplified after my last boyfriend. He was an alcoholic and he would get drunk and break up with me about three, four times a week for about a year and a half, and a

454
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:49.470
iPhone: Is a nightmare. He never remember these blackout drunk, but he would get very argumentative

455
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.470
iPhone: Now you're very smart guy, and

456
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.590
iPhone: I would argue with them like you

457
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.100
iPhone: Know it's a few tile was a drunk but I

458
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:09.450
iPhone: Had laryngitis on the entire time he dated from arguing so heavily, and he would get so loud belligerent and I would really have to almost even get like to

459
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:24.330
iPhone: contend with him, and it really was got that I noticed how amplify all this social anxiety in this hyper Taka after that I had it before, but it was way worse. It's been a lot more extreme since then.

460
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:33.330
iPhone: And I know a lot of that was he would cut me off all the time, interrupt me and I mean of course you super demeaning and crew. Also, but I'm

461
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:44.550
iPhone: All these arguments and we of course they were a few tile. It's not that stupid. I ended arguments or I can never want to look at, but the feeling I always had was

462
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:53.730
iPhone: And what I went away from. Was this some urgency that I needed to say everything that I really wanted to get across what I was feeling or thinking

463
00:46:54.030 --> 00:47:03.660
iPhone: And I need to do right then, before I got interrupted cut off stopped out and they walk away or whatever it is, urgency, I feel I'm afraid that if I don't take now if I let them.

464
00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:18.960
iPhone: Out or event, the whole point across. And I breathe and they respond. Their, their response will be 100% and form. And so they may respond with, not even having not under the whole thing and it'll, it'll be an erroneous response. You know what I mean.

465
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.930
iPhone: I do. It's kind of all those things tied together. But when you

466
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.050
iPhone: Said that that type it into the feelings more

467
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Specifically, but it turned inward boo boo.

468
00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:29.820
iPhone: Yeah.

469
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: See how the body's doing right now.

470
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.810
iPhone: We're not raising those much

471
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.300
iPhone: Okay, bye. Peter

472
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.640
iPhone: Peter family who will be both face.

473
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:46.290
iPhone: A

474
00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:48.300
iPhone: Lot about

475
00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we will, we want to do is be tracking what is so we did hear about

476
00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The feet. We saw a little pacing. We have some arms crossed, we have some of that right now. These books that I do are interruptions.

477
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: They're the very thing that is provoking the very thing you're describing, which is I have an urgency to make sure I get my message across. I may never have that opportunity again.

478
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am doing it to you in vivo, which means right in the moment I'm interrupting you. And that's the feeling that I want to understand how it registers in your body when I interrupt you.

479
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.580
iPhone: I don't know, maybe because I was

480
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:36.060
iPhone: counting on it or something, I don't know, it's, it's not that big of a deal. And in fact,

481
00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:48.990
iPhone: Now the invention it real. In reality, pausing and letting the person respond or interrupt me is not that big a deal. I got the response is not nearly as bad as the anticipation

482
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.420
iPhone: The fear of the

483
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:52.470
iPhone: Result.

484
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.040
iPhone: You know,

485
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I do

486
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.680
iPhone: I think we

487
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So now now. Can I just do a little, a little just psycho education my brain and most most people's brains.

488
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: have what's called sort of a working memory, which means I'll be thinking about basically

489
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A small amount of information at a time. I'm not thinking about all of the text. I've already we have basically a desktop of information that I can hold in my working memory at any given time. And that is my focus

490
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Now here's the thing.

491
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I cannot remember everything you said.

492
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There are other other other people to

493
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Us. But I mean, because you're until you're an intelligent person so you can generate a lot of information, a lot of words very quickly and all of them are important, but I literally

494
00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Physically, as in tissue in my brain. I can't hold it in my working space because I'm also I'm trying to also see what's the therapeutic

495
00:49:52.770 --> 00:50:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A move here. So there's a lot going on with these pieces of information that you you give, and I want to treat them, each with so much respect but they they pass like a like a train. I'm like,

496
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, there was

497
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a good one right so

498
00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.300
iPhone: That's

499
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:11.580
iPhone: That's really helpful and

500
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:14.550
iPhone: astute observation.

501
00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So from the consumer right of your information. We want to hear each piece and give it due diligence of reflection, but for me anyway. I can't quite do it.

502
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's new stuff coming in.

503
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And so if we could do a reframe just to reframe today as because we got six minutes left here.

504
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know, it's amazing. Right. That's crazy.

505
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.720
iPhone: Session saying how quickly the month.

506
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude, I know. So, um, so we may get get all the way through the technique but but we have a great start. So I want to add this extra piece which is

507
00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Reframing from the me's the outside world as a threat, seeing the me's the other of the world in your community in your social peer group less as a threat as more as

508
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: They want

509
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear me.

510
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it again me

511
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: The rest of the world. They can only hold a small you can pity us right we can only hold hold a small amount of information.

512
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And they want to hear, but I'm going to have to dish it out in small portions. So glad to be here, she's all right but I can't. She can't really speak to too much information at once. So I'm going to serve it at a dose that she can actually hear

513
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You can feel sorry for me like this poor whenever she you know she can't she can't think about too many deep things back to back to back.

514
00:51:55.770 --> 00:52:08.280
iPhone: All that way. That's why when you go to a class, you take notes. You go home, you study, you do exercises on the subject, and you take the exam, it's all, it's reinforced one. I see. So what you said is completely valid and

515
00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:17.190
iPhone: It's true for me to knowing can take in all that information. Thank you for pointing out, though, that knowing that probably pointed out two

516
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.100
iPhone: Things to you that was mind blowing.

517
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's see if we can integrate that. The first one is conceptualizing that the other meaning us other human beings that our intentions are to hear you.

518
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there some truth for you and that

519
00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We do want to hear you.

520
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:44.520
iPhone: Yes. What's an asterix

521
00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:48.240
iPhone: With a footnote.

522
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And we, we may disappoint you. Is that something like that.

523
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.980
iPhone: Misunderstanding, I was going to go into a

524
00:52:59.700 --> 00:52:59.820
Bit.

525
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.980
iPhone: Of a

526
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:18.720
iPhone: Because my graduation Vicky I've chosen lots of bad dynamics in the past. So, uh, I'm kind of fulfilling my own fear I have fulfilled in my own tears, a lot of cases. So

527
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:21.480
iPhone: You're right to enroll people interact with

528
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:24.660
iPhone: Boo, boo. I got a lot of bad experiences so

529
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, boop. So I want to reinforce something right before you said Astrid. Did you know that you paused.

530
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and

531
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.540
iPhone: I thought I knew I thought it was too much info.

532
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you and you did it. So in vivo. You did it on your own. You found your organic recipe so

533
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's happening even though we don't have it all structured and written out, we will get there. But that was a lot to ask from one session.

534
00:53:55.290 --> 00:54:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but I just want to reinforce learning. You did it organically. What you did was you said something at a really reasonable pace of speech and you said it, and you said you said yes.

535
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: With an Asterix and guess what you did.

536
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You stop talking and you put a pause. And you know what that gave me time to do. Then I got to say, oh, like as in will disappoint you, and then you said, well, kind of more like that dynamics. I did it with Vicki. Did you see that you did that.

537
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.090
iPhone: Was. What do you mean at the end there.

538
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You made it happen. You put the pause in there. You did it all by yourself just now. That's all it takes. So whatever it is that gave you

539
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The permission to not have to explain yourself because you don't have to. When you say Asterix

540
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I guessed right. But it gave it gave you time to hear my interpretation of it and it was off and then guess what, then you explained it. And that's the volley back

541
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And forth with small bits of information we volley.

542
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my interpretation. So I did. I got it wrong, which right and then you volley back over the net with understanding you volleyed with. Well, more, more like just the dynamics that I had set up with the sticky. You know you clarified it

543
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You made that happen in here today.

544
00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:36.300
iPhone: Cool. Yeah, your, your observations there that kind of know it's like sometimes it's just so it can be just the littlest thing but it opens my mind to. I don't know. It made me

545
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:44.640
iPhone: I'm so desperate for someone to hear me. And when you say you know i i can't. And I'm pretty sure most humans cannot

546
00:55:45.300 --> 00:56:00.150
iPhone: You know, soak in everything when you're doing like a runaway train and it was like since my whole point of doing that is my fear of not being understood that somehow was like the big one. You like whoa.

547
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:10.980
iPhone: That was as somehow given me a an out like an avenue to take the don't explain the whole thing.

548
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.670
iPhone: You know what I mean, like, give me permission to

549
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

550
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:17.370
iPhone: We know right them.

551
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:18.360
And just

552
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And just now. I was waiting for you to find a way to to bring that thought to a close and what I saw was you were talking, talking, and

553
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you said, do you know what I mean. Now that so you know how sometimes you wonder, well, how do I instead of saying sorry I talked too much. That's your key that's your way to segue to getting the person that you're talking to, to participate in the volley back

554
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is, that's your that's your things that you get to say out loud, is you get to say out loud, something like

555
00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I losing you here or

556
00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to talk more about any parts of what I said or do you, do you understand

557
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Because guess what it does. It includes other back into the conversation and they get to actually share

558
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What they heard they get to say, oh, yeah, you lost me five minutes ago. Um,

559
00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But, or they get to say, Oh, yeah, yeah. But then you notice they only caught the most recent stuff and not that juicy stuff you shared in the first part of the share but more the disclosure send at the end because maybe that's all they could retain but that might be your way is to say

560
00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. Man, or you know what I mean, sweetie, or you know whatever the other person is in because you did it in here organically. You did it all by yourself.

561
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I did a little bit of interrupt. I did. Pause So here's what I did, because I told you we'd be doing the work in vivo and

562
00:57:52.080 --> 00:58:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't need to do too much role play it just sort of happens. So what I did is I watched you say, do you understand, and I was kind of hoping you put a little bit more time, but I couldn't you didn't do it.

563
00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.100
You don't leave

564
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't leave time for me, the other world. The other people as humans to answer you.

565
00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:10.740
iPhone: Yeah.

566
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We will we will just just feel sorry for us that we can't think as fast as you do pity pity the fool where they will

567
00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:30.090
iPhone: Write that really come from that last boyfriend. It's it were even asking and then continuing to talk. It's, I, I was just like so afraid in a way

568
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's, inhale together. We're at two minutes over. I know I need to run a group

569
00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.450
iPhone: I have a question before we

570
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.260
Close.

571
00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:46.650
iPhone: If I go to group last week and we didn't have group. This week, could we meet twice this week and twice. Next week individually.

572
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.960
iPhone: Cuz I guess I can afford it since I didn't pay for groups, after all.

573
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

574
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you. I would love for you to see my Thursday group. No chance. You want to go at 11

575
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:00.630
iPhone: Oh, yeah.

576
00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:10.500
iPhone: I'd love to. I was kind of bummed. I, I didn't end up going last week and then we didn't have it yesterday. So 11am Thursday.

577
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And the answer is yes. I just, I've got some some clumpiness going on over here. Um,

578
00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So real quick and then I gotta jump out it to run this group I'm putting a Lauren will be in the 11am group. So you may need to set a timer for that.

579
00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And and should will all be all message your doc that you were here today, but also Lauren for our scheduled scheduled one that's a sure thing.

581
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well,

iPhone: Yeah.

583
00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So, and then I'll be keeping in mind if there is something that opens up. Do you want me to to to email you

iPhone: Yeah, if you have a available time later this week.

585
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't have time to go into it, but I did everything I said I would. I I message to Elena Elena. I didn't have a schedule I messaged

586
01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This woman Lisa Anderson. She's pretty brand new has not too many clients I did messaged her

587
01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't heard back from her. She said, we'll connect and we can sort of process about good she said good fit, which I think you're looking for a good fit to. So just so you know I've done what I said I would do.

588
01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's keep working through it I guess we'll take it.

589
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:45.480
iPhone: Yeah, I'm okay. Continuing to meet with you said it was a big transformative move with just your I just felt like I was cornered. So your willingness

590
01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:53.250
iPhone: To do it like really kind of opened the door for us. Again, I guess so. I see. So for now, if you can. I don't know.

591
01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we'll put a pin in it. I

Gwenevere Abriel: Won't

01:00:56.310 --> 01:01:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't move on transfer aggressively and you know what I mean, I'll just kind of we'll keep talking. And if Lisa and I talk. Then I'll kind of keep her update as you and I are progressing.
