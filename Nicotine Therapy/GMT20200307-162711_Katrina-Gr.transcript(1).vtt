Nice.

121
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.880
ROB: Quit everything yeah well yeah drugs. Yeah, we were doing were, you know, they were able to

122
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:09.600
ROB: To get off with methadone and method on. I had a problem with that too. So I ended up on Suboxone and then I met you up here when I got here. So, yeah.

123
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:19.380
Katrina Groves: So yeah, let's go into that your history of substance abuse. I know we probably gone through this and you went through this on tape, but

124
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:28.500
Katrina Groves: How old were you when you first began to use your first substance like what did you use marijuana or what was your first thing as a kid. And how old are you,

125
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:34.710
ROB: Oh yeah, well everybody smoked pot. When I was growing up when I was a kid, you know, in my it, but I was

126
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:47.070
ROB: A farm boy, so I didn't really get into drugs until I was, you know, 1718 but I smoked weed and did a line once in a while, you know, just with friends before that, but

127
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:58.470
ROB: I started my first shot crank when I was like 19 years old and it was downhill from there. But I worked my whole life. You know, so I was off.

128
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:18.270
ROB: I worked on boats. So I would be working and then I'd be off for two weeks to two months to a year, whatever you know whatever I want to pick up. So that was an open door to party, you know, and then I stopped drinking when I was about, I don't know, probably I would just safe to say 30

129
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.250
Katrina Groves: When did you start drinking

130
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.350
ROB: Oh, I never liked to take a taste of alcohol or beer, you know,

131
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.730
ROB: Even now, if I drink a beer or something. It's really hard to drink so

132
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.100
Katrina Groves: But did you start drinking the same time you started partying and doing crank because everybody else was or

133
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.980
ROB: Yeah, yeah, I'd say so. Okay.

134
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.030
Katrina Groves: And what kind of when was cranky drug of choice. And when did you start using the opioids.

135
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:56.700
ROB: Oh, not until, you know, I tried it before but I all my friends back home because I split went to Louisiana and they all did you know there's a few of them that did heroin and I

136
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:05.160
ROB: wasn't worth it to me. I always thought that I was above that or something, you know. Yeah. Then I went to prison up in Washington.

137
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:19.290
ROB: In 97 when I got out. I met this girl. And we started you know that was her drug of choice. So I was like, yeah, whatever. I was working. So I was able to support the habit.

138
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.420
ROB: If I did, very little. Yeah.

139
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:32.010
ROB: And then when I tried to stop you know you know the story there. It just, I couldn't stop. And so I came to California again in 2000 2001

140
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:42.960
ROB: Kicked at my, my dad's house and that is in brutal, it was, it was no good. We don't, we don't talk anymore. You know, I don't think he dug that and then

141
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.000
ROB: It was up and down from there until

142
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.160
ROB: You know,

143
00:11:51.240 --> 00:12:04.410
ROB: I don't know about seven years ago, and it took about two years to really to get out of that you know when you're using when you're doing methadone. It just seems like you should do heroin with it, I guess, you know,

144
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.930
Katrina Groves: So you were in a methadone program. Yeah.

145
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.890
Katrina Groves: I gotten that

146
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:19.320
ROB: Um, I got it for free for a year, because I was on probation and that was in 2004 2006 and then I got back on.

147
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:27.000
ROB: Oh, two years before I got on on buprenorphine or or

148
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:36.000

ROB: Just went away. I think

295
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:33.450
Katrina Groves: That might help if you feel like you know when you probably have a little bit of emphysema from smoking for so long. So those puffers really help if you're sick, you know, you might want to have one on hand.

ROB: Coming down. Yeah. One time, it really freaked me out. I had to go to the hospital, but

Katrina Groves: Catholics, or something.

321
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.160
Katrina Groves: Didn't get read

322
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:30.450
Katrina Groves: Yes.

323
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.530
Katrina Groves: Yes. Wow.

324
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.880
ROB: Yeah, I

325
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:40.590
ROB: I don't know if you ever saw my legs but they're pretty they're pretty damaged. Not that not as bad as some people but there enough

326
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.740
ROB: Yeah.

327
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.580
Katrina Groves: I wonder what in the world started at this time and

328
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.360
ROB: I don't know.

329
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:55.710
ROB: Well, I've got my knees got tore up months off a little accident tonight and

330
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:10.890
ROB: They're still, they don't really they heal all the way, but they still have this. I don't know that you can still, they still get a scab right near the crease of them because they're right right here on my knee or right here.

331
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.330
Katrina Groves: Show me your leg.

332
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:18.780
ROB: He the scars.

333
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.210
Katrina Groves: Now, you're too low. Oh.

334
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.250
ROB: Yeah. I forgot the cameras up there.

335
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.270
ROB: Can you see him.

336
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.140
Katrina Groves: Still too low. Turn your TV. Turn your thing down. Oh, yeah.

337
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:43.320
ROB: Yeah scars on my leg. So they never really a heel and they say they don't you know they said you could last all the whole time. But I keep them clean and

338
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:54.420
Katrina Groves: At the problem, I think, as you know, as if you use up all your veins that they just, they don't work anymore. And then you've got scar tissue and then you're prone to getting little infections, so

339
00:27:54.510 --> 00:28:07.110
ROB: Yeah, this one right here was from a wreck and I had dirt in it rocks and everything and finally got all cleaned out, but I don't think everything's out of it, or I don't know. It just never heals all the way you know

340
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.070
ROB: Because it's the band. It's right on the head, there's nothing they can do about it.

341
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:19.860
Katrina Groves: Yeah, well it's good keeping an eye on it. Do not get diabetes. I'm really glad you're losing some weight because if you got diabetes. That would be a really bad thing to have.

342
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.470
ROB: Especially my feet, my legs. Yeah.

343
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:29.100
Katrina Groves: All right. Well, that was good. Um, so any other skin problems like dry skin elsewhere.

344
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.270
ROB: It. You're trying to keep it moist. Take a, you know, okay.

345
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.520

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:54.780
ROB: I go I i've been I got one. Not a mole, but a pre cancer and he just sprayed my face right here. And then he found one over here. So he got rid of those. And I did a full body check and he's fine but I go back. I think in two months. Two more months to

348
00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:00.180
Katrina Groves: Was that for a dermatologist, or is that through your, your doctor at the clinic.

349
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:09.870
ROB: No, that's a dermatologist over here, dermatology. Yeah. Yeah. I was getting all this stuff checked out to make sure I had one on top of my head needed. Nope, that's okay.

ROB: But he found the one right here under that I always had a problem right here. And he sprayed that now when he was gone. And there was a little anything so

351
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.190
Katrina Groves: What's the name of your dermatologist. I didn't know we had any interest in Sydney.

393
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:38.190

394
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.970

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:22.620
ROB: My thoughts yet and and I suffer from PTSD. So I only learned that a few years ago. So now I understand.

435
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:38.100
ROB: That the depression is all it's from the, you know, from the past is not from what's happening right now and I've learned that so it's easier to deal with. And I could be in my worst mode and still pull myself.

436
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:53.100
ROB: To, you know, class, it's only an hour long, you know, hour and a half and three or three hours even but uh yeah I usually tape record and all my classes I got the disability thing so I could do that and

437
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:59.700
ROB: Yeah, so I come back and I listened to my recordings and I write my papers. So what

438
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.010

Katrina Groves: Like a child abuse or I didn't hear any

445
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.020
ROB: Well, I went I

446
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:23.970
ROB: Went from

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:43.620
ROB: Pretty much it all happen at once I there was a family issue and I split from home. I mean, it was a perfect family. I mean, I guess you could call it that, you know, they're still doing their thing. But I went straight off the cliff. I went I ended up first.

448
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:52.470
ROB: I ended up in the first place I ever went and I got in trouble as a juvenile when I was 14 years old, his boys Republic.

449
00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:02.400
ROB: And I'm getting blanket party there and I got busted up pretty hardcore so I split from there and then they put me in mobile camp, which I didn't feel I belong in

450
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:12.300
ROB: Excuse me, so I split from there. So I was a runner. I ran. I ran and the third time, they said, California youth authority. And when I went there. I was going to go for

451
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.350
ROB: An evaluation and, you know, get off and be on

452
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:30.900
ROB: parole or whatever. And I'd been 15 then but I got into a riot. So they put me in probably one of the worst places in California, which I saw everything the third day, I was there I saw Mexicans kill another Mexican

453
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.550
ROB: So yeah you know that's it's just all from there and

454
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.420
Katrina Groves: Islands.

455
00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:41.520
ROB: Islands. Yeah. And I never thought I'd never bugged me. I kept my, you know, and then

456
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:59.250
ROB: Kind of been through some crazy stuff in my life and I just kept that stuff down and I never thought me and it was just a few years ago. It just, it just toppled landed a, you know, almost turned myself into two, I forgot what it's called.

457
00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:01.290
Katrina Groves: Yeah.

458
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:14.760
ROB: Yeah. Yeah, but I was able to get on some medication. And then, you know, I was running wild for just a minute. I'm just too old for that. And I, I met a site that

459
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:23.670
ROB: She really helped me out. She was she's an older woman in in Santa Rosa, she wrote a few books and stuff. So she got my case.

460
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:39.930
ROB: And from there on it. It started working taught me some breathing and they put in, but the psychic psychiatry so psychologists, excuse me, this psychiatry is put me on Seroquel I can't remember the medical all those

461
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:51.540
ROB: Yeah, and that's about where it snap, but actually right before that I was working and my step mom had a friend who's a

462
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.630
ROB: Pa and

463
00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:01.290
ROB: Anyway, up in the Sierras. And she got me on she gave me a bunch of

464
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:09.600
ROB: What are those called the test not. I mean, they're just samples samples they gave me a bunch of samples of

465
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:23.100
ROB: I forget the name of that it's an anti depressant. But I was on it for like almost a year and then I ran out, you know, I didn't have it anymore because my step on me. I go through and

466
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:31.890
ROB: And I got this. I was getting the shock. It was like shocks coming up from my beat to the back of my head, and I don't know how to explain them.

467
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.150
Katrina Groves: I don't know. It's when you run out of

468
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:34.770
Katrina Groves: money ran out of antidepressants.

469
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.120
ROB: Yeah, so I went through this thing for about a month.

470
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:46.290
ROB: And I, that's where I ended up starting again on on crank and, you know, and that helped a little and then

471
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:54.210
ROB: Eventually it went back to heroin. Again, I was kicked for right then, when I was back when in 2000 I was getting for like two years and

472
00:40:54.630 --> 00:41:06.270
ROB: On nothing. I was I was fine. I was working, but that just not right there, kick my butt. So I wasn't able to get on those again they tried to put me on him here why I was here and

473
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:24.000
ROB: You know, Hey, that was running the past this will work. And I started taking on and it was new. I can't do it. I don't want to freak me out and I guess that had a little to do with it too. Anyway, I'm sorry but yeah that's I had kind of a little break down there.

474
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.930
ROB: And

475
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:37.170
Katrina Groves: It's good that you're getting in touch with that because if you just try to do your recovery superficially. It's not going to work. You got to really get deep in there and it hurts. It's hard.

476
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:57.510
Katrina Groves: What you're describing is called aces its adverse childhood events and the studies have shown that 90% of people who use substances have had trauma in their past and pretty much 80% of people in America have had trauma, you know, watching

477
00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:58.050
ROB: Right.

478
00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:06.060
Katrina Groves: You don't have to go to ward have had post traumatic stress because there are little wars when when somebody murdered in front of you, wouldn't you know that's that's

479
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.920
ROB: Why I didn't think it bugged me there.

480
00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:13.920
Katrina Groves: Keep that in your tissues. Oh, that's what these to say your issues are in your tissues. It's like, yeah.

481
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:26.790
Katrina Groves: So, you know, I'm glad that you have found that because you don't know how many people never find out. And then their lives. They're just miserable. They never really get to the core. So

482
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:37.800
Katrina Groves: What you're doing is, you know, you got to tell yourself, you know, Hey, good job, because you are walking the walk and you're figuring it out and and you're helping other people and it's never too late.

483
00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:43.680
ROB: Yeah. Well, I, I'm kind of starting to see I it's hard for me to pat myself on the back, you know,

484
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.660
ROB: Just don't

485
00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:51.900
ROB: You know, try to learn that, you know, I'm trying, I'm I'm giving it a shot. You know,

486
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.650
Katrina Groves: So you have another year of college or two years.

487
00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:12.720
ROB: It might take me to go, year and a half. But I'll have my yeah because I want to do it. I ended up I was going to just get the A and that's it. But now I want to get it for transfer. So I'm I'm taking those excellent courses that I need to take. So I can if I want to go on. I can, yeah.

488
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:21.570
Katrina Groves: We have a couple people in group that I know. You don't know. But there's 123 and one of them's an older guy and he's got

489
00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:22.980
ROB: I know

490
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.020
ROB: Yeah. Oh, he's going to humble.

491
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:32.760
Katrina Groves: Well, it depends which one we're talking about. But yeah, actually all three of them went to humbled at one point or another, I believe, but that's kind of

492
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:40.020
ROB: I got one in process. One of my friends here that that sees you, too. Yeah. Nice. I won't mention names.

493
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.410
Katrina Groves: That's okay. Yeah, we have to be HIPAA compliant.

494
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:58.830
Katrina Groves: Yeah, so my other question I guess was easy. We got stuck on the site part, but, um, do you feel still like, do you feel hopeless and worthless or is that gone away where you're feeling some hopefulness in your life and worthwhile.

495
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.350
ROB: Yeah, I feel Hope I feel

496
00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:13.020
ROB: A little hope. But yeah, I get that way, it just it's constant like that, you know, but I'm kind of break through it. I take a walk. I got my dogs, you know, good.

497
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:19.710
Katrina Groves: That's what I was gonna ask you, what do you do for self care, you, you, you love the ocean you like water right

498
00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.640
Katrina Groves: You still get up, you get out on the boats or what do you do for self care.

499
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.810
ROB: Oh, fishing.

503
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.220
ROB: Well, yeah, but I can't because I'm pretty booked up right now.

504
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.930
Katrina Groves: But

505
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:51.450
ROB: I get time for myself and my dogs get always yeah that's our first they they cost more than us. So

506
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.190
Katrina Groves: That's really true. Um, any allergies that you have. I don't notice on

ROB: Good for you. And then I want a two two and A two is what I take and um I think I think towards the summer, I want to come down again.

516
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:47.070
ROB: When I got the summer vacation, because I'm not going to take classes summer so I figured maybe that's a good time to cut back at least half alone, or maybe hopefully one that

517
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.460
Katrina Groves: Will so you used to take eight milligrams three times a day used to

518
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:50.940

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:52.080
ROB: A max. Yeah.

520
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.250

521
00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:02.370
ROB: Um, I just felt it was time and you know if it doesn't

522
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.610
ROB: I don't know, I just, I like that freedom. That's why I don't want to smoke.

523
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:20.910
ROB: Yeah, I've always been free and now I'm kind of like it's almost like, you know, not this so much but I look at a different. See, I would have looked at this is like when I'm on parole or

524
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:32.250
ROB: I gotta do this, you know, so yeah but it and I knew it wouldn't be as bad as it is. Everyone was pointing it out to be. So I just got on it and found out there. Pretty cool. So

525
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:38.280
Katrina Groves: Yeah, they are. And I think everybody here at bright heart is trying to help people navigate their lives.

526
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:48.900
Katrina Groves: And you'll meet Becca is the counselor that they assigned to me, and she's really cool, Rebecca, but I think she goes by, Becca. So that's kind of interesting because that's your

527
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:50.790
ROB: Yeah yeah

528
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:57.780
Katrina Groves: And she is awesome. So, you know, this is just an intake process and then

529
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:08.070
Katrina Groves: You'll do it like once I don't know, you could do once a month, but you got so much clean time. I usually get people on board and then they do every two to three months or something. I don't remember off. I was seeing you.

530
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.510
ROB: Once a month.

531
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.600
ROB: Every month. Yeah, okay.

532
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:17.730
ROB: Well, I mean, that was just because I didn't want to. I don't know. It felt weird not going there and I'm

533
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:18.390
ROB: Is

534
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:26.460
ROB: You know, so I figured, and you weren't there so I figured I didn't want to, you know, you said it's better to be safe, you know, start on occasion.

535
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:32.310
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I appreciate that and and it's good for you to oh did bright heart send you a peek up yet in the mail.

ROB: To open door.

540
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.640
Katrina Groves: Oh, that's what they sent your lab work, probably not your

541
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:42.600
ROB: Best

542
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:47.640
Katrina Groves: Maybe they did. Well, I would call them back you know you have their bright heart number

543
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:58.980
Katrina Groves: Say, Hey, I didn't. I need a p cup and they'll mail it to your house and then don't open it. You just have to call them when you're going to pee. It's kind of weird, that's going to make you feel like probation probably

544
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:09.150
ROB: Yeah, that's what I did. But she said she said something I'll check that For sure, because that's the way it was it first and then she said, when we call you got two hours to go to

545
00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.480
ROB: To open door. Okay.

546
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.980
Katrina Groves: Maybe I got no way of doing it.

547
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:21.810
ROB: I don't know. Well, by now, though. Yeah, because that's what I read, when I was when I was getting it that you got a cup and you had to open in front of them and all that.

548
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:28.200
Katrina Groves: I am learning to this is all new to me. But at least I don't have to drive all the way back.

549
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.670
ROB: No doubt.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.460

553
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.400
Katrina Groves: So two milligrams three times a day and you're needing the refill when

554
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.350

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:22.140
Awful.

674
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:34.500
Shola: They pulled 12 teeth and then sent me out the door with fake teeth and blood just dripping down my into my shirt and

675
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:38.370
Shola: Then it like ripped

676
00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:44.220

677
00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:51.240

681
01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.830
Katrina Groves: I'm surprised that they put in the teeth already. Usually they let your gums heal up a little bit, but

682
01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:15.330
Shola: I'm not the desk.

683
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.680

Katrina Groves: Wow. So, um, so you took

686
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:28.290
Katrina Groves: The pain medication, then the Percocet, for a couple of days. How did that work.

687
01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:31.110
Shola: It was a lifesaver.

688
01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:33.990
Katrina Groves: Did Frank help you

689
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:37.350
Shola: Yes, he is. Give it to him daily

690
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:40.110
Katrina Groves: Okay, how many did you take

691
01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.670

692
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.220
Katrina Groves: Well, I mean, how many, how many

693
01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.820
Katrina Groves: Dead 234. How many did you get a day.

694
01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.890
Three. Okay.

695
01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.550
Katrina Groves: Good. Now, are you back on Suboxone now.

696
01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:57.270
Katrina Groves: Yeah. Okay. And how long you've been on back on it.

697
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.960
Shola: Yes, ma'am.

698
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.800
Katrina Groves: How long have you been back on this about some

699
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:02.670
Huh.

700
01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.130
Shola: Yes.

701
01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.680
Katrina Groves: Know how, how long have you been

702
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.010
Shola: Battle

703
01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:08.880

704
01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:10.440
Shola: Um,

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:14.460
Shola: Three.

706
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:15.870
Okay.

707
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:20.310
Katrina Groves: All right.

708
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:22.830
Shola: You to be honest with you, I didn't stop.

709
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:25.800
Katrina Groves: You didn't have to Suboxone

710
01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.220
Katrina Groves: No. Okay, I'll be honest, is always the best

711
01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:39.990
Katrina Groves: Do you think that the percocet worked them because usually you got to drop the Suboxone down a little bit to get the effect of the Percocet.

712
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:48.120
Shola: Well, I was only take a little bit. And yeah, it did work. Okay.

713
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:52.860
Katrina Groves: I mean, that's perfect. That's actually what I tell people to do is just to drop this

714
01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.520
Shola: About something

715
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:56.910
Katrina Groves: But not to go off it. So that's fine.

716
01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:01.080
Shola: That's what I thought you would want me to do that.

717
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:06.900
Shola: I didn't know for sure. So I just went, but we did the last time.

718
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.670
Katrina Groves: Good.

719
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.880
Katrina Groves: Alright so let me. Um, if you're ready, let's dive into this

720
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:23.970
Katrina Groves: Let's just start with your allergies to regular medication. I know you have a bunch. Right. Can I just go through them because I

721
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:28.680
Shola: Think my allergies have changed because

722
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:34.380
Shola: When I had my operation. Then he used iodine.

723
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:37.050
Shola: Hmm, and

724
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:38.790
Shola: Yeah.

725
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:50.880
Shola: He said he wanted to do it. He wouldn't go like inside of me or anything that they want to, you know, clean me I guess what they use it for

726
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:59.460
Katrina Groves: That's a different kind of allergy, if you if you ate eat shellfish, you still might be allergic, but using iodine on your skin might be different.

727
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.470
Shola: Right, so

728
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.230
Katrina Groves: Remind me what your surgery was again.

729
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:08.520
Shola: For the incontinence.

730
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.170
Katrina Groves: For the bladder.

731
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.980
Shola: Left. Yeah.

732
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:12.750
Katrina Groves: How is that going, by the way.

733
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:16.290
Shola: It's, it's, um,

734
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:19.680
Shola: It's like 75% better

735
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.360
Katrina Groves: That's excellent.

736
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.580
Yeah, okay.

737
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.490
Katrina Groves: So since we're on surgeries. Let's. Well, we were on allergies, we're going back and forth.

738
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:34.830
Katrina Groves: Okay, so what about allergy to amoxicillin. Do you still have that

739
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:37.530
Katrina Groves: Still in a box so

740
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:38.640
Shola: I would say no.

741
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:42.600
Shola: You would say, No, I don't know, Dr. Morales, because

742
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:49.140
Shola: I don't even know if I'm allergic to a milestone because

743
01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:53.820
Shola: Whatever they gave me in the hospital for group be strapped

744
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:55.170
Katrina Groves: Right.

745
01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.990
Shola: They gave it to me intravenously, and my throat swelled up

746
01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:03.540
Shola: And so

747
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:11.490
Shola: I'm not sure if it was amoxicillin. I don't think it was, I think it was like a penicillin or something.

748
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:17.640
Katrina Groves: Okay, that's still in a penicillin. I just wouldn't do any penicillin derivatives. If I were you because

749
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.210
Shola: It would be

750
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.050
Katrina Groves: Risky so and also on your chart is

751
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:30.360
Katrina Groves: Tramadol and we know you had twitching and and jerking and like seizure kind of activities. So that's a no no right.

752
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.200
Shola: Right.

753
01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:39.330
Katrina Groves: And then oxy beating and that's a bladder medication or you you had nausea. With that, I don't know if that's a real allergy.

754
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.470
No.

755
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.970
Katrina Groves: Okay, any other allergies, you can think of.

756
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.140
No.

757
01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:57.930
Katrina Groves: Any others. Tell me about your surgeries. Oh gosh, man. Get back into here. I got two charts going I keep looking to the left because I have your Denmark chart. And then this one.

758
01:04:59.160 --> 01:04:59.370
Shola: The

759
01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:05.010
Katrina Groves: Surgeries you have had you had breast reduction surgery, when was that

760
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:08.910
Shola: breast reduction in implant was

761
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.910
Shola: Was my record say

762
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.000
Katrina Groves: It doesn't. So it's all right. You don't need to know

763
01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.490
Katrina Groves: To tell me, did you didn't you have anything else like gallbladder or

764
01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:28.080
Katrina Groves: No, nothing. No other broken bone. No other surgeries.

765
01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.000
Shola: No. Okay.

766
01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:39.300
Katrina Groves: And then we go to any hospitalization, gosh, you've had some hospitalizations right for

767
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:42.420
Shola: Attempt

768
01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:43.710
Suicide.

769
01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:45.390
Shola: One.

770
01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:49.410
Katrina Groves: Was that an OD or

771
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:57.780
Katrina Groves: Yeah okay and any other hospitalizations for major illnesses or injuries or

772
01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:09.360
Shola: Know this, when I had the seizures and they took me to our the pseudo Caesars they took me to and they flew me out.

773
01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:12.300
Right.

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:32.910
Shola: Oh,

793
01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.750

Katrina Groves: And to Dr. Peter, do your pap smear as well.

798
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:47.100

799
01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:51.540

Katrina Groves: 2019 a typical so

803
01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:16.470

804
01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:19.230
Shola: She's not my primary Joshua's

Shola: 10 years ago.

837
01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.850

Shola: And I have a little bit more community service to do

859
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.110
Katrina Groves: That was quick.

860
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:16.920
Upbringing

861
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:21.630

Katrina Groves: Oh, I know you're frozen now.

863
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:34.140
Katrina Groves: Now you're frozen debate. Don't you have to break glow in the tube to drive your car. They didn't make you do that.

864
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:39.690
Shola: No cuz been it was happening, July, so it's been what, nine months.

Shola: Okay, I could put any time.

866
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.180
Katrina Groves: And maybe not drinking sounds like a good idea for you.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.200
Yeah.

868
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:55.500

Shola: And my brother was an alcoholic. And then he got in a car wreck and he's been clean since and

870
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:09.030
Shola: My sister has multiple DUIs

871
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:18.840

Katrina Groves: I know you had a relapse, gosh, no. Was it in October.

880
01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.320
In 2000

881
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.070
Katrina Groves: I think it was October last year.

882
01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.150

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:17.010
Katrina Groves: I don't remember it. I just remember

886
01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:29.250
Katrina Groves: You struggle, off and on with it. You're on it for a while and then you're able to get off and then you get back on it again and then you're getting off. So I just, I don't know if you have that in your head about when the last time you used math. Has it been over six months.

887
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.150
Yes.

888
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:32.490
Katrina Groves: You think it's been a year.

889
01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:33.900
Yes.

890
01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.090
Katrina Groves: Two years.

891
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.430
Shola: No. Okay.

892
01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:41.850
Katrina Groves: What do you think was your

893
01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:46.110
Katrina Groves: Your main drive to do that.

894
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.340
Shola: And it was comedy combination of things and sex.

895
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.530
Shola: Mm hmm. And

896
01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.720
Shola: Association or whoever I was around

897
01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:01.620
Mm hmm.

898
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:03.750
Shola: So,

899
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:08.730
Shola: It's out there prevalent.

900
01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:13.350
Katrina Groves: Playing with your lighter are you still smoking.

901
01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.810

01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:27.720
Shola: Yeah, I have. It works really good

905
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:29.310
Excellent.

906
01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:36.630
Katrina Groves: I think that'll really help Chantix is like Suboxone for nicotine works great.

907
01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:37.710
What does

908
01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:50.670

911
01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.030
Shola: I don't know. I don't know. They

912
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.390
Shola: I think it was combination of everything.

913
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:16.950
Katrina Groves: So did you get a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at some point.

914

Shola: I started with agoraphobia to I really have a hard time leaving my house.

922
01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:47.640
Mm hmm.

923
01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.370
Shola: But

924
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:53.310
Shola: I can't think of anything else.

925
01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.490
Katrina Groves: So how have you been able to get out of the house are you

926
01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:00.120
Katrina Groves: You know, you do it when you have to now.

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:01.140
Right.

928
01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.930

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.200
Shola: Like he's quiet and I'm quiet.

936
01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:38.490
Shola: Oh, do

937
01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:39.960

1023
01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:45.930
Shola: Yeah, so he went back to work. And so I didn't have him to give me a ride. My mom works and anyways but

Shola: I got my car back now. Excellent.

1026
01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.930
Katrina Groves: Are you still taking the Wellbutrin for depression. The 300 milligram

1027
01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.030
Shola: Yes. Okay.

1028
01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:02.220
Katrina Groves: And then Cymbalta as well, or is that when gone

1029
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.440
Shola: Gosh, you don't

1030
01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:14.070
Katrina Groves: Do locks, a team. It was one for like pain and fibromyalgia. The Wellbutrin is more for smoking. I don't know if you're doing both or you don't know

1031
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:16.860
Shola: I think I'm doing both. Okay.

1032
01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:21.960
Katrina Groves: And you still take your Eunice Tom

1033
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:23.400
Shola: Yes.

1034
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.550
Katrina Groves: How many a day do you think every night.

1035
01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:27.690
Shola: Every night.

1036
01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:34.350
Katrina Groves: And the Chantix you're going to start on that. How about Abilify. Do you still take that

1037
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.180
Shola: I think so.

1038
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:40.410
Katrina Groves: Is your new doctor prescribing all this, or your new Pa.

1039
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:43.410
Katrina Groves: Or does he feel comfortable with that.

1040
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:52.410
Shola: And he, I think he is willing to do whatever that the psychiatrist or the Talmud.

1041
01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:54.930
Katrina Groves: Good.

1042
01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:02.160
Shola: Because it tells him that is what's working with me, I'm trying. Honestly, to get off of some stuff.

1043
01:24:02.610 --> 01:24:15.720
Katrina Groves: Oh that's right you are doing. Tell him in psychiatry, I forgot. Yeah, I'm really glad that you're doing that because this is pretty you know you're on a lot of meds. And I think that's a great idea to try to get down to just what you need.

1044
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.800
Right.

1045
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:23.520

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:38.580
Shola: Right, that

1207
01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:50.430
Katrina Groves: And that's hard when you're overweight and you, you put all the weight on your heels all the time. I think swimming would be a great activity for you, but I don't see you get in the pool. Why is that

1208
01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:51.660
Um,

1209
01:34:53.130 --> 01:34:54.870
Shola: No, but I did get

1210
01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.000
Shola: I have a

1211
01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:07.560
Shola: Application and on Tuesday. I'm going to meet with Josh and I can go into the Diabetes Awareness Program. So

1212
01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:12.960
Shola: They'll pay up to $200 for me to go to gym by me shoes.

1213
01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:15.690
Shola: So,

1214
01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.960
Shola: Because I'm pre diabetic I qualify

1215
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:23.670
Shola: Awesome. So I'm going to be going to the gym again.

1216
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:31.680
Katrina Groves: You always. Yeah, you do. Well, I think that was one of your good self care things right when you went to the gym, you felt better.

1217
01:35:32.130 --> 01:35:32.730
Yes.

1218
01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:43.500
Katrina Groves: Great. Let me see what your last one see was, you know, you keep those numbers in your head when when they check that blood test for diabetes.

1219
01:35:44.130 --> 01:35:44.580
No.

1220
01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.240
Shola: I don't think it's very high

1221
01:35:51.840 --> 01:36:07.590
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I don't think you've had one in a while. Oh, here's one. Wait, where's that this was gosh last year's 5.8 so you need another one. See you need another lab test for diabetes. I'm making a list for you. You better make your own. I'll put high

1222
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.890
Katrina Groves: Yeah.

1223
01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:09.420
Katrina Groves: Oh, good.

1224
01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.730
Katrina Groves: Well, compare list at the end.

1225
01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.100
Katrina Groves: That's great for the gym now. All right. Where was I

1226
01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.010
Katrina Groves: I was down to skin.

1227
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:26.700
Katrina Groves: So how about abdomen. Any problems with we already kind of talked about this, nausea, vomiting,

1228
01:36:28.290 --> 01:36:29.460
Katrina Groves: Abdominal pain.

1229
01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.080
Shola: Nope, I

1230
01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:34.620
Shola: Just heartbreak just heartburn and

1231
01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.630
Shola: I've been throwing up every morning because because my teeth.

1232
01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:41.070
Oh,

1233
01:36:42.090 --> 01:36:45.510
Shola: Just dry heaving because I don't have any food in my stomach.

1234
01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:59.490
Shola: Oh gosh, that's awful. But that doesn't have anything that's just a gagging I gag a lot, even before before my teeth. I knew it was going to be a problem because I gagged

1235
01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:05.520
Shola: Back then, I don't know what it's about why I get so much

1236
01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:07.410
Huh.

1237
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:11.340
Shola: Anyways, no semi problems.

1238
01:37:11.970 --> 01:37:18.750
Katrina Groves: When you take your Suboxone does that do the same thing under your tongue does it make you want to gag when you have it in your mouth.

1239
01:37:19.290 --> 01:37:21.120
Shola: No. Interesting.

1240
01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:23.910
Okay.

1241
01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:30.660
Katrina Groves: Um, but you don't have any blood in your stool or black poop or anything like that.

1242
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:31.890
Katrina Groves: Our dm dm is

1243
01:37:33.090 --> 01:37:35.550
Shola: I think I haven't him like okay

1244
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:41.400
Katrina Groves: No burning when you pee, though no blood in your urine.

1245
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.450
Shola: No.

1246
01:37:42.810 --> 01:37:44.760
Katrina Groves: No burning pain with your p

1247
01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:45.630
Shola: Yeah.

1248
01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:55.590
Katrina Groves: And then, tell me about your, your muscles and your strength. Are you having trouble with weakness in any part of your body arms, legs.

1249
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:57.090
Shola: Just my feet.

1250
01:37:57.750 --> 01:38:02.670
Katrina Groves: The feet. Yeah. And how about your back, your low back is that ok

1251
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:09.870
Katrina Groves: Oops, I lost you there you are.

1252
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:13.020
Shola: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Um,

1253
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:19.590
Shola: I have lower back pain, but I think it's because of my weight. Yeah.

1254
01:38:21.450 --> 01:38:23.850
Katrina Groves: Do you take ibuprofen for it every now and then.

1255
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:32.940
Katrina Groves: Yes. Okay. And so, neurologically you don't have any more fainting spells or passing out spells.

1256
01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.020
No.

1257
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.770
Katrina Groves: And headaches. Yes, you have migraines.

1258
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:43.620
Katrina Groves: Yes, and the tremor, you know, it makes me think you could see a neurologist for that.

1259
01:38:44.550 --> 01:39:00.330
Katrina Groves: On your list but but if the tremor bothers you, I know you've had that a long, long time. And I don't think it's just related to anxiety. It might be kind of a little bit of Parkinson's thing. Maybe they could give you some medication for that to help that tremor.

1260
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:02.880
Shola: I thought one thing

1261
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:08.640
Katrina Groves: I thought at one point I put you on a beta blocker like propranolol or atenolol or something.

1262
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.100
Katrina Groves: Okay, so there are pills. Put that on your

1263
01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:18.900
Katrina Groves: Your list. I know you're trying to get rid of pills. But if the main thing that bothers you, is that tremor.

1264
01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.950
Katrina Groves: I would talk to your doctor about getting on.

1265
01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:28.950
Katrina Groves: propranolol or Inderal or a beta blocker of some kind.

1266
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.350
Shola: Beta.

1267
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:32.910
Katrina Groves: Beta.

1268
01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:33.930
Katrina Groves: Blocker yeah

1269
01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.510
Katrina Groves: All right, and so as far as your we talked a little bit about your mood.

1270
01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:42.930
Katrina Groves: Your sleep is still kind of bad

1271
01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.980
Katrina Groves: Or is it okay with what you're doing now.

1272
01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:53.340
Shola: Now, I still wake up in the middle of the night, or I can't turn my head off or

1273
01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:54.420
Okay.

1274
01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:01.830
Shola: I mean, I would love to be an Ambien seven days a week.

1275
01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:05.580
Shola: Right. I'd get used to it. Are you know that so

1276
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:13.260
Katrina Groves: Exactly. Um, do you have any hallucinations, seeing things that aren't there hearing voices that aren't there.

1277
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:14.130
No.

1278
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:20.520
Katrina Groves: Suicidal thoughts recently.

1279
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:21.960
Shola: No.

1280
01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:26.250
Katrina Groves: That's a good one because I know you were suicidal in the past so

1281
01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:29.430
Shola: Yeah, that was hard for me to swallow right now.

1282
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:30.900
Yeah.

1283
01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:40.590
Katrina Groves: Alright, so now I want to go to your history of your past drug use and I know they did part of this already, but

1284
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:47.010
Katrina Groves: What's your memory of the first thing you ever used substance wise as a kid.

1285
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:49.590
Shola: Marijuana

1286
01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.240
Katrina Groves: And how old are you,

1287
01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.830
Shola: I was in sixth grade. So

1288
01:40:57.150 --> 01:40:57.600
Katrina Groves: Wow.

1289
01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:05.100
Shola: Well, in this hang in your bedroom. It's really easy to kit.

1290
01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:06.270
Yeah.

1291
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:12.240
Katrina Groves: Okay. And then what did that lead to after the marijuana. What was next.

1292
01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.920
Shola: The alcohol. Alcohol.

1293
01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:17.730
Katrina Groves: Mm hmm. And then what was next after that.

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:21.510
Shola: I really

Shola: Mainly alcohol and then

1300
01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:49.650
Shola: Because I was a witness for a Jehovah Witness for so long. I didn't purchase fate, anything like that. Um, but I knew I was addicted to

1301
01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:55.590
Shola: Viking in because I would have teeth work done, or whatever.

1302
01:41:56.850 --> 01:42:00.390
Shola: I'm just using that as an example, and I'm

1303
01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:11.100
Shola: I would take more than you know i mean i would mess with my pills, but I wasn't

Shola: The Viking in and then

1307
01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:26.400
Shola: Methadone

1308
01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:28.560
Shola: And

1309
01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:30.360
Shola: oxy

01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.600
Shola: Anything till wise.

1311
01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:35.280
Shola: And

1312
01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.780
Shola: Then after Norman I split up.

1313
01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:51.930
Shola: And I got in program, but the Viking problem. And then I've tried math. Three. Three times

1314
01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:53.820
Shola: I mean, I've

1315
01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.680

01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:03.180
Shola: I use

1317
01:43:05.730 --> 01:43:06.210
Shola: Math.

1318
01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.210
Shola: And

1319
01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:13.680
Shola: I'll pause always been there.

1320
01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:21.060
Shola: I know Jen heroin or any of that.

1321
01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:24.180
Katrina Groves: No IV drugs.

1322
01:43:25.410 --> 01:43:25.680
Shola: No.

1323
01:43:27.450 --> 01:43:32.550
Katrina Groves: And did. Did it have an impact on your, your work at all. I'm

1324
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:35.910
Katrina Groves: Using as you were

1325
01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.650
Shola: And I didn't work. When I was using

1326
01:43:43.110 --> 01:43:44.040
Katrina Groves: What about. Yeah.

1327
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:49.260
Shola: Wait, I was working at lunch. I'll and yeah it affected me definitely

1328
01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:53.190
Katrina Groves: Any legal troubles about then that you got into

1329
01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:56.340
Katrina Groves: Any record. No, no, probation, nothing.

1330
01:43:56.670 --> 01:43:57.540
Shola: That's good. Nope.

1331
01:43:58.770 --> 01:43:59.430
Katrina Groves: And

1332
01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:05.790
Katrina Groves: So, did you ever go to a program before you came to the Suboxone to try to get clean

1333
01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.270
Shola: No, I tried to get clean on my own.

1334
01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:12.000
Katrina Groves: Yeah, how many times do you think

1335
01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.180
Shola: Probably about four times.

1336
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:18.390
Shola: It's pretty tough. Yeah.

1337
01:44:22.050 --> 01:44:22.500
Katrina Groves: Right.

1338
01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.770
Katrina Groves: So looking back on those times.

1339
01:44:30.210 --> 01:44:33.180
Katrina Groves: Are you, how do you feel your life is going now.

1340
01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.310
Katrina Groves: In recovery.

1341
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:40.950
Shola: I'm still struggling

1342
01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:44.550
Shola: That I know

1343
01:44:46.830 --> 01:45:01.260
Shola: I know if I reach out, you know, then I'll be okay and stay accountable. I mean, if I was just doing this program. I don't want to say this is recorded. Hmm.

1344
01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:03.780
Katrina Groves: No, you can say whatever you want.

1345
01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:06.540
Shola: It goes away from me days. Okay.

1346
01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:13.050
Shola: If I was just doing this program, I would probably you because

1347
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:16.020
Shola: There's no accountability.

1348
01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:24.570
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I've heard that before and bright heart. You know, we have a really I think Tony's group and at Del Norte is is

1349
01:45:25.710 --> 01:45:28.950
Katrina Groves: Better, it's always better to have a one on one. So I agree with you.

1350
01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:41.820
Katrina Groves: But, you know, bright heart is a good organization to and they're trying to reach people as best they can. So I think it's better than not having anything

1351
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:55.920
Katrina Groves: Right, and the fact you guys are really lucky because you can do both. And I hope that that's what I want to make sure you understand is keep going to Tony's. This is just a way for you to get meds without having me to come to California.

1352
01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:56.790
Right.

1353
01:45:58.110 --> 01:45:59.400
Katrina Groves: So no

1354
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:02.970
Shola: I'm okay with it.

1355
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:14.970
Katrina Groves: Okay. Um, what was I gonna say, oh, and how's your daughter, Lauren. Is she still with you, or did she move away or she's still going to school.

1356
01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:18.960
Shola: She um. She's with me. She's working

1357
01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.050
Katrina Groves: That's right. She had a boyfriend or something.

1358
01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:23.730
Shola: She got engaged.

1359
01:46:24.210 --> 01:46:24.720
Katrina Groves: Oh my

1360
01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:28.530

01:47:12.630 --> 01:47:13.050
Shola: What

1376
01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:16.470

Right.

1378
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:28.650

Katrina Groves: Give yourself some time to stay home with the kids. If you can, that's, that's nice.

1671
02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:37.800
Right.

1672
02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:43.980
Katrina Groves: Okay, so let's see, where am I am

1673
02:10:45.930 --> 02:10:57.570
Katrina Groves: I'm just going to go down a list of like head to toe about how you're feeling in the past week or two. So, for example, any Fevers or chills with your cold that you've got

1674
02:10:58.290 --> 02:11:04.440
Katrina Groves: No, no. Night sweats, or feeling like cold intolerance or anything.

1675
02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:05.220
Or

1676
02:11:06.930 --> 02:11:14.640
Katrina Groves: Fatigue, you're probably tired. Hi, I'm going to guess being a mom, but do you feel like you get enough sleep at night.

1677
02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:19.980
Layla strnad: Um, yeah, actually I do play. Okay. Yeah.

1678
02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.050
Katrina Groves: But do you feel like you're tired or not.

1679
02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:24.810
Layla strnad: Really

1680
02:11:24.990 --> 02:11:27.960
Katrina Groves: Wow, you're the only mom, I know that doesn't get tired.

1681
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.280
Katrina Groves: Anyone weight gain or weight loss.

1682
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:34.860
Katrina Groves: That you've had recently.

1683
02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:38.910
Layla strnad: I don't pay attention to her way to know. Okay.

1684
02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:44.790
Katrina Groves: And he signs of diabetes like peeing all the time thirsty, all the time. Can't get enough water.

1685
02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:46.290
No.

1686
02:11:47.850 --> 02:11:50.910
Katrina Groves: Trouble with your eyes. Any blurry vision.

1687
02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:53.370
Layla strnad: No.

1688
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:55.590
Katrina Groves: Double vision.

1689
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:57.840
Katrina Groves: No redness.

1690
02:11:57.930 --> 02:12:00.000
Katrina Groves: Or pain or tearing of your eyes.

1691
02:12:00.630 --> 02:12:01.050
You know,

1692
02:12:02.250 --> 02:12:03.690
Katrina Groves: Any trouble with hearing

1693
02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:04.920
Layla strnad: No or

1694
02:12:05.190 --> 02:12:08.160
Katrina Groves: Any drainage from your ears are ringing in your ears.

1695
02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:09.840
Layla strnad: Know,

1696
02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:16.710
Katrina Groves: How about, nose, throat, you've got a little stuffy nose right now. It sounds like. But any sinus pain.

1697
02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:25.140
Layla strnad: No, I'm just like congested ahead. Right. No, but it seems like it's going away. Good.

1698
02:12:26.130 --> 02:12:38.160
Katrina Groves: Yeah, when you smoke to it keeps your body from getting the mucus out as much. So drink tons and tons of water steam your face, keep you from getting a sinus infection.

1699
02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:41.850
Katrina Groves: Do you have difficulty swallowing at all.

1700
02:12:42.750 --> 02:12:43.200
No.

1701
02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:46.500
Katrina Groves: And any hoarseness in your voice.

1702
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:48.930
Layla strnad: I don't think so.

1703
02:12:49.290 --> 02:12:51.390
Katrina Groves: You always have kind of a deep voice.

1704
02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:52.530
And yeah.

1705
02:12:54.810 --> 02:12:57.780
Katrina Groves: Any dental problems. A lot of people have tooth pain.

1706
02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.070
Layla strnad: Yeah, I recently had a tooth fallout.

1707
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:03.750
Layla strnad: And the rotors. Oh.

1708
02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:10.080
Layla strnad: Yeah it to get into Dennis, but so I have pain every once in a while, from that.

1709
02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:12.630
Katrina Groves: Oh yeah. The roots are exposed

1710
02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:14.820
Layla strnad: Yeah, that's hard.

1711
02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:21.600
Katrina Groves: Be careful. Sometimes those can get infected and they can spread throughout your face. It's not not good.

1712
02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:37.470
Katrina Groves: I know the clinic does have if you go in at like 730 or 1230 in the morning or right before their afternoon at 1230 you can sit and wait and they will try to squeeze you in. If there's a no show or a cancel.

1713
02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:47.400
Katrina Groves: Okay, so I don't know if that works for you, someday that you could have your mom or I know you got people you got your kids with you. So that may be challenging.

1714
02:13:48.930 --> 02:13:52.260
Layla strnad: In your I need to try to do on a

1715
02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:55.290
Katrina Groves: Hot. What would you, how would you get your kid some

1716
02:13:56.490 --> 02:13:57.990
Layla strnad: Of my sisters pretty

1717
02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:07.710
Layla strnad: Cool about letting like watching them when I have groups and stuff like that. So if I really need to go and she watched them. Okay.

1718
02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:12.390
Katrina Groves: So maybe that would be good on your list to do that for your tooth. Get it pulled

1719
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:18.030
Katrina Groves: Do you have pain with that. Do you do you take ibuprofen and Tylenol.

1720
02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:22.680
Layla strnad: Yeah, if it hurts. I usually take Tylenol or ibuprofen.

1721
02:14:23.550 --> 02:14:27.000
Katrina Groves: And you take no other medications, no still soft owners or

1722
02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:33.810
Katrina Groves: You know, not just take a nausea pill. I don't know what that was for maybe that was your in your kid pack or something.

1723
02:14:34.590 --> 02:14:35.670
Layla strnad: Yeah, probably.

1724
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:40.710
Katrina Groves: And your Suboxone is eight milligrams, you do three times a day.

1725
02:14:41.370 --> 02:14:42.060
Yeah.

1726
02:14:43.530 --> 02:14:45.000
Katrina Groves: And how's that working out for you.

1727
02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:46.170
Um,

1728
02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:57.600
Layla strnad: I've been kind of waiting to meet with you. I like, I don't know if I need to go up a dose or not, but I've been having more crazy than I usually have lately.

1729
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.960
Layla strnad: Um,

1730
02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:17.310
Layla strnad: And then I feel like I like if I don't if when I wake up I still like I have, like, I don't think it's from my cold. I think it's just from meeting to take my medicine, but I feel like I get the chills are like the withdrawals, I would from not taking

1731
02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:21.900
Katrina Groves: Hmm. So, what time do you use take your last box on at night.

1732
02:15:23.250 --> 02:15:26.850
Layla strnad: I take it, usually around like six or seven

1733
02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:35.310
Layla strnad: I take my first one. When I wake up and then I take one around lunch. And then I take the other one at six or 7am

1734
02:15:35.310 --> 02:15:36.450
Katrina Groves: What time do you wake up.

1735
02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:38.010
Layla strnad: I wake up at

1736
02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:40.530
8am.

1737
02:15:42.090 --> 02:15:42.480
Layla strnad: And

1738
02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:45.480
Katrina Groves: Then you take another at noon and then six so

1739
02:15:47.250 --> 02:15:52.320
Katrina Groves: It seems like it's not spaced out very far. Have you tried to wait until

1740
02:15:53.610 --> 02:15:58.380
Katrina Groves: Two o'clock or so to take your second dose why noon.

1741
02:15:59.940 --> 02:16:08.130
Layla strnad: I don't know. That's what I'm used to. Sometimes I do I don't pay attention to the time and I end up taking it when I start feeling like I need to take it like

1742
02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:15.960
Layla strnad: I know that, like, I don't know, I just get the feeling like I start getting chills are super cool.

1743
02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:16.980
Layla strnad: And it's

1744
02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:20.490
Layla strnad: About to take my Suboxone and

1745
02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:27.150
Katrina Groves: So do you put it onto your tongue for long enough. You're not accidentally swallowing it or or

1746
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:40.830
Layla strnad: I don't know if I do it right or not, like when I stick it under my tongue and I just I don't swallow at all, but it feels like I have a ton. This bit like under my tongue like I can't talk to nobody, or nothing.

1747
02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:52.170
Layla strnad: My I just wait and wait until I and then I wait 10 or 15 minutes and then I just spit it all out. I see orange and respite. Sometimes I don't know if I'm supposed to see that or not.

1748
02:16:52.770 --> 02:17:01.680
Katrina Groves: Yeah, sometimes you will see a little orange. I just wonder if you're one of those people to get so much saliva that it ends up not getting absorbed under your tongue right

1749
02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:02.880
That's what

1750
02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:05.790
Katrina Groves: Yeah, so

1751
02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:21.030
Katrina Groves: Did you ever try sub solve instead. That's the mint flavored one it dissolves quicker. It's not as much saliva. Sometimes it helps to change the type of Suboxone that you're taking. There's different brands.

1752
02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:22.590
Layla strnad: Are nurtured it

1753
02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:28.200
Katrina Groves: Because to me, I think that you don't sound like you're getting it absorbed really well.

1754
02:17:29.310 --> 02:17:34.980
Katrina Groves: So, and the other problem is I think you need to try and be on a schedule, which is probably hard but

1755
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:46.860
Katrina Groves: scheduling your kids that can be helpful for them to it's like okay this is a time for breakfast is the time for lunch. Here's dinner, you know, if you can schedule your family time and then schedule your Suboxone around that.

1756
02:17:47.280 --> 02:18:02.460
Katrina Groves: To be like every eight hours because it shouldn't once you're on Suboxone and if you're taking it regular. It shouldn't be like this up and down. So I, it makes me think that you're just not getting it absorbed really well.

1757
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:22.830
Katrina Groves: Okay, one option you can do too is a lot of people are. We're going to the shot, which sounds like not fun. Maybe, but there is a shot gets the Suboxone shot. It's a same stuff. It just goes in your skin of your belly like a demo shot. Did you ever get demo before for birth control.

1758
02:18:23.250 --> 02:18:23.640
There.

1759
02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:31.230
Katrina Groves: So it's once a month. And what's nice about it is it stays it steady state, and you don't have to take strips at all.

1760
02:18:31.530 --> 02:18:40.410
Katrina Groves: And it's in your system for a whole month and you don't have any withdrawals. You don't have any up and down. It's pretty awesome. So it helps people. I would not ever give it

1761
02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:53.190
Katrina Groves: Well, Never say never, but it's more for people that have been stable on Suboxone for a while and they're just tired of doing this because it reminds them of using because it's a strip in your mouth, you know, three times a day.

1762
02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:54.240
You're

1763
02:18:55.860 --> 02:18:59.970
Layla strnad: Here. Sounds pretty crazy sounds better than districts, though.

1764
02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:01.200
Katrina Groves: Does it

1765
02:19:01.770 --> 02:19:05.820
Katrina Groves: Yeah. So do you still see Tony, do you still go to group.

1766
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.570
Layla strnad: Yeah.

1767
02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:08.220
Katrina Groves: How often would you say

1768
02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.890
Layla strnad: I go once a week every Friday.

1769
02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:23.400
Katrina Groves: Oh, good for you. So are you going to be able to do my groups telemedicine. It'll be Monday nights, which I don't know how that works in your schedule, but it'll be like 545 to 645 ish

1770
02:19:24.090 --> 02:19:24.420
Layla strnad: Yeah.

1771
02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:25.920
In the evening.

1772
02:19:27.930 --> 02:19:31.590
Katrina Groves: Okay. And when do you need your prescription or did you just get it.

1773
02:19:32.130 --> 02:19:33.330
Layla strnad: No, I need it.

1774
02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:36.450
Katrina Groves: You do need it. Are you out like today.

1775
02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:40.980
Katrina Groves: Yeah. Oh, dear. Did you get one this morning.

1776
02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:47.220
Layla strnad: I haven't took one yet. I just go ahead with my appointment this morning.

1777
02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:54.120
Katrina Groves: Wow, you must not be feeling good. So you should take it every morning, you know, eight o'clock in the morning just first thing to do.

1778
02:19:55.380 --> 02:20:05.190
Katrina Groves: So I think that I can switch you to sub solve, which is the mint flavored one if you want to try that. Maybe it worked better for you.

1779
02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:08.040
Katrina Groves: Okay. And I think it's covered

1780
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:10.080
Layla strnad: On just

1781
02:20:10.410 --> 02:20:11.700
Katrina Groves: What pharmacy. Are you at

1782
02:20:12.390 --> 02:20:13.050
I'm at Walmart.

1783
02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:26.880
Katrina Groves: And so the milligrams or different just don't panic about it because instead of, instead of eight milligrams to box on it's 5.7 of sub solve. And the reason is because it's a lot more

1784
02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:43.830
Katrina Groves: It gets absorbed better and it's stronger. So the eight milligrams Suboxone only about six milligrams gets in. If even that sometimes just five so that it's equal the the five seven of the sub solve is equal to the aid of the Suboxone in case you notice

1785
02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:50.820
Katrina Groves: Okay, so do you want me to just give you a week to try it, or just do a month and

1786
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:55.740
Layla strnad: Um, I don't care. Whatever you think stress.

1787
02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:00.030
Katrina Groves: I think you'll like it better. I think I'll do a month.

1788
02:21:00.570 --> 02:21:01.320
Layla strnad: And her and

1789
02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:05.340
Katrina Groves: Mike or whoever can always call me if there's some problem with the insurance.

1790
02:21:06.330 --> 02:21:07.470
Katrina Groves: But I think they'll cover it.

1791
02:21:08.850 --> 02:21:09.690
Layla strnad: Okay, okay.

1792
02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:14.910

1817
02:22:47.070 --> 02:22:49.170
Katrina Groves: Wow. So what kind of headaches are they

02:22:50.490 --> 02:22:52.560
Layla strnad: I don't know, um,

1819
02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:55.200
Layla strnad: It's like

1820
02:22:56.220 --> 02:22:59.670
Layla strnad: I don't want to say it's up in my forehead and down below my head.

1821
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:01.770
Layla strnad: Okay, I normally

1822
02:23:02.970 --> 02:23:03.480
Layla strnad: I'm

1823
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:06.690
Layla strnad: At least once a day, I have a headache.

1824
02:23:08.250 --> 02:23:09.120
Katrina Groves: Um, what do you take

1825

02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:23.010
Layla strnad: Usually or ibuprofen, I try to take ibuprofen, but it doesn't feel like it works the same as the town.

1828
02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:30.060
Katrina Groves: So you could be having some rebound headache, it's not normal to have a headache every single day.

1829
02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:35.490
Katrina Groves: So it might be good to who's your doctor at the clinic or do you have one

1830
02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:40.830
Layla strnad: Right, don't have the last person I ever saw is dr dikes and she doesn't

1831
02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:41.490
Work.

1832
02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:47.160
Katrina Groves: You don't have any Indian blood to you because she's right next door at the Indian clinic.

1833
02:23:47.310 --> 02:23:49.140
Layla strnad: Or no, okay.

1834
02:23:49.530 --> 02:23:53.010
Katrina Groves: Please put it on your list of things to do, because it's hard.

1835
02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:59.370
Katrina Groves: You got to be a good mom. It's hard to be a good mom if you're suffering with stuff yourself so you got your tooth.

1836
02:23:59.730 --> 02:24:05.940
Katrina Groves: And then maybe get an appointment with the doc at the clinic and just say, have had these headaches and and talk to them because

1837
02:24:06.390 --> 02:24:14.820
Katrina Groves: Sometimes headaches or caffeine withdrawal. Sometimes they're, they don't doesn't sound like a migraine, like you're vomiting with it or you have to lay down right

1838
02:24:16.350 --> 02:24:21.960
Katrina Groves: So it's probably a tension headache, but that's not okay to be having a headache every day, you should get it checked out.

1839
02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:24.270
Layla strnad: Okay, okay.

1840

02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:40.410
Layla strnad: I don't know. I'm fine.

1844
02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:47.400
Katrina Groves: So you don't feel sad. You're not anxious, you don't feel depressed.

1845
02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:52.350

1846
02:24:53.250 --> 02:24:53.760
Yeah.

1847
02:24:55.020 --> 02:25:01.290
Katrina Groves: You don't feel any feeling of hopelessness or depression like postpartum depression. Some people have

1848
02:25:02.310 --> 02:25:02.790

No.

1851
02:25:09.330 --> 02:25:09.810
Okay.

1852
02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:17.400
Katrina Groves: And we did medications allergies. What kind of allergies to any medication that you know about

1853
02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:20.640
Layla strnad: No, I don't have any allergies. OK.

1854
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:33.210
Katrina Groves: And then so okay I got a call in your prescription. Then I'm going to do some solve at Walmart and we'll do three a day and I want you to really do a schedule like eight in the morning and then like

1855
02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:44.880
Katrina Groves: Two in the afternoon, and then like a 10 1112 12345678 like 8pm. What time did you say you were taking your Oh a nighttime dose at

Layla strnad: Six or seven. Yeah, it's

1857
02:25:47.430 --> 02:25:54.480
Katrina Groves: Probably too early. I think you need to take it closer to bedtime, unless it makes you hyper I would take it like more like eight or nine

1858
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:58.350
Layla strnad: Yeah, that's why I think I take it because it does make you hyper

1859
02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:02.070
Katrina Groves: Oh, okay. So you then you can't sleep at night.

1860

Layla strnad: Right. Yeah, it's really hard to go to sleep.

1861

Okay.

1862
02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:24.870
Katrina Groves: You should also. So the second thing to do would be go to group and ask Daria and Tony about getting the shot the sub blockade shot because it's going to give you a good level, not doing this so much. Your, your metabolisms choose it up last you

1863
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:27.480

Christina Frazee: It's doing kids. So we're gonna be leaving soon so

1964
02:36:38.490 --> 02:36:44.160
Katrina Groves: It's really better for you to be in a private place cuz we're going to be talking about some serious stuff.

1965
02:36:44.370 --> 02:36:52.110
Christina Frazee: Yeah. Um, well, I'm just she's outside if they come in the living room again. Then I'll go into another room because they're supposed to be leaving right now so

1966
02:36:53.100 --> 02:37:00.120
Katrina Groves: Okay, well let's start with something that's easier. Like I'm medication allergies. Do you have any allergies to any medication.

1967
02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:02.070
Christina Frazee: No. Okay.

1968
02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:03.540
And

1969
02:37:05.070 --> 02:37:08.250
Katrina Groves: Medication that you're taking right now.

1970
02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:14.160
Katrina Groves: Besides, or you're still on the Suboxone eight milligrams three times a day.

1971
02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:16.440
Katrina Groves: And what pharmacy.

02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:23.070
Christina Frazee: No, I just got one yesterday.

1974
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:24.060
Oh, good.

1975
02:37:26.130 --> 02:37:27.360
Katrina Groves: So, um,

1976
02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:34.350
Christina Frazee: And then I'm on Zoloft hundred milligrams. And then I'm on the volume five milligram

1977
02:37:35.430 --> 02:37:35.670
Christina Frazee: Good.

1978
02:37:35.850 --> 02:37:39.630
Katrina Groves: Now, this is all laughed. One and a half tablets are you just taking one

1979
02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:51.090
Christina Frazee: Missing one but um when I was talking to Tony yesterday she, she's like you need your depression meds up because I was just a wreck. And I was like, I think I'm supposed to be taking 150

1980
02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:52.290
Christina Frazee: I think that's what I

1981
02:37:52.470 --> 02:37:56.820
Christina Frazee: To go up to, but I'm so I'm going to do that because

1982
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:59.910
Christina Frazee: I'm just having a hard time right now.

1983
02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:02.700
Katrina Groves: Sorry to hear that.

1984
02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:08.730
Katrina Groves: So do you have

1985
02:38:11.790 --> 02:38:12.300
Okay.

1986
02:38:14.730 --> 02:38:18.690
Katrina Groves: Is it the opioids. That's the hard time or the math, or both.

1987
02:38:19.890 --> 02:38:20.460
Christina Frazee: Um,

1988
02:38:21.570 --> 02:38:27.660
Christina Frazee: No, I just, well, I've only been like when I think using its mess.

1989
02:38:30.330 --> 02:38:31.920
Christina Frazee: I don't, I'm just like,

1990
02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:45.570
Christina Frazee: I'm having a hard time dealing with everything. Like I just like I told Tony yesterday, I got a letter in the mail saying that my head went through already

1991
02:38:46.260 --> 02:39:02.100
Christina Frazee: And the meeting list. And I'm like, I know this should be good news. You know, it hasn't even been a month, but I think it just put it into reality for me, you know that it's like I'm on my own now, you know, and it's my family's like not together anymore, you know,

1992
02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:05.400
Christina Frazee: So I don't know. I think it was just a

1993
02:39:07.050 --> 02:39:09.660
Christina Frazee: Little dose of reality, it's just hard.

1994
02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:10.740
Christina Frazee: I don't know how

1995
02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:14.160
Christina Frazee: Long without my kids, you know, having them every day.

1996
02:39:15.510 --> 02:39:21.720
Katrina Groves: So why, okay. So you haven't had your kids for a long time now. Right.

1997
02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:22.650
Right.

1998
02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:25.080
Katrina Groves: This is not new.

1999
02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:33.570
Christina Frazee: I know it's just I think I go through different stages, like, because when I first didn't get the kids, then you know

2000
02:39:34.020 --> 02:39:45.150
Christina Frazee: They were crying every day because they missed me and then they went to it and then it went to where they're okay without me. And so then I get upset about that because the like.

2001
02:39:45.420 --> 02:40:00.270
Christina Frazee: Or. Okay. There'll be okay on the phone like talking to me and see me and then there. Okay, leaving you know and so that upsets me and it's like all these different levels of things that I'm having to go through that I never expected and so I don't know it's just

2002
02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:02.130
Christina Frazee: It's just hard.

2003
02:40:04.290 --> 02:40:11.100
Katrina Groves: The emotions are really difficult to you're not used to dealing with them, you're used to stuffing them. Yeah.

2004
02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:13.230
Christina Frazee: And I don't

2005
02:40:15.630 --> 02:40:24.030
Christina Frazee: I just let it build up like Elvis. I don't talk about it or you know I don't show emotion. So I just follow it to the pit of my stomach and then just

2006
02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:34.380
Christina Frazee: Smile, like everything okay cuz I'm gonna tell my kids, you know, like everything's fine. It's just adult stuff, you know, but I think not dealing with it is

2007
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:38.190
Christina Frazee: Brought me to my breaking point you know

2008
02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:40.440
Katrina Groves: How old are your kids now.

2009
02:40:41.340 --> 02:40:42.720
Christina Frazee: I'm 11 eight

2010
02:40:45.090 --> 02:40:46.710
Katrina Groves: And they're old enough to kind of

2011
02:40:48.450 --> 02:40:52.530
Katrina Groves: Understand about drugs their friends are probably using them in school.

2012
02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:53.550
Yeah.

2013
02:40:55.530 --> 02:41:01.020
Christina Frazee: Yeah, it's crazy because I went on. It was on Thursday. I went to Jordan's family length.

2014
02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:13.350
Christina Frazee: And he had like his little friend was talking about a bar and I was all with that, you know, and it's just it is just crazy to think that you know he's in sixth grade already. I know what I was doing in sixth grade, you know,

2015
02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:14.700
Katrina Groves: Yeah.

2016
02:41:16.050 --> 02:41:16.500
Christina Frazee: It's just it

2017
02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:22.890
Katrina Groves: Right and and so you know those emotions. Being a mom.

2018
02:41:24.450 --> 02:41:37.830
Katrina Groves: All mothers habit. It's like, yeah, we want our kids to be independent, but the knee, then they don't seem to want you. And so then you feel like the new hero like abandoned and you're sad that will, don't they love me and

2019
02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:43.620
Christina Frazee: I mean it's, yeah. It's like me and Chloe me and Jordan were really, really close to me and Chloe.

2020
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:55.680
Christina Frazee: I mean it was just a different kind of love, but me and Chloe have gotten so close lately and like every time I do see her. She doesn't want me to leave her side, even to use the bathroom like she's just like, and

2021
02:41:56.550 --> 02:42:09.690
Christina Frazee: She's all, I wish I could live with you and you know she's just really sad that all right you know she can't live with me and he was me all the time. And this is me doing her hair and you know it's just all the stuff that I'm reminded of every day.

2022
02:42:10.470 --> 02:42:15.870
Katrina Groves: So when, how can you look forward to a time when you are going to

2023
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:19.800
Katrina Groves: Be able to get your kids back with you.

2024
02:42:21.750 --> 02:42:29.760
Katrina Groves: I mean, are you on a step thing like the HUD, get your own place. Get out of this bad relationship.

2025
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:45.270
Christina Frazee: But then if it turns, I go back to the same old behavior where I'll sabotage it because I think like, I'm not good enough. I don't deserve this. You know what I mean. And I'm just denied self sabotaging them just like, Well, fuck it. And I'm shifting, you know,

2026
02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:48.870
Christina Frazee: I need to really

2027
02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:53.670
Christina Frazee: Be in a stable environment, you know, I'm

2028
02:42:54.900 --> 02:43:01.170
Christina Frazee: Constantly like having to live out of bags and just not. It's just raining, you know, working and then

2029
02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:15.000
Christina Frazee: I'm just hurting all the time because I'm working in just emotionally. So it flares up my fiber mile Jamie and I wake up at my hands are swollen and I'm just so exhausted and

2030
02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:25.530
Christina Frazee: There's just the constant I'm being told to get out move out you know my stuff still in bags like just the constant, not knowing

2031
02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:31.740
Christina Frazee: So, so, I mean, but I thought it would be a good thing for the hood going through this soon. You know what I mean, but

2032
02:43:36.630 --> 02:43:37.080
Yeah.

2033
02:43:38.490 --> 02:43:40.320
Katrina Groves: I think you second guess yourself a lot

2034
02:43:41.070 --> 02:43:41.460
Yeah.

2035
02:43:43.740 --> 02:43:54.210
Katrina Groves: Alright, well, let me just sort of start from the beginning again. Then, when did you start using narcotics, or actually, when did you start using any substance. How old are you, are you, six, eight.

2036
02:43:54.780 --> 02:44:04.770
Christina Frazee: I was gonna I'm gonna say around 14 is when I started using everything like first thing with lead and then it was meth and I mean everything coke.

2037
02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:07.380
Christina Frazee: Costly

2038
02:44:08.010 --> 02:44:11.040
Katrina Groves: Green LSD hallucinogens

2039
02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:21.720
Christina Frazee: Yeah, I've done LSD. I've done mushrooms. I've done ecstasy. I've done into lines like whippets and I've done computer cleaner. I mean, I've done

2040
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:24.270
Christina Frazee: I've done everything

2041
02:44:25.350 --> 02:44:29.160
Christina Frazee: I think the only thing that I haven't done is fracking pod, you know,

2042
02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:34.230
Katrina Groves: Mm hmm. And so at 14 then and that led to

2043
02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:40.110
Katrina Groves: Problems with your work, your relationships, your family. Yeah.

2044
02:44:42.750 --> 02:44:47.820
Katrina Groves: How many times did. When did you decided that you might want to try to quit or did you

2045
02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:51.000
Christina Frazee: I did.

2046
02:44:52.140 --> 02:44:55.980
Christina Frazee: I don't think I ever really quit. Um,

2047
02:44:59.010 --> 02:45:05.130
Christina Frazee: I mean, when I was like 20 something maybe 20 I went to do

2048
02:45:06.450 --> 02:45:21.240
Christina Frazee: For possession of heroin and you know I got clean and deal and then I moved back down to San Diego with my mom a little bit and seeking for a little bit, but I think unless it's like I was forced to get clean. I've never really been clean my own

2049
02:45:22.830 --> 02:45:31.350
Katrina Groves: Although you joined our program, what, um, gosh, when you were gone, and I can't remember the first time but you came back last year in March.

2050
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:34.200
Katrina Groves: Of your own free will. Right.

2051
02:45:34.530 --> 02:45:34.920
Yeah.

2052
02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:38.250
Christina Frazee: Yeah I cuz I just feel like

2053
02:45:39.630 --> 02:45:45.420
Christina Frazee: Now that I'm older and have kids. I don't know. I just feel different about it like I really

2054
02:45:52.890 --> 02:45:53.700
Christina Frazee: Let me go in a different

2055
02:46:05.220 --> 02:46:14.370
Christina Frazee: So I feel like now that I have kids and stuff. I really, I really want it. It's just, I know that there's not. I know that I have to do the work like

2056
02:46:16.170 --> 02:46:33.300
Christina Frazee: You can't just go into Suboxone program and then everything's gonna be fine. I know I need to be seen. Tom Sawyer, and I had a major setback with, you know, when I went into house was the house, house has been really good and then little thing with my boyfriend or you know whatever x

2057
02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:44.100
Christina Frazee: It's just that was a major setback for me. Yeah. And so I'm having to do like pull myself out of that hole now.

2058
02:46:47.370 --> 02:46:49.530
Katrina Groves: Are there other housing.

2059
