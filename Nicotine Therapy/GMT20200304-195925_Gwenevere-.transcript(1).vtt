00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello.

2
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.320
Angelina C: You sorry about this morning.

3
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, well it you know it worked out fine. We had a backup plan.

4
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's, it's no big deal. I guess I would say

5
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe just asking me say, Hey, do you have another day because I understand doctor's appointments and if there anything like mine, they always take longer than we think. And

6
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.750
Angelina C: I was there, you text me this morning and I was already there.

7
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, I

8
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:20.310
Angelina C: waited and waited and finding. I said, I have another appointment to be at nine. And now, sorry. We're backed up. They wanted my blood work and all that done, and I was trying to get my UAE done before I came in this morning.

9
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:33.450
Angelina C: And it took, I, I didn't even get it to finish the appointment. So that's what I was like I'm hurrying. But then I got she I'm just gonna go down to try quarter day to do the drug test, even though they're going to do one Friday to so

10
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: See, that's just now was this where you were going with this, a lab we doing something for Breitbart health

11
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.740
Angelina C: Um, well, I was trying to I was because I was going to my doctors, how to get a doctor's note to go to work, Sunday, I was so sick.

12
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.350
Angelina C: So I went to get a doctor's note. And then they're like, well, you got to get the blood work done. You got to do this and I was like what I said I wasn't expecting this. So,

13
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:07.980
Angelina C: It just took forever. And I felt so bad. So I'm just going to go down to try quarter day to get the thing and I rescheduled for Friday. So it's like I kind of missed out on box, but I thought I'd get home in time.

14
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.720
Angelina C: Okay.

15
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But we'll just, you know, sometimes doctors appointments are like that. So we'll just do our best to try to schedule on days that there's not a conflict.

16
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.750
Angelina C: Why wasn't supposed to. I had it set yesterday and I was there forever. That's what was wrong. And so they rescheduled me for this morning.

17
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Craziness.

18
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.110
Angelina C: Yeah, so I apologize. Normally I don't schedule them on the days I have with you guys, or even that close so

19
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no worries. And that's just, that's okay. We're all right so I'm going to open up a note here. Well, in doing that. Let's get you in a place where I can actually see your face, you have backlighting which means I won't be able to pick up on subtle aspect.

20
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

21
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.970
Angelina C: Oh good, better here. Maybe I can come down here.

22
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.490
Angelina C: Is that a little bit better.

23
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, no. Let's do this. Um, so here's what's ideal and you want to have nobody to look me right in the eye, if you, if you could, you want to put books underneath me. So on propped up so that you could conceivably if we were looking, I don't, I wouldn't be able to

24
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.870
Angelina C: It's too far. Okay, I'm just gonna be

25
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Better though was better.

26
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.790
Angelina C: Yeah, how's that, okay, better, better

27
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what am I on right now that maybe I could come up, maybe four or five inches. What am I on right now my

28
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.680
Angelina C: First aid kit.

29
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.690
Angelina C: Your table, though.

30
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, books, maybe I'm thinking, yeah.

31
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's worth it.

32
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's worth you're worth the effort. You know, you might as well get the most out of this.

33
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.170
Angelina C: Oh, I really

34
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.120
Angelina C: Enjoyed last session. That's why I was like, no.

35
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.670
Angelina C: And then we've got signed last night at work.

36
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.380
Angelina C: I looked down at my break at eight. And usually I have one before. Then I was like, Oh, no.

37
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so beautiful that is so much better. Okay. So, yep, turn it so just the top of your head then. Oh.

38
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Okay, right there, think that down a little bit. I really just want to see top of the head and as much of the body as possible in case we do any breathing kind of exercises and all

39
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.790
Angelina C: That kind of stuff.

40
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great. Right there. Okay.

41
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.640
Angelina C: Justin.

42
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You work so hard for that too. I love it. Okay, so let me get a little date in here. Today's the fourth minus will say Merry Christmas to you because it feels like it's gonna be December before

43
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.810
Angelina C: No, I know. I don't know why times fine so fast.

44
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Same. Alright, so let's go to let me see, what did I do last time. Did I teach you can I teach you the belly breathing.

45
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm so glad

46
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.440
Angelina C: I've used it to I used it yesterday at work.

47
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was someone being kind of rude and nasty around you.

48
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.390
Angelina C: What this one girl tries to be the boss and the boss, isn't there, kind of thing.

49
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

50
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.040
Angelina C: She's like, You can't do that. You can't do that. And I was like, well, my boss hasn't told me anything yet because my boss that don't just tell her. No, that's not

51
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.980
Angelina C: You do your side, I do my side and don't switch. So I just kind of was like, Okay, what are breathing and

52
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Love it. I love it.

53
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it, I love it, I love it, and you're going to have access to that with all kinds of uncomfortable moments.

54
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, just to reinforce it's biology is going to help and it's going to help being able to remember. Other things that you might be learning in here and so

55
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a nice little segue to let's do some imagery. Let's pull in some imagery and but first I want to check in with you and see what

56
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You've already played with because I know you were getting services with other people. So I want to check and see

57
00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have already come up with a safe place, you may have already come up with a mantra that you like sort of a positive self appraisal, you may have already come up with some things so I kind of want to check in with you and see if you've already done some of that.

58
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.730
Angelina C: I didn't really honestly i when i was there in 2016 I am

59
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:24.030
Angelina C: I didn't really believe like I guess I needed to be in there, kind of thing. Yeah. But when I was towards the end. My main thing at first was to stay away from my husband.

60
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:38.100
Angelina C: And that was the hardest for me. So those were the things we were kind of working on and and yeah I had a safe place to go if I started feeling uncomfortable. Yeah, we did that kind of stuff. But I, I really didn't take it serious really really cut this last year when

61
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. So it's like in one ear and out the other forgotten.

62
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.670
Angelina C: I know, but I just didn't. I don't know. This year I took it a lot more serious. So, okay.

63
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Okay, well,

64
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Love it. Well, I'm glad I'm getting to meet you. Now I'm taking it in. So this is cool. Yeah. So, so far what we've learned is

65
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The breathing exercise the belly breathing was remembered and you did it. And that's what we want. So that's fantastic. So we did actually, I can see that we did a little bit of imagery. We set up some some pieces already over here. That's great.

66
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to do something else with you.

67
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

68
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This one is potentially more in quite a bit more intense. And this has to do with it's not pulling back a lot of memories, but it is a tiny bit. It's pulling up a memory of an age it's pulling up, not the story of that age, but it will it will

69
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.080
Angelina C: ask of you to remember it for a moment and

70
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe even but not. You don't have to tell me what was going on. That's your choice.

71
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But it also may pull up maybe a nickname that you were called at that time. And then there's a couple questions throughout the activity if we get that far.

72
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it can take three or four sessions to do this particular exercise, but it's worth. Once you really get it. It's like, Ah, nice. So

73
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I call this is an anchor room.

74
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason I call it an anchor room is because

75
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to hear when we do the exercise. It's attached to this home that you're in right now.

76
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is the life you're living. It's not some future life. It's not the past and this is it even if you're staying in this place for two weeks.

77
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you got today. So I say let's take what we have right now and let's add on another resource another space, right.

78
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, again, is is capitalizing on right brain activity on imagination, but you're probably going to be tempted like most people are to dip into an actual memory.

79
00:08:53.490 --> 00:09:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'll be tempting for you to want to say, well, no. The room was pinky was pink. It was pink. Well, that's not what is being asked what's being asked is,

80
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you need it to be today that's different, not remembering it was pink or rather I really like blue

81
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I like my room, blue, and that's what it is. So be really careful to not force, just because it doesn't match a memory that's not what we want. What we want is getting your needs met in this room, exactly what you need right now.

82
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.580
Angelina C: Let me grab a Kleenex real quick.

83
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.160
Angelina C: Yes.

84
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.160
Angelina C: Sorry, sorry.

85
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.590
Angelina C: Well,

86
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.540
Angelina C: Phoenix.

87
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Tend to make people cry in here so it's probably good to have handy anyway.

88
00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:11.220
Angelina C: Because they're my nose is just been running so bad, like really bad, like a faucet. They put me on allergy meds, but I didn't take them this morning because I didn't know if they were really working because I'm still sick, so I quit taking them, but my nose is just awesome.

89
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's so there's going to be this is different than talk therapy. It's a little different in the sense that we're normally. Let's say you would say, oh I on the spot. My friend did this and then I say, oh, well, maybe you could try

90
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This out and I wonder what your underlying thought was or feeling. This one's really different. This one heavily relies on my next question.

91
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just

92
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You answer uncensored your first response and your first response might be in the body. That's fine.

93
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:43.890
Angelina C: Too.

94
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: By be an emotion and might be a memory that's all good. You can't, you can't do any of this wrong. You're going to stay away from the client to do it wrong.

95
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.580
Angelina C: Okay.

96
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I could ask a dumb question, I can get it wrong.

97
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But you have you're going to, you're going to be fabulous so

98
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But the reliance on my next question is my point. You're going to answer and then I will have another question. So we'll let my next question be the guide. It's not analysis where you go into this long story about why you think you just said what you said, We won't be doing that.

99
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just going to rely on, you're going to be your here's my answer. And then I'm going to have another question. And then you're going to answer and then I'm going to have another question, it's going to kind of go like that.

100
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. Um, and we'll get further into it, the more we can do it with that volley. Here's my response. Now what's going to your next question, we're going to kind of do it like that. Okay, and see where it takes us

101
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, it's uncensored

102
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

103
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Another one. Um, you know, that should be enough.

104
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.160
Angelina C: Let's create like

105
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.120
Here we go.

106
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to think about something where you still feeling stuck, kind of like I've been trying to solve this problem.

107
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: For example, I'm impatient, I get really impatient. When I see people aren't taking something like like I'll making up a story. So I've got a kid, right, and my kid doesn't look like he's concentrating and he's being silly.

108
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I lose it. I yell throw the papers everywhere. I don't like that about myself. So I want to work on that that and I've been trying. I tried medication. I've tried meditation. I've tried yoga. I've tried self talk. I'm trying to breathing nothing seems to help me.

109
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be I'm stuck. I'm stuck because it can't seem to keep it together around my irritability and

110
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I would be an example. Whoops.

111
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to turn it on.

112
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.170
Angelina C: A do not. Yeah. Look, I

113
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:52.410
Angelina C: Can hardly hear you want it does that hold on now, it shuts off the audio. So if we put it on.

114
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Do Not Disturb I think it'll stop doing that to you. I think

115
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.360
Angelina C: I think there's like a do not disturb you still have it completely turned off.

116
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Do Not Disturb earnest and so little moon on mine.

117
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

118
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.980
You'll be back.

119
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.710
Angelina C: Are you there.

120
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Test, test, test, I'm here.

121
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.280
Angelina C: I don't know what it's doing.

122
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Its back its back.

123
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.070
Angelina C: Its back. Okay.

124
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We're back. Okay, cool, cool, cool. Okay. So in other words, basically what I'm getting at is what is it that you kind of want to address through therapy. What's kind of bothering you still maybe it's a mindset. Maybe it's a belief, maybe it's self esteem. Where are you feeling kind of stuck.

125
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:39.900
Angelina C: Um,

126
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.260
Angelina C: I feel where I feel stuck, I think, is my anger issues.

127
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it is. OK.

128
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.670
anger issues.

129
00:13:51.840 --> 00:14:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And thinking back to the most intense or sometimes they're not the same. So,

130
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.250
Angelina C: Early on, soon. Yeah.

131
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm see if you want

132
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.010
Angelina C: A suit. There you go. I cannot see you're pushing on my button.

133
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.320
Angelina C: Okay.

134
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you can think back to the earliest age were

135
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: On get settled. Okay, so picture right now just now, you're like, oh, I think it's my anger issue right so you picture that one and then track it backward. Did I have it five years ago to have it 10 years ago. Did I have it 1520

136
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.930
Angelina C: It started about 10 years ago. Okay.

137
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that puts you at 35

138
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So go inside and I want you to see. Now dip into 34

139
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.020
Angelina C: I was happy. Oh, okay. I was happy.

140
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:56.610
Angelina C: Okay.

141
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So, something happened that age 35 that's really where it stands out. And there's not this sense that that irritability was not present in the 20s. It was not there in the teens was not there. And in early childhood.

142
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.090
Angelina C: No, I used to be get along with everyone.

143
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.430
Angelina C: So sweet now.

144
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.780
Angelina C: It's changed anger.

145
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.970
Angelina C: But I know what that wasn't was caused by just hurt.

146
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.920
Angelina C: And infidelity.

147
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Now when you say it's an issue.

148
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Infidelity maybe over like that event is over.

149
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But still there. Is there anger nowadays. Like, even at work, is it seemed like you're angry.

150
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.670
Angelina C: It has but um

151
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.570
Angelina C: I don't really get angry like that as much as I did my youngest

152
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:57.390
Angelina C: And I were living together in this little studio and when we didn't get along. I flipped one day.

153
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:12.870
Angelina C: And she calmed me down so much. I thought, This isn't worth it. After my car X all this stuff. And so now it's just getting through with my husband. Now he's on the road for six weeks in Texas, and that's really trust hard for me. Okay.

154
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it can't quite hear how

155
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. My you can't hear me.

156
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.750
Angelina C: I can hear you. There you go. Good.

157
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me a sense one more time about how anchor shows up haven't quite heard it, how it shows up in your life these days maybe give me a recent example last 30 days. How does it show up.

158
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:36.300
And

159
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:53.520
Angelina C: Say for example, were at my daughter's I taking my husband to go get his drug test for his work, and he was all nervous when I was driving bit it blew out into a huge fight and it's still brought it back home here into a huge fight and I'm never aggressive like that, but

160
00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:07.410
Angelina C: I just feel like the step little things we fight about like that. We can't even go to town to have a good time it like that kind of stuff. And then he blames it so it's all meat. No, I'm not saying that, but I'm not gonna sit here and let you walk all over me either.

161
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see where that moment actually happened, you're in the car.

162
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: He said or did something to remember what it was.

163
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.650
Angelina C: Yeah, the way I was driving and

164
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:20.790
Angelina C: tell you where to go.

165
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, wait. Was he criticizing your driving

166
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.280
Angelina C: Yeah.

167
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me

168
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Where to go

169
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.630
Angelina C: Yes. Okay.

170
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the emotion you felt when you were criticized for your driving. What was the

171
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:38.730
Angelina C: Alert like

172
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:46.260
Angelina C: You're already going to start this. We haven't been an Albuquerque this long to see the kids and it always happens around my older daughter seems like

173
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.750
Angelina C: Or when we're at her apartment and see. It's hard, cuz he

174
00:17:53.430 --> 00:18:02.250
Angelina C: I don't know. I just don't understand why you know like he blamed like because, see, when he did have kind of expanded you and he did something to me back.

175
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:10.860
Angelina C: What was 16 years ago now, my daughter 16 but it was 16 years ago. He had a girlfriend and it was a stripper. And I haven't run into her out here still

176
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:19.110
Angelina C: Okay. It was a stripper. He literally was taking my oldest over there with him writing are four wheelers and all this and she had two girls and

177
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:30.660
Angelina C: Then three years ago, I tried getting over him and I went and slept with somebody like a stupid THINKING I CAN GET OVER. Well, it didn't happen that way it's been World War three. After that, yes. Okay. I gotcha.

178
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This thing that happened 10 years ago was it the infidelity.

179
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.130
Angelina C: Yes. Okay. I gotcha.

180
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm getting an idea now.

181
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm the thing

182
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This substance use started, how long ago.

183
00:18:47.760 --> 00:19:00.210
Angelina C: I have all my back. I've been on those for a long time, but I haven't. I was on them for at least 1516 years but I've been off of them since 2015 clinics. I was really in the rehab.

184
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:07.680
Angelina C: Because only thing I was on was value. And when I was going in there was a benzo so it wasn't really oh and I smoke.

185
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:19.950
Angelina C: Pot for the pain. That's the only two things I was on when I went into rehab. So it was the domestic violence class. They were really wanting me to take more because of my anger and the fights that I got in there.

186
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm trying to see the domestic violence.

187
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:32.130
Angelina C: But I the, a lot of the drug use or opioid use and drug use is what caused a lot of our fights, too.

188
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So the domestic violence piece was more than 10 years ago.

189
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:47.190
Angelina C: Yeah, it was when Mikayla was 16 that's when it started, but it just seems like it got worse and worse until he finally broke down and then I started crying. I moved my step out of the room.

190
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.160
Angelina C: And it's like, I don't understand. But then he's like, I'm so sorry. That's not what I want. But

191
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:03.330
Angelina C: It's finally, the first time I saw emotion from him, I guess. Normally, it's the anger part and then I leave, I don't like to be around that. I just want to be happy. And so I'll leave

192
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:12.990
Angelina C: And I'll go live with my mom and I kept doing that with Michaela and so McHale and I got really close, and he didn't like that, but he went for a stage that

193
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:20.070
Angelina C: That kind of hurt me because he was like acting like he didn't want nothing to do with Michaela so it broke my heart.

194
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:35.970
Angelina C: And she's the youngest and they used to be best, best friends. I mean, they were the best of friends. You can separate those two and now it's just kind of like he's finally getting that back now that we're living together. But now he's gonna be on the road again for told me

195
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:46.560
Angelina C: He's going to be on the road again for six weeks and the place he went was Dallas and that's where he moved to when he left me. So I have a really hard time with that.

196
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.990
Angelina C: With the strippers and stuff but

197
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:55.710
Angelina C: Let's see if he's just real serious this time, you know, because it's just, it's hard.

198
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to get a picture of where to start. That's what I'm up to

199
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.170
Angelina C: I felt bad Rebecca was the same way, like, hold on just a second.

200
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to the domestic violence for a second. I just need

201
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your how old you were when that was going on.

202
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.430
Angelina C: Well, when it first actually started

203
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.480
Angelina C: Is the first time when we were drinking and

204
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.740
Age.

205
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:31.980
Angelina C: I have to say 21 my because I already had Patricia. She was a year old. So I was 21 when it started.

206
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And prior to that, when you work backwards and you say, how I was at 20 and how I was at 19 and how I was a 17 your ability to maybe tolerate something similar like someone criticizing something or someone telling you what to do. You notice you were very different. Yeah.

207
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.020
Angelina C: I wasn't really a fighter and I felt that hurt from when I got hurt from him.

208
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:08.790
Angelina C: But, and that was what was hard because it's still never proven, but I had a girl friend and Albuquerque that liked one of his friends and she was my best friend since kindergarten.

209
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:17.160
Angelina C: And he went over there. One day I wasn't there. And she and she brought him home and I was hurt and then that's

210
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:23.130
Angelina C: Like the first. I felt the anger, because before I used to be like the peacemaker don't fight. It's okay, don't worry about it, you know.

211
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:34.290
Angelina C: We'll get through this. But once I felt that true hurt. It's like it hurt. And I didn't know how to handle it then. And then as the years go on, you know, he's 653 hundred 80 pounds.

212
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: benzo us for just a moment. I'm I need to still keep doing some investigation here. So the benzo use the value. When did you first little were you diagnosed with something for that was treated with the value

213
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:57.630
Angelina C: And my mom disagreed, but I was off all my medications at the time. We didn't even know I had lupus at this time.

214
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.010
Angelina C: It was in 2016 when I went to rehab.

215
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:07.230
Angelina C: Is that what you're meaning.

216
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: No, not coin try

217
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.870
Something here.

218
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back a little bit. Ah.

219
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.020
Angelina C: Look at your

220
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Bio psychosocial because something's Canfield saying, Oh, man.

221
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I'm

222
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.070
Came in

223
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.460
And who did you meet with initially

224
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Get your bio psychosocial

225
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.000
Angelina C: I don't think I've had a BIOS

226
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.610
Angelina C: I just started seeing Rebecca

227
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that that would be really

228
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you did. You had one with Jessica on October 23

229
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:52.890
Angelina C: Okay.

230
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me look at that and get a sense of something here. Um,

231
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you have a history of some

232
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Really sort of a scary time in your life. I'm not sure. Something about I took penicillin and there was a suicide attempt in the past when. How old were you when that happened,

233
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:25.800
Angelina C: The suicide attempt to happen in 2016. That's what I had to go to rehab. The first time and that's when they put me because they wouldn't diagnose me because

234
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:36.090
Angelina C: The I'm and I should say this. I just don't think I got along with that doctor at all. But I was really domestic violence in there. I've been through my cup of the doctors told. Get out of my room.

235
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.940
Angelina C: I was fighting in there. And so they made me apologize to everybody and go to rehab.

236
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:55.500
Angelina C: But I was in so much pain this is before we even knew I had lupus. They just said I had they were thinking, I said Ms. I've been to the doctors. They couldn't figure out what's going on with me. And so I felt like they were judging me thinking. I was just in there to get pills.

237
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:05.580
Angelina C: Because that day. They gave me a oxy cotton in the emergency room of 50 milligram, but after that I hadn't had anything. And then I went

238
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.850
Angelina C: They put me on value. And when I came out.

239
00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:17.850
Angelina C: And then when I went in, they said they couldn't see me because I had, I was on benzo so I didn't even know what the heck I was doing. I was so lost but

240
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.440
Angelina C: Yeah.

241
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so say Mary just

242
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.830
Angelina C: Come right here.

243
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just reading. So we're okay. Just checking on something.

244
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so your family history. I'm having to read because I didn't do this assessment with you. You're the context of your childhood is I think your mother.

245
00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Suffered from alcoholism. Is that right,

246
00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:04.590
Angelina C: Yeah. Well, she was a lesbian, too. And that really took a toll on my brother night because they were drinkers.

247
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:19.470
Angelina C: And I saw him beating up my mom in the park. I mean, it was bad hurt my mom drink and drug abuse were younger. When I was in kindergarten before we moved out here in fourth grade. So there was a lot of

248
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you say, Did you just say I saw my mother being beaten

249
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:33.270
Angelina C: Oh yeah we stopped my brother and I saw her on the front lawn. One night I wouldn't woke him up crying and she was beating up my mom on the front lawn.

250
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:39.420
Angelina C: Then there was another time at the baseball fields these girls got her and I was so scared. I didn't know what to do.

251
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:52.260
Angelina C: But me and my brother were there and see my brother was raped when he was younger by the same guy that we used to go to the pool with that. They called him, Mr boozer from church. He was from church. And so he got raped so

252
00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:04.800
Angelina C: Sex isn't a thing in my life and I I could live without it. I don't know if that makes sense. Like right now at my estrogens at zero, but I'm on blood clot medicine, so I can't take anything

253
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:14.910
Angelina C: I tried black costs that didn't work. But anyway, I just don't have that sex drive, so I don't care. You know what I mean. So that makes it hard in the relationship.

254
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's both take a deep breath. Nice. Inhale, and we'll do some of that right now. Let's see if we can get

255
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.490
Angelina C: It to this this exercise together. I think have enough information.

256
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It's breathe in through the nose.

257
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

258
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.700
Exhale out

259
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: One more time in

260
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.030
And then exhale

261
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.500
And easy

262
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want to add is I'd like you to take your right hand, and I'd like to put your hand on something. Maybe it's a towel can be anything can be a pencil or pen, put it in your right hand.

263
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And close your eyes and I want you to describe how it feels. Only adjectives that come from your tactile experience in your right hand smooth rough

264
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.840
Angelina C: Cold

265
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, keep going, keep telling me.

266
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.320
It's rough

267
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.260
Angelina C: bumpy. I just keep cranking it real hard.

268
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's solid

269
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.770
Angelina C: Solid. There you go.

270
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want you to do something.

271
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: With your eyes. Let's do this one. I want you to use as many adjectives as you can. But the only thing you can do not labels, but only information you're gathering from your eyes.

272
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.960
Angelina C: It's not a rock, a crystal. Okay.

273
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a label move on.

274
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.440
Angelina C: What else do you stick a mountain. It looks like a pretty crystal mountain

275
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's also a late data coming in from your eyes would be brown shiny.

276
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.600
Angelina C: Oh yeah, like a crystal Lee. Okay. Ron shiny white Chris Lee.

277
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.430
Angelina C: Keep going, smooth or

278
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.620
Angelina C: Rough hard

279
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Okay. Close your eyes.

280
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want you to tell me only data coming into the ears.

281
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.540
What do you hear with the ears.

282
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.900
Angelina C: My daughter's radio really far away.

283
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.180
Angelina C: Me playing with the cow.

284
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Know hung from a fan or

285
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.770
Angelina C: No, I have it all quiet in here. I turn everything on

286
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want you to pay attention to smell. See if you can get. Soon as I said it Medea notice

287
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.890
My perfume.

288
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring your arm up to your, to your shoulders. You can get some fabric in there to see if you smell anything from the

289
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.690
Angelina C: Fabric do so.

290
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.160
Angelina C: I showed her

291
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.590
Angelina C: Beautiful. Yeah.

292
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want you to pay attention to what your mouth to taste. This is the hardest one to get to see, see if you can find a late

293
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.270
Angelina C: I have a medicine in my mouth.

294
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Medicine. You can taste the better.

295
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's nice. And notice how your body feels right now, after we've done this.

296
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm relaxed that I just did another grounding exercise with you. It's called grounding in the five senses when you notice that you're

297
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: In any kind of disrupts

298
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What can be really helpful. It's especially helpful to get the item in your right hand. If it's a tactile so it can be a blanket. It can be something right next door.

299
00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Especially if you're having an intense emotion. You can go to the freezer and put a piece of ice in your right hand that activates

300
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only like you're using distraction to sort of describe what you're feeling but it activates the left side of your brain, which is the one that has language that sort of organized and structured and want to get out of this emotional side.

301
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to activate because our left side of our brain controls the right side of our body.

302
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So ironically when we're thinking and paying attention to what's going on in our right hand, we're getting. We're going to activate

303
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The left side of the brain, which is more organized more methodical and has a little bit more of this sort of reasoning and sort of

304
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: logic to it. Whereas the right side is where we store all those emotions. So when you're having a big emotion might want to give that a try, and we did it in vivo just now, and you had a little bit of a were able to kind of bring that intensity down a little bit.

305
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.530
Angelina C: Yeah, nice. You can already tell when I get like that.

306
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's, that's your life and I want you to be able to decide, well, maybe I want to chat about what's on my mind. I like it, but not be a victim to it like

307
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have any say maybe I only want to talk about one story because it might rob you

308
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: have opportunities to be listening or taking in new information. Maybe it's an environment in a classroom or something and you want to be hearing what they're saying. And you might be missing out.

309
00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So we did that. Now I have a much better understanding we completely went left when I was going originally right but it's been so helpful to me.

310
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.490
Angelina C: So thing stories.

311
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:27.030
Angelina C: Really, and that's what's why I didn't take it honestly so serious in 2016 I think because I didn't trust the counselor. So you guys are the first ones I've trusted. Yeah. Oh, that's why. Now I'm taking a lot more serious this last June, when I tried killing myself to

312
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.400
Angelina C: In June, yeah.

313
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and this, this, this. And so let's

314
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.780
Angelina C: Just year

315
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:42.330
Angelina C: That's why I came across, they gave me you guys because I wrecked my car, I told a girl hit me hit on texting a 17 YEAR OLD IN MY Audi.

316
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:58.470
Angelina C: So I told that lost my job. It was just a mess. I lost my apartment so it would just went downhill from there. So I took some medicines and I just am puzzle on that came by and I wasn't answering the door so they call the permit it. So,

317
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And in any of your injuries in your life. Did you ever experience a traumatic brain injury. Have you ever had brain injury anything

318
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:19.710
Angelina C: I don't know if it's when I wreck on the floor like what I had record on the board with my helmet went completely around, but I've never been checked for it, they just kept looking at my neck for it. Okay. Okay.

319
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's get back into this exercise, we won't get all the way through it but that's okay. We can start, but we've got this idea

320
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Of anger, and I can tell you don't identify with anything before this sort of situation right around 21, it sounds like. But when I investigate a little further. There is some history of anger being in front of you in a really violent way you've seen it.

321
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been awake.

322
00:33:56.070 --> 00:34:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: To it and had a sense of helplessness around it. So although you're not identifying from the feeling. You've seen it.

323
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:04.710
All right.

324
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's going to get into much, much, much earlier. History

325
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you something underneath the current anger, the one that you recognize that one.

326
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oftentimes anger secondary it protects us from getting hurt again.

327
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.370
Angelina C: Hold on. Excuse me.

328
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:30.510
Angelina C: With my collar.

329
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.840
Angelina C: Yeah, because we have to be i'd i

330
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.740
Angelina C: Let her get her shoes. Sorry.

331
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.230
Angelina C: This is my daughter Michaela

332
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.370
Angelina C: Say hi, real quick, yeah I

333
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:56.160
Angelina C: Just said it right here. Don't grab it. Thank you. I have to keep the door closed as a cat times all over me when I'm only on this.

334
00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.420
Angelina C: Sorry about that.

335
00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Voice or something. So, okay.

336
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So underneath.

337
00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:06.510
Angelina C: Okay.

338
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically underneath anger is another emotion.

339
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:28.710
Angelina C: might hurt. Honestly, like it goes anger and then hurt and I calm down. But before I just be hurt and get over it right away. Now it's like it just sticks to be sometimes. Does that make sense.

340
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Course, everything you said. Makes sense. Absolutely. Makes sense. So let's understand that that initial hurt.

341
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were in the car. First we're going to try and understand that a little bit more

342
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to understand it more so when he criticized you're driving

343
00:35:52.500 --> 00:36:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see this is a quick quick answer. Do you see any problem with your driving. Is that something that you kind of identify yeah I'm not the best driver. Sometimes they screw up whatever

344
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:12.960
Angelina C: Yeah, he has always been like a kind of a backseat driver. But the first thing that popped in my head. And I'll be honest with you is like do treat other bitches like this when you were with them. That's what came to my mind.

345
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:24.000
Angelina C: came out of my mouth you treat other bitches like that that drive you around, you know what, when and then when he that's what got it into a big old thing and then

346
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:33.330
Angelina C: All his us for his CDs. He's always been so product they're always clean and he kept saying, I don't know what so foggy. He goes to my daughter and stuff.

347
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:47.460
Angelina C: Thinking, I gave him something like just pissed me off like so it went from there. And then we were supposed to stay there that night and I was ready to go home. I left them there before. I'll go home at a so he just told me that

348
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:58.200
Angelina C: We could leave and i just i i don't want to have to go through the skin. I've been pulling Michaela in and out of schools, back and forth, you know, so it's just not fair to her.

349
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:12.780
Angelina C: We can stay here. All I have is the electricity to pay which barely I can get by on that to get caught up in the food, but he's not going to be here, but that I think is a lot of my I'm trying to trust a lot. I have bad trust issues.

350
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's let's stay right here. If we can stay with want was sounded a little bit like

351
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel

352
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: disrespected in the car, like do you

353
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me. Yeah, well, kind of drive

354
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So my being disrespected. Are you respecting those other bitches. Well, you're disrespecting me. And so, is that something close to what you're feeling

355
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:58.110
Angelina C: Exactly what I'm saying. Because like he was staying at his friends. He went to Albuquerque. One night, just to go because he does a lot of security or body guarding so he went in this night to go to the casino with them and he didn't come home for four days.

356
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:14.520
Angelina C: So that kind of stuff right there just makes me assume that way. Why you know these it gets because what you said. And I said, Yeah, but you're not answering your phone usually answers his phone all the time for me. He wouldn't answer his phone. He'd call me. It was just weird. All right.

357
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.850
Angelina C: I need

358
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: To ask a question.

359
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I, um,

360
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you just say that you're at risk, plus or minus

361
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you at risk of having to move

362
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:38.700
Angelina C: If things don't go well here again. Yeah, but he's not even here though now so hopefully not but

363
00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.570
Let me say what

364
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to hear that I need to really hear how critical, his way of speaking to you is because if we're about to get up and leave.

365
00:38:51.720 --> 00:39:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Relocate water which restart our life. Again, if it's that intense. I want to know about it. And that's not so I really wanted to get a good reading a temperature reading on how important his opinion is of you.

366
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:09.060
Angelina C: While

367
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You might get up and leave if what

368
00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:17.040
Angelina C: He said if if the student on me again. I won't be with him.

369
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.790
Angelina C: And the way he talks me. He's been a lot more

370
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:29.430
Angelina C: After our last big blow out. He's been a lot better. But I don't know if he's just happy because he has a job.

371
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:37.590
Angelina C: Like, say for example, this morning, it kind of hurt my feelings. I've been the only one working now my checks are only 500 every two weeks. And so

372
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:49.110
Angelina C: It's okay, because all I have to do is pay the electricity but like He paid the cell phones today but like he's like I just made 703 days. And I'm like, it just hurt my feelings.

373
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.520
Angelina C: Why didn't know what I mean.

374
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: No, tell me why of what for the phones, tell me.

375
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.650
Angelina C: Because I don't see why he has to compare. I mean, I could go back to nursing, but I wouldn't be happy.

376
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.710
Angelina C: And I can make more money.

377
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.270
Angelina C: But he wasn't complaining when he didn't have a job, you know, it was getting us by, like, and then he turned around and said, you know,

378
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:17.220
Angelina C: All the little bit helps. Don't get me wrong, but just a little bit. It kind of hurt my feelings, because I've been pulling us through this whole time he just started work last week.

379
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So what you heard was not

380
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand why you're not paying more towards other things but you went to that there's something

381
00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of with you.

382
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.240
Angelina C: Um,

383
00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:46.260
Angelina C: It just, I felt personal because it's kind of like he's so happy you got $700 in three days if he's even telling me the truth. See, I don't even know.

384
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:56.160
Angelina C: And I know I shouldn't like it's been, I've been trying so much harder not to pull my kids into it. You know what I mean. Cuz MacOS and I are all we had for the longest time

385
00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:02.550
Angelina C: And I know she's sick of it all the years being pulled back and forth going and

386
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.310
Angelina C: I really thought this last time I was done, I got my own place. I was buying a car. It's just been really hard.

387
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.510
Angelina C: It just hurt my feelings, a little bit this morning.

388
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's start with trust.

389
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know. I want to know what you trust about yourself, don't answer right away.

390
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Put a nice long beat before you before you answer it nice and quiet. Just sit with it. This is really an important question.

391
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To stay stay with it.

392
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be more answers that will come with the quiet.

393
00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I trust about myself that I am

394
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.380
Angelina C: Trustworthy. Okay.

395
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What else

396
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.090
Angelina C: I wouldn't hurt or harm anything to her relationship.

397
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm trustworthy. So, for a lot of people I'm

398
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Trustworthy is I will do what I said I will do. I can provide reliability consistency and therefore I'm trustworthy. What I say is what I do. Is that how you define trust very

399
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:36.750
Angelina C: Much. Yes. Okay. Like, I feel so bad, like I spent $100 on myself and I feel so guilty.

400
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:54.900
Angelina C: And I feel it. My daughter's like mom don't like I feel so guilty and I don't know if it's a mom thing still or what, but I felt so bad you know we haven't had money and I haven't like the first paycheck. I want to do. You know, it's just hard. You know, I spoke guilty. Okay.

401
00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've got I'm trustworthy. That's a sense of who you are. So just now I caught something else important. So we're going to put a pin in the anchor room for a while until I get a sense of where there's some grounding here because

402
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish.

403
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I am

404
00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I already have trustworthy. What else I'm going to hear some of the positive attributes about you.

405
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.930
Angelina C: I haven't really I respectful.

406
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:32.310
Angelina C: I have a big heart. I'm lovable. I'm not, you know, I'd love to let people and

407
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:43.470
Angelina C: I'm just, I don't know. I mean that's and that's one thing too. I think that scares me is I don't know myself like I used to. Or maybe I never have. Do you know what I mean.

408
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So right then. That's why we're kind of putting a pin in this other activity because I'm starting to pick up on.

409
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like as soon as you touch on one thing. It's like hot surface and then it reminds you of this other thing. And then there's this other thing. And there's this other thing, and this is

410
00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All connected and it's got all of these intense feelings. So I wanted to kind of see where you are in sort of space, you know where your shirt.

411
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I am trustworthy. I'm respectful and I'm lovable. So notice that you jumped off there also really fast and then you started to say, Well, I don't know if I ever thought that. So that's why I said to go nice and slow in here. It's a time where we take

412
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What normally

413
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: We go very fast and we deconstruct it and we analyze little bits and important pieces of it so so kind of close your eyes and I'll do the same. I'm not staring at you.

414
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to sit here and I'm going to think about what I like about myself and I want you to think about what you like about you.

415
00:44:52.770 --> 00:45:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of do that I'm going to do the same thing will have what's called mirror neurons and we'll be doing something in parallel together. Okay.

416
00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You notice thing that answers are coming that awareness of kind of things that you like about yourself are showing up in your mind.

417
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is Trustworthy still in there.

418
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:33.930
No.

419
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: While draw a lot about is respectful.

420
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.890
Angelina C: Are you respectfully. Yes. Yes, indeed.

421
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are loving are lovable both one of the other

422
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, lovable.

423
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay what else showed up.

424
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:52.770
Angelina C: Just

425
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.480
Angelina C: I don't. There's really not anything else.

426
00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

427
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to really hone in on

428
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: lovable. I want to be really sure. That's your word. I am loving

429
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:08.730
Angelina C: Uh huh.

430
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. You're sure

431
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:22.230
Angelina C: I'm more loving or lovable, I guess they're both two different things. So I'm I'm pretty much folks I'm, I, I can't, I don't know, maybe not.

432
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what makes you doubt and I don't know which one is going on. Let's stay right there, nice and slow. Well, makes you flip flop. A little yes I'm pressing on it which because you said both and they are different.

433
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:39.180
Angelina C: Because I'm so lovable to my kids and my grandkids. I'm so

434
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.520
Angelina C: I'm loving to them.

435
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:50.280
Angelina C: But when it comes to other things. Like, I mean I love Paul with all my heart. He was a my high school sweetheart.

436
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.050
Angelina C: I still love him the same like my heart's with him, but

437
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.030
Angelina C: I feel

438
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:08.310
Angelina C: This is kind of childish if he does something to me, I would turn around and do it to him. And I'm not like that anymore. I could care less if he's going to walk and do something. I'm okay.

439
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:19.380
Angelina C: You know, I'd be me Michaela have gone before. And we were happy by ourselves, but she wanted to come home out here to be with her dad and but she doesn't want to be without me either, you know,

440
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:27.360
Angelina C: So it's i do i when it comes to my credit kids and my grandbabies there's nothing I wouldn't do if I could do it, but

441
00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:47.430
Angelina C: In like when I had nursing. I loved all my old people. And that's why I think for 25 plus years. I've always been secluded just with my old people during the day I'd work, live ins and everything with them, but I was making better money well $300 more than I make now but I told

442
00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:59.760
Angelina C: My youngest that I'm sorry, she's like, Mom, don't worry about it. Like last night they they walk down to my work at 10 and surprise me and I feel that

443
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:12.840
Angelina C: All I put towards her right now is me like my daughter is grown my oldest she has her kids so it's time to concentrate now on her in the love ability. I have for my kids.

444
00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:21.990
Angelina C: And Paul I really, you know, I want our family to work, but it's gonna come a point that I just, I'm scared. Kinda

445
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:22.980
Okay.

446
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mind works very fast. You have a lot of connections to different feelings different images different thoughts, it moves very fast. What are you at your best at solving problems.

447
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:46.890
Angelina C: Um, and this is what's so strange is there's this this one girl at work and her mom's a schizophrenia. Just for example.

448
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:58.620
Angelina C: And I feel I give her advice I've worked with schizophrenia and it's hard. It's not easy and being raised like that so i i feel like i give out better advice than I take

449
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Do you remember my question.

450
00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:08.340
Angelina C: Of when do I feel more comfortable when I give people advice and can help them.

451
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't say, when do you feel most comfortable

452
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.300
Oh,

453
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no didn't do anything wrong member, you can't do anything wrong.

454
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But just notice how I had asked a question, and it was forgotten almost immediately.

455
00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.070
Angelina C: Yeah I noticed that a lot lately.

456
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.240
Angelina C: I do

457
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.530
Even at work.

458
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's put beats, which means time let's at least have this between what you hear and how you respond. Let's give it time because it might be that the first response might not be the one you want to say. So let's, let's put a little bit of beat and I'll do the same.

459
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I'm going to do it again. This is what I asked you. I said, hey,

460
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: When do you find. You're really good. When are you at your best at solving problems. Don't say anything.

461
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That means, again, you're going back into the self, you're turning inward and you're remembering when you liked

462
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It, you were solving a problem like oh I'm good at this.

463
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When

464
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.730
Angelina C: I feel like a lot of work. I've accomplished because it's something totally different than nursing my deal with the money and stuff.

465
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:32.490
Angelina C: So I feel it's taken me a lot longer to learn to, I don't know why, but that's where I feel proud of myself where I I am making accomplishments that I can do it, you know.

466
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, I haven't heard it quite yet.

467
00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking for an environment. So I think I heard something. Let me check it out when it's new. I like solving new things. I like learning a new skill.

468
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That would work.

469
00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

470
00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:50.610
Angelina C: Yeah.

471
00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: learning something new and tell me a problem that you solve that you're proud of when you were at work recently that you solved it, and you're you liked it. You like oh, look how smart I am. I'm so old. I pulled this resource. And this one I knew just what to do. I like me.

472
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:17.370
Angelina C: I just did that yesterday because of my drawer. I was only 17 cents off and I'm the one that always has been screwing up the drawers.

473
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:31.770
Angelina C: To close it and I done it every night. And so I feel very proud of myself that I've come this far. It's taken me a minute, but I'm proud of myself for solving that like getting through it without having. Anybody else have to help me.

474
00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I kept my drawer almost exact yeah

475
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.060
Angelina C: Yeah.

476
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Not $1 over not $1 $20 over under only by 17 cents. Okay.

477
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you do that.

478
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:57.960
Angelina C: I I I I you know I stayed by my draw. I worked my draw a lot last night, instead of cleaning as much as I still not feeling too good, but

479
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:03.390
Angelina C: I just did my drawer all night and I just made sure I was on it because nobody else like this one girl.

480
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:09.720
Angelina C: That was there last night. Like, don't touch my door, but she could. It's okay to touch mine. So I was like, you're not touching my door either kind of thing like

481
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:23.370
Angelina C: You want the same respect and respect other people with their drawer. So I just pretty much stayed on my drawer and I closed down my drawer last night just fine. I still proud of myself for the first time I didn't need any help or anything.

482
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You realize the state by it.

483
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That ruled out. Anybody else messing with the money so that you could rule out whether it's your accounting and things like that. Do you to do anything else that you're aware of, to make sure that that door was on point.

484
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:47.760
Angelina C: I'm just, I just pretty much and I put like you're supposed to make $100 step before the night and I had plenty to do that.

485
00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:59.520
Angelina C: I had seven safe drops last night. So that's how you know usually have three or four. So I had seven safe drops. So I was on my dress register like almost all night. So that's what's nice, you know,

486
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:04.350
Angelina C: Usually, you'll have one or two drops. If you're working both registers at night.

487
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna give you an example of what I was searching for just now. You said

488
00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I count back every single time.

489
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I count back. I have a system they give me 20 I count back. Okay. It was 465-466-6768 and here's five years 10 years 20 I haven't routine. I do it exactly the same way account back to them every single time.

490
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And that way I have a double check to make sure I'm checking not only when I did it over here at the register, then I make them hear it go. I'm actually counting it backwards. That's what I was expecting to hear

491
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I was trying to see if you're aware of what you're doing or how you've accomplished being able to get your door straight like that with all of those drops, which is a really hard thing to do.

492
00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I was curious to see if you knew incrementally, some of the cool things that you're doing to make sure that your drop is on point.

493
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You see an example, good one or two counting money back better. I usually carry my hand and then just hand it to them. But that's a good idea to to make sure

494
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point was to do an investigation about how you are success.

495
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We ended up dipping into oh I tend to retaliate, a little bit to two people. We did you see how so many things are connected for you that I wonder how you

496
00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Solve problems. How you stay focused.

497
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You do it.

498
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:40.470
Angelina C: I do stay focused.

499
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.580
Angelina C: But I noticed myself all over the place to

500
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You do.

501
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:46.350
Angelina C: You do. Oh, yeah.

502
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:51.600
Angelina C: Like, somebody asked me something at work. I'm like, ah, like what did they just say like, you know,

503
00:54:52.590 --> 00:55:03.660
Angelina C: So yeah i or sometimes I hear not the same way that I guess I want them to say it, I guess. I don't know. I don't know what it is but yeah that's been something been going on for a little bit that I've noticed

504
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And your whole life for this is a recent thing.

505
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:12.240
Angelina C: Um, no, because I was really good. It's just been like the last

506
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:21.510
Angelina C: Time eight years, I've noticed I've been kind of especially last year was the worse for me. But yeah, okay.

507
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing something to still accomplish keeping this job, those doors so that

508
00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You're working very hard to make that happen. And you have every reason to be proud of it because your mind drifts off to curious things that are somewhat connected to something and I imagine it's quite a task to stay

509
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Counting while you might be talking with a customer, you have a chance of kind of miss counting and

510
00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:56.850
Angelina C: Yeah.

511
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't do it. You stayed focused

512
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:00.690
Angelina C: Yeah.

513
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:02.760
Angelina C: Makes sense.

514
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicely done.

515
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.730
Angelina C: Yeah, cool.

516
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So one thing you can do. I'm

517
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying, let's put a little beat in there in between a question or response. What you might decide to do is repeat someone's question.

518
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're at, and that gives time for you to think through, and repeat sort of a wizard. This woman's asking me, I'm going to say it out loud, not the first thing that comes to mind. But I'm going to get in the habit of repeating. So you want me to go check the

519
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Drawers

520
00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Go check and see if I have to repeat the question so we might do that in here to you might repeat what I said. And we get to check out if we hurt each other.

521
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's one thing we could do.

522
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.850
Okay.

523
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: slow you down a little bit and you just rehearsed the question right, then you might stay

524
00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.000
Angelina C: On the phone.

525
00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see you want me to go clear out the back instead your mind might go to. That's not fair. So the guy was doing it, you should remember. But that's not what the question was. You want ready. You're off the back

526
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

527
00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: All these other things that are connected to that neural network to that question.

528
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be something you could play with

529
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:28.530
Angelina C: That's I'm surprised you notice that because I noticed it, too. And at first I thought I was going crazy. And then now it's true, though I see it too.

530
00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.450
Angelina C: So,

531
00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason why

532
00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We've moved around a lot.

533
00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, will be difficult.

534
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: To accomplish anything and I would venture to say

535
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Impossible. If we can't pick something to focus our undivided attention on we weren't able to accomplish it today. It doesn't mean we won't be able to do in the future, though.

536
00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So I kind of let you leave you wandered into different networks kind of moving around and two different topics.

537
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But let me see what it was like for you.

538
00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't know. It's different for me than you well.

539
00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:10.170
Angelina C: It was, I know I was all it I could tell I was all over the place.

540
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you have that that we have a part of our brain called the insula, believe it or not, it's so cool. We have literally a part of our brain.

541
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That that is created and works so that we can actually look inward, we can feel how our body feels and we can self reflect. It's a separate place that's really a neat thing to know.

542
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have that intact. You can see the self.

543
00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But can you catch it. Can you intervene. Can you inhibit an impulse. That's what I wonder

544
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see it as it's happening. But can you stop yourself.

545
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you inhibit I wonder

546
00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:54.480
Angelina C: I'll work on it this week I'm going to stop and think before and try it and see how it works.

547
00:58:55.200 --> 00:59:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Or or don't just whatever it's all about whether something's adaptive for you or not. But let's just see what else happens. So you said just now, I noticed I was all over.

548
00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe some other things happen to give yourself permission to kind of tracks through you know maybe as this, this little mini movie were happening in front of you walk it all the way through, see if you have a memory.

549
00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Of some of the things we did in the early part. See if you can see it, see if your memories intact in that way. Can you see other things that happen.

550
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:29.940
Angelina C: Yeah, okay, what do you almost want to say like dysfunctional almost

551
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.250
Angelina C: But you know what I mean.

552
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a judgment worried about it.

553
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.580
Yeah.

554
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Which part seem dysfunctional to you.

555
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:50.910
Angelina C: Just kind of been all over the place. Oh, like when you asked me someone's kind of like, Oh my God, yeah. Yeah, I see what you're coming from them.

556
00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But does it work for you.

557
00:59:55.050 --> 01:00:01.470
Angelina C: Yeah, because I get it out like I think I've held it in for so many years that when I finally get it out, you know,

558
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:08.820
Angelina C: If it's just getting it out because I don't think I've gotten it out, I guess.

559
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:10.590
Angelina C: I don't think so. I just

560
01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:14.970
Angelina C: Double it just try to get it all out in one thing and it doesn't work that way.

561
01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So, but that's really important because for a lot of people. It's not if they don't want us to their stories. They just want the healing.

562
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: For you it might be that we take some sessions and you just talk about what happened. Your mom witnessing that you just talk about how this infidelities

563
01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: has affected you and I just sort of contain it and give you that space there might be some sessions where that's what we do. Is that going to be okay, where you

564
01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:50.010
Angelina C: may know Rebecca started that, too.

565
01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:58.770
Angelina C: I could, I didn't talk to her for a week or something that I come back in and just, just like we wait slow down a little bit. I'm trying to get it all, but I come back and be like,

566
01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:14.760
Angelina C: Just trying so hard just to get everything out that happened because there's times that I couldn't talk because they he was here or we'd be in the car together writing to Albuquerque like on Valentine's. We were all that's the day it happened on Valentine's so so

567
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know that it will feel therapeutic for you to actually vent.

568
01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: may not come away with

569
01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Level to get to certain exercises that you're going to be okay with that. Sometimes, is that right

570
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.990
Angelina C: Okay. Sounds good.

571
01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm asking you, making sure that's okay.

572
01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.830
Angelina C: Yeah yeah

573
01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, because I love hearing people's stories, I love to understand it, but I don't want you to come away thinking, well, all I did was done it, and I didn't get anything from this, so I'm checking in to see if this is going to meet your need.

574
01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.850
Angelina C: Yeah, maybe every now and then I did it to Rebecca, a couple Jessica couple times.

575
01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

576
01:01:56.070 --> 01:02:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's schedule another time. Um, let's see I already have a little to their sweet spot. Now we're going to keep moving around hopping around a little bit here. So you think about your schedule.

577
01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:16.560
Angelina C: I can do anything in the mornings really I don't know when I'm off next week, but I don't usually go to work till now.

578
01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:18.810
Angelina C: At two, so

579
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:22.170
I'm

580
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:25.980
A little

581
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:29.220
Can't

582
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: See anything. The only thing that I see right now, doesn't mean there won't be cancellations, but right now the only thing I see a really early morning like six in the morning, so

583
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're welcome to. I'm happy to do it, but I'm assuming you're not up that early

584
01:02:47.520 --> 01:03:00.570
Angelina C: Well, it just, it doesn't. I mean, if that's what we have to make the right now we can do that because I've. I'm going to start still doing groups with you guys, but on Friday. I'm going to go switch over, just for the med part. Okay.

585
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just check in real quick. And is that because you let me list the ones you can attend with I prefer strongly strength work with my clients that are in group to

586
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.610
Angelina C: So let me

587
01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: They are I have nine Monday nine in the morning.

588
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I have one o'clock on Monday I have 7am on Tuesday.

589
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.370
Angelina C: Let's try a nine o'clock on. Oh, but that's the group.

590
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a group

591
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:46.350
Angelina C: Okay, yeah, I'm gonna play stick which I don't. It doesn't matter. Excuse me, whichever one it which everyone thinks, because I know Mondays are really full so it doesn't matter. I don't mind doing Mondays. I already have it set in my phone is it

592
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What's changing what's feeling different is your work schedule changing

593
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:58.170
Angelina C: No, I'm just, I'm I get when I usually go to work, say sometimes my meds. Don't get called in.

594
01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:11.460
Angelina C: At that time, so I have to end it's okay because you're out. You pick them up the next day or something, but it's just a pharmacy ours aren't meeting with mine. So when I go like, if I go before work or something. They're not ready. I have to wait till the next day.

595
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.780
Angelina C: And that's not really a

596
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:13.980
Angelina C: Problem, but

597
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it is. This is part of your valuing and respecting yourself right now this has to do

598
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And in this program.

599
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you've been pretty darn careful about our appointments so far, you've been communicating and when something went sideways, you showed up here. You didn't blow me off. So that means to me. I think I can do this. I

600
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: First let me finish the other appointments. I just want to finish so I can hear myself say Monday 9am 1pm Tuesday 7am Thursday 11am Friday 12pm. Those are available to you. The other thought is this

601
01:04:53.250 --> 01:05:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I can ask the physician to always add one more day, which means you show up to group, let's say nine o'clock and you know you already have one to cover you.

602
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: For that day. It's not that you're short one. That means you could go that night. That means you move on to the next morning. Does that make sense you could have that one extra day

603
01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:19.200
Angelina C: That's fine. I like yeah

604
01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:33.090
Angelina C: I the campaign is what I really, that's why I don't want to leave you guys. That's why I want to stay with you guys. So I'm going to stay with you guys for group and counseling, but I'll just get my meds in my because even to get over here try core every time I go with the problem.

605
01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:33.960
Angelina C: So,

606
01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm still missing something. I apologize. Something still missing. What's the real crux of the problem with the medicine you want it once a month, or I'm trying to tell what

607
01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:57.360
Angelina C: Not well no, it's it she's just going to do two weeks at a time because I've been in it for so long that if I like I guess my example is, is that say if I run out. I'm okay.

608
01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:07.410
Angelina C: Do you see what I'm saying. But if I have those week one, sometimes I run out, or we go to Albuquerque. And I don't get my meds till Monday or Sunday. So it's just been an odd thing. Yeah.

609
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it that bright heart health physicians, the most I've ever given you is two weeks and that doesn't work for you. Try for will do something like 30 days. Is that what you're saying.

610
01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:24.090
Angelina C: Yeah, but they because we were doing two weeks here and then he went back down to a week. So I don't know.

611
01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. My guess is that's because

612
01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You are new here with me. So I think that's an easy fix, okay, you're okay with two weeks. All I have to do is tell the doctor 99.9% of the time he's gonna listen to me.

613
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:54.120
Angelina C: And I've always taken men here to the doctors to to let her count, like, you know, I have my meds there for her to count so she was like, I'll take you on board right away, but I will just what, that's what I was talking to you guys before I just wanted to make sure it was okay.

614
01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you want to do if you're back to two weeks and then eventually, maybe even next month. Go to go to monthly or three weeks or something, would you continue

615
01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, then that's that's an easy fix. It's

616
01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:14.160
Angelina C: Can I still get drug test your first choice or do I need to go to the tricor

617
01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That's out of my

618
01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.930
Angelina C: Okay, I started out of mine because I think that

619
01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:26.070
Angelina C: That's a hard time I'm having to is to the to the lab or I go right before work and they don't have my paper.

620
01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you just do a cup like I don't know why.

621
01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:38.700
Angelina C: They said they've sent me one. I haven't received it still in the one they did sent me. I didn't know my mailbox was closed at one time. So they got it sent back, otherwise I would have just been waiting for it in the mail.

622
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So that will change. Once again, this isn't going to this tricor thing or whatever this lab screening is forever.

623
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Shoot, I forgot my next client just showed up.

624
01:07:52.560 --> 01:08:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Next to. Sorry, I'm going to text you and we'll work out a plan for our next appointment. But if you're open to six o'clock I have the 13th open little texture and see if really, you can do that.

625
01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.350
Angelina C: Okay, yeah. Just keep in touch.

626
01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:08.130
Angelina C: All right, well, my boss is calling me

627
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, bye.

628
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.130
Angelina C: Thank you so much.

629
01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

630
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me.

631
01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Howdy. Howdy. Howdy.

632
01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's give it a try. Let's take those

633
01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:02.310
Gordan Ortega: Need a second just open up a note here for us.

634
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But in the meantime, you could tell me a little bit. If you've been in treatment before, if so, where you went.

635
01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:18.390
Gordan Ortega: To Santa Fe recovery twice. I'm just for a week long detox, you know,

636
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're kind of funny and group, you've got a good personality that's going to be

637
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.670
Gordan Ortega: You

638
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like I like joking around. I mean, it's serious business. But we got to have a sense of humor.

639
01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.800
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, definitely.

640
01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, okay. Well, that was a short story. I thought you'd be telling me a longer story and I could keep opening up this document. That's it.

641
01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:45.450
Gordan Ortega: No role is just to

642
01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Treatment know a know any you don't have a new sponsor, nothing like that.

643
01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:59.160
Gordan Ortega: Nothing like that. I'm actually in the process of looking into a different one. But it's kind of hard process to

644
01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:09.690
Gordan Ortega: Get into them and stuff like that. So I'm supposed to call back tomorrow to talk to the lady and see if there's any openings. There are boy, boy.

645
01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And that. Yeah, I think that's a residential

646
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:16.320
Gordan Ortega: Yes, and

647
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:18.810
Gordan Ortega: So in the cold in New Mexico.

648
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I feel like I've maybe talk to them, but there's a waiting list. So are you already on the waiting list.

649
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:25.800
Yes.

650
01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And they said, It's, what, three weeks, two weeks, how long

651
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.340
Gordan Ortega: Like two weeks, three weeks.

652
01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me something. When was your last use of a short acting opiate which includes heroin. Was it like a couple days ago, like how far back.

653
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:50.880
Gordan Ortega: prior to getting on this program so

654
01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.100
Gordan Ortega: At least a couple weeks.

655
01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:58.020
Gordan Ortega: I think it was February.

656
01:11:59.040 --> 01:11:59.970
Gordan Ortega: 6 maybe

657
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I asked because for some people, there's, it's sort of a sign when they're going through the right the diarrhea and vomiting and stuff. They're dope sick, so I'm just checking in just a light.

658
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:15.870
Gordan Ortega: No, no. Well, we know right. We can't tell, it's the same. Yeah.

659
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:16.710
Gordan Ortega: Totally

660
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't tell. So I thought I'd ask for some people it's like, yeah, I gotta own it. I did. I did.

661
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But not for you got it. Okay, so this this session is going to be transcribed. So you're going to hear me say some really funky things I'm going to say please transcribe quite nice lifetime. Use the law. So that's what I'm up to

662
01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: help us get through this assessment.

663
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.530
Gordan Ortega: But before I

664
01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Get into it, you basically just told me you won't be here very long.

665
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:56.370
Gordan Ortega: Well, I mean, that's all depending on that. You know what I mean. So, but I'm

666
01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:58.950
Gordan Ortega: Hoping not. Yeah.

667
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What makes you think you need a residential treatment. Tell me, tell me, tell me about

668
01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:05.760
Gordan Ortega: Um,

669
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:19.110
Gordan Ortega: I kind of just to get more of the time under my belt into get any more of the support and also because I'm having some legal issues to that. I'm hoping that if I go in through over there that I could

670
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.130
Gordan Ortega: Instead of, I mean, I could have

671
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.660
Gordan Ortega: Made it

672
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:31.410
Gordan Ortega: I could do the same amount of time over in a residential program and get

673
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.370
Gordan Ortega: Or end up going to jail for that same amount of time.

674
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:40.140
Gordan Ortega: And then it'll, it'll kill two birds with one stone. Hopefully, and help me.

675
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:43.200
Gordan Ortega: With everything else in sobriety instant

676
01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so there's a possibility. We won't be working together very long. I want to throw something else out there.

677
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.110
Gordan Ortega: Yes. Okay. Yes.

678
01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If you do

679
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously, tell us you can text me, even if it's like a last minute thing, just let me know, because then I'll

680
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: See you and will think, oh, we're going to just charge him. But if I know that you're in a residential program, I can enact debate, your case. And I can tell people I can say, okay, Doc. This is what's going on. And when he gets out

681
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.180
Gordan Ortega: Then he'll her to resume treatment. Cool.

682
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and then you don't have to go through all of these assessments again.

683
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:31.650
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you very much.

684
01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, and I think that might be a good fit, I'm that. So let's operate on that, that that would down the line that might be the case. And what we can do, would be kind of neat.

685
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is we can get releases of information if you want to. That's completely up to you. But that means that when you're there. Say you wanted me

686
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:51.720
Gordan Ortega: Or the docking record and

687
01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a conversation just to say, How's he doing

688
01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.020
Gordan Ortega: I have no problem with that.

689
01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we could do that. So, all right, let's go ahead and then we're going to go for it will go ahead and do this assessment today them. So the reason for the visit.

690
01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the initial evaluation great will do hope your independence. Yep.

691
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And onset. So we're going to be spending the first little bit of time.

692
01:15:18.690 --> 01:15:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: talking only about opiates. I'm going to get into the other substances, the other mood altering substances afterwards. But first, we're just going to compartmentalize and talk about the opiates.

693
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going to sound like this age of first use progression.

694
01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And at its worst, how much were you doing. And when was the last year. So you're going to hear that over and over and over and over. I'm going to be doing that same kind of questions for all the different substances. So how old were you when you first had an opiate

695
01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:54.120
Gordan Ortega: plenty for probably 18

696
01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what was it,

697
01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:03.390
Gordan Ortega: Just a second. Sorry.

698
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:24.720
Gordan Ortega: I'm still here. Sorry.

699
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.130
You have children.

700
01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:29.850
Gordan Ortega: I have two children, but not here.

701
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:40.050
Gordan Ortega: Um, so I was, I guess, has first taking percocet at that age, and then the progress.

702
01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, at its worst, how much were you doing

703
01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.290
Gordan Ortega: Percocet.

704
01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:47.280
Yeah.

705
01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.690
Gordan Ortega: I was doing 30 percocet 30 day code on 30

706
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.880
Gordan Ortega: For how many months, there's a lot

707
01:16:55.050 --> 01:17:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Of years, sir. So, oh, you just said something. How many years.

708
01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:08.220
Gordan Ortega: Four years but not at 18. I mean, when I was a teen only taking like port five here and there. You know what I mean.

709
01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:13.050
Gordan Ortega: So until I was like 3029 or something that I

710
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's 29. Did you do it for

711
01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: 29 up until recently. So the purpose sets at that at that. How many years are you doing that amount.

712
01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:33.720
Gordan Ortega: I was probably doing it from 27 to

713
01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:39.570
Gordan Ortega: 26 to 28 okay and then

714
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:44.610
Gordan Ortega: Yeah. And then I switched to heroin.

715
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:52.560
Gordan Ortega: And I did that for two years until I went to prison. And when I was 3233

716
01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And were you using in prison.

717
01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:01.890
Gordan Ortega: A couple times, but for the most part, no.

718
01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple times. You mean months at a time or literally I

719
01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Had noodles whole time, like, Tell me, what do you mean by times

720
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.270
Gordan Ortega: I mean, there was

721
01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:20.220
Gordan Ortega: Maybe two to three weeks total in the three years that I was using anything

722
01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.140
Got it.

723
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And IV use

724
01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: For the years

725
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you using intravenously starting what we know.

726
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.560
Gordan Ortega: Now, I started off smoking and then I

727
01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.500
Gordan Ortega: Started using it.

728
01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said your kids are not here.

729
01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.150
Gordan Ortega: No, they live with their moms are one with his grandparents and one of his mom.

730
01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.290
Right.

731
01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And at its worst, how much her. When were you doing

732
01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:15.750
Gordan Ortega: I'm smoking. I was doing almost a half ounce a day. But in the grill as well.

733
01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you had any intentional or accidental overdoses.

734
01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:26.850
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, I've had to

735
01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Accidental or on purpose.

736
01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.570
Accidental

737
01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Did either both results in hospitalization.

738
01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:37.170
Gordan Ortega: One of them did.

739
01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: When was that

740
01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.350
Gordan Ortega: Just in December or January 2019

741
01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And they treated you and just charge the same day.

742
01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Ever accidentally or intentionally had fentanyl

743
01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.370
Gordan Ortega: Yes.

744
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: When was that when did you, was it recreational

745
01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:12.090
Gordan Ortega: Um, I mean I had it when I

746
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:19.230
Gordan Ortega: ended up in the hospital for counter reaction to no proxy and they put me on the fentanyl patch and then prior to that I

747
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:25.320
Gordan Ortega: Had said no pills or heroin, that was sent little based

748
01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: When was what, how old were you let's do it that way. How will we this

749
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:38.700
Gordan Ortega: Um, I guess the fentanyl is something that I was seeing just when I came out of prison so

750
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.300
Gordan Ortega: Then relapse. So probably the last year and a half.

751
01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To put to like

752
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.680
Gordan Ortega: Age.

753
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Three 334

754
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you like fentanyl like that is not appealing.

755
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To

756
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Any cradle you ever used any of that.

757
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:09.810
Gordan Ortega: Are used at one time to kick

758
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What your

759
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:16.800
Gordan Ortega: 2018

760
01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: How long did you stay on that.

761
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:21.540
Gordan Ortega: I just took it one day.

762
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:28.830
Gordan Ortega: Give me from the point for when I stopped using opiates to when I could take us boxing.

763
01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go into some other substances.

764
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Age of first use of cigarettes tobacco.

765
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.090
Gordan Ortega: 10 years old.

766
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the progression from age 10

767
01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:50.880
Gordan Ortega: Um, I guess I was a full on smoker, probably by the time I was 16

768
01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were smoking half a pack or a pack by 16

769
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.210
Gordan Ortega: Probably half a pack maybe

770
01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And currently, what's your smoking look like

771
01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:01.770
Gordan Ortega: A pocket it

772
01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Already is your first use of alcohol.

773
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And the progression from there. Was it every weekend every day.

774
01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:31.470
Gordan Ortega: I mean, I had a period in my life when I was 819 or 18 I was drinking all the time. But other than that, I have only been like a binge drinker sporadically but even then I don't even do that really anymore though. Okay.

775
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to a period of time. Looks like age 19 all the time. So it was every day to the point of maybe blacking out

776
01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:42.360
Gordan Ortega: Um,

777
01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.000
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, okay.

778
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: How many blackouts in your lifetime. If you had to give it a number

779
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:57.420
Gordan Ortega: I don't know, probably only about 10 and okay maybe

780
01:22:58.230 --> 01:22:59.790

Gwenevere Abriel: And

855
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This was what, when are we thinking this happened. How old were you at this

856
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.580

860
01:28:55.770 --> 01:29:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Last us looks like to six, we got that. Okay, let's go over to

861
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Stimulants

862
01:29:04.650 --> 01:29:07.020

Gordan Ortega: Holly 16

864
01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the progression from there.

865
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.520
Gordan Ortega: I'm

866
01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.960
Gordan Ortega: doing quite a bit at that age, maybe

867
01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:30.660
Gordan Ortega: Maybe a quarter ounce a week and then it progressed to smoking crack eventually when I was older and

868
01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:32.880
Gordan Ortega: I haven't done that.

869
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's nice. You're kind of getting the groove of this this this pattern of freshening

870
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:39.210
Or

871
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay. Yeah, so forth. I'm a week. And so I kind of want to get a sense of the time period when it hit progress to crack about how old are you, is this the 26 to

872
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:59.520
Gordan Ortega: Know, I think I was already had tried to play like 918 or 19

873
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were doing it weekly though, I kind of want to know that period of time.

874
01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.880
Gordan Ortega: around that age 1819

875
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.500

876
01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And last year's

877
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you identify as your drug of choice. Like, for some people, even though they're in this program on the northeast, they don't identify as that being their choice for a lot of people, it's

878
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's math or it's something else. Or it's alcohol or something. I'll call for you, obviously. But what is your drug of choice.

879
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:49.320
Gordan Ortega: Probably heroin and meth mine. Okay, got it.

880
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we touched on actually those two. So that's right where we are. Let's go to the to the math right now. When did you first try that.

881
01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.290
Gordan Ortega: In 2012

882
01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:04.920

Gwenevere Abriel: After tried it.

884
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.760

01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:17.250
Gordan Ortega: fluctuated much

886
01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Much

887
01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:38.970
Gordan Ortega: It's worth doing three grams a day maybe

888
01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And last year's

889
01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.320

929
01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:34.950

02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:43.710
Gordan Ortega: I'm

1240
02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Not sure if I on that number.

1241
02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: On the self esteem. Okay, now. Oh.

1242
02:03:02.610 --> 02:03:03.540
So Jordan.

1243
02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a therapist, not your counselor, not going to tell you how to live your life. Can't do it. You know how to live your life. Okay, I'm going to show up here when we schedule.

1244
02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to give you an opportunity to have some therapeutic opportunity, whether it's inner personal or I might offer particular exercises that we could do.

1245
02:03:29.490 --> 02:03:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This type of therapy tends to work if you end up doing some big experiments like on your own. When you and I are not meeting, like let's say I teach you something, or we come up with a particular mantra.

1246
02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If you end up doing the exercises on your own. This this process works better.

1247
02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:51.360
Okay.

1248
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So about. I can't tell you what to do. I mean, this is your life, you're going to, you're going to live it your way. But the whale phrase things as well say

1249
02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to invite you to consider this or that you have a choice, little shot or you don't. Okay, but I'm not going to tell you what to do. That's

1250
02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:12.360
Gordan Ortega: Not me.

1251
02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact, I haven't even introduced myself.

1252
02:04:15.810 --> 02:04:16.470
Gordan Ortega: I just sort of

1253
02:04:17.190 --> 02:04:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Into this. I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist. I've had my license for about 20 years here in Florida and New Mexico, it'll be three years in June.

1254
02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have been drawn to this field of substance abuse.

1255
02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost immediately just seeing it in so many families on it just seemed like here was my family on here was this couple and here was alcohol or here was this drug.

1256
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just seemed like there was a lot of it there and I became very curious and wanted to know more about it.

1257
02:04:50.490 --> 02:05:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I use the phone only for scheduling doesn't mean you guys can send me messages. Let's say you were in distress member I told you, I want you to be able to reach out to me if you start to have suicidal thoughts. I want you to be able to reach out to me so you can be

1258
02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm freaking out.

1259
02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Or like, like a an emoji. That's like a freaked out and you can you can send it to me, but I'm not going to do psychotherapy through a text that's just like, not going to happen.

1260
02:05:20.490 --> 02:05:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's too precious what you're going through is too important. And I'm going to want to meet with you in here in zoom

1261
02:05:26.610 --> 02:05:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So my text back might feel cold, but I'm not intending to adjust. I need to come in here and meet with you. OK. OK. I love the phone for scheduling. Notice how we've been able to go back and forth around when we meet, I want to continue to be

1262
02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Able to

1263
02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That so schedule appointments, often from them. The night before, if I can remember I'm pretty good at it, though. But sometimes I'll forget doesn't mean we're not meeting. It just means I forgot to send out a little message to folks.

1264
02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Really important is

1265
02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:03.930
Your goals.

1266
02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Not what I want for you, but I want to help you with what you want in your life and you just think about the substance. See this part of it. What is your goal.

1267
02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:19.170
Gordan Ortega: To be clean.

1268
02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:21.360
Clean

1269
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Clean like off of what

1270
02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:26.670
Gordan Ortega: Off of everything.

1271
02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:31.110
Gordan Ortega: So,

1272
02:06:31.170 --> 02:06:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If I right. I want to leave.

1273
02:06:35.490 --> 02:06:35.910
Gordan Ortega: Off.

1274
02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Every, everything, but we'd. Does that sound like it's as close to exact as possible.

1275
02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:45.000
Gordan Ortega: Yes.

1276
02:06:46.230 --> 02:06:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And now thinking about. Remember we were talking earlier about having self harm thoughts. That's dipping into depression. That's dipping into thoughts and feelings that's in that mental health.

1277
02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Portion and that's where you and I will do much of our work. Now what I don't know is I don't know the depression piece has a lot to do with coming off of an amphetamine which, of course, everybody's going to be depressed all

1278
02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: This has to do with something else. But when you think about what one of your goals is when it comes to mental health. Maybe it's I want to go back to school or

1279
02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to eat better, or I want to stop having panic attacks or it might be. I want to learn new coping skills, but for you. How would you define what a goal is when it comes to your sort of psycho spiritual

1280
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:50.100
Gordan Ortega: Um, I think just becoming independent financially and as far as

1281
02:07:51.150 --> 02:07:51.690
Gordan Ortega: I'm

1282
02:07:53.250 --> 02:08:00.240
Gordan Ortega: Work and living situations and independent in independent from the diction and stuff will

1283
02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:04.590
Gordan Ortega: Be what will help my mental health and all that.

1284
02:08:06.090 --> 02:08:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So you really see

1285
02:08:07.170 --> 02:08:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This course of your challenge very much on

1286
02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The drug

1287
02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, that's fantastic. So let's, um, you did great.

1288
02:08:23.850 --> 02:08:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not, hard assessment. It wasn't kidding. Pause

1289
02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, we did great. So we don't want you to do it again. So when you do go into hoy, make sure you let me know so that we can get shipping.

1290
02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's pick another time to meet the first 30 days.

1291
02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to feel kind of intense. I will be meeting every week more I might be able to carve out time, but it would be really early morning or possibly on a weekend. I'm got this sort of full schedule right now and it's been a bit of a challenge to find time

1292
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm really glad you made it today because it would be a challenge. I mean,

1293
02:09:05.790 --> 02:09:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, let's see. So again, for these first 30 days, and if it turns out you're only with us for a couple weeks. I understand.

1294
02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's let's keep these appointments, let me know 24 hours in advance if you don't think you're going to make it. I'm an independent contractor, so I don't earn a living. When you're not here.

1295
02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't book anyone if if I don't hear maybe the day before so want to kind of

1296
02:09:31.290 --> 02:09:33.390
Gordan Ortega: Really good those commitments.

1297
02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I very rarely. Okay.

1298
02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll just show up for you guys, I'll be here.

1299
02:09:57.450 --> 02:09:57.810
Gordan Ortega: Do you

1300
02:09:57.990 --> 02:10:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Have on the horizon, some work that you're planning on doing and I can be looking ahead to be thinking

1301
02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, he's going to want this time spot. Should I be kind of looking ahead and be thinking, oh, he's gonna like this wanted it eight in the morning or 10 in the morning or 12 like what tends to be a time you think you might want down the line.

1302
02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:23.490
Gordan Ortega: I'm cry for now. Later in the day until I start working just because I

1303
02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:26.190
Gordan Ortega: Tend to stay up late and sleeping later so

1304
02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I have other commitments in the second half of the day so I can carve out time in the first part, but it's it's almost impossible for me to go in the second half.

1305
02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Of my other obligations, but but but we're meeting now. And so we might be able to do that again.

1306
02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This next week is just a real challenge.

1307
02:10:58.770 --> 02:11:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: About one o'clock on March 12

1308
02:11:04.290 --> 02:11:04.890
Gordan Ortega: That'll work.

1309
02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And which group are you and again

1310
02:11:12.330 --> 02:11:12.990

02:11:23.490 --> 02:11:23.880
Change.

Gwenevere Abriel: How about we meet

1315
02:11:33.150 --> 02:11:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what to do.

1316
02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll make an exception. Just let's do this next Monday, which is coming right up. Let's meet march 9 at

Gordan Ortega: Text me

1319
02:11:56.430 --> 02:12:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay, because this is this is rough. This is really going to be hard late in the day like this for me.

1320
02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:13.290
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, just text me if you can do it sooner than that. And if it has to be the morning I mean there's days when I am I'm up early, like that. You know what I mean, it's just

1321
02:12:13.710 --> 02:12:15.150
Gordan Ortega: Yeah, I don't want to be. Yeah.

1322
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and will, if you do, again, once again, if you start to have that negative thinking. Please don't be shy.

You want to be able to

1326
02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, his medication tied to today, meaning. Are you out of Suboxone and I messaged your physician and say he showed up for his appointment.

Gordan Ortega: I mean, I'm, I'm out. But I see her tomorrow so i i think tomorrow. Okay.

1328
02:12:53.550 --> 02:13:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's about right. It should be bridge between each session just for a little while, that won't last forever. Once you kind of really get him in the therapy that'll change. Okay.
