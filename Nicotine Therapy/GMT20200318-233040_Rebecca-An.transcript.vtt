28
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.990
Christine Imperial: These last this last month, I believe.

29
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.650
Christine Imperial: The Lord knew what he was doing, you know,

30
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.640
Yeah.

31
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.740
Christine Imperial: Yeah.

32
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.340
A

33
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doctor Dr kindle just

34
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Told me that you missed group last night.

35
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:08.910
Christine Imperial: Yes, I did. And that was actually because I didn't realize because I've got a government phone and you're only a lot it so many megabytes of data.

36
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.350
Christine Imperial: And I realized that I was out of data and now was actually on the road.

37
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:27.270
Christine Imperial: With my son, trying to get everything situated for tomorrow. And by the time I got back to my son's house. Who's got Wi Fi.

38
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.980
Christine Imperial: I tried to go to the admissions meeting room and

39
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.950
Christine Imperial: Nobody would answer. So I finally called the Anthony like about 530 maybe

40
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.420
Christine Imperial: Okay. Yeah. And then he

41
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.090
Christine Imperial: Said that he was going to

42
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.300
Christine Imperial: Try to get ahold of Dr. Kendall and find out if she was able to kind of squeeze me in today.

43
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.060
Christine Imperial: And so that's basically what happened. Yeah.

44
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:15.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, yeah. She just wanted me to make sure that you knew that, you know, it's that you got to be in group. So I'll let her know that it was an internet issue that you didn't have service where you were.

45
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.790
Christine Imperial: Bright right

46
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:33.510
Christine Imperial: Yeah, like I'm on the road if I'm not anywhere near Wi Fi right now. It's hard because I don't have data, you know, so I've used it up all this month, looking for apartments.

47
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, I'm glad you found one.

48
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.860
Christine Imperial: Yes, me too. And I've been actually waiting for these apartments for months I was put on a waiting list so

49
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm in. So, tomorrow is the big day starts right

50
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.300
Christine Imperial: Yes, uh huh.

51
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.560
Okay, good.

52
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's everything you have everything you need for your apartment or resources to be able to

53
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get what you need.

54
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:14.010
Christine Imperial: I'm hoping I'm hoping I'm my daughter in law kind of set me up for you know something for right now because all the food banks.

55
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:37.440
Christine Imperial: All the resources that I had in place are all in young going either shut down already or going into being shut down for two to the public at least you know there are employees that are working, but we are not allowed the public is not allowed there so

56
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.070
Christine Imperial: She set me up with, you know, like

57
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.880
Christine Imperial: A blow up bad and she

58
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.640
Christine Imperial: Blankets

59
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.750
Christine Imperial: The only thing I don't have as a TV, which is really going to say because I'm a TV tune

60
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.620
Yeah.

61
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.540
Christine Imperial: Yeah.

62
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What will you have your phone, you have internet access on your phone.

63
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.040
Christine Imperial: Well, I don't have any data so

64
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's a problem.

65
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.930
Yeah.

66
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.250
Christine Imperial: So I've got an old laptop.

67
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:30.420
Christine Imperial: That still got the little DVD thing on the side. So I'm hoping I can learn how to work this. That's what I was doing it when you came on. But yeah, so at least I'll have DVDs too much.

68
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good.

69
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then you'll move in tomorrow. And what about your utilities, you've got that all set in place.

70
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.880
Christine Imperial: Huh. There are included with the bread.

71
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good.

72
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.520
Yes.

73
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And How have things been going since you've been engaged with bright heart.

74
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:09.630
Christine Imperial: I'm good. Good. Um, I was building a little bit out of sorts, only because like I had talked when I talked to Dr. Kendall, it was

75
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:35.490
Christine Imperial: Maintenance basically I've been clean going on six years, August 27 to Martin six years, but I didn't where I was living because before this, the Section eight was supportive housing and supportive housing kind of falls under the county umbrella of community connections.

76
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:44.880
Christine Imperial: And they were paying 100% of my ramp. But then my name came up with the Section eight so they

77
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.140
Christine Imperial: Dropped me but they had me in what's what we call the war zone.

78
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.300
Christine Imperial: And so it was

79
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:06.180
Christine Imperial: Getting harder and harder to say no because a lot of the people that I dealt with.

80
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:24.450
Christine Imperial: Or either dealt with me. There's one main bus line which is on Central Avenue. And so, I mean, you would see everybody, or I would at least because I have to get on the bus and it's, I'm like,

81
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:42.870
Christine Imperial: 12 miles from where I do my na groups in and my recovery groups and stuff like that. So this main bus line. Yeah, I would see people all the time. So back in September.

82
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:59.850
Christine Imperial: I got involved with first choice, which is a clinic out here that dense that actually does Suboxone but they were like way on the other side of town, and if you

83
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.880
Christine Imperial: If you get off the main that main bus line.

84
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.560
Christine Imperial: They the buses only come by once an hour.

85
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.300
Christine Imperial: So, I mean, this was like

86
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.460
Christine Imperial: 22 miles out of what I mean. Outside of where I live.

87
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

88
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:33.900
Christine Imperial: Yeah, so we got really hard. So I started buying them and on the street and on the street. It was 25 milligrams and so

89
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:45.000
Christine Imperial: Yeah, I've been filming little bit bad but not to where I'm like really withdrawing. So that's a blessing to you know

90
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:53.490
Christine Imperial: I don't want to glove higher. I don't want you know i'm good where I'm at, you know, I don't, I don't want to get go any higher.

91
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.350
Said, how many

92
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many milligrams. Are you on

93
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.470
Christine Imperial: eight milligrams twice a day.

94
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good. Yeah. And you're taking it regularly.

95
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.430
Christine Imperial: Mm hmm. Yes.

96
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.450
Christine Imperial: Yes.

97
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.940
Christine Imperial: I actually took one in the morning and then right around this time I start

98
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:26.160
Christine Imperial: Building like the hot in the ears, you know, and in the back of the neck and so I'll take the other one. Around this time, and it'll carry me through the night.

99
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good, good, good, good. And how have you been dealing with are struggling with

100
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any anxiety or depression. Don't you been oh

101
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:46.500
Christine Imperial: Yeah, I mean, but I'm I've got social anxiety. Anyway, I've done half my life in prison you guild so

102
00:10:47.880 --> 00:11:00.900
Christine Imperial: I am diagnosed with social anxiety. So I really don't go anywhere. And lately. Just the anxiety level has been like really high. Just because you know being homeless and

103
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:25.740
Christine Imperial: I mean I got them me but they're like, again, you know, 2530 miles out of Albuquerque. So it's really hard for me to try to go and stay with my son's when everything is in in the city, you know. And so for me to even look for a place was really hard and we have a

104
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.040
Christine Imperial: We have just a minute solar

105
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:42.570
Christine Imperial: We have what's called the coast crisis team. And they're actually funded to a PD, which is the Albuquerque Police Department and

106
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:54.810
Christine Imperial: And it's it's it's funny to me because back in the day, I would never asked a PD for help, but they actually paid for a month.

107
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:11.250
Christine Imperial: I've been a month. I'm sorry, a week in a motel room when I first became homeless. At the end of December. So that was a blessing as well, you know, and from there. I've been couch surfing here and there and here and there.

108
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.730
Christine Imperial: Can you excuse me for just a minute. My dog is crying. She needs.

109
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:18.330
Christine Imperial: No pot.

110
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.200
Christine Imperial: Chili or Jen.

111
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:34.200
Christine Imperial: Can somebody let Sola out please she's crying. She probably needs to party bad and I'm on the phone with me one good

112
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.180

113
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.550
Christine Imperial: Service dogs.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:40.920

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:30.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: OK, so the whole time that you were going to that program. You didn't connect with any of the other Members, any other other women that you were in group with

171
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:45.360
Christine Imperial: Well, majority of them are either coming out of prison or jail or are on probation and parole or through the supportive housing.

172
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.470
Christine Imperial: Possible for women actually

175
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:24.810
Christine Imperial: You know, are like I said it Albuquerque. Seems like a big city, but it's really not. You know, you see the same people, same faces all the time. So, um, yeah, I did a lot of time with a lot of the women that were there and

176
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:36.690
Christine Imperial: Needless to say, a lot of them are surprised like because they everybody calls me imperial by my last name like imperial you think clean all this time, I'm like,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what do you think it's going to be like for you to be a little

192
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: After you get settled into your new place.

193
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.030

Christine Imperial: Well, when I, when I first got out.

197
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:43.290
Christine Imperial: The first three years of recovery. I went to work came home, went to work came home and so I really didn't go anywhere. I'm a homebody you know so

198
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.240
Christine Imperial: That's what keeps me safe and so

199
00:20:49.380 --> 00:21:04.620
Christine Imperial: If I can continue that I'll be okay you know and I know that's not really a good thing. You know, because even my sentence mom and nice get on the bus include from one side of town to the other and you get to talking to people meet people.

200
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.470
Christine Imperial: But I mean,

201
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:17.280

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.130
Christine Imperial: Don't like leave them but

207
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:53.520
Christine Imperial: Yeah, and it's not that I'm afraid of people you know what they can do to me. It's what I can do to people.

208
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:55.290

Christine Imperial: Damn, I'm not, I'm not good with people.

214
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about if you were to engage in self help meetings online.

215
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From home.

216
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.390

Christine Imperial: There's a prison etiquette and you're never asked questions you you know you pretty much if you can stay quiet and stay out of the mix year okay so throughout those years, you know, I've learned not to say anything.

299
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.140
Christine Imperial: Or not to ask questions.

300
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:42.300
Christine Imperial: That's, that's one of the things that, did I really do need and not just connect with with with people like me. You know what I mean.

301
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:42.960
Yeah.

302
00:29:44.190 --> 00:30:02.400
Christine Imperial: My son and I were just talking just the other day and I was like Cena gotta find that balance you know and and he's, he was the one that was closest to me. So he saw me at my worst and at my best. And I'm like, son.

303
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:21.960
Christine Imperial: I got to find that balance you know where you know sometimes you know sometimes people take my kindness for weakness and so I kind of be that, you know, excuse my language, bitch, you know, and so that they don't you know and so

304
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:34.440
Christine Imperial: I don't want to be that person because I remember a time when I wasn't, you know, and I wasn't that hard convict or whatever you want to call me so

305
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:48.870
Christine Imperial: I want to go back to that. But people don't let you you know so I got to kind of find that balance, you know, and that's another reason why I don't like to be in public, really, is because

306
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.740
Christine Imperial: Man, I could go from zero to 102.5

307
00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:09.270
Christine Imperial: And I don't like to be that the person anymore. I'm not the person anymore. You know, and so yeah communication. I think I need to be able to do

308
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:16.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. So that just gives us something to work on while you and I are working together.

309
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:23.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, you know, and just, you know, this is just, again, my from my point of view and

310
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My perspective is that you know your past is your past.

311
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:40.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That doesn't, you know, mean that that's who you are. So in my eyes. You're not Christine the conduct your esteem, the person

312
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:42.240
Right. I know.

313
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're a woman in recovery.

314
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

315
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:55.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That has completely changed her life. And so that's my view. All right. Just to let you know that like

316
00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:10.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I honestly, it doesn't bother me in any way, shape, or form that you are in prison or how long I like to hear people. I like to hear people's stories because it just shows me their strength.

317
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:23.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: rhino and allows me to see the things that they've kind of walked through a little bit in what end helps me figure out in what ways I can help them best, you know, while they're walking through this journey, you know,

318
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of amazing

319
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay. Okay.

320
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.100
Christine Imperial: There we go.

321
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:35.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so we're gonna be working on communication taking back your power and your voice.

322
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, right.

323
00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:45.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And being able to communicate with people in Minnesota manner. Right.

324
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And not an aggressive manner but assertive.

325
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.470
Christine Imperial: OK.

326
00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.000
Christine Imperial: So my past.

327
00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.880
Christine Imperial: I don't know the guys, I tell ya gotta find that middle

328
00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah okay alright so that's, you know, we have a game plan on what we're going to be working on.

329
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

330
00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the meantime, while we're working on it. Don't forget that it's really important that you go to group. And if you're not

331
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Able to go to group you make sure that you

332
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:25.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let them know so they don't count you as a no show or an out of compliance. You know how it works. You've been

333
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.910
Christine Imperial: You've been working with

334
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Outside providers so

335
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:41.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just make sure that you do that so that the doctor knows that you're you haven't fallen off and you're not, you know, struggling, but that you're having like this last time internet problems, you know,

336
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they can just kind of

337
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, help you along a monitor yet through this process. Okay.

338
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:57.780
Christine Imperial: Okay. And I also, I don't know if it's you. I need to speak to your or Dr. Kendall, but

339
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:10.110
Christine Imperial: I have not been able to go and do drum blood draw, only because everything here in Albuquerque is like shut down completely especially places like that.

340
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.830
Christine Imperial: Yeah, just humans and stuff like that been tried core

341
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.600
Christine Imperial: Is completely shut down.

342
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:31.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, I'll let her know I'm pretty sure that she's that I think all of our providers are aware that that any kind of services like that, that they're you know they need from the clients are going to be put on hold for a little bit because of what's going on.

343
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.850
Christine Imperial: So just to be did. Did you think that I was

344
00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:37.380
Christine Imperial: Non compliant as well.

345
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, understandable. Definitely.

346
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:51.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and make sure that when you move into your place that they have your new address so that they can send you paperwork and your you ways. Don't forget, you gotta do those us, they'll send them to

347
00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Send them to the through the mail if they're doing them through Brighton heart.

348
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:57.660
Okay.

349
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.850
Christine Imperial: And they do have my address because like I said at that I was moving in on the 16th. Okay.

350
00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. Have you done a UA through brighter yet.

351
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.460
Christine Imperial: No, it's

352
00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's very interesting.

353
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:21.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you know you'll get the you a cup in the mail and before you even open it you call the clinic.

354
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You call the virtual clinic that you talk to you before you got to me right and

355
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Somebody on video you show that you open it. Show them the bottle. You go to the bathroom, you come back and you show up. You just kind of hold the bottle up to the camera while they read it, read the temperature. It's really simple, you know,

356
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:50.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's kind of the process of a UA through bright heart and the great part about it is you have six years in recovery.

357
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.500
Christine Imperial: Right, you

358
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know what I mean.

359
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:59.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, you have this huge solid foundation. That's just, you know, really amazing.

360
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:06.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you been struggling with any kind of cravings or triggers in your head.

361
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:30.840
Christine Imperial: Um, lately. No, I'm before I got on with bright yellow. Yes, I was. That's one of the reasons why I started arm with first choice. And then I couldn't get used to them. And by that time I was already you know

362
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:48.540
Christine Imperial: Needing the Suboxone so I was starting to buy him on the street and of course I'm not trying to hustle. And I'm not trying to go back to jail or prison so I had to look for other clinics ever closer to me.

363
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.210
Christine Imperial: And they had like two months waiting lists. So

364
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.590

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.140
