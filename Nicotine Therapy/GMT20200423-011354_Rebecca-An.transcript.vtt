00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.710
Ethan Tuttle: Well, in some ways, I'm doing I'm not, I'm not like sober, but I'm

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.350
Ethan Tuttle: Other than that, I'm having a good day. I mean as good as I could expect

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you mentioned something in group. The other day that I wanted to touch base on

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that was your benzo blackout.

14
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.280
Ethan Tuttle: Um,

15
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What happened.

16
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hold on, I got close my door.

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

18
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.690
Ethan Tuttle: I'm not really sure. Like I go into this

19
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
Ethan Tuttle: Way. When I get him more than my worst shape. I'm kinda like, you know,

20
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.400
Ethan Tuttle: Taking different taking different pills to like so that I can focus for work and then I take them to that I fall asleep but then

21
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.210
Ethan Tuttle: There.

22
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.850
Ethan Tuttle: I don't know what it is but like maybe I'll get up and I'll take like a

23
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.910
Ethan Tuttle: Xanax or something.

24
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.250
Ethan Tuttle: And and then like a day will go by. It's like, I don't know what happened that day.

25
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.580
Ethan Tuttle: Some so that's

26
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.790
Ethan Tuttle: A that's a yeah that's a serious problem, but

27
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.410
Ethan Tuttle: Um,

28
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.380
Ethan Tuttle: It's funny, I think.

29
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.480
Ethan Tuttle: The

30
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.300
Ethan Tuttle: I came to started doing right heart. My ultimate goal is to get off of just all this stuff. And I don't want to

31
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:24.090
Ethan Tuttle: But, but I have two minds about that, obviously, because you know I can make a you can get I'm over getting on my knees and crying, and saying like, can we go be different tomorrow, but

32
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was fun. Good.

33
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.110
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, it could one thing that really absolutely worked was when I started going on.

34
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.510
Ethan Tuttle: The Suboxone and I wasn't getting high. And it seemed to reduce the cravings.

35
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.160
Ethan Tuttle: I don't want, you know, and I don't have any desire to stop doing that and start doing those drugs anymore. Some stole kind of tangled up in the

36
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.420
Ethan Tuttle: The anxiety meds and the

37
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.340
Ethan Tuttle: The like the

38
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.540
Ethan Tuttle: Where they call it Adderall.

39
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: ADHD meds.

40
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.560
Ethan Tuttle: ADHD meds. Yeah.

41
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So in giving you just a little bit of information, you know,

42
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm

43
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that Suboxone is is

44
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Has a little bit of opioids in it.

45
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:49.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so you taking Suboxone and you taking bentos and having these blackout periods is is a huge red flag. You know those two together are dangerous combination, you know that right yeah okay so if you black out and you take you know that before you blacked out. You took one

46
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.440
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah.

47
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My concern is, is that we don't know how many you've taken it during your blackout.

48
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.370
Ethan Tuttle: Right, I actually have a general idea.

49
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.330
Ethan Tuttle: But I'm

50
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.750
Ethan Tuttle: The. I mean, the problem is I just can't. I have to cut everything down to zero that

51
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.990
Ethan Tuttle: I'm struggling with cutting down the focus meds because it helps me so much their work and

52
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.930
Ethan Tuttle: You know, so

53
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.850
Ethan Tuttle: It's

54
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.790
Ethan Tuttle: When I play this story through my head. It's like, God, you know, it's like, I don't know what to do.

55
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:46.980
Ethan Tuttle: The pain meds were this thing I got into just as like a party thing and then like I'm over it. I started taking Suboxone that's that's totally effective the

56
00:04:49.410 --> 00:05:02.700
Ethan Tuttle: That are all stuff. I really have to work on this somehow because I've gotten to the point where I don't feel like I can be effect like I can work anymore unless I take something like that. That helps me focus

57
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:11.760
Ethan Tuttle: And so I have to get, get my it's like I have to undo that story in my mind and and then you know that soreness.

58
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.240
Ethan Tuttle: similar story for the the anxiety meds because

59
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.650
Ethan Tuttle: I

60
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:30.600
Ethan Tuttle: I can't have this unlimited supply of them, and where I'm like taking on taking them all the time where I'm partying. It's because it's a disaster. It's totally dangerous.

61
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:40.980
Ethan Tuttle: But on the other hand, they've been a lifesaver. And these really are in these major situations. So I'm reluctant to say like, no, I can you know

62
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.750
Ethan Tuttle: So it's like I'm all confused about what my goals.

63
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.780
Ethan Tuttle: Are you know what I mean.

64
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

65
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.330
Ethan Tuttle: I get much simpler if it was like, Okay, I just want to, you know, stop taking everything in your

66
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.810
Ethan Tuttle: It, you know, at least for

67
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.000
Ethan Tuttle: Obviously it's unrealistic.

68
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.880
Ethan Tuttle: Or it has been recently.

69
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think you need to pay attention to the costs and benefits of what you're doing really

70
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:27.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you you know might think that it's helping you productively. But isn't really when you're missing, you know, two, and three days.

71
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they don't know you know where you're at and what you're doing.

72
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, all of a sudden you just drop off for a couple days from work.

73
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you know there's there's that piece. So really kind of taking a look at the benefits

74
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.030
Ethan Tuttle: Versus

75
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The cost and see if it's really doing what you think that it's doing for you, you know,

76
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.560
You

77
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.020
Ethan Tuttle: KNOW WHAT I MEAN FOR GOOD IDEA.

78
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.500
Ethan Tuttle: Costs and benefits.

79
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because the idea is, if you think about it, once this job is over with and you move on to the next one.

80
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what you you want them to

81
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:28.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They love your work. You want you. You want them to believe in you, and believe that you're going to be there, believe that you're going to show up for work and everything, but you have, you know, you're creating this pattern of missing in this job.

82
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the next job might not be so

83
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Great. You know what I mean, my might not be so forgiving and and

84
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:45.990
Ethan Tuttle: They won't be I mean like operating it my the level that I'm theoretically operating at

85
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:57.270
Ethan Tuttle: It. Yeah, and I have a lot of lot of fear around. I mean, we've known this is going to happen.

86
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:07.020
Ethan Tuttle: He the fact that the the job is anything. It's like I already knew about it. I already knew. I'm going to freak out about it and it's gonna be hard. I'm size kind of plan for the whole year to just

87
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:13.470
Ethan Tuttle: Suck and be hard because I gotta get I have to hand figure out sobriety and figure out a new job.

88
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.420
Ethan Tuttle: Which is just

89
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.700
Ethan Tuttle: So it's kind of like

90
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:26.790
Ethan Tuttle: My prior to dipping my toe into the back end. The are doing this deal with the devil with drugs again.

91
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:40.530
Ethan Tuttle: Prior to that, I had this like five years that were just five plus years. And we're just amazing. Like kept making more money and kept loving my job morn Lily and got married and

92
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:53.910
Ethan Tuttle: It's like on this incredible uphill swing and then I cracked her like everything crashed all in around the same time for, you know, for all these different reasons and

93
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.730
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, one. So one's good.

94
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.880
Ethan Tuttle: One good way that I could look at it is, you remember that, um, the

95
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.790
Ethan Tuttle: The, the audit project that I was so freaked out about for so long.

96
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:25.560
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, yeah. So I finally finished that like as far as I know, I've like submitted every single thing that they need.

97
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:44.430
Ethan Tuttle: It was like messy and confusing at the end and and now I think maybe there was like one thing that that that they still needed and I just submitted it, or early today, but I'm expecting to be on a call tomorrow, where we're like, yay. That's completely finished now.

98
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.940
Ethan Tuttle: And I've had calls it with

99
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.370
Ethan Tuttle: Several people

100
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.260
Ethan Tuttle: Like I just working just before I called you and I'm gonna jump right back into work.

101
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.390
Ethan Tuttle: After I talk to you.

102
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:07.680
Ethan Tuttle: So, I mean, this good transition period where I have two months where like before, I'm going to be let go.

103
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.190
Ethan Tuttle: As long as I don't like stop showing completely stopped showing up for work, right.

104
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.330
Hey,

105
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.280
Ethan Tuttle: We're I can straighten this stuff out and

106
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.240
Ethan Tuttle: I guess my goal right now is to

107
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.470
Ethan Tuttle: Like so I marry wrote me the prescription for the the

108
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:53.760
Ethan Tuttle: For the Adderall. I actually hadn't filled it but I filled it today. And I said, and it doesn't take one in the morning and I thought, Okay, I'm gonna take them in a try taking these exactly as prescribed.

109
00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:00.120
Ethan Tuttle: And then even maybe try a day where I just don't take it and see how that day goes

110
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.210
Ethan Tuttle: And then the. The other thing is the

111
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:19.170
Ethan Tuttle: Suboxone which seems totally under control. So the thing. The other thing that I need to at least get on a like at least some steady about it is the

112
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.270
Ethan Tuttle: Vendors

113
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.240
Ethan Tuttle: So I hadn't been taking the vendors

114
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.260
Ethan Tuttle: Are was taking them once in a while and then

115
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:38.130
Ethan Tuttle: Stopping that Mary had prescribed and then I bought them from this guy that I know. So what I'm planning on doing is figuring figuring out and

116
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:53.970
Ethan Tuttle: In the next couple days. If I can get on a steady like I'm know everything and just and even if I'm a mess. At least I'm on the steady mess. And then I can start to make a goal, like, okay, let's slowly get this down to zero.

117
00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:04.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So remember that in the beginning, you were taking him as needed. So they were PRN so you're only taking them when you're when needed. If

118
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:14.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I just want to throw this information out. If you're, if you start taking them regularly. You can then become physically addicted to them as well.

119
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, then you have to go through the detox of them to. And so you have to keep that in your mind as well, you know, whatever that that plan looks like keep that

120
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your mind, you know,

121
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:41.790
Ethan Tuttle: That's a good point. So I will like I'm not going to try to take them. I'll take them as as necessary. So I'll take them if I feel like I have panic or you

122
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:52.140
Ethan Tuttle: Or I feel, which, you know, I feel like I need it. I'm withdrawing from it. Then I'll take a little bit so that I don't feel uncomfortable from that.

123
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:53.790
Ethan Tuttle: Right.

124
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.550
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, when I asked me to

125
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.800
Ethan Tuttle: Change my thinking from I take them to

126
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.170
Ethan Tuttle: Get out of myself to I take them just barely enough so uncomfortable.

127
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.680
Ethan Tuttle: And then, and then I because right. The problem is, right now I don't know how much of it that is every day.

128
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.990
Ethan Tuttle: You know I

129
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:14.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get

130
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.820
Ethan Tuttle: I buy them. And yeah, so

131
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:24.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you've really got to, you know, be cautious.

132
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.500
You know,

133
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially being on Suboxone and taking Benz's at the same time.

134
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's

135
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:45.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's fine in moderation. You know what I mean. But when you start taking them and you're losing time because of them. Then again, that's, you know, that should be a huge concern, you know,

136
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:55.170
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, yeah. And that's what literally those literally what ended me up in the hospital. And that's how I met you guys. It was a combination of the two. Right.

137
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.470
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah. And it turns out that or

138
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.970
Ethan Tuttle: I guess, thanks to Suboxone it's been

139
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.400
Ethan Tuttle: That has been an easy way for me to give up the the that part of it.

140
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:13.830
Ethan Tuttle: So,

141
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.040
Ethan Tuttle: Opiates. Yeah, exactly.

142
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.130
Ethan Tuttle: Um, so I need to

143
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.840
Ethan Tuttle: I need to recommit myself, sir.

144
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.130
Ethan Tuttle: Like

145
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.620
Ethan Tuttle: To add to it, making this a regular thing in a realistic way.

146
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.250
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, I can't wake up tomorrow and be perfect. I just I can't

147
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.420
Ethan Tuttle: For one thing, I if I just stopped taking

148
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.850
Ethan Tuttle: My I might not die. But I would be extremely uncomfortable.

149
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you already experience.

150
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you already experienced detox symptoms when you don't have to take themselves.

151
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.280
Ethan Tuttle: Um,

152
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.510
Ethan Tuttle: Well, I've been taking them every day for

153
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.350
Ethan Tuttle: You know, like a month. So yeah, I would expect.

154
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:11.910
Ethan Tuttle: I've done this.

155
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:19.230
Ethan Tuttle: I've taken him every day, every day for a month and then I stopped taking them them. I go, this is really awful. I don't want you know

156
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:33.120
Ethan Tuttle: So I have a little bit of experience with it. The only and I've been in this exactly in the situation I'm in now, or it's like crap, I gotta stop taking them, but I don't know where the you know how to how to manage it.

157
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.560
Ethan Tuttle: You know, okay, so I'm taking today and I want to get to zero and it usually takes like

158
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.390
Ethan Tuttle: My buddy who went through the same thing.

159
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.600
Ethan Tuttle: He just had that

160
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:56.220
Ethan Tuttle: I'm sure you guys can see it with a lot of new patients when they're just so ready and they're just want to completely

161
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.910
Ethan Tuttle: Give up and and they'll do anything that you know anybody tells him or

162
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:21.870
Ethan Tuttle: You know, any dot whatever the doctor says, and this guy. He got lucky and you found this doctor or group of doctors who is very good with doing these dozens of withdrawals and their things. It was like six weeks long or they're just they were going down by tiny, tiny amounts

163
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.850
Ethan Tuttle: And and he said it was amazing because

164
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:34.860
Ethan Tuttle: He never felt high and he never, I never really felt only the tiniest bit of

165
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:37.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Discomfort.

166
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.620
Ethan Tuttle: Of discomfort until I got all the way down here and it wasn't hard for him to to

167
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:45.570
Ethan Tuttle: Collect

168
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:56.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And really, that's kind of a that's a taper off of them. And that's a safe way. You know, to taper off of vendors for sure.

169
00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:02.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, a lot of doctors like to do it that way, it could because again it is the safest way to do it.

170
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:02.910
Yep.

171
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:12.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So they're just, you know, I want you to keep in mind. You're addicted brain that

172
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:19.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, really throws those messages in your brain that says you know you need them to you need this.

173
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:25.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You need all you know all of the Adderall. You're taking you need all of the vendors, you're taking

174
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:34.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what's going to make me feel better. You know, you have to really pay attention and identify that piece of your thought process as well.

175
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, because in reality.

176
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:52.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in the very beginning when you and I first are working with each other. You weren't taking Adderall. Right. And you were taking your bentos as needed. And you were doing pretty well.

177
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're doing pretty well.

178
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.260
Ethan Tuttle: Right, I had a good like month or something there. And that was

179
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:05.430
Ethan Tuttle: That's where I wish I was. And then if I could just go from there to not being on Suboxone and be sober. I'd be thrilled.

180
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:24.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you know, once you tackle you know the other to the other one. Once you once you gain the foundation in your recovery. You know what I mean, and keep it for a little bit. The other one is easily. You know, it is an easy taper as well but

181
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, you've got this whole cocktail for disaster going on that you know is the outcome isn't going to be very good when you do your cost of analysis.

182
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: cost benefit analysis. You know what I mean. Yeah. And it's about you being safe.

183
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.060
It's funny, I

184
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.830
Ethan Tuttle: I wrote down the cost benefit analysis.

185
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.670
Ethan Tuttle: It's almost like there's two different Ethan's that takes us like I totally takes them just to get higher to get out of myself.

186
00:18:54.810 --> 00:19:10.800
Ethan Tuttle: Or and I also take them because it's like I you know I can't focus on work right now. And like a like a big part of the similar thing for the Benz's is it that there's, I have a real. I think it qualifies as the medicinal need for it, but

187
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:25.110
Ethan Tuttle: If I can't be trusted to date, you know, to know when those times are then I can't be trusted with the medicine and I just have to like suffer for because I have that this deficiency and it's like

188
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.200
Ethan Tuttle: So that's, that's something I know on like

189
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or find alternatives.

190
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:32.190
You know, yeah.

191
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. I mean, there's an option as well. You know what I mean. Yeah.

192
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something to think about.

193
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:50.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because the whole idea and the whole goal is to be a BS sober healthy, Ethan. Right. Yeah.

194
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.450
Ethan Tuttle: All right, well,

195
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.110
Ethan Tuttle: Then I'm just in this last couple moments. I'm realizing that I'm happy to commit to

196
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:13.380
Ethan Tuttle: I tried to commit to this and it didn't stick but I'm gonna I'm gonna try it again because it right right now. The thing that makes sense to me as the journal and I can just get them journaling back

197
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:26.850
Ethan Tuttle: The this the cost benefit analysis that you talked about and do today, which was sort of like a it was a transition day in a weird way where I like got up in the morning. It wasn't sort of a normal day and

198
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.920
Ethan Tuttle: Had my coffee and like certain chatting with people you know

199
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.550
Ethan Tuttle: All the Germans are

200
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:43.470
Ethan Tuttle: Our offices basically working mainly with people in Berlin, so they're all in the end of their day when as we're waking up.

201
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:55.710
Ethan Tuttle: And I took on it it's it's a lot of stuff, but it's stuff that I think I can realistically get done this week. And if I could do that successfully this week and stick to this journaling thing.

202
00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:01.200
Ethan Tuttle: Um, it wouldn't be like a home run. But at least it would be like

203
00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.530
Ethan Tuttle: That'd be making progress.

204
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:13.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, a step in the right direction. Yeah. Yeah. So tell me on a date within a day. How many Adderall DJ

205
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:23.820
Ethan Tuttle: So far I took it just like it's prescribed it said one in the morning. That's right. That's what I decided I was like okay, that seems like

206
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.360
Ethan Tuttle: Actually they tell you the truth.

207
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:35.280
Ethan Tuttle: Just remember, and I just describing the difference between taking something to get out of yourself and taking something that because it has a purpose.

208
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.160
Ethan Tuttle: Right when I started taking Adderall.

209
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:55.140
Ethan Tuttle: I took it exactly that way. I take it one in the morning and I wouldn't take one after you know in the mid afternoon because I knew it would screw up my sleep that night. Mm hmm. And then everything is fine and how it like um

210
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.740
Ethan Tuttle: I went to Bucharest or not Bucharest town in Romania and

211
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.180
Ethan Tuttle: I don't know if they suspected something with me and dragons of that town but

212
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:19.380
Ethan Tuttle: That. So there's, it's the big company, you know, they have 42 not huge, but they have 40 people working in their office and we have 4050 people working in our offices in San Francisco.

213
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.820
Ethan Tuttle: And everyone's flying back and forth and like joking about how hard each adjusting is the each direction.

214
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:41.370
Ethan Tuttle: But because I have these after all it's like on the first day I just wake up pop one of those things and walk into the office, like when when the meetings are supposed to start looking like totally normal. And they're like, I kind of tired. They're like, No, no problem.

215
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.410
Ethan Tuttle: Um, so, not that I want to

216
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.760
Ethan Tuttle: use drugs. That way you know my whole life.

217
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think it helps with a time adjustment.

218
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.750
Ethan Tuttle: Well, definitely, like in that case.

219
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:07.500
Ethan Tuttle: I mean, that was one of those cases where I was able to go go go in and

220
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:21.030
Ethan Tuttle: And have a good productive morning where I focused and ran all these meetings and that all this stuff. And usually they literally scheduled people to be sort of like missing the first two days of work when

221
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.380
Ethan Tuttle: When they fly over there because the time adjustment adjustment.

222
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.030
Ethan Tuttle: Right, you know,

223
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Makes sense.

224
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So yes, that's very nice of them to do that to you know

225
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:42.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of times the companies don't. It's like up you flew in today. Tomorrow 8am up here, our dime Edward. Let's get this show on the road.

226
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:49.650
Ethan Tuttle: In reality, you can't without pharmaceutical help. It's like unrealistic to

227
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.660
Ethan Tuttle: Think really hard, like all day long.

228
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.980
Ethan Tuttle: After when you turn your brain for a loop with with the time change.

229
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:04.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A time

230
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're gonna you're gonna start journaling. Again, you're gonna try to start journaling again.

231
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.470
Ethan Tuttle: Well, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna. This is like my, I can do it.

232
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.060
Ethan Tuttle: Goal for the week.

233
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:27.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you go to smart recovery.com you can actually pull

234
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A cost benefit analysis assignment.

235
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Out of their toolbox. Right.

236
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.130
Yeah.

237
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, that you can utilize

238
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.100
Yep.

239
00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can pull a lot of things out of their toolbox. I love their toolbox.

240
00:24:51.510 --> 00:25:00.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that's definitely one thing that can really kind of let you see it on paper and give you a little bit bigger perspective, you know, you know, and you have to look at it.

241
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: with an open mind and

242
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.310
Ethan Tuttle: Be honest about it or maybe updated over a day when you're thinking about it.

243
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, totally.

244
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:18.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because sometimes we see it through, you know, our perception and sometimes our perception isn't what other people see you know what I mean.

245
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's different. We think we're doing good, and other people are, are, you know,

246
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Seeing something different, you know,

247
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:30.180
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, sure, a little

248
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:40.230
Ethan Tuttle: You know, knows, maybe I thought I was doing great over in Romania, but but they're all know because I was all chatter chatter in like

249
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.750
Ethan Tuttle: All different directions, trying to describe our systems work.

250
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And they're gone. What's this guy on

251
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's not happy.

252
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.370
Ethan Tuttle: No, no.

253
00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.030
Ethan Tuttle: Never got any hints

254
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:04.050
Ethan Tuttle: That way that at this point, it's just like the time that I miss you know

255
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:05.130
Yeah.

256
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:16.860
Ethan Tuttle: They have seen me like I back I'm feeling so healthy, you know, I'm doing a founding these, you know, I found a new doctor that I really enjoy working with and

257
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.740
Ethan Tuttle: So that's kind of how I talk about it.

258
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:20.850
Good.

259
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because really it's nobody's business, it's your own

260
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it is a medical

261
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:31.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is falls under your medical so it's not like you have to disclose anything to anybody.

262
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

263
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:48.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But, you know, you think about the time that you know you have missed work over it and you know if that behavior continues. What that does is show inconsistent, you know, attendance. It shows

264
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Not being available. You know what I mean, all of those things that can really spell disaster.

265
00:26:54.990 --> 00:27:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, at the end of it. And the idea is to get you to, you know, the end of this job. So you get your, your severance package. You know what I mean. Yep. And you go out strong

266
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, definitely. It's not about

267
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.310
Ethan Tuttle: Hopefully by the end of the job. I'll be

268
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:26.460
Ethan Tuttle: I'm like, because they're making pretty smart like the last month when, you know, your job is ending on you know the end the end of the day, you know, on a certain day at the end of this month.

269
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.860
Ethan Tuttle: They know that people aren't gonna be there and be thinking about their next job. So

270
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.710
Ethan Tuttle: So the goal is to have a have a job lined up, which basically means I have to basically finished the

271
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.830
Ethan Tuttle: I have this whole genius plan where in this started like um

272
00:27:47.970 --> 00:28:02.460
Ethan Tuttle: I don't know how much of it me these stories. I told you, but there's this company that I'd really like to work before and I'd really think their product would benefit the company that I currently work for. And if I what was consistent and super effective about all all these

273
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:02.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me.

274
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:03.510
You know,

275
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:14.220
Ethan Tuttle: Thing things I'm trying to do instead of like constantly missing meetings and or being inconsistent about things like

276
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.520
Ethan Tuttle: You know, so it's possible.

277
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:31.320
Ethan Tuttle: If there have been periods where it's possible that yes, the companies, even if they don't believe they even want the the product, just to sort of help me in my career future they'd be willing to

278
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.190
Ethan Tuttle: To take a serious look at that. So that's what I got to make happen.

279
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.640
Ethan Tuttle: on mute. This even have to listen to me.

280
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you fighting allergies or are you getting a cold or

281
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.580
Ethan Tuttle: Um, I don't think it's from the

282
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.750
Ethan Tuttle: From any withdrawal. Nice. My wife and I both been service sniffily

283
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably allergies in

284
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Another piece of this, I want you to remember is that

285
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're using substances and you're not sleeping on a regular basis, it lowers your immune system, your ability to fight things right, which makes you more vulnerable and more susceptible and knowing that they being

286
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Also makes you

287
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.780
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, you know, I have written all over

288
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. So you've got both of those.

289
00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:46.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In play right now.

290
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So these are just things

291
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know for you to it's

292
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:54.570
Ethan Tuttle: Good motivation.

293
00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:03.810
Ethan Tuttle: attics get to this. I don't know if you're an addict or alcoholic. But you get to this point where you're like,

294
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:10.110
Ethan Tuttle: It's hard to care in the first place, you know, and when you when you're in that point it's like

295
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:18.810
Ethan Tuttle: Are you know smokers they smoke every cigarette cigarette pack a day for 30 years and it is fine with it, where you're like,

296
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.190
Ethan Tuttle: It'll probably kill me. But it's hard to, it's hard to build up enough

297
00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:31.470
Ethan Tuttle: So the very first step, you know, the well and in a their own

298
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:38.520
Ethan Tuttle: Where they admit they're powerless over alcohol that, that's fine. You can do that and keep on drinking. Yeah.

299
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.960
Ethan Tuttle: For me, I kind of think of like

300
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:54.300
Ethan Tuttle: If I'm really going to be at the beginning of of our trajectory. Our I'm like really getting sober instincts over and being a different person. Like, the first thing is to like Karen.

301
00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:08.880
Ethan Tuttle: I know how I get this way, but I just started not like yeah I know there's consequences to like a cost benefit analysis, there's just all this awful stuff in the negative column, but I'm just like,

302
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.480
Ethan Tuttle: It doesn't

303
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:22.800
Ethan Tuttle: That's what I used to talk about a lot in smart meetings is like that motivation part of it, like, yeah, great, but like, how do we, how do you

304
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:39.360
Ethan Tuttle: Logically, that makes sense. Which is great. That's why I love these meetings. But then, what is it that makes me care and just even the state that I'm in right now is like, I haven't talked to my family, which is like, which is kills them I my little niece. She's like,

305
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:55.320
Ethan Tuttle: Three years old and it's like, so this will affect the development of our relationship forever until she's a teenager in a grown up adult is it. Oh yeah, uncle, Ethan, he was he was around and anyway so

306
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, what I know.

307
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:01.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know what I know.

308
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:08.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What change happens when it hurts too bad to stay the same.

309
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.990
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah.

310
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

311
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's where you start caring

312
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:21.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And where you want to, you know, do something different because you're uncomfortable in this scenario that you're sitting in

313
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.390
Ethan Tuttle: He's holding on to this thing that you think

314
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.340
Ethan Tuttle: You have, you know, because you

315
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Want to

316
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:33.780
Ethan Tuttle: Stop. You've, you've, you've lost. So you're like okay I don't care, I can just let go, whatever it is.

317
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:53.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just gotta get to a point where again where enough is enough. And, you know, you don't know. You know, I don't know what that's going to be for you. You don't know what that's going to be for you until you make that that decision to say

318
00:32:55.170 --> 00:33:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know it's going to be hard, but I need to get my shit together and I need to do something different or I'm gonna lose. And you know, that's where we're

319
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.130
Ethan Tuttle: Even I think that's kind of a trick.

320
00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:16.320
Ethan Tuttle: That the attics and addiction play on that it isn't actually that hard.

321
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:25.410
Ethan Tuttle: We have this the science and the techniques like if I'm 100% committed to the bottom of my heart right now to

322
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:32.820
Ethan Tuttle: Get from where I'm at, to, you know, totally clean off of all these things.

323
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.800
Ethan Tuttle: We get there's a there's totally a path to doing that.

324
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:43.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's there's these little things. I don't want to let go of you know i don't i don't want to let go of this and I say,

325
00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:53.190
Ethan Tuttle: It's like I refused to let anyone else manage it for me. So, and then, and then I'm my own doctor and it keeps working out of about this well.

326
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the meaning of insanity, is it not.

327
00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.640
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah yeah well

328
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing the same thing over and over, open for different results.

329
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.590
Yeah.

330
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's something to think about.

331
00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:09.870
Yeah.

332
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, even you have a lot of yet to yeah a lot of yet.

333
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.920
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, that was bumming me. I mean, I'm sorry I'm not to

334
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:27.390
Ethan Tuttle: Give you a hard time for me out. But that's the thing is that I have

335
00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.580
Ethan Tuttle: This life where it's teetering on

336
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:40.800
Ethan Tuttle: Well, I don't know. I have like enough money in the bank that I could like go into a drug hole for like

337
00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.150
Ethan Tuttle: If I don't kill myself with drugs. I could do it for like years

338
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.040
Ethan Tuttle: Right.

339
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:48.780
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah.

340
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:55.590
Ethan Tuttle: I would slowly lose all these things that i i love that I've obviously been willing to

341
00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.930
Ethan Tuttle: You know, in the past, to pay those sacrifices

342
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:11.280
Ethan Tuttle: I'm going to try to impress you this week and do this the simple things that I'm that I'm saying I'm going to do.

343
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:23.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And there they are. They're just simple things. You know what I mean, they're nothing, you know, they're, it's not a bunch of changes, but it's just about reviewing and analyzing and

344
00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're trying to pick back up. One thing that you let job.

345
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:29.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

346
00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:38.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, I definitely don't want to bum you out. But I'm not going to sugarcoat anything

347
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm going to give you a reality.

348
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:49.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'm going to be 100% truthful with you. You know what I mean. And this isn't based off of what I'm telling you is not based off textbook. It's based off experience.

349
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

350
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, you know what, what could possibly you know

351
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:04.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. And, you know, if you go into a benzo blackout again.

352
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:19.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, the, it's very much real and this is a horrible for me to say and I hate saying it. But the reality of that can be you know that your addiction wins. In the end, and

353
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know your your family will suffer a huge loss.

354
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you have to know that, again, if you've heard me say this 100 times that it has one job.

355
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One job and that's to take you out.

356
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you have to remember that, you know,

357
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something else to think about

358
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.800
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, it's interesting that you that I said that and you latched on to it. I wasn't even

359
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.640
Ethan Tuttle: There's a lot of the consequences are the

360
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.560
Ethan Tuttle: That is a

361
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.790
Ethan Tuttle: putting myself in your shoes, listening to me talk

362
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:12.420
Ethan Tuttle: all this crazy stuff happened last week, you know, a couple like days when I should have been at work and I wasn't and like

363
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:24.570
Ethan Tuttle: Arguments with the wave and low. Yeah. And then there's this like a Thursday. I think it was Wednesday. I was like, kind of doing okay and then Thursday I just suddenly can't remember.

364
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:26.640
Ethan Tuttle: You know,

365
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.310
Ethan Tuttle: There's a

366
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: D, are you missing the day or just hours.

367
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:36.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sorry, I got it.

368
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.760
Ethan Tuttle: Well actually it's

369
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.510
Ethan Tuttle: It's not like long periods of time. We're going by. Right. I don't know what happened.

370
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:52.830
Ethan Tuttle: I wasn't really in really bad shape. And in that, in that way, like, you know,

371
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.260
Ethan Tuttle: Sort of in the months leading up to the when I went to the ER. Yeah.

372
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.860
Ethan Tuttle: But uh yeah weeks would go a week would go by and I wouldn't really know

373
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.230
Ethan Tuttle: What happened, we're going on. And if I could just

374
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:26.670
Ethan Tuttle: Journal that would kind of put a stop to that because then have the journal. Right. Who cares if I took 16 Xanax or whatever. But if I write it down and then I'm like, well, no wonder, everything's kind of hazy be heads, and then at least like a look at really what you know.

375
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:33.150
Ethan Tuttle: It can be really powerful. So yeah, I really, really want to do that.

376
00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm hoping that you know

377
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:50.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, but then there's also this whole piece to that says that, you know, if you're in that state of mind your addiction isn't going to want you to write down what's happening.

378
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to me,

379
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's easy to say

380
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, do it later do it later. And I'll do it tomorrow, you know,

381
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:05.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because your addiction, you know that lives in your mind. It does not want you know to lose control.

382
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:06.480
Doesn't

383
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:08.700
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah.

384
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:19.080
Ethan Tuttle: Let's say keep it's funny though because they want you always but you know both the addiction in your better your better half or whatever, you know, you always want to make the next right

385
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:32.940
Ethan Tuttle: Decision and when I'm kind of in both or, you know, because I'm working. I did some actual work today and I'm going to do some actual work and we wrap up.

386
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:37.920
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah.

387
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:49.710
Ethan Tuttle: Within control. Sometimes it's so hard, because it's like I could do my journal right now but you know I literally just told my boss, if this thing was going to be done by 10 o'clock, and it's 945 so

388
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's like, I better do this first

389
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I gotta do this verse.

390
00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:55.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

391
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:56.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What does it

392
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Say about it.

393
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here is

394
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:02.400
Ethan Tuttle: She

395
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.240
Ethan Tuttle: She's amazing. She just sort of

396
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:16.860
Ethan Tuttle: My perspective on it is that she's like, she's so committed to me and our

397
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:32.490
Ethan Tuttle: Our like marriage and our future together that she like when she sees me kind of losing control and she knows that because he tried to control a game for a little while, at the very beginning is interesting because she had never heard of.

398
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.370
Ethan Tuttle: The principles of

399
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.800
Ethan Tuttle: What's, what's the concept of

400
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.250
Ethan Tuttle: Coke.

401
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:57.240
Ethan Tuttle: Correct codependency or you know how powerful addiction is. And can you, like, just like

402
00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:01.650
Ethan Tuttle: Can you put someone in the cell like that are going to help

403
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me.

404
00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:11.580
Ethan Tuttle: And the answer is totally now so he didn't know any of that stuff and over there with a couple we have 10 years off together pretty much now.

405
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:26.610
Ethan Tuttle: So she's seen eight years of me as a sober person in these two years of me, and she most of that time to figure out, like you can't do anything when I go into this mode. So she just sort of rolls along with me. Sometimes she even parties with me lately like

406
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:36.120
Ethan Tuttle: Lately, she's been in a on like sobriety house kick. Um, and so she's sort of

407
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.820
Ethan Tuttle: doing her best to take care of, like, get me to eat every day and

408
00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:48.510
Ethan Tuttle: Instead, at what she thinks the best decision is for the day. And that's all she does.

409
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:50.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

410
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:58.680
Ethan Tuttle: Then we have these great times where I'm like, where I, you know, turn, turn around and you know have a day where I'm don't run in everything into the ground and

411
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many days a week. Does that happen.

412
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:20.520
Ethan Tuttle: I feel like like the last two weeks this

413
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.700
Ethan Tuttle: This whole relapse. I forget.

414
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.100
Ethan Tuttle: It's like three weeks. Right.

415
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:34.230
Ethan Tuttle: Like a month ago, I think I was certain still solidly in the VHS I'm making that up. Or is that sound about right.

416
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now it's been a little over a month. I think that you've been struggling with

417
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:40.320
Ethan Tuttle: Okay, a month. Yeah.

418
00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:42.600
Ethan Tuttle: Um,

419
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:49.350
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, so I would say on average in that time. I've had to like really bad.

420
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:55.500
Ethan Tuttle: I'm totally out of control kind of

421
00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.710
Ethan Tuttle: Episodes and I've had

422
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:10.260
Ethan Tuttle: Many sort of sweet nights, but liliya we're just starting out and watching TV together and I got you know I do work the next day says it's not like I'm failing.

423
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.170
Ethan Tuttle: And you know only failing.

424
00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:20.970
Ethan Tuttle: When say one day out of the week. But I mean, come on, completely losing control not going to work and

425
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.210
Ethan Tuttle: When data we can

426
00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, just know that

427
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That this disease that you're struggling with

428
00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That it's progressive. Yeah, right.

429
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.780
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah.

430
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So remember that piece to that that one day can easily turn into two or three days and before you know it, it's five days.

431
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:55.500
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, no, I even even status quo is like the one day a week is not acceptable. I obviously I can't live this way.

432
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And are you losing weight.

433
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:14.820
Ethan Tuttle: I definitely lost weight because I was at a. I was like, not eating at all. And then with Lily as health. We started on we got into a like having at least one big meal a day.

434
00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.910
Ethan Tuttle: Routine and that has a

435
00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.050
Ethan Tuttle: Game. I'm not gaining weight, but at least I'm not like becoming skinnier and skinnier.

436
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm still not losing anymore.

437
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:27.960
Yeah.

438
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know you're able to eat a full meal.

439
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay, good.

440
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.660
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, it's funny, like

441
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:50.040
Ethan Tuttle: I really don't want to claim victory or that everything's going fine but you'd be surprised. Like this morning. I got up and had a pancake. And I think they might have made a smoothie to

442
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.980
Ethan Tuttle: And then jumped into some like

443
00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:01.650
Ethan Tuttle: Some stuff at work and had a pretty pretty normal day

444
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good. Yeah.

445
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:07.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. How's your water intake.

446
00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.990
Ethan Tuttle: I don't do great with that because I don't like to drink.

447
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:19.320
Ethan Tuttle: Tap water, but we have a ton of like

448
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:27.180
Ethan Tuttle: Sports drinks would buy them by the case and I get hired and drinking them so

449
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.410
Ethan Tuttle: I do get into a mode where I don't drink enough water so

450
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:42.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's something to work on, you know, somewhere down the road, not saying you got to work on that today, but definitely somewhere down the road. Get back in

451
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to putting healthy in your body.

452
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.350
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, um, last week when I was talking to both you guys about this.

453
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.600
Ethan Tuttle: journaling thing.

454
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.790
Ethan Tuttle: I was talking about making a spreadsheet instead of a journal or a sort of combination of the

455
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:03.900
Ethan Tuttle: Water call on

456
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:11.520
Ethan Tuttle: Us to put in there like, you know, how is your bowel movements and all the basic stuff.

457
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:21.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because, you know, part of it is, is one of the first things that obviously you know you know that one of the first things we start falling short on is our self care.

458
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:34.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is what we put in our body, how much we're sleeping. If we're drinking enough water, all of those things that our body needs to function we, you know, those are the first things that kind of get thrown to the wayside, you know,

459
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:50.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so getting you back on a you know this daily routine of eating, you know, healthier and you know journaling and you know getting full night's sleep. So how was your sleep.

460
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.460
Ethan Tuttle: Well, it's been all over the place.

461
00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.470
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, I'm seeing

462
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:11.370
Ethan Tuttle: It. If I can just get the same side of my mind to get into the journaling thing. There's just so much power in it for so many reasons that I'm

463
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.220
Ethan Tuttle: That'll be a huge

464
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:25.560
Ethan Tuttle: That just that in itself would be a you know a huge difference. And I'm not saying that I want to keep things status quo, but that's really my I'm excited about.

465
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:30.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's just step one and it's simple. You know what I mean.

466
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:33.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Keep it simple.

467
00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Keep it simple right now.

468
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Yeah.

469
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:42.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

470
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't want to put too much on your plate because then it becomes too overwhelming.

471
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:48.840
Ethan Tuttle: Right.

472
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.280
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, you sound like

473
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:59.520
Ethan Tuttle: Given that I am like I'm in this period where I have to work or

474
00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:01.890
Ethan Tuttle: I get to work. I mean,

475
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:09.960
Ethan Tuttle: I think it'd be so stupid right now to like go to a 30 day or go to some recovery program or whatever.

476
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:13.290
Ethan Tuttle: Because I'm in this like

477
00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:23.190
Ethan Tuttle: Sit you know situation with my job where the expectations are kind of low the payment is like really high.

478
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:25.020
Ethan Tuttle: Um,

479
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:29.550
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, so I should I should keep going with it as long as I can.

480
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:34.620
Ethan Tuttle: And it's

481
00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:35.490
Ethan Tuttle: Clear

482
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:37.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and your recovery.

483
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:48.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Try to get back on track with, you know, consistency and work in your recovery and at the end of it. If you find out that, you know, it's too much, it's too hard. You can't do it.

484
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:56.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then, really think about going into a 30 day rehab to you know get that foundation bag. You know what I mean. But I get it.

485
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:58.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I totally get it.

486
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, there's a lot at stake right now, you know,

487
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:22.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I you know concur with you, you know, definitely in the past. My idea is, well, if you can stay sober, you're going to need. And, you know, really a Sam, which is the basis of recovery treatment. Anyway, says if you can't stay sober at this level of care. We need to bump you up another level.

488
00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you need a higher level of care and so

489
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The next level of here from outpatient is I O P which is three days a week and then

490
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:42.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The next one above that as five days a week, where you check in, you know, on a daily basis and or the end of the day, or you know whatever that looks like and

491
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Interesting. Yeah.

492
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.260
Ethan Tuttle: So do you guys

493
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:50.670
Ethan Tuttle: Do those more intense of levels. Already, would it be like some other

494
00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:51.870
Ethan Tuttle: Provider

495
00:49:52.680 --> 00:50:02.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that they do do, um, you are able to do I op, I believe I have to check with Helena, but you certainly can, you know, we can get you engaged in

496
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:07.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in another group or we can definitely you and I can check in three times a week.

497
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:09.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

498
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:15.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just to have an end of day check in to see where you're at and to see what you're doing and see how your day went

499
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:31.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's certainly possible. You know, I don't have a problem, you know, doing that, if that is going to help you get back on track. You know what I mean. I say we do it you know i mean whatever it's going to take you. This is your ship. So you have to tell me what is going to work for Ethan

500
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

501
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:40.680
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, I mean, I'd be happy to have a if you can schedule something on Friday, we could meet on Friday, and I can show you what a

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Two o'clock.

506
00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:01.980
Ethan Tuttle: I think so, it's unlikely at this point that I haven't you like

507
00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:09.270
Ethan Tuttle: It used to be that I hardly had any time but like it's gotten more and more like

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.880
Ethan Tuttle: Critical things on my calendar.

509
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:27.120
Ethan Tuttle: Yes.

510
00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:42.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, so let's do that. Let's just bump you up from once a week to today, and a check in on Friday and see where you're at, where you, where you went for the last, you know couple days.

511
00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:45.000
Ethan Tuttle: That sounds great.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:46.980
Right, yeah.

513
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:57.420
Ethan Tuttle: So maybe I don't know you probably do like hour long sessions is this, do you do any of these shorter checking session.

514
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.460
Ethan Tuttle: Yes. Yeah, there's a thing.

515
00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:05.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. You don't have to. We don't have to spend an hour twice a week together. What we can do is

516
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing a check and can be 15 minutes or 30 minutes it's whatever you know we

517
00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whatever we seen suitable well we can work.

518
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:21.060

524
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:42.540

525
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:42.870
Okay.

526
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.900
If that's open

527
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:51.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I don't have anything after group. What I usually do is

528
00:52:52.530 --> 00:53:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My day is usually done after that Friday group, but so we can do a 15 to 30 minute check in over the, you know, and see where you're at.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:18.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 45 PM and I'm just going to put it as 30 minutes, but we can stay 15 minutes if things are going great. There's no reason why

530
00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:21.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know if

531
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're struggling with something we can certainly

532
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Change it around and, you know, we'll do it. I'll set this in my calendar for

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right.

554
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:21.630

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Well, that's good. At least you're getting out away from the computer.

583
00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:26.460
Ethan Tuttle: So creepy and we're going outside, though, because you have to do the gloves and a

584

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your area, are they telling you that if you don't wear your mask. You can't be have any service.

587
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:37.890
Ethan Tuttle: Um,

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I mean, when you go to the store.

590
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:54.240
Ethan Tuttle: I didn't get turned away from a drug dealer one time back because

591
00:57:55.890 --> 00:58:00.210
Ethan Tuttle: It's he was, he is way back in the day was in New York City. When they had

592
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:16.230
Ethan Tuttle: Corruption and more more corruption than they do now. So this drug dealer had who ran this one corner his deal to city was because they're having a problem where kids were getting addicted to heroin that were too young. So they made him card everyone that he sold their into

593
00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:25.080
Ethan Tuttle: And so it was funny because it was kind of like harm reduction way before its time. It was before Giuliani was mayor.

594
00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:26.760
Yeah yeah

595
00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:32.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I can never met a drug dealer that card and anybody that's funny. Yeah.

596
00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you were too young.

597
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.300
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, I got card for trying to buy one of those to you.

598
00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:42.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's one for the story books, that's for sure.

599
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:48.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my god. Okay, so we have a game plan set in place.

600
00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:49.620

605
00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.540
Ethan Tuttle: Thanks. Oh, hey, by the way, I don't know.

606
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:11.220
Ethan Tuttle: Did you hear the whole story that about they gave me the wrong room code. When I first showed up.

607
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.240
Ethan Tuttle: Ah, yeah. It wasn't as late as you probably thought I was because

608
00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.950
Ethan Tuttle: I did. I called him like my wife's things

609
00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:35.730
Ethan Tuttle: Just like I'm supposed to. I called in 20 minutes early and paid and got the room number which look kind of weird. And then I called it right at six o'clock, and I got lead into as low as in some other

610
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:44.700
Ethan Tuttle: Other groups, if someone had given me an other wrong group number so yeah at six o'clock I do call back and then wait for the waiting period again.

611
00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To go

612
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.290
Ethan Tuttle: Like, Oh, thank you. Yeah, so that's why I'm shut up.

613
00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:53.640
Ethan Tuttle: Whenever I did 615

614
00:59:54.660 --> 01:00:09.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay. That's all right. You know, I asked them if you were in the waiting room and they told me. Yes. Yeah, they were there. So they you know i know that they have a lot going on that, you know, we are just exploding everything's going to zoom and

615
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.840
Ethan Tuttle: You know, it's great. Your writers

616
01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:23.100
Ethan Tuttle: Perfect for, like, I mean, it's a great business. Anyway, I would predict that it would be growing like gangbusters. But now the whole telemedicine thing and everything. Yeah.

617
01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:23.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's

618
01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:24.360
Ethan Tuttle: Cool.

619
01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:30.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's crazy. Everything's going to zoom. You know, so, um, so

620
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:39.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it would make sense, this is my, this is the room that will me always meet that but you still think of the virtual clinic and check in, because they have their

621
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:53.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bam surveys and stuff that you have to do, which keeps them updated on your progress and where you're at and what's happening, you know, all of that stuff. So, yeah.

622
01:00:54.060 --> 01:01:02.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But if you ever get for our individuals. The group one will always be different, but for our individuals, it's always going to be this group.

623
01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:10.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This number. Okay. Okay. So if you ever get anything. Yeah. If you ever get anything other than this for individuals.

624
01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, they gave you the wrong one.

625
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.220
Ethan Tuttle: Okay.

626
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.130
Ethan Tuttle: Perfect. So far, they've been pretty good so

627
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.770
Ethan Tuttle: Yeah, I'll take it.

628
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: with a grain of salt. Okay, yeah, they're just

629
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're just really busy, I get it, I watched them, you know,

630
01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go crazy if I can imagine that if they had an office that the people in virtual clinic where you would see them just running, you know,

631
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:38.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's what I am.

632
01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:46.650
Ethan Tuttle: Really impressed with Danielle, like a man of crazy insurance problems and all that she saw. Um, yeah.

635
01:01:54.540 --> 01:02:02.220
Ethan Tuttle: And she said, You know what, I've never met, Rebecca, but I heard really good things about her. So that's another thing about how you guys are so weird, because you've never, never met each other.

636
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I know, I know. Definitely. I've seen her work miracles to

637
