19
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, the next part is wanting to know if you would tell me about your history using history.

20
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When did it start, what was the first substance that you were exposed to what age and how did it progress.

21
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:43.710
Michelle: I was I was introduced to her when I was in a relationship with a guy who had been clean and sober at the time that I met him, and we just

22
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.150
Michelle: Kind of, we were about two years into our relationship. And we just had some things in our life that kind of

23
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.550
Michelle: Were stressful and I'm behind it person for a while there. I had been on Xanax and

24
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.290
Michelle: I mean, okay, well, if you want to get technical. I guess I started with Xanax, I was in the process of divorcing my husband, my first husband.

25
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:25.500
Michelle: When I had gone to the doctor and asked for something for anxiety and I been suffering, pretty much my entire life. But this situation. My there was other other things involved as well. And my son had been in a

26
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.540
Michelle: He domestic violence of use case where he got severely hurt by boyfriend. I was seeing.

27
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:50.100
Michelle: Here after I divorced my, my first husband and I went to my doctor and astrophysics, because I was going through some extremely stressful time custody battle divorce battle, you know,

28
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.670
Michelle: Everything. My son, getting hurt and

29
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.860
Michelle: It's. It started with that. I guess you could say. Because after I moved to Oregon.

30
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.260
Michelle: And my doctor would no longer from Arizona would no longer prescribe it in Oregon. For me, and I couldn't find a doctor in Oregon to help

31
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.490
Michelle: With a prescription of something for anxiety that worked as well as annex did at least and

32
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:32.130
Michelle: And I had just, I mean I had the lowest dosage and and it worked for me because like I have like in the moments where I just get super panicky, and I need just something in the moment, because I just get so up in my head I get super worked up and just

33
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.270
Michelle: It's hard to breathe and

34
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.270
Michelle: But yeah

35
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.600
Michelle: They had to be on presence as well.

36
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.090
Michelle: And then I couldn't find a doctor in Oregon to prescribe ME ON WHAT I WAS PREVIOUSLY before you know because after my meds ran out like

37
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:04.230
Michelle: You know, because my doctor in Arizona prescribed me three months worth of meds before so I could find a doctor in time.

38
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:14.730
Michelle: Mm Hmm, no doctor. First of all, wouldn't accept my insurance. I guess it was Arizona insurance only accepted in Arizona, California, Nevada there but

39
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:28.380
Michelle: I went through a really hard time I was going through some stuff with my family as well. And he was already doing it behind my back and I had known about his previous views, but

40
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:44.040
Michelle: I you know I took it with a grain of salt. We all have our problems, you know, it's not, you know, CAN'T HOLD YOUR YOUR FAULT against you and criticize you for it because that's not how you heal and move on and be better. So

41
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:57.630
Michelle: Two years, three years in our relationship. I was going through some more problems with my son and and all that. And we were in the process of moving and I was just extremely like just stressed out and

42
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.210
Michelle: There was a really rough time just a lot of stuff went down and

43
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:20.850
Michelle: I couldn't get, you know, find a doctor to help me. You know, you know. So he was like, you know, try this and you know you just do it small, small portions. You know, you don't riddle. And it's kind of just like Xanax as well.

44
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.670
But

45
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:38.220
Michelle: I tried it and I did like it and it started out in small portions, obviously, because I had never done it before, and to, you know, he wanted me to be safe and not woody or anything, and

46
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:53.310
Michelle: It grew to bigger proportions, you know, as time went on, you know, your tolerance level goes up with it and and it just got out of control. I got out of control. And when I had learned the first time I got sick.

47
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.930
Michelle: I knew I never wanted to feel that again.

48
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.410
Michelle: When I was brutal that's

49
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.620
Michelle: When they tell you withdrawal is like, I mean it was. I thought it was gonna die like yeah

50
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He was bad. And how long ago was that

51
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.120
Michelle: Um,

52
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.340
Michelle: I've got so much going on right now. And my memory. And my thought process is just I can't even

53
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.300
Michelle: I mean, probably about a year ago.

54
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.850
Michelle: About a year ago or two years ago now, two years ago.

55
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.770
Michelle: Yeah it. That's when it. That's when I got my first, like, really big segments and

56
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.820
Michelle: I

57
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.650
Michelle: And then

58
00:06:51.480 --> 00:07:03.090
Michelle: pregnant with my daughter. And so that helped me be sober for, you know, a while and then obviously after I had my baby I relapsed and I just

59
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.570
Michelle: I felt extremely guilty and

60
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's your baby.

61
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.510
Michelle: She's, she's two and a half, two. Yeah.

62
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A little toddler. Yeah.

63
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.800
Michelle: Yeah, so I just say I don't want to relapse and I feel like if I get help with medication.

64
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.820
Michelle: I feel, you know, that is huge, you know,

65
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:38.040
Michelle: Plus for me because I, you know, and I and I like the fact that there's no luck so minute and it's like one of like if if even if I really wanted to, I couldn't because the knock on wood block.

66
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:39.960
Michelle: You know,

67
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.960
Michelle: I mean, I like

68
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any history with alcohol abuse.

69
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.590
Michelle: Um, there was a point in time, I was like, I

70
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.140
Michelle: people drop out. When I tell like my full life story, but I was in a group home.

71
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:16.650
Michelle: From for for a while. And after I got out of the group home and I turned 18. And actually, before I even got out of the group home in in the group home. It was alcohol. So I did a lot of drinking from about 15 to 19

72
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

73
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:20.400
Michelle: I mean,

74
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:32.010
Michelle: Yeah, in that time period. I did have a huge problem without all yeah I mean I drink in the group home and the times when I was in the group home in the foster home I drink on the weekends every weekend.

75
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:33.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

76
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:41.970
Michelle: When I got out of the group home I drink a lot. I mean, it was like, you know, every night was a party night at someone's house.

77
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.950
Michelle: I grew up in Southern California.

78
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:45.600
So,

79
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, and what about what age were you if you remember, was the first time that you experienced any substances.

80
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.440
Michelle: Like like taking substances or yeah many others.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Weed or, you know, marijuana or

82
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:14.220
Michelle: I'm, to be quite honest with you, I've always like, from the time I was like five years old, six years old, but

83
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:33.840
Michelle: My, my father got custody of me because of my mother's drug drug abuse and I lived with my father for a while and then I ended up in the group home in the foster homes for a while, but pretty much my entire life. I've been around drugs and people who do drugs and

84
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:52.230
Michelle: I started smoking weed probably got nine around there and Mike like everybody I was raised around it. It was never like a hidden thing the adults or, you know, it was just, we're all running around parents are over there and a huddle grandparents. I mean, my grandparents used to grow weed.

85
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.170
Michelle: I used to help them harvest their plants.

86
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:09.720
Michelle: I GOT A Minor In Possession. My second day of school my sophomore year of marijuana marijuana has always been around, like, I mean, as long as I can remember. I smoke weed, but

87
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.450
Michelle: The very first thing

88
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.820
Oh, sorry.

89
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.800
Michelle: She's i guess i I sipped alcohol even

90
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.920
Michelle: Before smoking pot. I mean, my

91
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:39.300
Michelle: My life has been pretty pretty pretty wild. My, my father used to have a cake and it was an open cake and and i mean we used to sneak alcohol.

92
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:52.320
Michelle: On the weekends. When I mean, yeah, it was just a huge party my whole life really my parents just partied a lot. Drink, drink lot, and I'm sure they were doing.

93
00:10:52.710 --> 00:11:02.370
Michelle: I know they were doing harder drugs behind the scenes that we didn't necessarily see or really know about. But as far as drinking and smoking pot that was out new

94
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.020
Michelle: But

95
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:13.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's one of the questions is the year of family dynamics, you know where your parents together your whole life. Do you have siblings.

98
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:46.530
Michelle: Up until five, six years old, I was with my mom, but she didn't have a little or girl. She didn't have a little girl until I was living with my father. So I never got to know my younger sibling my younger sister. I've met her a few times, but I don't

99
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:52.290
Michelle: Know her. I don't, we don't meet up for holidays or anything.

101
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.390
Michelle: But

102
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.340
Michelle: My mother.

103
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:13.770
Michelle: My mother and father were never together they work together. I guess for a brief period of time when I was an infant.

104
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.390
Michelle: But

105
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:26.760
Michelle: My half brother, like I grew up with, up until I was five. But I, to be quite honest and frank with you. I really have no very like very good memories of my childhood.

106
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.470
Michelle: Sure and I their memories are sparse. Like I feel like even up until like

107
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.290
Michelle: 1314 my memories are just

108
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.680
Michelle: You know, they're just there.

109
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.990
Michelle: I don't know.

110
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:46.800
Michelle: I don't remember. I mean, I remember certain things, but not like you like feat stuff, you should remember, you know, in that

111
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.300
Michelle: Other people remember I've always noticed that like everybody

112
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Has a story to tell and you've got pieces of yours.

113
00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, understandable and what age were you when you went into foster care.

114
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.490
Michelle: 1617

115
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: from your, from your dad.

116
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:17.760
Michelle: Yeah, yeah. Well, my mom actually my dad had kicked me out and I lived with my mom for a period of time. I'm the one who called CPS on my mother.

117
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:31.620
Michelle: Actually, and then nobody had wanted me nobody wanted to take me and my dad didn't want me back because he was with his girlfriend then, at the time, and they had their three kids. She, her three kids and

118
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:41.970
Michelle: I just, I've never gotten along with my mother. My mother has been an habitual like I mean she's been on math my entire life. As long as I can remember, and

119
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:52.080
Michelle: This the when I my little sister was like super, super young and I can't even really put an age on it.

120
00:13:54.180 --> 00:14:01.770
Michelle: Wasn't really talking. So I want to say she was in between, like, one and two were around there. But yeah, he came home from

121
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:19.740
Michelle: Hanging out with my friends really early in the morning and I had found my my younger sister playing with her purse dumped update upside down, you know, in the kitchen. There will, my mom was obviously sleeping passed out drunk or on, you know, whatever. And, and I

122
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:29.580
Michelle: I left, I took off and she showed up in my there's some math in her purse that was on the floor and the little girl was just

123
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:38.490
Michelle: Yeah, I mean, it was literally like not even a foot away from her. And I felt like that was just wrong fucking

124
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.190
Michelle: Sorry. Um,

125
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:53.370
Michelle: So I left, I took off for a while and I took my little brother with me. Well, she left us unfair. She took it. She took us to the to the fair and she left us

126
00:14:54.270 --> 00:15:07.890
Michelle: With like she left us at the fair with no money, no cell phone, no way to get home and took off with the little, the little girl. My little sister, and we had to figure out a way how to get back to back home.

127
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.520
Michelle: Because I believe their kids and affair and

128
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:11.910
Yeah.

129
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:24.900
Michelle: I blew my mind. And so I took off and and I came home to her house there she she usually left early in the morning. She had a morning paper route.

130
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:32.610
Michelle: Newspaper, Robert, whatever. And I came back early in the morning to get some some stuff and

131
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:44.850
Michelle: I mean she she she started pushing me. She came, she came back, like she was just like, she said she was waiting for me and like she was somewhere around spying watching me come back because she knew I would be back or something.

132
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:57.630
Michelle: But the fight that we got in, like she I mean she got that was the second time in our relationship that she got physical with me, where she put her hands on me and tried to me to try to keep me from leaving to and

133
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:03.930
Michelle: By the end of the night. Yeah, that was. Yeah. But anyways, um,

134
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:14.460
Michelle: I I left. She came because she wanted my little brother back and I was like he doesn't want to go home with you, like we were at my friend's house with her parents and

135
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:28.800
Michelle: You know her parents were allowing us to stay there and she's she suggested that I call CPS so I called CPS because I didn't want to be there with her and my dad like had kicked me out to her and

136
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.840
Michelle: I'm

137
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:40.050
Michelle: I just, I didn't want to go back to my dad, either because that was a toxic violent really relationship with his girlfriend and I

138
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.380
Michelle: Ever since they got together.

139
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:52.590
Michelle: She's just mean I was the odd man. Now I didn't fit with her and him in her in her three kids, you know, and

140
00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.970
Michelle: But yeah

141
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.570
Michelle: She you want to get into that either.

142
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:06.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You had a rough childhood.

143
00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:22.200
Michelle: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nobody wanted me so I was in the group home for a while. And one of the ladies that worked at the group home was a foster parent as well and she took me in as a foster child and I was doing really, really good there for a while with her.

144
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.840
Michelle: Until I met a guy who was about 10 years older than me.

145
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.570
Michelle: Yeah.

146
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:40.860
Michelle: Um, anyways, I ran away with him and he ended up being extremely violent physically verbally.

147
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.230
Michelle: Abusive physically and verbally and and

148
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:53.010
Michelle: I was on the run. I had a juvenile runaway warrant for me and

149
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:04.980
Michelle: I had rock I reconciled with my father. He and his girlfriend had broken up. She actually left them for a guy with a Mustang and

150
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:13.290
Michelle: Her kids were grown and narrow, narrow and by this time, you know, like she wanted something else. And then I mean

151
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:25.830
Michelle: The whole dynamics of the whole relationship and the whole story. And in a backstory and everything I could go on for days. But she she left him after her kids were grown. She used him and

152
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:38.820
Michelle: But I reconciled with him and you know we got to talk and and he helped me out. You can pick me up from the use of guy and I see this coming for a while until I

153
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:48.030
Michelle: Until my birthday, my 18th birthday, where I was no longer awarded state and no longer a juvenile run away.

154
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:49.590
Michelle: But

155
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.250
Michelle: As about 1717

156
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.380
Michelle: When I ran

157
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:07.050
Michelle: And it's like 1617 when I was in the foster home and and 1516 like in the group home.

158
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.780
Michelle: And then before that I was with one on one. And then for that in and

159
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So where does school fit in all this into graduate, we

160
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:30.480
Michelle: Graduate I ended up dropping out because I just you know with with being in a group home when I was in a group home. I was in an all girls high school small like 1212 girls High School.

161
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:49.920
Michelle: And I was able to work up almost enough to graduate. Not quite enough. I'm actually right now studying for my diploma. I literally have like a credit of English four and three units of worldwide and some p and I'm done. And I'll have my diploma, but

162
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.350
Michelle: Yeah, no, I'm

163
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.660
Michelle: Good job yeah I when I moved when I was with my father. I was in school.

164
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.150
Michelle: until the very end there.

165
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:10.410
Michelle: The very like probably the last six, six months of my stay with my father before he kicked me out with my mom's I was in school, but I pretty much was ditching all day long.

166
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:21.630
Michelle: And and that's part of the reason why he he kicked me out because I just, I wasn't going to school. He didn't know what to do with me. And then what the summer and a half, because I

167
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:38.100
Michelle: I didn't go to school. I did summer school when I very first got here got got there to California and I did like because my entire freshman year I got involved with an older man when I was 1415

168
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:44.610
Michelle: In Oregon. He was 32 I was working 15 and

169
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.680
Michelle: My father's girlfriend had found out about it.

170
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.760
Michelle: Through her daughter and her daughter was a year and two days older than me and

171
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:16.440
Michelle: Her daughter was seeing the got the guy was seeing friend who was 22 but we were 14 1516 and she was 1516 I was 1450 but anyways. Her mother found out about it and she told my father, and she pressured my folder to press charges against the guy.

172
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:17.910
Michelle: But

173
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:29.520
Michelle: That was run anyways because of all this stuff and all the court and everything, because this was a small town in Oregon where it was front page news. So I got bullied a lot and I got her asked a lot

174
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:41.190
Michelle: In high school, from the family members, you know, because he was he was married. He had three kids, you know, in a small town everybody's mother and sister and all their kids and, you know,

175
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.010

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:58.980
Michelle: Workings. Yeah. So yeah, it was front page news and I got harassed a lot bullied a lot. Well, that was going on. So I pretty much just stared out the window. When I did go to school and I didn't pay attention. I didn't do anything and

178
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.240
Michelle: My friend and I started ditching but you know

179
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:12.810

181
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:42.480
Michelle: And he was married at the time with his first wife and her two boys. And for a while there. We were all doing fancy family counseling and that turned out to be a huge toxic situation with her because

182
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.250

198
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.310
Michelle: Anyways, the first incidents.

199
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.350
Michelle: In this so he

200
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:50.040
Michelle: Her firstborn did some stuff that what he did to some girls. And so, and

201
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.210
Michelle: I remember as a kid when we were on like the church island.

202
00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:08.310
Michelle: They had think I mean they had campers that were just on like all over the place. Cars vehicles tractors all over the property. There's a party who go out on the canoe in the middle. So there's like places you could

203
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:14.310
Michelle: Do some stuff to like people and nobody would even notice. Nobody. We didn't know where you were, but

204
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:21.660
Michelle: I remember seeing him doing something and it didn't click until later on in life but

205
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:31.680
Michelle: When I was a kid I want when I saw it. I just was like, I didn't know what he was doing was wrong, but I'm

206
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.820
Michelle: her oldest son like to kill animals like

207
00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.170
Michelle: Where we lived in Southern California.

208
00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:53.130
Michelle: We would find like like rigs like needles all over the ground all over the place. And he would use these to

209
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.830
Michelle: kill the animals and he would stab them until they died or he would poke their eyes and

210
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:00.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

211
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:12.270
Michelle: But yeah and and so she moved in, she met a guy, and she moved to Colorado because my dad wanted to move to Oregon. He wanted to get away from down there and he wanted to move to Oregon.

212
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:19.740
Michelle: And get the boys into, like, you know, dirt bike riding you know something, you know you wanted, and she she didn't want to move

213
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:28.950
Michelle: And the reason why was because she was she'd she'd been cheating on them all. Anyways, like, yeah, we moved to Oregon and during the move to Oregon.

214
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:43.170
Michelle: He had left my father had left me with one of his buddies while he was moving stuff going and and dealing with the whole wife situation and her kids and all that stuff. He left me with a friend and he ended up from

215
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.170
Michelle: messing around with me doing some stuff to me and

216
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.430
Michelle: I just kind of pretended that I had like slept through it.

217
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.940
Michelle: And when I told my father about it and my grant you know

218
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:15.210
Michelle: Nobody believed me and then later on he had done it to somebody else and tour, she told her parents and her parents out of like had a whole court thing over it and everything and they wanted me to testify and my dad didn't

219
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:25.920
Michelle: Grandparents because I mean if you like his buddy wasn't just some random buddy like his parents were friends with his my grandparents like

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.280
Michelle: Which is, I mean,

222
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:49.650
Michelle: In my opinion, I mean I think back on it now you think like his mom was living with him. Wouldn't she have thought it was weird that, you know, a little girl is sleeping on the floor in his own. You got a spare bedroom or a couch or yeah I look back on that now, and I'm like,

223
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:51.720

277
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:08.730
Michelle: Um, there was a point in time for like maybe a year when I was

278
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.660
Michelle: 1213 where I was cutting myself.

279
00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:18.180
Michelle: But it never was like I'm cutting myself to commit suicide. Right now.

280
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He was to get out of the pain in the inside. Yeah.

281
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:27.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When's the last time that you

282
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: acted in so far.

283
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.180
Michelle: Um,

284
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.970
Michelle: I had

285
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:48.000
Michelle: An incredibly terribly bad argument with my significant other and

286
00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.340
Michelle: I had wanted to do it. And I know I'm

287
00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:02.880
Michelle: I had wrapped the rope around my head, my neck. So, I mean, I can you know

288
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.640
Michelle: Like I was ready to do it.

289
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.950
Michelle: But

290
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.920
Michelle: He taught me down. And I don't know, you can see

291
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how long ago was that

292
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.230
Michelle: All three years like

293
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.990
Michelle: Three, four years. Three years. Three, four years ago, I think.

294
00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:39.270
Michelle: When just before we had just started doing heroin.

295
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:41.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

296
00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But none in the last two weeks.

297
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:46.920
Michelle: No. Okay, good.

298
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:57.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you start having thoughts. I'm going to ask that you either pick up the phone and call bright heart and get myself or somebody on the phone with you to help you walk through it.

299
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:06.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or you go back to the emergency room one or the other, especially if you start developing a plan behind it.

300
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We make that commitment for me.

301
00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.060
Michelle: Yeah, definitely.

302
00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:13.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

303
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:26.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just want to just touch base on one thing and that is for you to be able to start looking at yourself as a survivor, because that's really what you are

304
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.900
Michelle: Through that a lot

305
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and the great part about survivors, Michelle.

306
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that we're warriors.

307
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:44.730
Michelle: I just feel like it's just not enough to survive. But sometimes, like is it really worth it to just survive it mean

308
00:35:45.630 --> 00:36:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You've gone through it. It's over. You don't have to experience most of what you've already went through and the great part about it is that you know you've got this, you know, little girl who you got to protect and love and give her the things that you, you know,

309
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you didn't get, you know,

310
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's an awesome place to be. I just want

311
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Want you to recognize that

312
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:18.300
Michelle: We think about that, too. But I feel like, you know, like it scared me when I found out I was having a girl.

313
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:19.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sir,

314
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.210
Michelle: Yeah, definitely. I didn't, I didn't know I was

315
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.620
Michelle: It scared me when I thought maybe for now because I don't. I've never had a relationship with my mother.

316
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.860
Michelle: My mother never had a relationship with her mother. Yeah.

317
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:39.990
Michelle: Yeah.

318
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.030
You and what

319
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Michelle, you get to break that cycle.

320
00:36:48.180 --> 00:37:02.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get to you get to do something different than what you've ever done or where you come from, you know, and what a great, great thing to be able to be there for your daughter and to give her something different than what you got.

321
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

322
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.720
Michelle: You just, you know, we fear.

323
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.070
Michelle: I'm never going to really give her life that she deserves.

324
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:28.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's kind of amazing because, you know, we think that what that entails is money or, you know, never having enough money, which nobody ever has enough of money. I don't care. You know,

325
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But in reality, you know what she needs most

326
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:40.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is a loving, kind of mom to guide her through all the crap that happens in this world.

327
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.180
Michelle: Yeah, I just worry that i mean

328
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.850
You know,

329
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable.

330
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:58.230
Michelle: Because I

331
00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:19.290
Michelle: In my ways. And I you know I worry that I'm not going to like mentally or if I'm gonna be early and show her that the love and affection that that she needs.

332
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.480
Michelle: Because I don't, I don't know. I you know I

333
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.530
Michelle: Might be parents. The way I was raised in the week you know

334
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:38.940
Michelle: I mean, I had my son until he was, he had just turned three when all that stuff happened to him.

335
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:51.210
Michelle: I don't have. I mean, part of it is like his, his father won't make

336
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.990
Michelle: Every capacity with no set visitation and

337
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.830
Michelle: Just up until recently, like within the last year, he hasn't he hasn't let me

338
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:12.600
Michelle: Let me see him so. And every time that I have seen him recently that the demeanor and then

339
00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:21.330
Michelle: Just the vibe I get is just off where it's like, I don't, I don't know what's going on, you know, but

340
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.800
Michelle: He just turned

341
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.930
Michelle: He just turned eight

342
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.330
Michelle: He's gonna

343
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:32.430
Know,

344
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.610
Michelle: He's he easy

345
00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:38.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, yeah.

346
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.140
Michelle: Easy, um,

347
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.390
Michelle: I had him until he was three. I mean,

348
00:39:46.830 --> 00:40:03.210
Michelle: Robin. I just got divorced when he was when he was three years old and but it was just me and him up. And, you know, up until it was three years old. Because when I was married to my husband, my husband was a long haul truck driver working in the oil fields in North Dakota.

349
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:13.860
Michelle: For the last two years of our marriage he was gone a lot like month at a time and would only be back for like four days at a time.

350
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:18.030
Michelle: So it was just me and my boy and in

351
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.300
Michelle: You know I

352
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.750
Michelle: look back on it, you know, and it's

353
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.540
Michelle: And then you looking now like boys are so much different than girls, they are

354
00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:33.000
They are

355
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is there anything that you think I missed. That's important for us to know about you.

356
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.240
Michelle: Know,

357
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And are you willing to engage in individual therapy.

358
00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.990
Michelle: Yeah I am, yeah.

359
00:40:54.270 --> 00:41:00.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what date and time would be ideal for you. And let me see if I can produce that

360
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:04.620
Michelle: Yeah, right now, so I'm in the middle of moving

361
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.030
Michelle: I may even be moving Oregon.

362
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.820
Michelle: Or maybe even sooner.

363
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:19.020
Michelle: And as far as I know from what bright heart from what Dr. Jamison is told me

364
00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.290
Michelle: They're not wearing, you know, covered in Oregon.

365
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think we're in the process, because one thing I can tell you is that all of my certifications are from Oregon. Okay. So I think that we are in the process of doing that.

366
00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's a plus. Right.

367
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:50.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So let's just kind of play it by ear until you do make that make that move and

368
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:52.920
You know that

369
00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.280

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.570
State stuff and

376

379
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:48.360

392
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.860
Michelle: Yeah, that is like me, just where I'm in my head a lot and you know

393
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.650
Michelle: Obviously I've got the kid running around and stuff as well. But I mean, lately I've tried

394
00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.440
Michelle: tried not to be so.

395
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:35.820
Michelle: Proud to get the tough packed got to get all the stuff ready. I got all the stuff I need to do a lot of work on my schooling. I'm trying to just keep a schedule to where I'm focused and she's on a schedule tour.

Michelle: Yeah, at least I have like some hours by myself at night.

397
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:46.710
Michelle: It's quiet and, you know, I can just sit and relax. Good.

398
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's important time for you to have

399
00:44:49.440 --> 00:45:01.260
Michelle: So like, you know, and I've been. I've been trying to listen to more music and, you know, just, it's the one it's raining here it's it's really, really bad because then she doesn't get to go outside and that makes it even worse.

400
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I know all about a two year old typically

401
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:10.230
Michelle: They need to have lights bright in the house like

402
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.860
Michelle: I think our ceiling should at least be like

403
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:18.750
Michelle: Open. You know, I think that would have a separate night.

404
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.520
Michelle: Yes.

405
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.670

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. That's right.

408
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.090
Michelle: Don't forget that. And whatever you do, you know,

409
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:40.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you start in between now and the time that I see you again. Just keep that month that word inside your head, and that is, you know, your survivor, Michelle.

410
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:51.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With everything that you've experienced and you've been given the gift of this little, you know, baby girl and you get to love her and give her the things that you didn't have when you are a kid.

411
00:45:52.470 --> 00:46:03.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we'll go through this a little bit more. And because I definitely have a lot of experience in this whole area and my life growing up as a lot like yours.

412
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:20.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, so we have that in common. And so I can definitely tell you how I got from that point that you're at, to the point that I'm at and kind of give you some tools to help you along your journey.

413
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:23.850

582
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:58.200

588
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:29.460

590
