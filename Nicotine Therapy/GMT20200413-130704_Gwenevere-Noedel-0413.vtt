Gwenevere Abriel: Time.

3
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.510
Alicia Noedel: Just one of those mornings, where she just wants me

4
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So taking a little time for yourself today.

5
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.470
Alicia Noedel: Oh,

6
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.780
Alicia Noedel: I don't know. Probably going to make some tortillas or something.

7
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay how how how on the surface are your emotions this morning.

8
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.740
Alicia Noedel: I'm

9
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.940
Alicia Noedel: Feeling

10
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.830
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

11
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.940
Hmm.

12
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.520
Alicia Noedel: I didn't get much sleep last night, so I'm a little

13
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's gonna make those emotions pop up pretty quickly.

14
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, we don't have sleep. Okay, now

15
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you already kind of have it in your mind memorized.

16
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The halt acronym.

17
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: H Lt.

18
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's it's a handy one just to put ourselves in really quick check

19
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.260
Alicia Noedel: Everything we worked on it yet.

20
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's just one of those things that we just memorize. It's super convenient for. It's not just for recovery. It's for any kind of how am I going to meet any given moment. So the word halt mean stop. So it's kind of cool because halt means hungry angry lonely tired.

21
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's a cool way to put rate. Okay. Wait, am I reacting kind of based out of am I hungry. Okay, I need to meet that need. First, before I make an important decision.

22
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I, am I angry. Okay, check myself do my breathing.

23
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And my lonely, you know, case where my depression is coming from. Have I taken enough self soothing self care. Okay. Oh, and you. Am I tired.

24
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.210
Alicia Noedel: All man.

25
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be irritable, it's going to be cry. It's going to be real, real quick, rapid cycle of these emotions because when we're tired. Everything's right up there right at the surface. So it's a convenient one for

26
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, all these other things are really sort of fancy, but if we can remember basically help

27
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Run it through what is health stand for, am I hungry, and I agree on time. Okay, let me address those basic needs. First, then, then I can make an important decision.

28
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.140
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

29
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Just throwing it out there lots of those out there to memorize that. That's a pretty handy one

30
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.030
Alicia Noedel: Now that sounds, that sounds really informative.

31
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be a

32
00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.500
Alicia Noedel: Good thing to think about, you know, run through all those before you start thinking that that's how you feel you're like, well, maybe way and what wins it my emotions are just heightened for a different reason.

33
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean why look at your little one right. It's so basic. It's like we address these things right away.

34
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so we address them. And so we can address those in ourselves.

35
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right. I'm opening up a note, let's see, we reviewed three 330 so we don't need to do it today. We can do whatever we want. Now take a look

36
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.460
Alicia Noedel: The lighting for me okay good at.

37
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: All it's beautiful.

38
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.650
Alicia Noedel: Okay, it's snowed last night like crazy. So

39
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

40
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, yeah. Mind. It is so it's so hot here.

41
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.960
But it really

42
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.090
Alicia Noedel: Like how beautiful

43
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let me see.

44
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It or just

45
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.420
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it's really cool.

46
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's cool.

47
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.630
Alicia Noedel: Insulator wish I was in Florida.

48
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's cool, but wish you were somewhere else.

49
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.980
Alicia Noedel: I will shows at Universal Studios.

50
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

51
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Their business must be plummeting.

52
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.640
Alicia Noedel: Oh, yeah.

53
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.300
Probably

54
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Say don't want

55
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Us gathering. That's a huge gathering. Yeah, Mike.

56
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.230
Alicia Noedel: We all year round, because it's so nice.

57
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah, always going going, going, going, we can go anytime

58
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see.

59
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we did. You did some hard work about me but you should

60
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. I think we started developing was it that we were working on the anchor room is that we were doing.

61
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.290
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, we got pretty far. I think

62
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's see.

63
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: ported

64
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Problem with yeast infection house her

65
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: House house. The all the girly girl parks is that infection healing up

66
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.940
Alicia Noedel: They sent me more medicine because of the ones that got the medicine got spilled. And so there wasn't enough for all 14 days.

67
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.490
Alicia Noedel: So they sent me more medicine. I gave her like five more days of it, and she's good right now.

68
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:25.230
Alicia Noedel: She doesn't have any rash in her mouth. And so once we stop giving her them and they said that that medicine causes rashes everywhere else. So once that one went away everything else.

69
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. Okay. Here we go. So you just had to hang in there for that medicine to start working

70
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.580
Yeah.

71
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's hard. Go to see our little babies hurting

72
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.020
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, especially when you there's not much you can do about it.

73
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you did. So try to remember this, right, you had that helpless feeling you persevered, you continue to make the calls and spoke with her, you needed to. And it's being resolved, try to remember those. Okay, they're going to be important when self doubt creeps its way in

74
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, good job, Mom.

75
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

76
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's up to you. I want to be sensitive to

77
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you want to go back and work on this room and the room itself is more about getting to a positive place.

78
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not intended to end in the negative experience. But it doesn't mean along the way. There might be some roller coasters of emotions, we could focus on other things we can come back to this when you've had more sleep is it's up to you. What would you like

79
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.300
Alicia Noedel: I think I'm implying anything

80
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Wonderful. So I'm looking at it now and

81
00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The Pete, there's a few pieces I don't let me just, let me look at my those chunked into to

82
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Just look a little bit

83
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: As I recall, you

84
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: May some amendments to the wrong. We made some amendments on April six,

85
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't think God

86
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Must plan line adult makes a call I say

87
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were able to identify this sort of speaking directly to the. See, who are you talking to, okay, the adults, make the call. I say you need to know.

88
00:07:50.010 --> 00:08:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: She, she meaning you kept it inside every single negative actions affected her. She had to worry about our safety. She even a steal a bag of chips. Instead of playing with Barbies. Why are you acting like your kids.

89
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Should not have had us if you didn't want us need to straighten up

90
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You can lose her to realize how many times she said in a row and wanted to herself. You should be ashamed of yourself. The apparent and reassure her meaning and follow through. Oh, you did some powerful stuff really

91
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Gets it

92
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.120
Alicia Noedel: Done it without you. When that's for sure.

93
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.420
Alicia Noedel: We know where to begin.

94
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is an interesting room and it because it isn't just one thing. It's a lot of things that we haven't even gotten to

95
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Me see have we done the missing misinformation. I don't think we've even gotten to that yet.

96
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's keep going here. Let's see, assertive, you should be. Yep, got the shame the apparent yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep handle your business behind closed doors.

97
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So then there's the Barbie dolls and make believe there's a family. So there's seven Barbies talking to each other.

98
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You had and ended this session, I think you labeled it happy emotion no thoughts of worry and then I wrote to myself continued work he did incomplete activity. Okay, so we did not get there's a couple really big pieces to this that haven't, haven't been done yet.

99
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

100
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just remember though.

101
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's remember the

102
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The resource team.

103
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, slow start for me to

104
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Like today's a hair up kind of day.

105
00:09:44.640 --> 00:10:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back into it, let's let's kind of set intention. Let's get really in touch with the protective figure, and that's the self, making sure and you know that in real time. You know, it comes instinctual Lee. Everybody has everything they need

106
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's also Joaquin when you think of a protective figure. It comes naturally from you and you also really see it in working

107
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

108
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I would die for my family. It's very, it's very real for you and you recognize that self protection and protection of others and you recognize it in yourself, sort of be present with that.

109
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then also on the sillier side right there. Scooby, and I don't know if we want to keep Scooby Doo. I don't know if we needed to pull that one away, since I was a little afraid of the monsters. It's up to you.

110
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably want to keep the silliness of it.

111
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.090
Alicia Noedel: Are you in

112
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life that he's protective

113
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's yeah Sometimes he runs away, doesn't he

114
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.820
Alicia Noedel: I feel like that he doesn't provide

115
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:06.180
Alicia Noedel: What what that what that kind of position needs to be fulfilled.

116
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: He said he does or doesn't

117
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.720
Alicia Noedel: He does it

118
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, look, before we leave. I want to offer one more thing protection sometimes means running away.

119
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.220
Alicia Noedel: Right. Yes. Yeah.

120
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I just thrown it out there that it isn't always stand in front

121
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.520
Alicia Noedel: Oh, your flight.

122
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is. You see it. So you've got the fight. Don't you in there. So maybe Scooby unconsciously was representing room and and then he he books, it

123
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Runs out of there. So we can take it out if you want it, pure and simple will take it out. There was also Clarice Starling as a protecting victims. She's pretty and smart.

124
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So just sit with it for a moment and really want us to go close your eyes and just visualize and see the self, see who are keen

125
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring in Scooby Doo. See if it has a place in this imagery there R amp D times when it's better to run

126
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And Clarice

127
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:21.660
Alicia Noedel: I felt for a really long time that you know that's why I had so much. I think that's why I had such a hard time answering that, when you first brought it up about a protective vigor.

128
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:29.910
Alicia Noedel: Because I've always had such a hard time thinking about anybody being able to protect me more than I can protect myself.

129
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know, that's why this stuff so tricky and make make it seem simple, but it's far more in depth, isn't it.

130
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

131
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.170
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it says, I've never tried to rely on anybody either so

132
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:54.330
Alicia Noedel: You know, thinking about, I've just, you know, I've had one real unreliable figure after another in my life that should have been there to protect me. And so, you know, I'm hesitant to think about

133
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.600
Alicia Noedel: It, you know, what if they're not there.

134
00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.220
Alicia Noedel: When I need them.

135
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so, Lisa. That's why this is imagery and I'm

136
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now notice that what we're doing is I'm not bringing walking and I'm not making you stand up and face yourself with something threatening. This has to do with sort of the neural networks in your brain assessing

137
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: At least in here, even in fantasy. Can you give yourself permission to sit with probably some discomfort of trusting that someone or even in your imagination will be there. So, and you're saying, and now you're saying it's

138
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't been able to do that, but that's the work is see how close you can get to even picturing it

139
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I noticed your eyes stayed open and your mind went to. Yeah, but there's all these times, and kind of yeah but it it. No, no, no.

140
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And not even in imagination and that's why I would invite the closing of the eyes and Justin fantasy.

141
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It means that you can leave the fantasy in the room. If you're not ready to pull your guard down, then that's that's okay too. You get to decide that I'm this is not a hypnotic induction.

142
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like that. This is just the closer and closer that you can give yourself permission to see these strengths. These attributes in your imagination.

143
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do this together, let's come in if you can

144
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me as much or as little as you can keep your eyes closed.

145
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of breathe into it sort of settle in your mind was, was recalling that this is that would be a very risky thing to do. But now, now just listen to my voice kind of notice, is it screechy

146
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it deep is it high pitch just sort of pay attention to what you hear through your ears just tuning in

147
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you hear any feedback through the zoom or maybe some sounds in your room outside of them just use your ears.

148
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. Pay attention to the temperature. Notice how your head may feel with your hood on and versus your face. It feel a different temperature. Pay attention there.

149
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your shoulders back, tummy arms and about those hands today feel differently.

150
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Or they exposed to the air.

151
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: just tuning in taking nice nourishing breaths.

152
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to picture this room.

153
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This anchor room.

154
00:15:43.530 --> 00:16:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The safe place. It will have everything that you need it. Nothing complete and we'll get there from here. It's a process that whatever comes up where it's not easy. Why then that's right on time and it informs the work we're doing cannot possibly do this wrong.

155
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: All of it is part of the process. It will take as long or as little time as as needed.

156
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's just right for you.

157
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: If you continue to be difficult or maybe some pieces will feel easier than others. And that's on time.

158
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So see if you can notice this fireplace that you had put in there on the front wall in the room next to the staircase.

159
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And has that mantle rocks, much like your auntie Connie's

160
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice

161
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's still summons up this sense of calm safe, stable cozy.

162
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself permission to enjoy it without worrying.

163
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: How long it will last just see if you can sit with enjoying and being with it.

164
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Comforting.

165
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Template form.

166
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a smell of faint smoke from the fire.

167
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a couch maybe

168
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: A big black suede couch with little throw pillows and a lush blanket.

169
00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: sectional couch with a long L shape for you to lay down full size bed directly across from fireplace a carpet to start gray or black curly fluffy and soft.

170
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how it feels to be present.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: With the blanket, the fire.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The suede couch.

174
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to your body. If you're relaxing calm and safe.

175
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: With special attention, possibly to your legs.

176
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: See if they're allowed to settle in.

177
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: See if the stomach is level.

178
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's coming up for you right now.

179
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.540
Alicia Noedel: I think going to try and figure out

180
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.160
Alicia Noedel: My protective figure and think more about it.

181
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.760
Alicia Noedel: On my own time.

182
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.310
Alicia Noedel: Okay, just because I don't want to waste our time.

183
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.970
Alicia Noedel: Welcome, my mind drawing blinks like this.

184
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, you're where you distracted by

185
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Not having the protective figure in the room.

186
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.690
Alicia Noedel: I just have it empty. No, no, no, I'm not distracted by it at all. I just, you know,

187
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know.

188
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.440
Alicia Noedel: I know that you want me to have one so

189
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I do, but the fact that it's not there is just fine. What I'm wanting is is for us for you to be in that room. So I noticed your mind went to. You don't want to waste time with that. It's okay. I moved on to this other piece. It's fine. Okay, definitely add to it.

190
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I'll leave it the way it is and then will correct it is recommended as we go along.

191
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.730
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

192
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. You're so

193
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Calm. Okay. You do. Okay.

194
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

195
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got calm and check check your body that's been a pretty good messenger for you to check and see

196
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Get eggs in hands are still

197
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, like some hands. How about how's the stomach.

198
00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.280
Alicia Noedel: Level.

199
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stomach. Were you able to picture being on that full size L shaped Ottoman okay

200
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the emotion.

201
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.800
Alicia Noedel: Emotion right

202
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It is. It's a good one. Why not

203
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:32.580
And

204
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact is, your hands and legs are still your stomach is level, that might be a sign that that's exactly what that is is at ease. Um,

205
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there any thoughts of worry right now.

206
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay.

207
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

208
00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to call if we were able to see the door. Did we get that far.

209
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to find it in here.

210
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The exit. Yeah.

211
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:05.640
Alicia Noedel: The trap door.

212
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, is there a tractor.

213
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.040
Alicia Noedel: We were yeah we made one

214
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can we see about chapter, chapter

215
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: See, tell me about it.

216
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.500
Alicia Noedel: Right in the middle of the room.

217
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.960
Alicia Noedel: It's like a safe kinda

218
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.580
Alicia Noedel: Little they see

219
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Where does it lead to

220
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.980
Alicia Noedel: Like a lockbox, I guess.

221
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

222
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.020
Alicia Noedel: But it's built into the floor.

223
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: trap door hidden from view has magic wand. Yeah.

224
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We did do the misinformation. We got it right here. So your misinformation was I pretended nothing is going on.

225
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

226
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's broken into so many different pieces in here. So you got all I threw down less of while everything's fine identity foreign

227
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that position anymore. I can handle things more you don't feel helpless anymore wish somebody would have protected and cared enough to stop putting drugs.

228
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, putting drugs before her tired of being hungry every day head shaking. No, I'm just, it's hard to think about it. I wish they could hug feel better trust the hug all the tears and insecurities being scared in the vault. Okay, so that's where you put it all.

229
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So then we amended it and we've got the fireplace.

230
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

231
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think what what's left is that sense of

232
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Project pretending that nothing's wrong and as if doubting that you were exaggerating. What you're perceiving that

233
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do with this idea that you were exaggerating just that need to live on. Does that assessment that

234
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: No I don't either. Oh, what can we do to maybe get it. Is it out of the vaults, make it disappear, remembering that you can use magic to get rid of it.

235
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think maybe we'll do it through conversation so

236
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Does

237
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The little girl does Alice still believe it.

238
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.840
Alicia Noedel: No.

239
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so where did that belief that well, I must be just blowing this up so big.

240
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I just pretend like nothing's wrong.

241
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of that go happened to it.

242
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it. So who has it then still, is it still around. You don't know how it's gone. I'm maybe that's less important than that, it's gone. But is it gone

243
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.980
Alicia Noedel: Through me. Yes.

244
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what about for out

245
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:24.990
Alicia Noedel: I don't know.

246
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.340
Alicia Noedel: It's not like that for so long.

247
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.820
Alicia Noedel: I guess it's not

248
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back into this room and be present with Alice

249
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of being her right that age nine, that that sort of

250
00:24:51.630 --> 00:25:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have other things in the room, not just what Elisa would want to check check in and see if that sense of I doubt myself my own perspective and perception at age nine, what do you think Alice would want in the room.

251
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:27.300
Alicia Noedel: At the time I was I was honestly just happy, you know, with a one place to be and a

252
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.460
Alicia Noedel: full stomach. But you know, I would have wanted to

253
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:43.650
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, of course I was a little kid. I wanted you know all the new toys that I would see and on TV and stuff. Okay, but

254
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.470
Alicia Noedel: I would have just been happy.

255
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.130
Alicia Noedel: Warm and fed and safe.

256
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.810
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, okay. Nothing in, you know, in an empty room.

257
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.820
Alicia Noedel: On concrete, you know,

258
00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.080
Alicia Noedel: As long as I was safe.

259
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I know that's your minimum, but this is where you get to indulge in more. I'm not going to tell anyone. You're not going to be considered selfish for it.

260
00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean that all of a sudden, you won't appreciate and stay in gratitude, that's not going to be an automatic thing that happens just because you sit here and fantasy with me and in your mind.

261
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we, we say, well, this is the bar. This is all I deserve.

262
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I should be happy with just the bare minimum, and I didn't even get

263
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Not even in fantasy. You can't give yourself permission.

264
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's try a little bit together. Okay.

265
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We used to have this curly fluffy carpet and now we're back down to concrete again. Right.

266
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.700
Alicia Noedel: No, I won't fit.

267
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there we go. We even had some Barbies. Yeah.

268
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.240
Alicia Noedel: I want toys in it.

269
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so let's dress. Those Barbies. They're like, was it seven or nine of them interacting as a family. Lots of family around in Barbies. And so what did they

270
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.590
Said,

271
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.560
I don't remember.

272
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.660
Alicia Noedel: I think I yeah I would play pretend a lot. That's right. Yeah.

273
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's the storyline of this pretend game, get yourself into battle that

274
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.210
Alicia Noedel: I'm trying to think about what I used to

275
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.820
Alicia Noedel: Play about

276
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What don't force it. This is why I try and tell people this is not memory, you're pushing memory. And I'd like you to go give yourself open up your mind even close your eyes and I want you to just see it, feel it here at, be it.

277
00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: All those Barbies. You're not distracted by any kind of temperature concern. You're not distracted by an empty tummy. You have a full time. In fact, if you want to see food around. You want a fridge in that room, why not

278
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean you even have it in there, you know,

279

Alicia Noedel: A life like that.

297
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.450

298
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Memory.

299
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, it's a different. It's a different part of the brain, if we pull from what you want. Okay, so hang on to it tight and it does take effort. It'll drift off to comparing to

300
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.240
The fantasy and one

301
00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:02.520

Alicia Noedel: And kids.

333
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:48.450

Gwenevere Abriel: So check in with Alice again just sort of be present, be in that room on the couch.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Full size bed front of the fire.

341
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get a sense of what's going on outside the room.

342
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside outside or anything.

343
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside that's

344
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Going on.

345
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.560
Alicia Noedel: It feel like the reason why the room feel so safe is because the outside is so unknown.

346
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.530
Alicia Noedel: Anything could happen.

347
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.870
Alicia Noedel: outside of this room.

348
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's safe for inside

349
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.330
I'm

350
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to stay with that for a little bit. Okay.

351
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't forget that you have access to that magic but I'd like you to consider now just be present with this nine year old Alice just being with her.

352
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And that there's a real sense of sure yeah it's safe in here and and there's even an I don't know what's out there, but you're not preoccupied with it.

353
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: As long as you're inside. That's the sense. I'm getting I don't have to be worried. So I don't know, but I know I'm saying here.

354
00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to catch your first thought.

355
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Who could handle being outside

356
00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.110
Alicia Noedel: Adult me

357
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So can you Alice. See if you can ask or invite in or in some way communicate with Elisa around how on earth does she sort of handle being out there.

358
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to catch your first thought.

359
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:57.780
Alicia Noedel: The first thing I thought about was, um, being aware of your surroundings.

360
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:04.290
Alicia Noedel: Okay, being aware of what the light is happening around you at all times.

361
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get in conversation. So let's see if Alice has a question or here's something from Alessia it's going to be a first person conversation like

362
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: HEY, ALICE THIS IS WHAT YOU DO boo boo boo talking directly tour anyone listening will think you're insane because you're talking to yourself, but that's okay. You can tell them your therapist made you do it.

363
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So, see what comes up. Is it, Alex. The question. At least you knows what to say. See what see what just happened because it was

364
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Being aware of surroundings. But how did, how did that conversation happen. Let me hear

365
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.460
Alicia Noedel: She just looks

366
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.740
Alicia Noedel: At me like

367
00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:01.860
Alicia Noedel: It's crazy that I just came inside from

368
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.500
Alicia Noedel: The big world outside

369
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.350
Alicia Noedel: And see how I'm able to do it.

370
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how you're talking about it as if it happens.

371
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Island more direct directly. You don't know who's going to talk if it's the child or fits the adult but just start speaking from that person.

372
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:25.710
Alicia Noedel: Got me

373
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.790

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

377
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:41.910
Alicia Noedel: One day you'll be able to do anything and protect yourself from anything

378
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.550
Alicia Noedel: And you'll

379
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:51.900
Alicia Noedel: Be able to conquer whatever you want. Even if it's the world.

380
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:55.470
Alicia Noedel: You'll be able to do it.

381
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Now look at Alice. Does she believe you.

382
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.070
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

383
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at her face.

384
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.010
Alicia Noedel: Smiley

400
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:47.940

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.460
Alicia Noedel: Be with her face to face. Yeah. She'll get

402
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: A chance

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:27.570
Alicia Noedel: Every day.

408
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds like an adult, but

409
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Play. There we go. Yeah, so let's get to play. What do you, what's the first thing that comes up.

410
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.090
Alicia Noedel: Please play

411
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Is really important. I really want to understand this.

412
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So she's reassured. She gets her hug. She feels right, I guess she's got this love and she's got a smile. She

413
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Believes

414
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That she will be able to do it yourself.

415
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: There's one more part though, for we go, right there. Can at least to offer something to Alice around

416
00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How she can already

417
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Go play

418
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.300
Alicia Noedel: Woody me

419
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's try this on want you to imagine that there's something appealing outside. Maybe there's a playground out there a pool or I don't know what

420
00:40:54.390 --> 00:41:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a group of kids or you know there's ideal affectionate parenting figures. I'm not sure what's out there, but whatever play is out there.

421
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: To sort of toggle between the possibility that Alice could go out and play.

422
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then come back to her. Is it a yes she can or no, and maybe we need to kind of explore what Alice needs in order to play outside

423
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So what comes up with this idea of going outside. Are you knew from the other things we were talking about. But what happens is I brought that up.

424
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.190
Alicia Noedel: Safety because I'm with

425
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:47.370
Alicia Noedel: Alicia.

426
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

427
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:59.160
Alicia Noedel: Are you would click it, go to the pool, and it really would have fun and it would be okay and everything will be fine.

428
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go. I'm with her. I'm safe and I can go to the pool.

429
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you check in with your body and see if anything's left that's that's not quite the full truth, see if anything just got a little charged up

430
00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that seems true

431
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A

432
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Glass Door currently closed locked. I can see the door now getting a wooden white glass handle door. Okay. Wouldn't white door.

433
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see it. Okay. So how would you you to

434
00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Get to the pool. How would you do it go nice and slow. How'd you get it done.

435
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:17.880
Alicia Noedel: GET EVERYTHING SITS ON and then put her clothes on over, make sure we have all our stuff. We need to take to us. So lower little toys that are sunscreen and our towels.

436
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.810
Alicia Noedel: And we go up the stairs.

437
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.390
Alicia Noedel: To the door.

438
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.950
Alicia Noedel: And Alice has the key Alicia has the heat for it.

439
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:36.120
Alicia Noedel: And then we go out. HI, ERIC No lead that leads us to

440
00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.150
Alicia Noedel: Ya le just to the back door.

441
00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:40.980
I guess.

442
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:57.420
Alicia Noedel: We go outside in the pool is just down the block. So we walk down the sidewalk and hold hands with Alice on the inside the farthest away from the street and the cars.

443
00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.490
Alicia Noedel: And we get the full

444
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And what is Alice to

445
00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:16.020
Alicia Noedel: Swim and play into handstands and cartwheels and

446
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:22.020
Alicia Noedel: somersaults in the water from flips and backflips

447
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And is Elise, you're watching

448
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:26.520
Alicia Noedel: You know,

449
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.010
Alicia Noedel: In the pool with her.

450
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: In school with her.

451
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So interacting with her playing with her.

452
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And how it both of you feeling in the pool playing

453
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:42.780
Alicia Noedel: Happy

454
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, happy and warm.

455
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.310
Alicia Noedel: Water, the sun beating down on me, my shoulders.

456
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So what does Alice know

457
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: About Elise, yeah. That helps her feel safe.

458
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.400
Alicia Noedel: She wouldn't let anything happen.

459
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.280
Alicia Noedel: Because if we were to happen to her.

460
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.650
Alicia Noedel: It would affect both of those.

461
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And did Alexia know what to do on your own or she have to get a masters degree and how to

462
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:42.330
Alicia Noedel: Know,

463
00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: She just

464
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.860
Alicia Noedel: Knows that it

465
00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.730
Alicia Noedel: gets hurt. She gets her

466
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.840
Alicia Noedel: She will protect you at all costs.

467
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And does that allow Alice a chance to play.

468
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:12.840
Alicia Noedel: Yes.

469
00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And again, just to say it again to delete to have to learn

470
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Where those lines were safety is versus danger.

471
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:25.080
Alicia Noedel: No.

472
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.520
She knows

473
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Does this Alice know what safe.

474
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:33.840
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

475
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:37.740
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

476
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, for nine year old. What a nine year old know and not quite as much experience, but having to do with does she need to pretend

477
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That something isn't

478
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it is what is it about Elisa that gives Alice the safety.

479
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That shares

480
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: deceitfulness okay

481
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.500
Alicia Noedel: Show lies between us.

482
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:05.340
Yeah.

483
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay to be angry.

484
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.680
Alicia Noedel: Yes.

485
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how about sad and scared.

486
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yeah.

487
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Can she say I'm hungry, I want to snack or I want to eat. Can she say that

488
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:30.480
Alicia Noedel: It's not about her being able to say it's about it. The need being fulfilled.

489
00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:33.240
Alicia Noedel: More for me.

490
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:43.800
Alicia Noedel: It's grown all day long laundry laundry. There's nothing. There's that the meat. There is no money. There's no money, you know,

491
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's a noticing have a full tummy a full time. It's a noticing a Reno.

492
00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: On

493
00:47:54.300 --> 00:48:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm full. I'm full. Just enough just just right not over full and not grumbling.

494
00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And this Alice know how to register a little bit of hunger, not the starvation hunger, but hunger, just a little hungry, like, Hey, I'm bad, I'm starting to get hungry. She knows

495
00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, she take care of herself.

496
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:22.260
Yes.

497
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:24.150
Alicia Noedel: Guys do

498
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

499
00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's spend a little bit of time kind of talking about that.

500
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's sounding a little bit like

501
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What come out of this fantasy here for a second, just talking real time together.

502
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That tries to tell me, tell me more about what that phrase kind of means in current day

503
00:48:52.260 --> 00:49:05.250
Alicia Noedel: I feel like I put myself on the back burner a lot to take care of everybody else and you know that's kind of like where I'm supposed to be right now, just because you know I do have to make my daughter.

504
00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:20.250
Alicia Noedel: She's you know priority number one, so her needs to come before mine, you know, but I do try and at least like once a week you know do little things for myself that I don't do every day.

505
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what those things are.

506
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.180
Alicia Noedel: Like I haven't done it in like two weeks, but I'm paint my nails or

507
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:32.190
Alicia Noedel: I'm

508
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:37.320
Alicia Noedel: To like a little extra like hair mask or

509
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.180
Alicia Noedel: Face Mask, stuff like that.

510
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So it might be do

511
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there might be time for that.

512
00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:52.320
Definitely

513
00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you been journaling.

514
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:02.460
Alicia Noedel: Know,

515
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: writing stories or poetry.

516
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.990
Alicia Noedel: Working on a little canvas for the baby.

517
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah.

518
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:16.080
Alicia Noedel: With a quote on it. Yeah, wanted to paint her something so she got forever.

519
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.120
Cute.

520
00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So you got some creative stuff going on.

521
00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:38.130
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I was gonna paint that and then I got it all drawn out and then it opened my acrylics that I realized, you know, I've had these acrylics for like five years and they were in my storage for a really long time. So from it getting hot and cold hot and cold. They dried out.

522
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

523
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.170
Alicia Noedel: So I don't have any paint.

524
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't. Can we can't add water. It just won't work.

525
00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:46.860
Alicia Noedel: No acrylic paint gets like rubber

526
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.030
Add

527
00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Them are

528
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

529
00:50:55.290 --> 00:51:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Last, last week I talked about with Houston integrating the imagery of the resource singers and the belly breathing.

530
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: As we leave today and I know you said I want to spend some time on my own really sort of developing this protective figure. What did you notice about

531
00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened today as we near the end.

532
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:19.080
Alicia Noedel: We kind of like

533
00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.780
Alicia Noedel: The fact that I'm

534
00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:32.790
Alicia Noedel: My own protected figure for young for, you know, past me in the past.

535
00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:46.710
Alicia Noedel: But you know, I can only protect myself so much in the, in the present, you know, as much as I can present myself, you know, I couldn't. I mean, I don't know if that makes sense.

536
00:51:47.790 --> 00:52:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I think, I think I'm hearing it is clear how you can protect your daughter, but you're still a little vague on how to manage adult boundaries limit setting self care my hearing even close to that.

537
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:08.820
Alicia Noedel: Um, yeah, I guess I'm

538
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:18.120
Alicia Noedel: I mean, I'm happy being being in I sell content is a good word. I guess with me being my own

539
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.420
Alicia Noedel: Particular figure

540
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know you're not the first one to do that. And isn't that really what I'm up to, anyway.

541
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

542
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So absolutely. I'm thrilled.

543
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it is you. It's all you. Even if you had picked the Hulk. It's still you

544
00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, we see in the Hulk this perfection. This this clarity.

545
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Of safety and we

546
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:52.920
Alicia Noedel: Don't feel like that strengthen yourself already

547
00:52:54.420 --> 00:53:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, if we think if we can recognize it in the Hulk right I'm exaggerating it, but we can recognize it.

548
00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: We can see it in ourselves, you may not know that. But that's the truth. And so you're even closer to it. You really recognize it in yourself.

549
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And so that's that's beautiful. And I think you said it yourself. You're like think it's kind of neat that I am my protective here, but then you digress a little bit

550
00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what I didn't quite something about, I can do it for my daughter, I can do it for Alice rather I can do it for Alice, but

551
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you as an adult.

552
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:37.410
Alicia Noedel: I mean like to child, you know,

553
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:42.210
Alicia Noedel: A good strong positive, you know,

554
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.800
Alicia Noedel: Figure a role model is like a superhero in their eyes.

555
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

556
00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:57.900
Alicia Noedel: Wait, but for an adult, you know, you're just you. That's what I. That's what I meant. I'm not a superhero in my own eyes, but

557
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:03.480
Alicia Noedel: I didn't know if that would be a problem with working this program. That's what I'm

558
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh well.

559
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You will find out it working the program, it's going to be something like

560
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to run into. I'm not enough you'll either run into something like that or you'll be excited and you'll be in that you know that growth mindset, you'll be excited about learning and oh boy, I want to learn this and master this

561
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But your mind goes to boy, I sure wish it was this and you get

562
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That

563
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Done still hurts. And that's the work I'm working with. You want to put it in the past, but over and over again. It will take effort to go to

564
00:54:53.880 --> 00:55:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, haven't done it yet. What do I want to do and you force your mind to do it. It's not going to come naturally to you, but it does take effort and that's that's the thing that people think, Oh, well, it's supposed to just be come easy. No, you're having to push away a lot of negative history.

565
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe five times more than this person.

566
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Or 10 times less than the other person. I don't know what the number is, but it's going to take effort longer broken with you. We all do it. We have to prioritize and budget our mental energy and say rat, and it is it is one thing to see the urgency of the needs of a baby.

567
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see it clear as day. And what about what's important to you.

568
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You may never feel it as urgent it is it important, it's still deserving of energy and that's where I'm coming in like rah rah just going by, you can do it, you know, and so it's

569
00:55:52.080 --> 00:56:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: There may be times where an urgent, it might be urgent and keep an eye out for those are the ones and you darn straight. It's time to paint those toes.

570
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you start no time and no rest no sleep no eat feeling lonely deprived. Now, you're not going to be as emotionally available to your daughter. You are central to this working

571
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You do, you do have to be

572
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Taken care of in order to best take care of your daughter is the truth.

573
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:26.880
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, you're right.

574
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see an opportunity to carve out some time for rest. I better run and run this group. I'm a minute late

575
00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we meet again at this time on Monday 20 x one day. Sure.

576
00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:57.390
