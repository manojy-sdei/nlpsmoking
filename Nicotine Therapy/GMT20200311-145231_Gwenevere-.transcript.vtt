00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:35.880
Ashley Bitakis: I would say, though.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.730
Ashley Bitakis: Maybe four or five days.

303
00:31:54.870 --> 00:32:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, you've got Anthony age seven, you've got Levi.

304
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: John h3.

305
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.970
Ashley Bitakis: He's for now.

306
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.500
Okay.

307
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Cute, cute. Cute. Stand with your mom.

308
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.590
Ashley Bitakis: With my grandmother

309
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandmother. That's right. You said that

310
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And and

311
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Anthony's with our tube.

312
00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:21.960
Ashley Bitakis: Is

313
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Where is the father of these children, these days, where is he living

314
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:53.400
Ashley Bitakis: We're, we're assuming he's in Virginia, because we haven't seen him or heard about him, but his locations really unknown.

315
00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Was last time I talked to him.

316
00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.150
Oh, gosh.

317
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:03.870
Ashley Bitakis: Maybe six September of

318
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.400
Ashley Bitakis: Last year,

319
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: There was some goings ons, but we can check

320
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.260
Ashley Bitakis: Out there was a lot of harassment and

321
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:30.840
Ashley Bitakis: Jogging it taking the kids. I think the last time I talked to you.

322
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.460
Ashley Bitakis: We, we haven't seen him since then. So

323
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You want any other medicine right now.

324
00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:42.930
You know,

325
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:52.410
Ashley Bitakis: It will I do I'm having a lot of trouble sleeping, you can have steadily my mind my bed. So I did take

326
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.640
Ashley Bitakis: What is it like Waldron. It's like a sleep aid.

327
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.280
Ashley Bitakis: Okay, yeah, but um yeah I took it took, like, three of those last night.

328
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.020
Ashley Bitakis: Literally the day hadn't really taken a vacation.

329
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna make me your

330
00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And even goes through tele health, you can make someone yawn. That's amazing.

331
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Was my mind. We are just such social creatures we humans.

332
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.940
Really see

333
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Any sort of events significant events.

334
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: happened over the last

335
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Couple months.

336
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.110
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, we're currently homeless.

337
00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what do you sort of attribute that to

338
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.920
Ashley Bitakis: I mean strictly to addiction.

339
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:48.750
Okay.

340
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not with your children. I noticed

341
00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.800
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, it's, it's for the best.

342
00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:05.700
Ashley Bitakis: That we Anthony Kentucky can't continue to go to school and then leave. I started school now being mobile. We didn't have the transportation to provide

343
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.950
Ashley Bitakis: Education to them. So then being with Nana right now is the best

344
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:17.490
Ashley Bitakis: Which is hard to say because her and I still don't quite get along, but

345
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.780
Ashley Bitakis: For the sake of the kids we're making it work.

346
00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about how you change people, places and things

347
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:46.950
Ashley Bitakis: So places we, you know, have not lived with Nana. Should we won't live with Nana.

348
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.480
Ashley Bitakis: over previous friends.

349
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.220
Ashley Bitakis: You know, or or connections.

350
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.260
Ashley Bitakis: We've gotten rid of don't talk to

351
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:09.990
Ashley Bitakis: So social life or any kind of dealer that I know don't talk to anymore.

352
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.020
Ashley Bitakis: Or don't know how to contact

353
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.190
Ashley Bitakis: We're in a new part of town. So location wise.

354
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.710
Ashley Bitakis: Teaching changing location. It was, was a big. It's a big thing also

355
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:30.750
Ashley Bitakis: Not living with Nana's I'm it's it's more of a positive thing than it is anything else.

356
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, homeless will, where are you right now.

357
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: at a motel. Okay. And so that's where I'm hearing. I need to get a job, so that you can get your own place. Is that what I'm hearing

358
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.060
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, and get her kids back

359
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, with

360
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, did any legal events happen that would preclude you from being with your kids.

361
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was your decision. And I noticed she said it was because you wanted them to be in a school setting it was not. You didn't say it had anything to do with

362
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your substance use.

363
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:32.550
Ashley Bitakis: Well, being in a motel also and doing drugs with two kids in the same room that's just too close. There's not enough space to get away with that.

364
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:45.180
Ashley Bitakis: So having them not be exposed to my addiction in one little room is near to impossible for the best that they weren't with us at this time.

365
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so the phone number that you have. Do you anticipate. It's going to be the number you're going to have for maybe another month or more

366
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.200
Ashley Bitakis: This number this number will most likely be long lasting.

367
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:15.090
Ashley Bitakis: I actually have another phone another phone number that I can provide to you after Saturday. I'm going to be able to have my own like my own phone

368
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, I think what I'll do is I'll wait to hear that one.

369
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That'll be the one. Maybe that you and I can text confirmation numbers around scheduling.

370
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.080
Ashley Bitakis: Right, okay.

371
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

372
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you leave town.

373
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Couple months ago.

374
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.020
Ashley Bitakis: James had a job opportunity in Flagstaff

375
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.200
Ashley Bitakis: Arizona. Okay.

376
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:55.710
What happened.

377
00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:05.700
Ashley Bitakis: His contract ended within like three weeks to a month of employment, we had a comeback.

378
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: How's your self esteem zero to 10 these days.

379
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.370
Ashley Bitakis: I mean it's it's up and down and

380
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.460
Ashley Bitakis: It's all over the place. Some

381
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.550
Ashley Bitakis: Some days I feel like

382
00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:42.120
Ashley Bitakis: You know, I guess I better go myself and others.

383
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But not give me a number zero to 10

384
00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:51.570
Ashley Bitakis: So my highest level of self esteem zero 10 will probably sit at a good five

385
00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:55.770
Ashley Bitakis: Okay, my lowest would be definitely zero

386
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We're seeing each other, twice a week.

387
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if that might be a good idea until you get some more stable.

388
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you be able to do that and still be looking for a job.

389
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:33.120
Ashley Bitakis: I would have done a lot of looking for a job. It's just a missing puzzle piece to

390
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:46.440
Ashley Bitakis: To to get out there and actually get it so I you know I like to say I could get a job pretty easily. But then again, I haven't worked in over a year, so I don't

391
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

392
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this, let's do, let's write a couple goals.

393
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want

394
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: As you know, those are really important for steering what we focus on

395
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about what you want.

396
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: For your life, the things you want to work on.

397
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Try and think in terms of maybe something you want to do more of or something you want to do less of, and let's see if we can create a goal that can can kind of drive our work together when something you want to do more of

398
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:30.180
Ashley Bitakis: We do more, more productivity inside and outside the home.

399
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be more productive from Doc.

400
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll start with in the home.

401
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that mean,

402
00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.310
Ashley Bitakis: I'm it's just far too easy for me just to stay in bed curl up and

403
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.750
Ashley Bitakis: And just stay there, you know, for 48 hours straight.

404
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So this getting a job is going to represent for you.

405
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Productivity right

406
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

407
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You were saying something earlier about you've been looking, but it's one thing to look. So where were you looking

408
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:33.030
Ashley Bitakis: Location of our motel is in a prime location to get a little, you know, like a little jobs, something that's simple such as cash cheering at sprouts is where I'm really hoping to actually get that job.

409
00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Application at sprouts.

410
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.010
Ashley Bitakis: Yes, they did.

411
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: When was that

412
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.240
Ashley Bitakis: I finished the application yesterday.

413
00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Excellent.

414
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.280
Ashley Bitakis: Yeah, it's exciting.

415
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you talk to anybody over there.

416
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:51.660
No.

417
00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.190
Ashley Bitakis: My anticipation, depending on how today kind of went

418
00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:09.570
Ashley Bitakis: Through filling up to even leaving the room, I would like to go in there. Okay. And it's and it's right there by Smith, too. So I kind of thought, if I had that hope of

419
00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:21.990
Ashley Bitakis: Maybe getting some medication from you guys. I did get that gets them to drink sit for a minute. Relax, think what I'm going to say and then go into sprouts on the way back to my room.

420
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And today do background check, is that going to be an issue. I can't remember that history.

421
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.170
Ashley Bitakis: No, I don't have. I've never been convicted of anything.

422
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.070
Ashley Bitakis: I've been charged and never convicted

423
00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now tell me what you mean more about I want to be more productive in the home. See if you can identify more about what that means. Or we could drop that. Because what I have is I want a little job that's very tangible

424
00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We can also drop. I want to be more productive in the home, we can change that all together. If you want to pull it back.

425
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.250
Ashley Bitakis: I'm sorry, wait.

426
00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:08.730
Ashley Bitakis: What was the last thing you said

427
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's come up with another goal, maybe, maybe a mental health goal, maybe something around feelings, emotions and substance use the word somewhere in there.

428
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.820
Ashley Bitakis: We're just going to have to close this.

429
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.700
Ashley Bitakis: So as a goal for feelings and emotions and my substance abuse.

430
00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Will will pull those apart when you think about your emotional growth.

431
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychological growth.

432
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a very big conversation. But from your perspective, what would you like to do more of

433
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:53.790
Ashley Bitakis: I have a huge just attachment. I've become very just attached to every everything and everybody around me.

434
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what is, what do you want

435
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.470
Ashley Bitakis: I'm sorry.

436
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.490
Ashley Bitakis: I want to become more

437
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:06.990
Ashley Bitakis: Attached

438
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:10.800
Ashley Bitakis: To the people, my husband, my children.

439
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's talk about what group, you could attend

440
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: These are some options.

441
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You might want to write them down. You have paper and pen.

442
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.030
Ashley Bitakis: Right right out to the bathroom. I do.

443
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:52.470

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The address of the prescription. You can go into virtual clinic and tell them, hey, this is the pharmacy. I found the address with your first task as soon as you end with me.

517
00:52:53.730 --> 00:53:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Find the address of that Smith's because that's going to go faster. That order is going to go in faster as soon as the physician knows where to send

518
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.310
Ashley Bitakis: You soon as we hang up. I will send it to you. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: And then if something goes wrong and you don't get like when you call the pharmacy and say, hey, is there an order and if it hasn't gone in, in the next you know couple hours, I would say, I don't know what her schedule is like

520
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:19.650
Ashley Bitakis: You can

521
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Text me and say, hey, I called the pharmacy. There's nothing there.

522
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:24.960
Ashley Bitakis: Thank you. Thank you.

523
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for now it's not forever. But right now I want to make sure you're getting that

524
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:31.890

526
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The

527
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to see it doesn't look like you've met with a doctor, yet it's not right.

528
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.730
Ashley Bitakis: No, no. Not this time around. Correct. Okay.

529
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so they're going to need to meet with you and she may end up saying I can't do it until she meets with you. So I don't know what the response is going to be. I was under the assumption that

530
00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: They had done a health and physical, but I'm looking in the record doesn't look like it looks like we're we're meeting first so

531
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder why they didn't set that up for you.

532
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:16.260
Ashley Bitakis: Maybe, I don't know, maybe they just assumed because it was on the program before I have no idea. Yeah.

533
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not on you that's on on now. My guest to know what what the deal. I'm just going to type something to Angelina, she's our sort of case Navigator. Let me just see what she says. Okay.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.470
Ashley Bitakis: Okay.

535
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:31.350

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. You've got my cell phone. It sounds like there's a couple little things that need to happen, but that doesn't mean it can't happen right away. Maybe the doc can meet with you today that might move it along.

539
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:12.690
Ashley Bitakis: OK.

540
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So the number that you are at is, let me see what they've got in the record here.
