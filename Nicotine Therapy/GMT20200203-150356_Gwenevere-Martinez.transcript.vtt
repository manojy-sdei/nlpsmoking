Gwenevere Abriel: So you guys are getting sec

13
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.320

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.690
rochelle: Don't know, huh, yeah.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.800
rochelle: Yeah, call just feeling lousy. Yeah.

17
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the season for it.

18
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.620
rochelle: Yeah, well, my nephew's had walking pneumonia.

19
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

20
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.630
So I'm

21
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.160
rochelle: Just kind of hoping we don't doesn't lead to that.

22
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So while I'm opening up this note where you have remind me, are you on iPad or laptop.

23
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Laptop. Beautiful. Okay, so it's already sort of wide enough. That's great.

24
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And looks like we did a lot of preparation before

25
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: A container which you mentioned is a tough shed made of wood, about eight by 10 and there's a sense of

26
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.360
Peace, a

27
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense of peace, I, I'm assuming it's in it. And there's a we have a distancing metaphor, which is sort of when you need to. If there's a dis

28
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A distressing experience of thought an emotion or memory. You can sort of picture camping and there's a stream mountain behind it and maybe you could picture something sort of floating away down the stream.

29
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You also have an I'll probably want to be referencing those which is your team right of this protective figure of mom always having your back no matter what.

30
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: This nurturing figure. This is quality of grandma always there to talk to available to you to vent, much like a mother figure

31
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's also this wise figure which your step dad has that quality.

32
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

33
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It just so I can get a sense of kind of what is current and up to date.

34
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Has anything come up around your acts.

35
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And for you, Rochelle. When you think about your x, is it more distressing for you to think about something in the past with her something that gets triggered in your current life or when you look into the future.

36
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think of her what's what's more distressing.

37
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.610
rochelle: I don't know if it's just like the

38
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.980
rochelle: Anxiety because I haven't seen her so long. I don't know if it's a stress, but it's a

39
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Call it anxiety and is it more about thinking about the past, or is it a what if into the future.

40
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.210
rochelle: No, it's not. It's not like

41
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.530
rochelle: Into the future. I could see cuz like

42
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.170
rochelle: I moved on and I have

43
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.200
rochelle: I'm living my life and I'm happy. You know, I mean, I think it's just

44
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.590
rochelle: Been so good with my leg recovery and sobriety, or whatever. But, um,

45
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.050
rochelle: I guess it's just in the back of my

46
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.330
rochelle: Brain that

47
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.690
rochelle: She'll lead me to relapse generally mean just the stress of

48
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.860
rochelle: Having to deal with it like

49
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:44.160
rochelle: A kosher. Am I gonna have to go pop. Is it just to do with this shit. Like, I don't have to feel like I have to explain anything to her anymore but I already know that it's gonna come up. Why did you change your number. Why did you just need me like though why

50
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold that.

51
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do some work without. Okay. So what you want is to be able to look directly at your screen.

52
00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, I'm not there with you. So we got to kind of work pretty hard to make this this be effective with the telemedicine.

53
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So about are you if your eyes were

54
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Left and Right, I want to do a little experiment here make sure that we've got a good yeah you're sitting up. So let me just bring this

55
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: onto the screen. I want to just test it.

56
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure we got good I movement here.

57
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll just do a test.

58
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just and this one on this one. I'm really just going to be watching your eyes to make sure you're not straining them and you're going to have to decide to right now you're, are you more than shoulder to fingertip away.

59
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.330
rochelle: What do you mean shoulder

60
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Are you more than

61
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Like three feet away. How, how many feet. Would you say you're away from the screen right

62
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.650
rochelle: About a new Julie from touching it. When I stretch out me

63
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

64
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's see if that's too far too close. Let's find out. So just kind of watch the DOD as it goes from left to right, you don't, I'm not worried about the middle part, but I want

65
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay, I can see your eyes. Now is it straining or a should notice that they're going left and right because we want this bilateral stimulation, but I don't want you to be hurting like it's going so far left and right that it's hurting her. I know. Okay, that's great.

66
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And there will be times when I speed it up because in here we see

67
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's actually

68
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:53.670
rochelle: How do I move. Move the little screen because on the right hand side, our pictures covering for the dogs going away.

69
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.

70
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.230
rochelle: How do I move it though. Let me see.

71
00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: On your

72
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.050
rochelle: Yeah, man.

73
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: On your mouse grab grab the top black bar, you know, and just move it.

74
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe to the top of the screen. It'll. It'll move it should, if you should be able, with your mouse to grab the

75
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

76
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.830
rochelle: Okay, that was actually too fast, so I

77
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to go back down. I'd like like this in here. Okay, so

78
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got that. So that distance that you are at just now is really important for it to be effective. So I'm, I'm going to stop sharing for just a second. So we can talk to each other.

79
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to this for a second. Notice how

80
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You went to the future.

81
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Notice that words like anxiety.

82
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.200
Stress

83
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Over the future.

84
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Having to defend yourself right having to explain. I'm sorry.

85
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

86
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.520
Yeah.

87
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And you also mentioned something about it will lead to me, relaxing. So they're

88
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:19.650
rochelle: Not necessarily, but like it was always like, Damn, I need is I need to do this bitch to me like

89
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:33.390
rochelle: type thing. Like, I shouldn't have to explain myself for years later, but I do know like only writing would be would say like, sorry, because I get just looking

90
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.620
rochelle: Change my numbers up to her call she's imprisoned she

91
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.460
rochelle: Do you know what I mean, like,

92
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I sure do.

93
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:43.710
rochelle: Yeah.

94
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll stay there with that.

95
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'd like you to do is to picture. And this is this is the work right. You're going to do this is a little different. So what it'll look like in here is I'm going to ask you to pull up this worst image.

96
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what you picture in the future, just the worst thing.

97
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to tell me how stressed, you are when you pull that picture up and send imagine thing because we can't predict the future, but we're going to go with a future pace right now so

98
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: kind of picture. You don't have to tell me what it is. Just hold it in your in your imagination. I guess you worry thought the one that's really like I'm gonna have to

99
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Deal with her answering her. Okay, or maybe something else came up, but whatever comes up for you and let me know when you've got it.

100
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:36.900
rochelle: I got it.

101
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the emotion, you're feeling right now.

102
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.200
rochelle: disgusted.

103
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, disgusted. Now I'm zero to 100 how much distress. Are you in right now.

104
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.750
rochelle: I guess probably like

105
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.410
Like 5050 yeah so

106
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want you to think

107
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: About what that image.

108
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And this emotion of discussed

109
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants you to think about what this says about you.

110
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might know what this belief is by saying

111
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: By finishing the sentence. I am so you picture it you know the emotions discussed what does this say about who you are.

112
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be able to find it by finishing the sentence, I am

113
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.520
rochelle: I am stronger.

114
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm stronger. That sounds like a positive one. How do you feel when you have that thought of I'm stronger.

115
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:57.780
rochelle: How do I feel

116
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say I'm stronger. What happens to

117
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The moment.

118
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.640
rochelle: That the negative that I was thinking just became distant

119
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:09.720
Uh huh.

120
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me the negative thought. I want to hear it again.

121
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But

122
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.140
rochelle: What I was thinking

123
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:26.100
rochelle: The negative thought or the like the negative image. Oh, I was disgusted. And I, the negative image was just like me strung out again.

124
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.110
rochelle: Yeah, when I pitch it. Okay.

125
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see anything before I'm strung out. Can you maybe picture.

126
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you get to that point. Can you picture making contact with her.

127
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And saying or doing something before you're strong out, can you can you pull down into some awareness.

128
00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: For that. Yeah. Okay. And earlier the emotion was discussed what is it now when you picture.

129
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.510
rochelle: Maybe I'm like nervous.

130
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wouldn't mind if you're comfortable with it. What are you picturing what what's this image. Remember I said kind of

131
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.220
rochelle: I'm picturing just being face to face with it.

132
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.150
rochelle: That's always nervous.

133
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like any location in particular.

134
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.910
rochelle: There's no no no.

135
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is harder to get to. So right there.

136
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about yourself.

137
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.480
rochelle: Like in the moment. What am I believe in myself.

138
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: This move so fast, try and just see if you can catch it. Just as it's happening. First thing that comes to mind. So notice that you're sitting here with nervousness, you're picturing being face to face with her.

139
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:15.240
rochelle: What came to mind was a good or new build the motion. They say, Sorry, I'm bigger than

140
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that say about who you are.

141
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.200
rochelle: That I'm just ready to move on. I'm strong. There we go.

142
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm strong. I'm ready to move on.

143
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a different scale.

144
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: This one is from one to seven.

145
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:41.070
rochelle: Think for a

146
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.990

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me see a little bit. Um, when I said that. What were you thinking about when I said, well, make sure you're not pleasing me

301
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.880
rochelle: I guess you put doubt in my head.

302
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.100
rochelle: It was, yeah.

303
00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:28.380
rochelle: Like they thought, well, Damn Am I pleasing here, is it really, am I really feeling peace. Okay.

304
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.220
There we go.

305
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so how. Let me check in on this other thought of yours, which was I. I am strong. Can I see how how true is is that one from one to seven right now.

306
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.720
Okay.

307
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little bit with that one.

308
00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm strong.

309
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pull up the team.

310
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just curious, just so I can bring you back there. How do you picture this team being a part of you.

311
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.600
rochelle: Hello. How do I picture.

312
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.230
rochelle: When you say team like

313
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:29.790
rochelle: It feels like this part of my head thinking like grandma and mom and this one's thinking that like I just picture them just

314
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What are they doing so they're separate. Is there any way you can picture of all getting along together somehow

315
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.620
rochelle: Guess that's a little hard, they know to put them all.

316
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.900
rochelle: In nothing, just because they just went through that Dubois and

317
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:52.500
rochelle: He's over here and we will be here now. So I guess that's, yeah.

318
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's work on this a little bit more, um,

319
00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take, remember this is a quality. So what can you sort of pull away from Step Dad, what is the actual call quality that you know he represents wisdom, a wise figure. What is it about him and see if we can do a little bit more work around this.

320
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.170
rochelle: What

321
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: When you

322
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: When you picture him being wise, what do you picture I'm doing or

323
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:44.820
rochelle: I guess when when I picture like just wise, it's just like the beliefs that he

324
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.100
rochelle: He always tried to like install on us like

325
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:07.950
rochelle: When you said that it was like, Don't do drugs type thing. Yeah. Not only was he a police. He was the dare officer and just

326
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:17.040
rochelle: All centered around that. You know what I mean. So, as I always don't do drugs and he was real strict so it was

327
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.400
rochelle: That being

328
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:22.920
rochelle: Good.

329
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: To see represent

330
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: A belief in rules.

331
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And that has a sense of wisdom and part of. Is that right, like, it feels wise to to have this knowing of at least he has some confidence about right, wrong is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then also specifically one of those beliefs is don't do drugs and that elsewise

332
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:00.840
rochelle: Yeah, okay.

333
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get a couple more. So notice that it's it's the quality is his beliefs. Is this rules the strict rules.

334
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:09.420
rochelle: A boom.

335
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we got the quality of it now and let's just to make it a little bit more rough but robust, where else does his wisdom show up, whereas to get the sense of it.

336
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.690
rochelle: Just the way you with a goal is a good leader late afternoon.

337
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Ooh, tell me more about little pictures you just got in your head about picturing him leading is that in the dare work he was doing. Tell me more.

338
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:47.820
rochelle: It was just

339
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.860
rochelle: Was I don't know.

340
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You see him talking to anyone talking to you or some way he moved that it just had this sense of this is a leader.

341
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.420
rochelle: Yeah, I see him talking to us like in a

342
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:26.400
rochelle: group setting where it was like the presenter.

343
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:32.160
rochelle: And just

344
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:42.360

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.520
rochelle: What's right from wrong and why we shouldn't be doing that.

347
00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you trust him.

Yeah.

352
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And

353
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them is to not do drugs. What does this wise man wants you to do if you're not doing drugs. What does he wants you to do.

354
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.320

Yeah.

406
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what, no matter how many times she said this is a little talk here, no matter what someone else does.

407
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't control her, she's going to do her do her thing you've been busy growing be convenient if she did too, but

408
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be in the presence of someone saying

409
00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And accusing you of things, calling you names judging you trying to corner you and move you across the chessboard, in other words, manipulate right. Anyone can do that, that that's their business.

410
00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But you get to stay in your truth which is I'm straight. Right, I'm good. Right. Like, I got this. I'm right here. I'm fine.

411
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.100
rochelle: I just feel like

412
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.370
rochelle: I could see all that Ray know

413
00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:44.010
rochelle: What is that what's gonna, I guess that's just the hard part is because I keep replaying that in my head and I keep telling myself.

414
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:46.590
rochelle: And

415
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:53.580
rochelle: I still not that i doubt way so that there's that little part of my brain.

416
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:56.640
rochelle: What

417
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:07.440
rochelle: If you don't see all that, like, I don't know, there's that doubt in me like there's this much doubt. Okay, it is still there.

418
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That I want to work on that next time, I'm going to see if I can create a way to say that in here.

419
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressing is that little bit of doubt. What if I don't say all that to her.

420
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: How big is that fear.

421
00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:39.870
rochelle: I guess that's probably the biggest fear of the whole thing right now is just I replayed it in my head. I said, I am good. I am strong.

422
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:41.520
rochelle: I

423
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:50.700
rochelle: Worked on my sobriety myself the last four years that we haven't talked like I am good. Do you know what I mean, like,

424
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.480
rochelle: I'm good.

425
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:57.960
rochelle: Sorry, but I am good.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the doubt.

430
00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:43.260
rochelle: For all the Munich manipulative ways that she knew her to get back into my life, you know, remain like making me feel sorry because

431
00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:44.970
rochelle: I

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:29.700
