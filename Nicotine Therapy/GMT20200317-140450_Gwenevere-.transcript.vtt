33
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to train him so he brings a little bell and goes outside and once it says, Hey, I wonder what's it

34
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.520
Wayne Dal: Like having a newborn

35
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That potty training is going to be deafening.

36
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, everything

37
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But I gotta tell you something. There is a trainer out there. I have my my silly little Chihuahua. I'm not much I don't know much about dogs, but it got me a little Chihuahua thing and

38
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I can train that dog. He does. He dances, he gives me pause. He does this little, um, I call it the army crawl I try

39
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: to sneak across the carpet like this Denton, Denton, Denton, Denton, and he'll high five. He'll. He'll rollover. Um, it's really smart and I did it all with positive training always

40
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.340
Wayne Dal: Good, yeah.

41
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.570
Yeah, but

42
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.280
Wayne Dal: That's kind of what we're trying to do too.

43
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.010
Wayne Dal: But yeah, and he's teething and all he wants to do is fight.

44
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Choo choo choo choo choo get lots and lots of different chew toys around just lots of choice become options for things. He can chew on.

45
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: positively reinforced when he goes to the right shoe. We give them a little positive really yummy treat this guy. I remember his name. Little trainer on YouTube. I learned everything from him. I was so good. Can't believe

46
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.840
Wayne Dal: I'll have to look that guy up

47
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Something, George. I'm really good. And they'll literally he could bring up if you install a little, a little bell next to the door when he wants to go potty ego ring a bell and

48
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.030
Wayne Dal: That would be cool. You there really isn't

49
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I mean, how big can the brain of a chihuahua be really

50
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.860
Wayne Dal: Really smart so dogs are smart.

51
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they know what's up. But this party anything is going to be the death of me because I'm trying to have a peep had trained this

52
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's a boy dog.

53
00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.990
Wayne Dal: I you know how great he is I'm trying to do the same thing but I passed by the door. You know where I want him to go out

54
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.000
Wayne Dal: Sometimes you'll use it. But other times, catch him in the act.

55
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been hard.

56
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.140
Wayne Dal: Forgot what was that

57
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's so hard.

58
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me see, once you tell me a little bit about how your health is one of your goals was to make sure that you follow through with your

59
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your physician appointments and follow up appointments. Have you been doing that.

60
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.170
Wayne Dal: I've done that I have appointment with my primary physician. I think next week.

61
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.440
Wayne Dal: My health has been good. I'm still, you know, recovering

62
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.950
Wayne Dal: But my lungs fill a lot better.

63
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.780
Wayne Dal: And I'm just feeling a lot better. So I've been doing a lot more exercising.

64
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.970
Wayne Dal: So,

65
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.550
Wayne Dal: It's been going good. As far as my physical health.

66
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm not looking at you, but I need to pull up a note and it's it's not it's not a smooth process right now. Tell me a little bit about the dynamics with your son right now.

67
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.180
Wayne Dal: My son is moved out.

68
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.060
Wayne Dal: No.

69
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.690
Wayne Dal: He did.

70
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.860
Win.

71
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.980
Wayne Dal: Oh, couple weeks ago.

72
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: How did that come about.

73
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.770
Wayne Dal: Well, he

74
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.500
Wayne Dal: Has a girlfriend now.

75
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.450
Wayne Dal: So,

76
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.870
Wayne Dal: He moved in with her.

77
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of her

78
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.620
Wayne Dal: She's really nice.

79
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.450
Wayne Dal: And he's really good actually. We know her family and stuff. Oh.

80
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:51.900
Wayne Dal: My wife used to work with her with her mom like, years and years and years ago. So we know her family and

81
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.910
Wayne Dal: She has a real good head on her shoulders and she keeps them in line, so it's it's it's a good relationship.

82
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Complimentary he

83
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:20.610
Wayne Dal: He I think they rushed into it a little bit, you know, as far as moving in with each other. Yeah, but you know they're they're grown up, but don't so you know they can make their own decisions. And I just think he's in a lot better place, and he was, you know, a couple years ago.

84
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:35.520
Wayne Dal: He still has some work to do on himself and I've let him know that you know that he needs to go to counseling and then get his anger issues dealt with and you know because he doesn't want to take that into a new relationship.

85
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.350
Wayne Dal: But all in all, they seem happy.

86
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.440
Wayne Dal: And I'm happy to have him gone

87
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.400
Wayne Dal: So that's, that's what's going on with him.

88
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.820
Wayne Dal: He has a he has a pretty good job.

89
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.680
Wayne Dal: So I'm happy about that.

90
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.310
Wayne Dal: Yeah, it's it with him. He got a car.

91
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.750
Wayne Dal: So, you know, he's he's moving in the right direction.

92
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:21.750
Wayne Dal: So I feel good about it. You know, I know he's not in I know in my heart. He's, he's not in the same place as he was, you know, when he came to live with us.

93
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.730
Wayne Dal: So,

94
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.300
Wayne Dal: I have a good feeling about it.

95
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.310
Wayne Dal: All right. Don't worry about it, you know.

96
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have I want more time for me and my needs. It's been a while. So we need to update our goals. Give me an example of where you're creating time for me and my knees. Give me a little story about how that's true or not true for

97
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.760
Wayne Dal: You now that he's done.

98
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.770
Wayne Dal: Now I have all the time in the world to myself.

99
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.780
Wayne Dal: Basically right now all my attention goes to this puppy.

100
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.820
Wayne Dal: And my other dog.

101
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.950
Wayne Dal: You know I'm fixing up the house a little bit, you know, kind of like, you know, spring cleaning the blinds.

102
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:27.240
Wayne Dal: Stuff like that. Read a painting some some walls need to be paying it

103
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.100
Wayne Dal: And

104
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.660
Wayne Dal: I haven't yet. I'm going to the

105
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Bathroom

106
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.440
Wayne Dal: That's next actually we bought new light fixtures and stuff so

107
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:51.720
Wayne Dal: I've been busy putting those up. How fun though. Yeah, I've been keeping myself pretty pretty busy and, you know, I do have the long time now. So

108
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: When we set that goal.

109
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't there was no

110
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It was more like will set limits and expectations boundaries with family members.

111
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you can have me time and it was a measurement of from three

112
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To six or seven a day so me time you wanted it many times throughout the day. What number are you at, have you reached this goal. So let's give it a number

113
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.320
Wayne Dal: And see where. Yeah, I would say it's a

114
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.120
Wayne Dal: I would say turn tune because okay

115
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So should we close that goal.

116
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Nicely done, man.

117
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's more challenging when there's other people around so that same skill that it takes to set the limits. You don't have to do it when they're not around, so

118
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It may still come up again and we can reset things. If you notice, though, there I am again getting angry instead of asserting you know

119
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.210
Wayne Dal: It'll come up. I know.

120
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but let me let me put achieved here so that we can get behind other ones that you want to work on. So we got achieved. All right, we got three

121
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Today is 317. Okay, the next one change routine and morning. Part of the reason why you were wanting to do that as you were looking ahead to tapering you also have a very new thing which is I think you have stopped the thing

122
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.700
Oh, yeah.

123
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.190

Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so amazed. Did you ever think that was possible.

126
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.640
Wayne Dal: You know, no, I didn't think I was gonna stop you know i wanted to

127
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.560
Wayne Dal: It was kind of forced upon me so

128
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.940
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I'm real excited about that.

129
00:11:52.770 --> 00:12:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So changing routine in the morning. So finally, increased frequency from zero to five days a week, changing routine.

Gwenevere Abriel: Go for walk water trees make lunch take Listerine strip before taking Suboxone and I know you have the puppy. So I want to hear about can't be passive about this. This takes effort right

131
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing that supports changing routine.

132
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about what your morning looks like in the morning.

133

Wayne Dal: There's days where no I don't ever forget to take it. Okay, but I'll, I'll snap that I need to. And I mean, I'll just, oh yeah.

148
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.820
Wayne Dal: You know, so I don't ever go a day without taking him or anything.

149
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.290
Wayne Dal: But, you know, I'm a one and a half. So,

150
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: One and a half.

151
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.160
Wayne Dal: mil yeah yeah

152
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me put that down here. Okay, that was you did a big drop when you did this hospitalization. Is that right,

153
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.600
Wayne Dal: Oh, I was at two and then

154
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.420
Wayne Dal: Actually the dark

155
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.020
Wayne Dal: Actually the doc.

156
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.930
Wayne Dal: Said, it's time to take her

157
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:16.620
Okay.

158
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

159
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:30.720
Wayne Dal: So I've been at to for a few for probably about three, three weeks or so. Okay, and all this stuff happened so I for the last group.

160
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.670
Wayne Dal: I went down to 1.1 point five.

161
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And what would you like to do moving forward around education. What do you want to do with it.

162
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.830
Wayne Dal: I want to keep, keep going. I want to go down to one.

163
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.270
Wayne Dal: Okay.

164
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when are you thinking, I'll just make a little note. Just when you think I

165
00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.960
Wayne Dal: was planning on doing it tomorrow.

166
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And are you having any withdrawal symptoms.

167
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.830
Wayne Dal: On the one point, you know, no.

168
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.080
Wayne Dal: No, I haven't. You know, I've been taking the Connor team and stuff. If I start to sweat. But

169
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:20.310
Wayne Dal: I've noticed I've been kind of tired at the end of the day, and I don't know if that's because I'm getting up so early.

170
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I mean, isn't that a couple of hours earlier than what you were doing.

171
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.450
Wayne Dal: Yeah, it's, it's real early so

172
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.380
Wayne Dal: You know that's that's about it. You know, I don't have

173
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.740
Wayne Dal: You know, if I do have, you know, start sweating. I'll take the quantity but

174
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.760
Wayne Dal: Other than that, no. No cravings.

175
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So instead of having a craving when there is a disconnection with someone when there's a disagreement with there's a negative experience when you are angry or irritated. What do you do

176
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.360
Wayne Dal: What do I do

177
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.550
Wayne Dal: Go to that.

178
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.410
Wayne Dal: alone time

179
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.520
Wayne Dal: That way I can sit and think about, you know, whatever the issue is

180
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.550
Wayne Dal: If I, if not you know i resort to, you know, just

181
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.450
Wayne Dal: Breathing and thinking about

182
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.150
Wayne Dal: My response before I say

183
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a plan for today, it's going to feel a little different.

184
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You can always declined. But I want to talk to you a little bit about a different approach. And it has to do with a larger sort of developmental trauma.

185
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is get those past feelings out of me and be positive. That's that kind of

186
00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Past that may still be with you that may still feel like I don't have a choice in the moment around my anger.

187
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to check in with that in just about a second but I just want to make sure

188
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That I've written notes here. So let me just write a little bit more. Okay, updated.

189
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I go to alone time and I sit and think about the issue.

190
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I resort to breathing and think about my response. Before I see

191
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Very nice. Okay, that is under the goal of letting things go

192
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you you assess when you said it what you will know we had a number. This is a hard thing to measure client will increase frequency of instances of I say my piece.

193
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And let it alone from a frequency of 20% to 30 over the next three days. So that was a very, I thought it looks like I thought it was

194
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You pretty quickly. So thinking about just kind of rewind the last couple months here.

195
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You say your piece. Let it alone.

196
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Last time we checked in. You read about 50 I've been concentrating on that it has been just become a habit. Again, other than 50% that was see

197
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Baba, Baba, Baba. Oh, October I do it all the time. I don't linger on it. I say it, and that's it. November, letting go of irritation in father in law he feel sorry for himself now thinking he's an old man who deserves better.

198
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So those are little snapshots. I make little notes.

199
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.190
Yeah.

200
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

201
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.250
Wayne Dal: I think, I think I'm probably about 85 90% now.

202
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:58.560
Wayne Dal: Where I say what I have to say. And that's it. I study it and that's all it needs to be done.

203
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:06.300
Wayne Dal: So it's pretty much at that percentage, but something that I just, I don't know, it's like

204
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:15.300
Wayne Dal: Just like instinct or just admin or something. Now, where I know that's what I have to do is just set and

205
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.280
Wayne Dal: Forget about it.

206
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to keep this goal open or you feel like you've reached letting

207
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:29.940
Wayne Dal: I think I've reached my goal of of not lingering on and holding on to

208
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.920
Wayne Dal: To stuff.

209
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:32.940
Me too.

210
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so too.

211
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We're human. We're not perfect. Sometimes we take personally things we get ourselves offended.

212
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But 85% pretty darn good. You take that put it under are achieved airier your eyes for Nash Nash. Uh huh.

213
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

214
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you say oh go rich. We're going to take this one out to cut

215
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Taste.

216
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So that leaves us with

217
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Something you would like to

218
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Miami's calling me for some reason and

219
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to get my vote.

220
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.270
Probably

221
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: See

222
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You think about goals. Right now, the only thing I have left right now whether your stated goals is changing routine in the morning.

223
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And

224
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: No, we already close that one out. Sorry change. What do I have to have those wanted to do.

225
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: More meantime change the routine.

226
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm I may want to keep down a little bit.

227
00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.700
Wayne Dal: I think my, my main goal now is to get off Suboxone

228
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

229
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but

230
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.810
Wayne Dal: My main yeah

231
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's off. And so you want to do more of this less use of Suboxone and you're already doing that you're that one. We've got get you that one's ongoing

232
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

233
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's this one to get off the Suboxone and not be dependent on anything for my life. So I'm going to grab this one copy and we're going to write

234
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Actual tape or plan that you like and then we can kind of watch it over the coming months.

235
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.240
Okay.

236
00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.070
Wayne Dal: The end of the year.

237
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

238
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can't remember licious walk this through how frequently. So let's say you do will go, let's say one. This is just a template one milligrams will say three slash

239
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: then a week later, would you want to say, do you think at one milligram for two weeks.

240
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.510
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I think.

241
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.500
Wayne Dal: I'm gonna go down one tomorrow and

242
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.230
Probably for a couple weeks.

243
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:55.290
Wayne Dal: And it all depends on how my body relax. You mean exactly

244
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

245
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.040
Wayne Dal: Think two weeks is a good is a good

246
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.370
Wayne Dal: It's a good amount of time.

247
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So once you look at your account. Well, that's not true. I can do.

248
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just a place for us to to explore. Let's go calendar so two weeks, one would be at March 25 another week would be April 2 which I'm guessing you go 2.75

249
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'm going to put two weeks from there, just, let's just look at it together.

250
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.110
Wayne Dal: Okay. It was the first day of April.

251
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.960
Up to four.

252
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Then we have 416

253
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be 50 milligrams

254
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And then of course 16

255
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.100
And then April 30, I guess.

256
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.470
point two five.

257
00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess is, you're going to want to stay there for a month. That's my goal.

258
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this is a rough, but this gives you something to look at. And what we'll do is we'll just cross compare and see where you're at and you can inform this is what's going on for me. I can tell.

259
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want me to. I can tell the doctor kind of what basic template is what your plan is and you can ask her questions like, well, if I did it like this. Well, how am I feel and what happens next.

260
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so far, when I've seen people get ready.

261
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see that would put us at five.

262
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say

263
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:40.770
30

264
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to say 527 I'm going to say 527 only because what you're doing is

265
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Moving it from Wednesday to Wednesday. Wednesday. So I just did. It's weird because I want to send it out on Monday.

266
00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's when your group day is but right now it's at a Wednesday. It's not that it's not that critical. So let's just not overanalyze it

267
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So though may, I'm just going to stick with the Wednesday, so that I can keep myself together here.

268
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:20.340
Wayne Dal: 1.25 Do I just go completely off or not.

269
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's the question. So here's what I see, I see. You would be

270
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: at point two five between April 30 all the way to about may 27 so here it is right, you said at the end of the year. So I noticed that you said the end of the year.

271
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.660
Wayne Dal: Because I want to take my time. You know, I don't want to

272
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.520
Wayne Dal: Well, but

273
00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, why don't you want to rush just see if you can answer that.

274
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:57.720
Wayne Dal: I just want to do it comfortably. You know, I don't know how long it will actually take two

275
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.340
Wayne Dal: Is totally off.

276
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.200
Wayne Dal: You know what I mean. That's why I asked if

277
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go backwards then let's go this way for point two five. I'm asked about this part you're asking right now.

278
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I've only had a couple clients do it and they don't do it right in front of me. They do it over long weekend with the doc and I don't get to hear what's going on.

279
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's usually abrupt because they're leaving the state. So this is what I've heard, if you're going to do point two five.

280
00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I think ideal is a minimum of two weeks. So that says to me easily a month and then I think what she does is over a weekend. She stays in close contact with you. She gets you on the clock zone and

281
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: There's very there's like, I think it's this tiny little, little bit of the morphine and then slowly. It's just the no locks on and there is, from what I've seen, there is some discomfort, meaning

282
00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have probably those calls west. That's your go to kind of symptom. And you may want to have three days, but it's never going to be the full kick experience. Okay, it's still going to be what you've been doing all year.

283
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But from what I've heard. It is a little bit more intense as those last receptors are absorbed. Okay, so

284
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I've heard. Now she may have. That's the part I can't really I'm not really witness to how she does this thing.

285
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But then the locks on alone. The way she describes it is that it's such an amazing because it sits on the receptors.

286
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have cravings. You don't have any of the allergies that part. You don't have any of the euphoria that tiny bit maybe that you're still getting you know when it hits your bloodstream. Okay, there it is, that's not there doesn't have any euphoric effect.

287
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But it does sit on the receptors. So you're not going to have the craving.

288
00:27:52.740 --> 00:28:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm hearing so minimum of a month, but you would have put together a month. Now let's say you don't go at the two weeks.

289
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You could do point seven five all the way to May you could do point five all the way through June, you could do. I mean point 509 point two five all the way through July, but still, it's still

290
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: When you said all the way to the end of the year. That's

291
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.360
Wayne Dal: Easier. And I'm trying to say so.

292
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: In either way, the question has to do with

293
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say I want to do it carefully. I want to do it slowly.

294
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to probably be like what happened in the hospital where you had to make a difficult choice around the beeping. This is still going to be you. It's going to be left to you deciding, am I ready to live my life.

295
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Without this, so that's the part where you and I get into it. Okay.

296
00:28:55.110 --> 00:29:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wrote this down and we can change it the next time we meet, but it's a place to look at. It's a point of

297
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.100
Wayne Dal: Departure okay

298
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you get to I get to write it and you say, oh,

299
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So I might say, I'll just say in end of may meet with Dr. Aubrey L to explore

300
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: taper off protocol, you're still on a taper down okay and not on an off some people stay at this for many months. This is going to be up to you, up to your doctor, you and I, in coordination, but you know, I'm not pushing this

301
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You're at a safe dose right now based on her language.

302
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. So yeah, I would like to be off by the end of the year, so

303
00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about

304
00:29:51.660 --> 00:30:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What you would need to do in order to feel more confident about that. So right now, how important is it to you. Let's go a scale will do MIT the motivational interviewing

305
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I am i mean

306
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: How important is it on a scale of zero to 10 it's you taper off by the end of the year zero to 10 how important

307
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.010
Wayne Dal: Oh, I would say it's a 10

308
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:23.040
Wayne Dal: Really to go yes it's it's my ultimate goal right now is to be off by the end of the year.

309
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now from zero to 10 How confident are you that you can do that by the end of the year.

310
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so why is it not a five. Would you say

311
00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.550
Wayne Dal: Because

312
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.750
Wayne Dal: I'm confident in myself and

313
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.260
Wayne Dal: I've made up my mind to set a goal.

314
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.800
Wayne Dal: And I know I can do it. I can overcome anything

315
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.030
Wayne Dal: I know I'm strong enough to do it and

316
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.280
Wayne Dal: That's what I want to do.

317
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And if it was in the next six months, how confident, would you be

318
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.900
Wayne Dal: Probably about the same, maybe a nine. Okay, so

319
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know why it goes down.

320
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.660
Wayne Dal: Low just less time, I guess.

321
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What we

322
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Do at this time.

323
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.110
Wayne Dal: My main goal is to be comfortable, you know, and not

324
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.540
Wayne Dal: That that's that's just my main

325
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.650
Wayne Dal: Concern is just to be comfortable

326
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:56.310
Wayne Dal: And

327
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:08.160
Wayne Dal: I guess that's it. Just, just to be comfortable doing it. That's why I gave me, you know, that's why I first aid at the end of the year was my goal.

328
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:16.770
Wayne Dal: You know, because I don't know how long it'll take me to adjust to 2.75 or half point two five.

329
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.350
Wayne Dal: You know, right.

330
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, alright, so

331
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about what you would need to do in order to accomplish that.

332
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a close look at this comfort. That's a big piece for you.

333
00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The comfort.

334
00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm noticing today on your on you said I'm going to taper. I'm going to do it tomorrow.

335
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been meeting discomfort. I'm assuming that's what the sweats are is that the uncomfortable. Well,

336
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.490
Wayne Dal: Yeah yeah

337
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:22.950
Wayne Dal: And I guess I forget that it's pretty much only sweat. You know, I mean it's not full blown withdraw. Yeah.

338
00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but we do forget we forget

339
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:27.150
Yeah.

340
00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:35.550
Wayne Dal: Like, I think that's just the fear of it all is just to that feeling of full blown withdraw.

341
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.080
Okay, so please

342
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with that hold that right there. Hold that right there.

343
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the primary concern is, it's a thought. I remember full blown withdrawal and you associated with being off of this is that right

344
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.680
Wayne Dal: Oh, yeah.

345
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What else

346
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.340
Wayne Dal: Not are not having it. I guess I'm gonna mean

347
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Tell me more about the non HAVING SO NOTICE HOW IN THE MORNING. IT'S NOT embedded in a in a set time, which I'm going to invite you to do is to embed it and stack it with other things.

348
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Even right next to the dog food. Right. Like it's already embedded in routine where it's not a I want to extinguish that you are snapping

349
00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To it and because if it's a snap meaning remembering my concern is that its associated with an uncomfortable thought threat.

350
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Worried about the future. Oh, I just got anxious. Oh, I could now I just snapped to it. I want to get rid of anything that has to do with the addictive behavior part but

351
00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The mornings made up with I get up i p i can make coffee. Then I empty the dishwasher I brush my teeth, I take the dog for walk you see there are not only a few there's all of these stack things

352
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And earlier when we were changing routine. I wanted it stacked in there before. But you and I haven't been meeting quite as often and whatever, but it's not too late. We can do it.

353
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to have that strip, if possible stack in with other things, you're already doing that has nothing to do with emotionally regulating

354
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want any of the reaching. I just wanted to be stacked in there with something that you're already doing. Where can you see where could you do it.

355
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.940
Wayne Dal: A good dude right before I go to work.

356
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Where would it be that that would be stacked in because

357
00:35:53.310 --> 00:36:01.530
Wayne Dal: It would be in the middle of doing everything here in the morning, you know, my whole spiel here in the morning and you know going to work.

358
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do right before you go to work.

359
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:13.020
Wayne Dal: Basically, you know, once I really go to work I shower, get dressed and I'm done everything else.

360
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

361
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.810
Let's talk about the show.

362
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So you take a shower. Where do you typically store the strips. Where do you store.

363
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.640
Wayne Dal: Oh my closet.

364
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're out of the shower. You go out underwear. You get dressed. So there, you're already in the closet. Is there a way to have a little sticky, a little something there that reminds you to reach for it right then you're in there putting dress shirt on. Are you putting a dress. Yeah.

365
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:47.640
Wayne Dal: Yeah, no. Well button down shirt or, you know, polo shirt, something like that.

366
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it better there than in the underwear drawer. What's a you absolutely going on right thing

367
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.350
Wayne Dal: It's right by my my shirt. So, okay.

368
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:06.690
Wayne Dal: Just where you don't know the grandkids can find it or anything like that, you know, so it's right there right by my shirt. Okay.

369
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So by shirts. Can you put. Can you put a little something to maybe behind the door so that you could see it. It could be a little drawing some little symbol.

370
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:23.010
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I can actually hang a piece of paper on my shelves. It says, take your community.

371
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Or yeah, something that you doesn't have to be. But as long as you know what it means.

372
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, that'll be the objective. That's the new behavior. So client will take it right after shower.

373
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: While

374
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Dressing

375
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.700
I'm gonna say actually while

376
00:37:53.370 --> 00:38:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to say in closet, you know, basically near wiling closet, putting on a shirt is a specific but I want to get something set in place. They're coming on the shirt will put

377
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you'll have like finishing putting shirt on getting whatever preparation while it's absorbing right

378
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.990
Huh. Okay.

379
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how many times you already do that. Just like that zero or sometimes

380
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:31.470
Wayne Dal: Just like that.

381
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.500
Wayne Dal: Yeah, sometimes I would say

382
00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So can I put once a week to five times a week to seven times a week. What

383
00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.440
Wayne Dal: Probably about two times a week.

384
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how many you're already doing it or how many want to do it.

385
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.810
Wayne Dal: Well, I want to do it every week, every day. So seven times.

386
00:38:52.200 --> 00:39:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: On a say from tune. That's where we're at. To seven this Saturday and Sunday might be more difficult because you might be sleeping it maybe

387
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.010
Wayne Dal: Not for the foreseeable future.

388
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know.

389
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You're probably going to need another one. Um, maybe by the door when you go take him out for a walk. You might need another one there something simple, just a picture of

390
00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:19.560
Wayne Dal: Something

391
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That represents that because when you're walking. It can be dissolving

392
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.550
That's true.

393
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:28.290
Wayne Dal: Okay.

394
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. So we've got from zero to seven days a week. There we go. Yeah, and I didn't create enough time for my

395
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Interview intervention. I wanted to do, but I can get started doing the preparation of it real quick.

396
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, Wayne. I want to do a little bit of imagery with you. I want to start to prepare

397
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To do a little bit of some deeper, deeper psychotherapy, just to really take a look if there's any charge left and some of that trauma history of years.

398
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We've done a little bit of it. I just want to kind of try this other technique which I've had some success with here in bright heart, to my surprise, it's been effective. And it's the FDR

399
00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And it does ask that we'd be like this sitting here, remind me. You're, you're in the iPad or iPhone phone phone

400
00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.600
Wayne Dal: IPad beautiful

401
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's about 11 inches wide or something. So when you

402
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.670
Wayne Dal: Create an iPad Mini. So just let you know.

403
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's fine. So I might end up asking you on a day that we do it that you have two containers right next to the to the mini and so it'd be like this. How far away arm's length away shoulder width apart and drop them next to your iPad Mini. Does that make sense.

404
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, out here so

405
00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:49.620
Wayne Dal: That's how far the

406
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.610
Wayne Dal: IPad needs to be

407
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. And then what you would end up doing is when we meet, I would say, I want you to look at the to the tops of those two objects.

408
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just going over some of the comfort pieces and I would have you just with your eyes, not with your head.

409
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking at the tops of them at the rate that I'm pointing. So you'd be looking at the tops of them as I'm pointing. You don't have to look at me. Let me just see. Look at the tops of maybe the top of the corners of the

410
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: IPad

411
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.730
Wayne Dal: Some chairs here. There, I could look at the top corners of

412
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, so next time it would they need to be right here right next to where my fingers because I'll be changing the rate

413
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I've noticed, like I've had to really adapt to people doing this in their car and so over time. I found what works. Okay, so that's the bilateral stimulation. That's the part of the eye movement.

414
00:41:48.750 --> 00:42:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It, it is helpful and beneficial. It's the go to evidence based treatment for PTSD and what it does, it's kind of neat for people that don't want to tell their story. You certainly can. But for a lot of people didn't really want to retell, you know, sometimes they don't want to re traumatize

415
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:08.970
Wayne Dal: Themselves.

416
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: By retelling stories. So what this does is it says you think of it, hold it in your working memory, which means you pull it from the hippocampus.

417
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Are all that memory is stored and you think about it, you don't have to tell you what it is. You think about it, and then I'll be doing some target mapping. There's a lot of steps to this, but the bottom line is you don't have to

418
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Retail your story. You think about it. You hold it there in the imagery and then I do my work.

419
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But

420
00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

421
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: In preparation, I'm talking fast because I've only got 10 minutes here. I want to do a little bit more preparation around that and talk about some imagery. The first one I want to do has to do with

422
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: A container.

423
00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: An emotional container.

424
00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to think about a box.

425
00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, doesn't even have to be a box want to think about how many people come up with things. I wish I knew soapbox anything. It could be any container. These are the requirements.

426
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That'd be big enough and strong enough to hold all your emotional stuff. So those are the only constraints doesn't actually have to be a box, it can be whatever you want. So when you first unfortunately I stuck that word in there. And so now I probably mess with your own imagination, but

427
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.350
Wayne Dal: No containers. I can

428
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you think of

429
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.010
Wayne Dal: A jar.

430
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.570
Wayne Dal: Right off the bat, when

431
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.060
Wayne Dal: You first said container. Okay.

432
00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Big enough and strong enough to hold all your emotional stuff. Do you want to change it from jar, keep it as a jar.

433
00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:51.840
Wayne Dal: Um, I think we can keep it as jar.

434
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And how big is it

435
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:56.400
Wayne Dal: About

436
00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:57.990
Wayne Dal: A gallon

437
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:02.940
Wayne Dal: Gallon and was like one of those big 70 jars. You know what I mean.

438
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:03.720
Uh huh.

439
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And can you see through it.

440
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.500
Wayne Dal: Yes. Okay, can see

441
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And we need some sort of lid and locking system.

442
00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.740
Wayne Dal: It has a plastic lid with a block on the top.

443
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and how is it, how is it a latch or lock where you got to keep

444
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.840
Wayne Dal: It's a, it's, it's kind of a latch and as a lock on the left. Okay.

445
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.340
With lock.

446
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And this is kind of the weird part of this question.

447
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that stuff, want to stay in there, and if so, is there something in there. So there's an environment that we make inside that sun tea jar.

448
00:44:53.070 --> 00:45:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That that gallon jar that that stuff will want to stay. So could we put something in there that all that stuff would want to stay in there, or do we need to take a really close look at the locking system.

449
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.480
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I think it would want some of the stuff in there.

450
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, why is it want to stay in there.

451
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:24.030
Wayne Dal: While we're trying to get that stuff out. You know, I don't want some of that stuff in me, you know, what are in that jar. Okay.

452
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I may explore that further next time. Let's keep going. Let's do this other one which has to do with a distancing metaphor. This one's really great

453
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to give you some examples of other people's metaphor and you can come up with your own or use one of the ones that I share. So a distancing metaphor is imagery

454
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That involves process, which means it's in motion, and it's moving further away. So, very common one is you're somewhere off on the side of a river bank.

455
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you're thinking of a negative memory childhood or you're feeling angry of disappointment.

456
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And you put it on a leaf, you can kind of picture that it's slowly floating further away to the point that you can't even see the leaf anymore, but you are grounded.

457
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And settled on the side of the river, other people it is spaceship taken off really fast into outer space, some people, it's a helium balloon and it's slowly floating out in two

458
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Hemispheres hemisphere there. So then we have sailboat, and I'm on the sea side I have a fast racing boat. I also I'm in a car this way and this thing comes around.

459
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Passing my opposite direction. That was my distancing metaphor. And I can see it in my rearview getting smaller.

460
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And smaller and I'm going in the opposite direction. So giving you a couple of examples or a train. Also, it could

461
00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Be put in a train car and you can hear it click, click, click, click, click, and it's moving further and further away.

462
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To the point you can't see the training more, but notice that all of these distancing metaphors.

463
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where we would take something negative, probably put it in there and have some distance from it, and it would move further away, but they're all process, which means they don't just

464
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: hit the floor and land, they are moving away to the point that we can't see them any more. So in your imagination, what do you like as a distancing metaphor, one that I can bring us back to if we need at the end of a session when you might be emotionally activated, something like that.

465
00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:37.800
Wayne Dal: I would, I would go airplane.

466
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, there we go. Just

467
00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.890
Wayne Dal: Put it on the airplane and fly away.

468
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Okay.

469
00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, next one.

470
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: These are a little bit more difficult to get to. If we don't get all the way through it. That's okay. I'm working fast.

471
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: These are three three images and those are the

472
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: These can be real or imagined Wayne

473
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagined which includes a movie a book TV show or just straight out of your imagination could be an animal could be a real person could be just a quality of someone you only knew for 10 minutes

474
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm looking for here is I want you to think about when I say to you, I want you to bring in your mind's eye, real or imagined a tentative figure

475
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Has the qualities

476
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Of protection, what comes to mind.

477
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.300
Wayne Dal: Grandpa.

478
00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandpa. Are there any mixed feelings about that. Are there times when he hurt you and was an unsafe person, is there any dissonance mixture in it. No.

479
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.390
Wayne Dal: No.

480
00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Love it. Then grandpa it Shelby

481
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's go to another figure really important one as well.

482
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: real or imagined nurturing figure. This is a figure that wants for you, your growth wants for you, your development and your potential absolutely wants it for you, for you to grow and develop

483
00:49:53.460 --> 00:50:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: May include affection in may not nurturing has to do with growth and development nurturing your growth and development, real or imagined.

484
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up.

485
00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:11.520
Wayne Dal: Um, I have to say my grandma.

486
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.360
Wayne Dal: My grandma and grandpa like the only people that

487
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:22.770
Wayne Dal: I feel wherever nurturing and loving and never hurt me, you know, and I felt safe with them so

488
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.050
Wayne Dal: I have to say those two

489
00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Next one. This is the third figure real or imagined a wise figure that has the quality of wisdom.

490
00:50:51.870 --> 00:51:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now go to creative go to favorite movie favorite TV show someone that you're like a could be a spiritual failure. Don't forget there's that right. Don't forget those pieces to wisdom.

491
00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Knows what to do, knows how to do it. Maybe it's stored knowledge. Maybe it's experiential learning just give yourself the space to come up with something. Just take your time.

492
00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.930
Wayne Dal: I would just have to see God because that

493
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes sense. Awfully wise, right.

494
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:38.880
Yeah.

495
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Sounds good. Alright, so we did a lot of work really fast, which means that

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The next time we meet

497
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We might be able to start to work on work on the target negative cognition.
