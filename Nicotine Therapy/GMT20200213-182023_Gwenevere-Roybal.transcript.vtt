1
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, this is the second piece of Nicole rival. She's going to be in here in a second.

2
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It started off as group at 11 it's now becoming individual therapy.

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: She should be seeing me twice a weekend.

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.990
Jackie's there. And it's interesting.

6
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a possibility. We might still have group if Jackie's saying she's here.

7
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.160
Dawn Abriel: Literally, do you remember what the agreement was for how much you're going to decrease each week.

8
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.350
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, you said

9
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.800
Nicole Roybal: Wait.

10
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.200
Nicole Roybal: I thought you had said that to wait a week and then go down to three times a day and and that

11
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.730
Nicole Roybal: Was I thought it

12
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.100
Nicole Roybal: I thought they said

13
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.930
Nicole Roybal: They'll take the know

14
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.540
Dawn Abriel: You're taking a massive amount I gave you all of that medicine to get off the alcohol.

15
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.070
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so you don't need all that medicine.

16
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.590
Nicole Roybal: Not off alcohol. Okay.

17
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:57.420
Dawn Abriel: But, but because you took so much. You do have to taper and if you taper 100 milligrams less every week or two weeks, then you will get down off of it. But you keep taking it. Your body's going to get even more dependent on it. So I wanted to check in with you and make sure that's clear.

18
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.720
Nicole Roybal: Okay, okay, I understand 300 milligrams a week not 600 right

19
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on, hold on, how slow

20
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get what we're at and recommended tight ration and the frequency because you guys are. That's a big difference 300 to 600 different Yo let's start over, Nicole.

21
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.430
Dawn Abriel: Total the total amount that you're taking per day.

22
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.720
Nicole Roybal: 1800 okay

23
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.300
Dawn Abriel: You should decrease that by 100 each week.

24
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.020
Dawn Abriel: So this

25
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.060
Dawn Abriel: Shows 17

26
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.750
Dawn Abriel: I know, I know, I know, I know. No, I can fix that part.

27
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.730
Nicole Roybal: But

28
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.240
But

29
00:02:47.010 --> 00:03:04.290
Dawn Abriel: We obviously I've done a shitty job of communicating this to you. So I really wanted to be clear. If you, you just need to start decreasing and I'll make sure you have the 100 milligram capsules, but they do have to be

30
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.200
Dawn Abriel: It has to be 100 milligrams per week that you take it down. And if you went from

31
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.650
Dawn Abriel: You know that those big doses, then of course you would be shaky, but you know you're if you're there now at 1800

32
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.090
Dawn Abriel: And you've been at this for how long now.

33
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.680
Nicole Roybal: I'm TWO WEEKS, TWO WEEKS. Oh, yeah.

34
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.160
Dawn Abriel: So why don't you stay this week at that and next week. Go to the 1700

35
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.380
Nicole Roybal: Okay, gotcha. Yeah. Cuz I went down 600 milligrams. And so I think that's all the way, my body's been freaked out right

36
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.370
Yeah, that's right.

37
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.860
Dawn Abriel: Exactly.

38
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.540
Nicole Roybal: Well, at least I got through it right

39
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole.

40
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a blank piece of paper, write the date.

41
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, um, I

42
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to do a group to group. What do you want to do to have the reduction because it'd be nice to have it even

43
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.370
Dawn Abriel: I guess, why don't you, why don't we do that.

44
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

45
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole right down February.

46
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: 25 foot 1700 and this is the galaxy. And you've been talking about.

47
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. You wanted every week then 1600

48
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: On March 3 1500

49
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: On March 10 1400 march 17

50
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: March 24

51
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Then march 31 I think it's 1200

52
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.480
Nicole Roybal: Yes.

53
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.600
Nicole Roybal: March 31st.

54
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the next date is April 7 I think it's 1100 I'm not writing it down. So I'm counting on you.

55
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: 14

56
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess that's it 1000

57
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.210
Yes.

58
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: April 22 one 900

59
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: April 28 800

60
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.910
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I gotcha. I'll get the rest. You don't have to do that.

61
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You get the idea. Yeah.

62
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But what we can do is

63
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll always if you transcribe this, then it can go in

64
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The note inside the note and it can be a reminder for me to check in on you and say, Where you at, where you at, where you at this way I can help to

65
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.620
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

66
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

67
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.430
Dawn Abriel: How much, how much three. How many of the 300 words do you have left.

68
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.140
Nicole Roybal: You know,

69
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.640
Nicole Roybal: Well, I just bought them last time he prescribed me some and I have I have quite a bit. Okay. Taking him.

70
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.610
Nicole Roybal: So,

71
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.190
Nicole Roybal: I said I have taken only like six doses.

72
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.960
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

73
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.980
Dawn Abriel: That's all right.

74
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:42.030
Dawn Abriel: I just them. So you're you're on killed it gets down to a lower dose. I'm only going to order like 100 of the 100 milligram ones so that you can use the three hundreds

75
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.930
Dawn Abriel: You know, add add as many three hundreds AS YOU CAN I TELL YOU NEED THE 100

76
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.940
Yeah yeah

77
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.800
Nicole Roybal: That works.

78
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.210
Nicole Roybal: And I understand fully this time, I promise. Okay, well,

79
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.370
Dawn Abriel: No, I'm sure I didn't. It was my

80
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.750
Nicole Roybal: Know it's probably my fault too because I always

81
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.790
Nicole Roybal: I hear one thing and I hear it the way I want to hear it. So it's just knowing

82
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I just told Jackie that we just can't put it together because we've only got two. And so, um,

83
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just leave it like that.

84
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it sounds like we need more people in here.

85
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

86
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.760
Nicole Roybal: Is there more people

87
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.870
Nicole Roybal: I guess.

88
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're on a bi weekly or monthly schedule because they put together some some time so you know i mean

89
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean this, you wouldn't even be here.

90
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.920
Nicole Roybal: Right, yeah. I usually be on Tuesday. Right.

91
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's kind of starting to get a little, a little skimpy

92
00:07:50.370 --> 00:08:00.270
Nicole Roybal: Where I originally started my group therapy was this one and I liked all the people I like Mia. I'm Katrina. Everyone always talk to me about certain things and and you guys listen to me. And I was like,

93
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.100
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, that's okay so

94
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

95
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, Doc. If you're done, you can head out and all kind of continue the course. I started here with her. Okay.

96
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.730
Dawn Abriel: By

97
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.110
Nicole Roybal: Me.

98
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:33.120
Nicole Roybal: So on the insurance because how I can't have two one on ones in one week then shirt it'll still show it as a group therapy for today.

99
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Um, I don't know when you say you can't have this, you're not supposed to have it on the same day.

100
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not supposed to have individual therapy and group on the same day.

101
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.310
Nicole Roybal: Okay, maybe that's what it is. Maybe I'm excited.

102
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have it on the same week

103
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.070
Nicole Roybal: Okay, your Medicaid. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

104
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, cheese and then Katrina's trying to get in one

105
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.360
Of course,

106
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Too late. It's 33 minutes we're going to move on.

107
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get into it. Let's, let's get a little bit more information.

108
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted to talk to you about ways to communicate because you were saying you get offended.

109
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because you're, you're, I can see you're trying to protect you know this sort of fledgling, you know, new self confidence. This new image and trying to take pride in what you're doing and

110
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and so it would be nice. I understand that he could reinforce that.

111
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you could practice with him, saying instead I feel this is hard to do, but you do have a choice. You don't have to say, Screw you, I'm out of here. And then there's an argument, you can say how you feel. Why don't we spend a little bit of time.

112
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of practicing that

113
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.110
Nicole Roybal: Instead of saying, I think.

114
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's very different.

115
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.230
Guess what.

116
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I think is subject to interpretation. It's your opinion and he can not agree, but something else happens when you say I feel

117
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say, I think you're in storytelling mode when you use

118
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So I haven't, I haven't done this. I haven't shown you the worksheet on this.

119
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna do right now.

120
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it's so helpful to have this under your belt with your family, with friends, people that work, especially with people that you're romantically involved with this is a standard

121
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:55.890
Nicole Roybal: Awful way to communicate. I'm trying to get the doctor like I've been told this before about I fell, but I don't remember.

122
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably. I mean, this is a pretty pretty important one.

123
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.290
Yeah.

124
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.770
Why

125
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.290
Not going there where

126
00:11:45.780 --> 00:12:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: share my screen with ok so the nice thing about this is that it mitigates which means reduces the potential for blame when we say, I think, blah, blah, blah. It tends to make the other person feel defensive

127
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

128
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I don't want to not, I want to make sure I gotta send a message a virtual clinic really quick. Okay, let me just say group was cancelled. Please let's

129
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.360
Hi.

130
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.000
Jackie.

131
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Katrina needs to know.

132
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.410
Okay.

133
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So looking at this I statements, what we do is we're taking responsibility for our feelings.

134
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, and it will help you improve your communication when you're feeling upset.

135
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: One way to achieve this is by using the I statement this technique will allow you to communicate what's upsetting while minimizing blaming

136
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: If our statements feel to blaming the person we're trying to speak to will often become defensive and then you're off into an argument. So here's the deal. Is it

137
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it up for debate. If I say to you, Nicole. I feel jealous.

138
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a debate of whether I feel jealous. Is it possible that I don't

139
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's absolutely true.

140
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So wow beautiful about an emotion word

141
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that it's not up for debate.

142
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's real. It's what actually happened. I feel offended I feel insulted. I feel hurt. I feel angry, I feel sad, I feel scared. I feel disgusted. I feel surprised.

143
00:13:53.220 --> 00:14:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel happy. I feel excited that is not up for the date the rest of the way we talk. Most of us, it creates this argument because it's a well that's not true.

144
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.620
Nicole Roybal: And then we're on

145
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're in a debate of convincing one another, my reality is real. It's more real than yours. And off we go.

146
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.810
Nicole Roybal: What did you say you're making me jealous.

147
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.150
Nicole Roybal: Nope. Same thing.

148
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll get into that with you. And that's, I'm glad you wrong.

149
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.030
Nicole Roybal: If you say, I feel you're making me jealous.

150
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That won't work either. Yeah.

151
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.160
Nicole Roybal: I'm still confused.

152
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Again,

153
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get it.

154
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. On your piece of paper right I feel and a blank space, it's only three words.

155
00:14:51.330 --> 00:15:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If you decide to replace that third word with the word and you can put a big know for the word li ke can't say like

156
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.830
Nicole Roybal: Oh my god, it's like my main thing. Yeah.

157
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're going to

158
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Say goodbye to it, put it on a ship and send it to Peru.

159
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you can't say that.

160
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel that you're making me jealous know

161
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.370
Nicole Roybal: The two words I use a lot

162
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.290
Nicole Roybal: It's gonna

163
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But here's the neat thing when when your communication gets cleaner.

164
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be understood faster.

165
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:36.900
Nicole Roybal: You're going to

166
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: feel less insulted less alone less loved. You're going to feel when you actually speak.

167
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: on an emotional level.

168
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll go really fast, the person will hear, Oh, you're feeling jealous.

169
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I care about you. I care about this person I know I wouldn't want to feel jealous.

170
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the natural course might be what's going on, what's. Why would you feel tell us what's happening. But let's not go off there. Come back, come back, come back, let's

171
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Come back, let's first get the structure, then we'll come out of it. Okay, so the key piece, the key function here is I feel you. You got to only put in an emotion word, the only word that can go there is an emotion word

172
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people don't talk like this.

173
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're going to do, we'll do it together. First let's play with the little exercise, they have here. So take a look at this example.

174
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically we talk like this we say here, you're right in here. You make me angry. That's how you talk, huh, you may be angry because you're always late.

175
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:54.720
Nicole Roybal: Right.

176
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:56.370
Nicole Roybal: Let's say

177
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

178
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Fallacy with this Nicole is it's not actually true.

179
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, step back from this

180
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You take my will use me because I'm here, I'm the only other person so will take me

181
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: This, in my life all making it up. So don't get too caught up in the story. And my husband is a never home for dinner. He's never on time and I don't get angry.

182
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm grateful makes a good living and

183
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I really appreciate the the way his career is he's got to stay late and he's working with people that just you can't walk away from them. So I get it.

184
00:17:50.850 --> 00:18:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you hear in that that it's the same event of someone being late. But it's subject to interpretation. He doesn't make me angry or not angry.

185
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But the truth is way up here. Look at this one. Remember what you wrote down. I feel angry now. That's true for you. Not for me.

186
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I might say, I feel lonely.

187
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: For you. The key is to really get maybe for the first time, no one makes you do anything. I don't make you do anything.

188
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a filter with which you view the world with which you interpret people's actions with which you perceive threat danger. We all have a filter.

189
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it is your filter.

190
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And so here's what how we play with that.

191
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't even want to get into that too far off, because then you'll miss learning just this part will go over to interpretation in a little bit. Let's get all the way through these examples, and then we'll circle back. So here we go.

192
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You totally like you make me angry when you're always late.

193
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.970
Nicole Roybal: I know I'm

194
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A girl and me so

195
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

196
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm changing ownership and I'm owning I'm not projecting I'm instead I'm owning my own feelings and I say, there it is. I feel frustrated when you come home late because, well I stay up late worrying.

197
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: For

198
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.740
Nicole Roybal: One better than the first.

199
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Does and it's because it's it's not blaming this other person. It's just explaining your experience. It's not blaming it's explaining your experience, I feel frustrated

200
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: When you come home late you just stay right there. You don't have to go into the because

201
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Because when you go into because my gosh, it just gives more details and then the arguments about the because

202
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The cleanest way is just, I feel frustrated when you come home late on on Thursdays, because that's the day like I actually, you know, right, you got your reason in your head. But if you don't explain it.

203
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you don't run the risk of an argument going on and on. So it's just I feel frustrated when you come home late and then you should then you shush, shush exhibit

204
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.630
Nicole Roybal: Exhibit problem too. Yeah.

205
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you zip it and then this person, Daniel.

206
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Has a decision.

207
00:20:45.930 --> 00:21:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: He's looking at you. You just own drone feeling. You didn't say it's if I'm down. He didn't say it's my fault that you're frustrated just said you feel frustrated when I come home late and I get to do something, I get to care about you.

208
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I get to care about your frustration or not. I have that right

209
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.590
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

210
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This gets to show up, but it's not filled with a bunch of storytelling, on and on and on. Justification on and on.

211
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do another one.

212
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You never call you don't even care.

213
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the typical way we talk we we say how we see the world. And then we plug in an interpretation of it.

214
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And we accuse someone. Hey, you don't even care about me based on the fact that she never call like this person doesn't even say anything we've already analyzed and said you don't get

215
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.710
Nicole Roybal: And it's like time them how they feel. So, of course, then they're gonna get defensive. Don't tell me how

216
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: To hate it. No, and you don't like it, too, right, because what is this person is Daniel is saying.

217
00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Your blog about that's a boundary crossing. We don't like it when someone crosses the fence and comes over to our sciences. Well, this is what you're thinking. This is how you're feeling

218
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, we would prefer if people kind of just own their own stuff. It'd be convenient. So that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna leave this parade of honesty and we're going to start

219
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go, instead of you never call you don't care. We're gonna say I feel hurt when you forget to call and for you. I won't even get into the because

220
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.800
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, for me, yeah.

221
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Cuz that's next level is you need to be ready for what's coming your way barely have a handle on this.

222
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.000
Nicole Roybal: So when

223
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel hurt when you don't text me when I text you back. Period. Period. You go, I feel, here's my emotional experience of an event. Those are the only things you're sharing

224
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now you're going to get quiz here you're going to do one ready

225
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to say it to me because it works better. I'm going to be the friend in the scenario for all of them. Okay, so you're directly talking to me.

226
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So your friend keeps canceling plans at the last minute and you've known me for 1520 years. Okay, so you have been dealing with me for a long time being flaky.

227
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

228
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.690
Nicole Roybal: With me. Okay.

229
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the flake in this

230
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

231
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Last weekend last weekend you were waiting for me right at the restaurant. When I call to tell you, Oh, I'm not gonna be able to make it. And you felt

232
00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Hurt, but maybe in this you might feel something else. So it's up to you. But now using the I feel

233
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:54.960
When she got

234
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Some nosing around out there.

235
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:10.110
Nicole Roybal: Um, yeah, the mailman comes going up to his car isn't there by his body was, I was like, who the hell is getting in the mailbox. Sorry. Okay. I FEEL COZY canceling any

236
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:11.670
Nicole Roybal: Heard

237
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to

238
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:13.410
Hell.

239
00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here, I feel you're only going to do three words. What do you say to me.

240
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.210
Nicole Roybal: Ah, OK. Sorry, I'm thinking of the way I would react normally

241
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.160
Nicole Roybal: You're gonna

242
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it differently because you don't want the same result. You can do the same thing, but you're going to get the same result.

243
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.730
Nicole Roybal: I feel that

244
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:36.480
No.

245
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.710
Nicole Roybal: As I say, that are like every single time after feel okay

246
00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:44.580
And

247
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an emotion word

248
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: you've known me

249
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: For 15 years right

250
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.270
And I keep doing it.

251
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.800
Nicole Roybal: It's hard. It's really hard not to say those words I feel

252
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.540
Nicole Roybal: Upset

253
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:09.660
Nicole Roybal: When you don't show up because it seems like how

254
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.620
Nicole Roybal: I can't not you like or that

255
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You said I feel upset now upset is a word that's it's not precise upset can mean Mad, sad, it can mean different things. So it's a risky. It's risky.

256
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.700
Nicole Roybal: But it's a little bit of both. Because even taking me forever.

257
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So then you say,

258
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.200
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

259
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad and bad. You can do both.

260
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.050
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I feel sad when

261
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.940
Nicole Roybal: I feel I get mad when you don't show up and you keep flexing.

262
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.810
Nicole Roybal: And also makes me sad because I don't get to see you. I miss you.

263
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay not bad. You did sneak in a light for the map. He

264
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I but but you move so fast I could check and you

265
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.930
Nicole Roybal: Know, just get it out before I forgot the end of it.

266
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a, it's an arrow. It's a causal relationship for you. It's

267
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.290
Nicole Roybal: I feel

268
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: angry when you don't keep your commitment.

269
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel angry because I got a babysitter. I got my hair done nails done bought a new outfit took a bus that took me 45 minutes to get here.

270
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't go out with Sarah I'm in order to keep this commandment. You see it.

271
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That is, that's your experience, it's not the only truth because you don't know what I'm feeling

272
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.620
Nicole Roybal: Exactly. Okay. But

273
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They both exist at the same time.

274
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll find out. We'll find out the other side. But at this point, you're just trying to on your part, without saying you make me

275
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I don't make you do nothing. MAYBE, MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE reinforcing that she'd been doing it for 15 years but maybe makes me think you really care. Okay, so very complicated. But you get to say I feel angry and I feel sad because they don't get to see much

276
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.150
Right.

277
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that makes perfect sense. We're going to do another one. You're doing great.

278
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Another one out. Show your this is a tough one because when you're working with a group, especially at work, this kind of thing comes up and we got to use the same skill at work, too. So you're working on a project with a group and one member is so lack of lack and

279
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

280
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not completing and it'll be me. I'm a slacker my

281
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Not completing the tasks on time. I'm really comfortable because you are doing it for me.

282
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's a great

283
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to do it because like you have a better accountability and

284
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever, maybe I'm insecure and I'm not confident, but you're

285
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.410
Nicole Roybal: Confident you

286
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't do it. And I'm just going to say nothing.

287
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You have repeatedly had to finish my work which has been frustrating for you. So what do you say to me, take your time go nice and slow.

288
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Third word will be an emotion.

289
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.490
Nicole Roybal: Yes, yes.

290
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.750
Nicole Roybal: I feel

291
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.400
Nicole Roybal: What I want to say is, I feel like you're taking advantage of me, but I can't say that I feel

292
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.130
Nicole Roybal: Angry

293
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:53.490
Nicole Roybal: Angry so I don't want to push them over. I feel I know whatever I feel angry when you don't do your part of the work, because then it reflects back on us and makes us look bad.

294
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Well then you zip it and use

295
00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

296
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.850
Nicole Roybal: Though, like I said something better.

297
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic but but noticing yourself how hard it was for you to own your anger as if that's a forbidden one for a lot of families are not supposed to. That's the one that. Instead, what you do is you describe the experience of anger and you don't end up saying

298
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm angry because I keep having to do your work and it's it's pulling from how good a job. I could be doing at my part, because I'm spreading out all of this time to everybody's

299
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And I could be doing a much better job for the part that I'm getting graded on and I'm I'm I'm I'm angry. Right. Yeah. Oh, you did great. Okay, let's do another one.

300
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, we don't really have blockbuster anymore, so it's

301
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.020
Nicole Roybal: Probably not.

302
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, but, um, you know, maybe a

303
00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.320
Nicole Roybal: Pretty good.

304
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like, you know, some really cool.

305
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.300
Nicole Roybal: Makeup. But I was a weird one.

306
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna make us good so I'm the friends that borrows stuff and I bring it back to you. Damaged usually

307
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.300
Nicole Roybal: I'm okay clothes I put that into okay

308
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.260
Nicole Roybal: Okay, so you can

309
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I keep borrowing stuff and I bring it back missing a button. There's a little stain on it. Um, that's a good one because it's pretty common for people. Mm hmm. And of course, I'm back again and I want to borrow that pink sweater again.

310
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.190
Nicole Roybal: And maybe one

311
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you like it and you are worried. What do you say to me.

312
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.910
Nicole Roybal: What I would say, Oh no, I'm probably gonna work this weekend so now

313
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.620
Nicole Roybal: I feel

314
00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:05.700
Nicole Roybal: I feel angry when you bought. I don't want to say, angry, angry. Okay, whatever. I feel angry when you borrow my clothes because

315
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:14.490
Nicole Roybal: I noticed that sometimes you damage them and I don't want you to damage my favorite pink sweater.

316
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.330
Nicole Roybal: Either way, no matter what the situation is gonna go wrong.

317
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

318
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that you've done it.

319
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice about yourself how hard it is for you to sit with your own anger.

320
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:39.150
Nicole Roybal: Hard. I don't know why I don't want to express to someone. I'm angry that I feel like it's going to make them angry and then they're just going to project back anger and then it's going to turn into an argument. So it's like saying upset is better for

321
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.190
Nicole Roybal: Like okay she's not angry, she's upset.

322
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you, you. There's a lot more wiggle room with this. Once you really get it.

323
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:48.540
Nicole Roybal: Then

324
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The more nuanced and you can say irritated.

325
00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.880
Nicole Roybal: Annoying good on

326
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, those are those are little cousins of angry. I'm kind of a pest.

327
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you can put your own flair to it, but you don't get to wiggle around with that until you figure out this structure. If you start, you hear the note as soon as you say, like, or that and I knew it before you even started doing it because it's

328
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That. Amen. She's not on Nicole. I knew you were going to do it because everybody does it.

329
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

330
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:20.700
Because

331
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:31.500
Nicole Roybal: I went to Valley High School over here in New Mexico and Albuquerque, and after, after I went there, I noticed, I would say, like, like after like every like word like like like

332
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:38.400
Nicole Roybal: It was so annoying. I'm like, oh my god. So now I still have that and it a lot.

333
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's

334
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool to be conscious when we're unconscious. I want you to think about how powerful words are now take a step back, you may know why you caught that that habit in that school

335
00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But our words are the best symbolic representation of what is going on in our head and our hearts and our soul psychology. That's all we've got.

336
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.510
Nicole Roybal: Maybe, yeah.

337
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.040
Maybe a hug.

338
00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe cleaning up after someone. Yeah, there are some gestures that the best we can do is through a story you know through poetry through through talking. Think about how good it feels when someone really understands you

339
00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right feels amazing. You feel loved. Right.

340
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:42.270
Nicole Roybal: Yeah definitely goes the other way too. So if you take the time and be conscious be awake be on purpose. Another person might feel respected and cared for.

341
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might end up being able to communicate a level of intimacy that you haven't been able to in the past.

342
00:33:51.480 --> 00:34:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You might develop different kinds of friendships, people might get to know you really know you and then that I feel like a phony thing might start to dissolve because you know what, you're not showing up with a story approximating how you feel. No, no, saying it. I feel

343
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Unimportant and you don't show up.

344
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To our lunch. I feel

345
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:29.280
Nicole Roybal: Like the main just like emotion sad, angry or happy, whatever. There's so many other words

346
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There are. But remember, you're just learning right now. So there was no time for the for the finance. Now there is once you really get this and immediately practice it.

347
00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: With with family and you can say it in positive ways to I feel happy. You guys are all sitting around and we're making food together. You just did it. You did it in a positive way.

348
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, instead of what most people do is you should hang out with the house more

349
00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because

350
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.260
Nicole Roybal: Why, why are you telling me that

351
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Also what I'm doing. We just don't own our own feelings. Most people grow up in homes where they don't. So you're not alone. That's like the norm, unfortunately.

352
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Amen. But, but then children don't get to, to find out that they have a right to them.

353
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: They get to understand how to handle them, they don't get modeling from their family about what's a healthy way to process feelings.

354
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's there's some downside to family systems that don't own their own feelings. Okay, so let's take a couple. We gotta go. But let's do one with with let's do a couple of Daniel. Daniel

355
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:42.690
Nicole Roybal: I'm

356
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: gonna insult check

357
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

358
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Make a decision.

359
00:35:51.720 --> 00:36:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That I don't make you feel anything that's the new filter. Right. It's like, Hmm, I feel it nonetheless you do feel it, you feel hurt probably insulted minimized unimportant all those yucky ones.

360
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But the truth of the matter is that you're making meeting about what I'm saying and doing you are responsible for that because the next person may make a different meaning out of it. I hear it from Daniel and I'll go

361
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.700
Nicole Roybal: Below the term you use

362
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go away. You know, because I'm not offended. I can see what he's doing. I like okay he's doing what he always did, and he's testing to see if I'm going to get as upset or maybe this is how he fills up so it pisses me off and

363
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, so I can see it all play out. Like, oh boy. There it goes. Again, I'm kind of hungry. I'll see in the kitchen. And it's not a thing for me but you

364
00:36:51.870 --> 00:37:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What he says because you still put a lot of weight into what other people say. And think about you. You've given been given away your power for a long time.

365
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. You're going to say I feel

366
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.730
Slow way down. Okay.

367
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I'm Daniel I say all that's all fine and good, you know, I'm Nicole. But I don't think it was gonna last very long. In fact, um, how about we have a little toast will have a little champagne. I mean it is you know Valentine's Day. Don't be a bitch. Come on.

368
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.170
Nicole Roybal: You. There's nothing like that. But

369
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:39.360
Nicole Roybal: I feel pressured when you're trying to push off a little my face because you know how good. I've been doing and why would you try to take that away.

370
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So the last one. The. Why would you try is

371
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: A baby. That's a, it's a big that was a big push you did great on the first part.

372
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.860
Nicole Roybal: Yeah I know, I'll say yes my girls are they good I shouldn't say

373
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me, give me something he would say, it'll hit home better if you give me my script.

374
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.300
Nicole Roybal: I'm he'd say something like, I'm

375
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.780
Nicole Roybal: Sad. So he was saying last night is saying that

376
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:18.090
Nicole Roybal: No matter what because the okay so he was trying to say because of how I've had my withdrawals in the past and how intense, they are

377
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:28.410
Nicole Roybal: That there's no way I was just drinking alcohol that I'll have to have been on drugs as well. And so he thought, I've been on time and I'm like you, dude, I've been clean off drugs and alcohol and now I'm coming on board.

378
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.030
Nicole Roybal: I got it.

379
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.680
Nicole Roybal: You got it though. Sorry.

380
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.500
Nicole Roybal: Anyway, when he says something like that. I guess I could say I feel

381
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no. You got to go through it. Let me say it to you.

382
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Harder.

383
00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, Nicole. I think you should really own the fact that I know you're telling everybody that you you were actually, those were withdrawals, but I know you were really drinking and or at least using some other drugs. I, I would appreciate if you would just own it.

384
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a deep breath. Remember the box breathing. I told you you breathe into the belly, you can take as long as you want. And there's no doctrine on this planet that we have to respond to someone within 10 seconds we can take our sweet time

385
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You get in touch with how you are feeling and it's okay to have that feeling. And if he's worth your time of day. Can you tell them how you feel and why, very simply, what

386
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.130
Nicole Roybal: I feel very angry.

387
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait what, wait what

388
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.110
Nicole Roybal: I feel very angry. Oh.

389
00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:36.780
Nicole Roybal: I guess I added to bury my buddy.

390
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, keep going. I didn't mean interrupt.

391
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:48.000
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I feel very angry when you say stuff like that because I know how hard I worked for my sobriety and

392
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.400
Nicole Roybal: No links. Oh.

393
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so a little, a little extra one at the end.

394
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.690
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I always tend to do that was extra

395
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It One More in this time go with

396
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel sad, try it out and see what happens when you do that one.

397
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:13.320
Nicole Roybal: Everyone, everyone is angry every single one of them has been angry, I feel very sad when you

398
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Drop the very

399
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.520
Nicole Roybal: Oh, am I saying, I know I feel sad.

400
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:23.130
Nicole Roybal: When you tell me when you say stuff like that because

401
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.370
Nicole Roybal: I know how hard I work because basically the same thing is angry. I know that.

402
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:43.740
Nicole Roybal: You're not right and I'm serious. I affiliates that you think I am on drugs or drinking anything worse because I would never do that. I'm clean because of him or not because of him, but he's willing to help me through all of it. I'm not just gonna

403
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.790
Nicole Roybal: With the drug part not the alcohol. Right.

404
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:48.780
So,

405
00:40:50.490 --> 00:41:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That was closer to actually how you felt typically anger is a secondary emotion, it's protecting that other one. And so, notice how it felt a little bit more true you were feeling it a little bit more

406
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.560
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

407
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what you end what you can end up saying over you, Sam back I feel sort of initially angry but underneath them sad.

408
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I value what you think of me. And one of the reasons that motivated me was for you and then you don't see

409
00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I progress.

410
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And you shush, but you're not giving people a chance to care. You don't shush.

411
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Give a

412
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:35.880
Nicole Roybal: real problem for me.

413
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: They we've got to have a chance to hear you. Human beings can't hold much in our little working brain right at the same time, we can have this amazing storage capacity. And I can remember some things from being little

414
00:41:51.390 --> 00:42:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Haven't even thought about in a while, right, but I can pull it up for my my hippocampus but right here, as I'm listening to you. I can't remember much so you you're wasting all those words, you might as well just say one sentence. That's the one. I'll actually here.

415
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And give me a chance to show you I care about you. Don't you want to know if I care if you're hurting and sad.

416
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:26.580
Nicole Roybal: When I'm a lot of sense. Lot of sense because it's like they'll have their first or emotion or thought and then by the time I'm done talking with my frickin Long's huge sentence.

417
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:34.110
Nicole Roybal: Then they go to anger or to another thought. And they totally forgot that. First off, but they're good and see member

418
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course it makes sense. Remember I was telling you earlier, you could drop the because

419
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why if you go about your because I could skip over hearing the sad and just focus on the content of the because and never show you I heard you.

420
00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're doing yourself a disservice. Especially since you and Daniel don't have these new skills. He doesn't know how to mirror which is the listeners skill set. So you're robbing yourself of an opportunity to look in his eyes and see I just told this person I feel sad when you minimize

421
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The progress. I've made.

422
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.920
Nicole Roybal: And you sure, is it. Yeah.

423
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get to

424
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because part of this process, whether this turns into some relationship down the line or dissolves is seeing reality for what it is.

425
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Find out if you really cares and I know it's scary to do that. But this is a way to find out. You

426
00:43:45.930 --> 00:44:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Open your heart up, we said, what's the truth for you know we we we make it vulnerable to the actions of others. That's what we do when we're in an intimate relationship we trust them. We say, here's my little underbelly my sad. How are you going to treat my sad.

427
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to find out if this man is trustworthy with your tender feelings we couldn't do that before and I know it's scary because what if he's a turkey with them. Well, at least want to be nice to know now, he's a turkey.

428
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.150
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, Mr showing only skills. When I first met him.

429
00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So what the reason why I focused on this today was to say it doesn't mean that it's only an FAQ and out the door, you go, there's other ways to interact. Give it a try. Don't maybe you'll forget, but it's

430
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:41.400
Nicole Roybal: Not going to forget. This is a big thing. And I really am trying to think of anything I do to make sure that we don't fight that we just get a long fight.

431
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And a go to for you could be, oh, Daniel. I'm feeling defensive. I don't want to fight. I'm feeling defensive

432
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:50.550
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

433
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a really

434
00:44:53.220 --> 00:45:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Because after that if it continues. Then we get into anger and I can't you know righteousness. I thought that that though, but you're sharing your truth in the moment.

435
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.060
Let me see. I think we

436
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.960
Nicole Roybal: So we have Wednesday at 12pm next week for our one on one or next one.

437
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I put

438
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.370
Two. What did you

439
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Say yes.

440
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:30.600
Nicole Roybal: Yes. Okay.

441
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Primary care physician.

442
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And go commit to the volunteering your day is about to get really structured because that's going to set everything you need to do is going to wrap around

443
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I ready. Am I showered in my business. I'm what am I going, where am I, where am I going to go. Am I gonna have my goodness it's all going to be around that volunteering. So go find out more and see if you can see yourself commit to it.

444
00:45:53.730 --> 00:46:00.330
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I will. I've been in before so I know what to expect. I just different people now so I'm kind of scared.

445
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you'll be fine.

446
00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:03.360
Yeah.

447
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This is for your recovery. This is for you. cares. It's just volunteering, no worries.

448
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But do tell me you can text me if it gets really scary. Okay, let me know. Okay.

449
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:24.330
Nicole Roybal: I just realized tomorrow's Valentine's Day. I don't think I'm going to go to a meetings. I'll be at Daniel's. Would it be okay if I go to the NA meeting tonight instead

450
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, absolutely.

451
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.780
Nicole Roybal: Okay. All right.

452
