00:16:54.390 --> 00:17:01.920
David Dusseau: You know, I was bad on it and 80s and 90s since I've gotten on Suboxone it's a lifesaver for me.

140
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.800
David Dusseau: I know I'm thinking about using

141
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.270
David Dusseau: OBS

142
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:12.360
David Dusseau: But I was mad, you know, always from 1974

143
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.900
Magalie Marcellus: So how long been clean

David Dusseau: From opiates.

146
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:38.850
David Dusseau: I've been clean from old is since I got all my teeth out, I got one script of Percocet, about six years ago.

147
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:49.290
David Dusseau: And that was it. Before that it was about five years before that I got on heroin for about six months.

148
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:59.070
David Dusseau: And that brought me down real quick. I went from I'm 195 right now. I was down at 137

149
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:11.010
David Dusseau: And I went into a homeless shelter to get sober and got back with my wife and my son was only like two years old.

150
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.900
David Dusseau: But I never mess again because during that time I crossed it my feet.

151
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:20.610
David Dusseau: I

152
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:26.310
David Dusseau: Went out and my pickup windows down truck wasn't running quit on me.

153
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:34.590
David Dusseau: And lucky I I woke up so cold and my P i couldn't walk on for a month and up in the hospital.

154
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.270
David Dusseau: And that's a good reminder because I still heard today.

155
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.090
David Dusseau: They're numb the single they burn.

156
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.120
