1
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.130
Samantha Scott: Okay, cool.

2
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.530
Samantha Scott: Let me turn my volume up one second.

3
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

4
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.960
Samantha Scott: Okay, now I can see you.

5
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so happy Friday to you.

6
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.810
Samantha Scott: Happy Friday.

7
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.400
Samantha Scott: I think many of my zoom set up better.

8
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.220
Samantha Scott: But I can't get the light right in here. It looks dark. Oh, well, I'll work on a more

9
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're I think you told me that this was a phone, um,

10
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.340
Samantha Scott: No, I started on a phone. This is my laptop.

11
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.270
Samantha Scott: I think my phone was probably better picture than my laptop actually

12
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if I've seen both, but both of them.

13
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.370
Samantha Scott: grainy.

14
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: They both. Yeah.

15
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you think

16
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.340
Samantha Scott: I don't

17
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:08.190
Samantha Scott: I don't know i mean it's it's it's always dark in here, but now I've got like a lamp right here, a lamp right here, a lamp right there menu, Mexico, all the windows are open.

18
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it possible that the the where the camera is that it has like smooch like like a fingerprint. Awesome. It's just Michie

19
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.040
Samantha Scott: That looks better. Hold on.

20
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.190
Samantha Scott: I think that looks a little bit better. I still need better lighting, though.

21
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.830
Samantha Scott: But yeah, that was definitely a little bit of it, I think. Good call.

22
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, your screens frozen some waiting for it to unfreeze okay

23
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.340
Samantha Scott: That that may have done.

24
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Done a little

25
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: There's definitely something unique and I'm not quite sure what it is because typically

26
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.570
Samantha Scott: I can see, you know, what am I had

27
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:13.920
Samantha Scott: Last time, our last group, the last 10 minutes it was all this like weird slow down sounding thing like for a second. I was like, am I going crazy. And then I realized. No, it's just that I'm hearing everything everybody's saying it's just more slow down.

28
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We're okay well let's

29
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Just keep our eye on your video. There is something distinctly kind of grainy about it. I don't know if it's just the

30
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know enough about

31
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.620
Samantha Scott: It. I don't know. I'm working on it. I wanted to be better because I got it. I'm gonna have to use this for other

32
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.390
Samantha Scott: Purposes. I'm sure at some point.

33
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're I think you're going to benefit more from what it's like to sort of be in contact with

34
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And when the

35
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit crisper. Now I don't know if I come across really hear

36
00:04:48.750 --> 00:05:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You okay, good. Okay, good. Alright, so let's let's let's turn away from our technology since it's not something we can take action on right now and let's go to if you want. You said you've kind of had on your mind, quite a bit what's been on your mind.

37
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:25.620
Samantha Scott: Well, I just, I mean, I've been thinking about like what. Well, we talked a lot about my mom, um, last time, but like a lot of the I feel like some of the stuff that maybe I talked to you about before, or just that I've thought about before has been like clicking into place like this morning.

38
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.290
Samantha Scott: I told you, our car got stolen or I don't know if I did, but our car got stolen, um, we've had a rental car.

39
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:49.230
Samantha Scott: A rock fell off of a truck and hit the rental car so global a blog. He's on the phone. This morning kind of being aggressive with the people that the insurance people, which tend to be effective.

40
00:05:49.830 --> 00:06:05.280
Samantha Scott: And he's good at doing it without being, you know, going over the line or whatever. But when he does this, it always affects me you know because I've heard that same kind of tones and it's like when I hear those tones. It just affects me and

41
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:18.300
Samantha Scott: For years I've wanted to be less affected by it and then this morning I was laying there and I was getting into that thought process of like this was like 815 or 828 or something.

42
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:31.110
Samantha Scott: And I was barely waking up and I heard him being aggressive on the phone and but I realized what he was doing. I was like, Okay, this is what he needs to do this guy's not calling him back, you know, blah, blah, blah. It's

43
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.350
Samantha Scott: It's good. And then I was like, You know what, this is his deal. This has nothing to do with me.

44
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.300
Samantha Scott: And I, I don't need to be upset by it.

45
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:54.210
Samantha Scott: pretty major. I mean, I still felt upset by it. But the fact that I could even say to myself, this has nothing to do with you and

46
00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:10.080
Samantha Scott: There are going to be times when people are going to be around you, and they're going to raise their voice and they're going to raise their voice for good reason. That has nothing to do with you and I'm tired of being like affected by that all the time, you know,

47
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. So the last part is

48
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That initial response that sort of hit of, oh, I don't like this that's probably going to be there and I hate to say forever, right, and it may, it may dulled down over time where it's it's more like it's a nuisance, or it's an irritant.

49
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.470
Samantha Scott: Right.

50
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But the more or you can get into accepting that that initial threat response is going to be there. Based on all those years of association with your mother. It's your relationship to that, in a sense, it's exactly what you did. It's that's not

51
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.420
Samantha Scott: It felt amazing

52
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, it still feels amazing. Like I feel like I'm like that's like a real

53
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:10.710
Samantha Scott: Breakthrough and I know it's like the only the beginning of it, but it's like every time I did that is probably like you said, it's going to strengthen the connections.

54
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:30.060
Samantha Scott: And always not like to hear that up. But as long as I don't internalize that it's so much better because that moment of getting upset is fine. It's the hour lead and a half later than I have to wait to calm down, that's like really

55
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.760
Samantha Scott: You know, hot

56
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.020
Samantha Scott: You also

57
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

58
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

59
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.330
Samantha Scott: Yes.

60
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:50.040
Samantha Scott: That's been huge. I've been doing that a lot of been doing. I mean, not always to the end. I feel like we really made a breakthrough with like all the with the

61
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:59.100
Samantha Scott: I mean I feel like this is all connected like we've talked before about the the Peter Levine, the somatic the like trauma vortexes and stuff.

62
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:15.330
Samantha Scott: I'm really into that and I've always felt like all my sort of shoulder and like weird pain. It's about like how I hold myself and it's been like this for 10 years just like it tends to center like right here and

63
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:27.630
Samantha Scott: I don't know, I just feel like I'm breathing, you know, I mean, I'm even thinking about like breathing into those spots. You know what I mean, like, and trying to just loosen it up and

64
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:39.030
Samantha Scott: Like, and we're going to work on getting more exercise. I already have been going on more walks. I'm going to do the cardio in the backyard on the exercise bike.

65
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:50.340
Samantha Scott: I think that'll well I'm I'm writing, I'm like I said I'm writing a I'm working on my blog have spent on the back burner for a long time and

66
00:09:51.090 --> 00:10:09.150
Samantha Scott: This is kind of the perfect time to work on it because people need content because a lot of people are stepping off and I'm trying to make helpful content, like how to help the homeless. You know how to be safe on things that you can do for free at home to entertain yourself.

67
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.380
Like

68
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.600
Samantha Scott: Yeah, it's good.

69
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, um, let me turn towards

70
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The previous session, I want to look at

71
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.440
Okay.

72
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So you mentioned

73
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned an author and you mentioned Peter Levine, but then you went into the pony Daigle

74
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Which so Peter Levine is primarily a so she's an amazing clinician an author. He, he's the designer of the somatic experiencing techniques somatic x

75
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.370
Or anything

76
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.470
Samantha Scott: I haven't had that

77
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.520
Samantha Scott: Sounds cool

78
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um, it's it's interweaves in the work that you and I are going to do. It's in there.

79
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I really do believe

80
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That that body does keep the score and there are going to be some profound messages in there. The you're going to hear me use since I didn't get trained with Peter Levine, you're going to hear me using somatic transformation.

81
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that is more

82
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's from this woman up in Seattle. So you're going to hear more of

83
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.870
Samantha Scott: Her general idea. Yeah, okay.

84
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the same thing. Stephen gorgeous is the author of the poly bagel theory. He's the one that discovered the dorsal eventual Vegas nerve that indeed.

85
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a mile a native version of it that's attached to our facial muscles.

86
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.770
Samantha Scott: Are I muscle on this.

87
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Your muscle that is it's my eliminated. It's really key that she here and that is smiling needed because

88
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It is our social engagement system. It's the reason why, when you talk with someone and it's the reason why I want you to have really good video but

89
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is because this feels good.

90
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: When someone that we're socially listens to us contains are difficult emotions we feel heard, known and understood just feels amazing.

91
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason it feels so good.

92
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if that ventral

93
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Nervous, which is like, I'm like,

94
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, that's like that's like so cool that you can describe that in science. It's not just theory anymore and I just love it. So,

95
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:36.570
Samantha Scott: That's pretty cool stuff. I bet I made a ton of people are probably having poly vago withdrawal right now. You know, I mean, I mean, I guess the people who are on zoom or like, you know, getting some of it, but

96
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is rough, you know, if you're if you're not if you're not in a romantic relationship or you're living with someone, or with kids, or even a pet.

97
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:59.460
Samantha Scott: This is what I mean. And it's, I'm feeling lucky to have like somebody that I'm with and stuff. But honestly I just feel like I'm not talking like every time I talk to somebody, whether it's like customer service or like it.

98
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:18.720
Samantha Scott: Just like such a relief to be talking to. But I'm actually making plans for that. Um, I, I talked to one of my friends, my good friends last night on Facebook and and we're going to get together for like weekly, you know, zoom sessions or whatever. So that'll be good.

99
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.070
Samantha Scott: I need more talking than just my husband can provide

100
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:23.970
Samantha Scott: I know

101
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I need a little diversification in the context

102
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Of our now i'm so I'm looking, I'm looking at this note wasn't quite yet. It was on the six. It isn't written yet so i don't i don't have it all quoted yet but

103
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: My recollection is

104
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The introducing this notion of gaslighting

105
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder where

106
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Every part yeah where that landed with maybe how pieces might be starting to come together.

107
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:10.620
Samantha Scott: Totally. I mean, I like I said, I mean, when I hearing her, you know what, it's hard to like describe all of it without hearing like the whole first of all, like when I

108
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:20.970
Samantha Scott: When I heard her saying that it's like not like I've never heard anybody say something like that. But the fact that it was the mother connection and

109
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:35.970
Samantha Scott: The fact that she. I mean, it was so different, because like her mom was like bohemian and like the problems were, you know, I never had any of those kind of problems like where people are partying too late or coming into my room or

110
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:45.060
Samantha Scott: But I mean I had my own version of that insecurity of not and I mean one of the things I've thought is that, um,

111
00:14:46.470 --> 00:15:08.970
Samantha Scott: This whole thing about like a wanting to control my husband's anger and wanting him to not be angry, I think, is connected to me feeling that it's unsafe to express my opinions and feelings, especially this the intellectual ization thing, you know, and

112
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:30.090
Samantha Scott: I'm trying to then project what I've internalized as like proper behavior don't show any emotion no vulnerability, blah, blah, blah. On to him. And I think that's in addition to the noise level of it, the trigger. I feel like that's part of, I don't know, I could be wrong.

113
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

114
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take what we did with. We did a lot of sort of

115
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Introduction almost like psycho education to watching someone else's experience and you were introduced to maybe feeling validated. Like I yeah there it is. Yeah. Other people around.

116
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've had an opportunity to apply some of these skills. I'd like to have a kind of day today. That is different.

117
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so today what I'd like to do is start preparation and preparation is in and of itself is an intervention. So, for example, but I'd like to do with you is I want to develop and these are going to feel random, but I'll explain myself. I'll

118
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Always explain myself. Whatever you do, I want to develop

119
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:18.810
Yeah.

120
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Brain Stuff, which is a protective figure nurturing figure wise figure a container distancing metaphor in an anchor room. Sometimes it takes 345 sessions to develop that some problem, we'll get to that today.

121
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.890
Samantha Scott: Just FYI. I am not familiar with most of those terms so

122
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's opposed to you that's

123
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.050
Samantha Scott: Okay.

124
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a shift gears from all of that analysis, you just did, like, this is why I do what I do what I do what I do, I do. And just right brain. We're going to go right brain. Now we're going to use imagination.

125
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Many use. You don't have to pull for memory and knowledge storage from left brain.

126
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to be whimsical

127
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.030
Okay.

128
00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:58.860
Samantha Scott: That

129
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's if it's uncomfortable. Then let me know, okay.

130
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, if it's like something else. I'm always interested in whatever the experiences for you so

131
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll repeat myself, it don't you don't have to know what it is the first time, I'll just keep explaining it until it's like, oh, that's what she's asking for. So what I'd like to do. First I want to develop your resource team and

132
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: These are real or imagined. And so let me, let me explain. First one is going to be a protective figure. So what I want you to do is think about this ideal of a protective figure. It can be a morphosis of real imagined it can be a blending

133
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.940
Samantha Scott: So for some people want already

134
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. But is it

135
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.650
Samantha Scott: Detective stabler from as for you.

136
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. That's it. Detective stabler okay

137
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.200
Samantha Scott: He's really good looking.

138
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.070
Samantha Scott: Either but

139
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the main thing.

140
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't doesn't hurt the imagery at all.

141
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope. It don't. Okay, that's beautiful. And are there any mixed feelings as in, in any given moment would detective stabler not be

142
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective or does he embodied protective quality like perfectly

143
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.720
Samantha Scott: Perfectly, I think. Yeah.

144
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.220
Samantha Scott: In modern culture.

145
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. We do what I do.

146
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.230
Samantha Scott: Other things you might want somebody else but for your protection.

147
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.130
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

148
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we're looking for.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.650
Samantha Scott: Today, and when I say

150
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pull up the quality of detective stabler immediately. You're going to go oh yes in here in his presence. I feel safe.

151
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: He's got my back, my friend, my, my six he's got he's got me. Okay. Beautiful.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's a hard one for some people. Okay, this one the figure wants for you, your growth your potential to be reached know ambivalence know I get back in return. It's just pure and simple. Your cheerleader your champion. Yes, this is it. You got this garage. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

156
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.950
Samantha Scott: Oh, and so much harder. I'm

157
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.770
Samantha Scott: Really trying to think

158
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: real or imagined.

159
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.840
Samantha Scott: Right, it's going to definitely be a match.

160
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:45.510
Samantha Scott: Time on and just ain't or like fictional but um, let's see.

161
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:56.220
Samantha Scott: It's weird because I don't know whether like I just naturally think like should I be thinking of a woman, but

162
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you free associate and we can rule them out. See what you don't know about us yet is you can say something and just be so sure and 20 seconds later, you know what, when delete that I got something else you can do that here.

163
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.120
Samantha Scott: Okay.

164
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just take

165
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:17.580
Samantha Scott: A then

166
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You can have. Okay.

167
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:27.150
Samantha Scott: See, I guess, you know, Dolly Parton

168
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it.

169
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a certain song that comes up a certain image that I can summon up if I were

170
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.440
Samantha Scott: Just like I'm

171
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:45.540
Samantha Scott: Just that smile, you know, and I mean always think about me and Lily, Andy. No, that's real sad one, but she is

172
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, she does. Okay, so, Dolly Parton and it's a lot embodied in that smile.

173
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.190
Samantha Scott: And that worked. And that, like, just like southern

174
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.510
Samantha Scott: Don't have you ever saw Steel Magnolias but like I have

175
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.870
Samantha Scott: Actually shot in the closest town where I grew up.

176
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.970
Samantha Scott: Close reveal is about, like, an hour outside of negatives, which was that

177
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so. Okay.

178
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We're southern

179
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Hospitality encouraged me

180
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.590
Samantha Scott: And like humor and like wanting to

181
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:29.460
Samantha Scott: She's always really supportive of everyone and she wants them to all be happy. And it's not like yeah

182
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Never would she say anything negative about anyone. She just asked if she did. It'd be like, oh, she's just cranky and book about right would be

183
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.890
Samantha Scott: Yeah, right.

184
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.760
Samantha Scott: Right, like the true embodiment of like southern hospitality without any of the, you know,

185
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.830
Samantha Scott: Yeah, okay.

186
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now also make sure that she represents this quality.

187
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Of wanting you to reach your potential

188
00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.700
Samantha Scott: That didn't work because

189
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:11.190
Samantha Scott: I saw this thing recently Reese Witherspoon to TV show the first episode, she does with Dolly Parton and she meets up with her and she's like, when they asked me what I wanted to be when I was

190
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:26.460
Samantha Scott: In kindergarten. I said, Dolly Parton and it was just so warm and like she was like women empowering and I just found out she produced Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which was like where the most feminist. Yeah.

191
00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the name of it. Now, this is sort of self serving. What's the name of Reese Witherspoon show

192
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:48.510
Samantha Scott: Think it's called shine on I've watched all of them. But the first one was her and Dolly Parton and it's just her meeting up with women, she admires and talking to them about why she admires them and who they admire and it's pretty cool.

193
00:22:49.410 --> 00:23:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Having nothing like that where you can have any kind of TV show you what like Oprah money like why would be so cool. I would love it. Honestly, I'd love to give people everybody in the audience.

194
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be like, I'd be like, here's unconditional love unconditional love. Here's

195
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.640
Samantha Scott: The dream.

196
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the dream. Oh, we gotta let that

197
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: let that one go. So let's

198
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:14.760
Samantha Scott: Just

199
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just try and get it for you, showing

200
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:17.610
Samantha Scott: Good.

201
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go. That was fantastic. Dolly Parton

202
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:21.900
Samantha Scott: Feels good.

203
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let's go to a third figure, which is why senior

204
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.510
Samantha Scott: Like what I mean just wise, like how else would you describe

205
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember that the ultimate goal with this is, it's your team. It's a resource team for you.

206
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Wisdom around you, what would you want it to be.

207
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.080
Samantha Scott: Like right

208
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.750
In kind of thing.

209
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:01.950
Samantha Scott: See

210
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.220
Samantha Scott: I feel like I'm only pulling from TV.

211
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:22.680
Samantha Scott: The business show top of the lake and Holly hunters in it. And she's like, really quiet but she's like her character is really quiet but she doesn't bullshit. She speaks in like really

212
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a

213
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: network TV show kind of

214
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.700
Samantha Scott: Was like a British TV show, but it has the chick from madman Elisabeth moss on it.

215
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:41.400
Samantha Scott: And it's like she plays. She's got all gray hair, long, long gray hair no makeup.

216
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:42.390
Samantha Scott: She's living out

217
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:51.570
Samantha Scott: But basically, she's all about. She says, pure wisdom and she doesn't bullshit. She's not flowery you know

218
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.290
Samantha Scott: It's real hard to describe. Unless you see it, but

219
00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

220
00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I know it doesn't matter what I think right

221
00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.690
Samantha Scott: It's like, but she's, she's wise.

222
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:10.560
Samantha Scott: But not caught up on my pretense or anything like whatever the most effective way to say something is if that's causing she's gonna cuss if that's you know

223
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.160
Samantha Scott: Right.

224
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I just tried to look it up to figure out what the show was but you get you picturing her

225
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of

226
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:29.820
Samantha Scott: sitting there, smoking a cigarette, like she does in the show saying that's bullshit, or no, you know, or whatever it is.

227
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Top of the lake. Is that a thing. Yeah, top, the top of the lake.

228
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:43.020
Samantha Scott: It looks like Holly Hunter with shocking gray hair she's like from another world, almost

229
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But not. Okay. So let me go back to where we are with this, we are at Holly Hunter. And if I were to pull us back. If I'm bringing imagery, it is with long gray.

230
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: wear your uniform and she is

231
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise.

232
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:07.650
Samantha Scott: And spiritual guru you guru kinda but not the usual code.

233
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So kind of a snarky guru.

234
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:12.720
Yeah.

235
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've got wise Frank spiritual guru.

236
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.170
Samantha Scott: I get it. Yeah, Frank. Totally. That's good.

237
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay, okay. But you do get a sense that it's it's not just to diminish to put down it's she's gonna lay out her truth telling us it

238
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how it is just

239
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Straight truth right

240
00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.130
Samantha Scott: Right, right. Totally.

241
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you like that idea of being around that kind of honesty. Right.

242
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.770
Samantha Scott: Do I like the idea being around radical honesty, I like the idea of one day being radically honest but

243
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:50.880
Samantha Scott: I don't know if I'm there yet.

244
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Beautiful. Let's do another one you doing great.

245
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do an emotional container, the instructions on this are also really sparse.

246
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: capitalizes on this disability of our minds to compartmentalize well I I'm taking that natural aptitude that we do. Maybe some people call it denial or whatever. But I'm going to take it and I may use it deliberately

247
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say you and I are doing an emotional activity and you're really activated and it's like, Oh, dear. We only have five minutes to process, what's happening. And it's like, oh, you need

248
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: 25 minutes. To be fair, we have it and to you, I might say, you know what, Samantha. How would you feel about putting what is going on for you physically, emotionally, spiritually and putting it in this container.

249
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And here it is. You're going to design your own container and here are the instructions.

250
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to think of a container that is

251
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff.

252
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably going to be that negative stuff negative

253
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably wanting that in the box. The other stuff. Who would want to tuck that away that this stuff is probably going to be your emotional your negative emotional stuff. So I want you to get some visualization on how big, what is it, what's the shape, color, is there a lock and

254
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: How big

255
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.830
Samantha Scott: It's gonna be big. I mean,

256
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:30.840
Samantha Scott: What do you like African like a stick like us like one of those big steel drums that they like ship a whale in or something.

257
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Got you. Me to steal and how will this stuff. Stay in there if you want to put it in there has to get in there and how does it stay

258
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:45.090
Samantha Scott: There's a hatch. That's like sealed by whatever magic ceiling function.

259
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:53.040
Samantha Scott: I forget what that's called, but it's put in, put into place and then a master logs put in and spotted

260
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Master Lock spun beautiful and you know the isn't a combination

261
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.680
Samantha Scott: Yeah, it's a combination.

262
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.050
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

263
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.340
Samantha Scott: And

264
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I am the only one.

265
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.350
Samantha Scott: Can just died. Let me grab

266
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: A writer without a pen.

267
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.110
Samantha Scott: Well, that's like if you use it. It's got around

268
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:23.580

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go.

270
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course, now it's

271
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, a keyboard. All right. Beautiful. Now, oftentimes, and this I'm going to put a little spin on this is oftentimes and I stopped putting this in the front end of the of the invitation is yeah so big enough strong enough.

272
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: To hold all your stuff. And what is it that's in there that will keep that stuff inside

273
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:59.520
Samantha Scott: Like, what will keep it in there. This the strength of like the inches of steel and the strength of the hat.

274
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and the end that is true. And for some people.

275
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When I asked that because there was. Notice that I didn't ask it quite like that.

276
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Came up with this on your own, but actually what's inside that will help it stay what's inside that will make it want to stay

277
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.170
Samantha Scott: Oh, like something that makes it like it.

278
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't tell something comes up.

279
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to stay there.

280
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.550
Samantha Scott: Because it's

281
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.730
Samantha Scott: Field with like

282
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:47.520
Samantha Scott: Projections of fear and pain and like, it's like totally occupied because it's like, this is where, you know, oh yeah, this is great. It's like a sports game for a sports fan or, you know,

283
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

284
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.000
Samantha Scott: It's distracted.

285
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.140
Basically

286
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great.

287
00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do another one. This one is good for same kind of thing, let's say, and I'm going to give you some examples. And then just come up with your own or you could certainly use one of the ones that I mentioned. So this is a distancing metaphor.

288
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Very commonly used. One is, I'm in distress. I don't want to be thinking about this anymore. I'm angry and resentful I'm offended. I don't want to be offended. I'm here on the riverbank with Dolly Parton

289
00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Watcher.

290
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Right. And detective stabler I'm here on Riverside grounded here and what I see is down the river this leaf and it is my resentment and I watch it as I stayed here feeling what it's like to be here with my team and I see it.

291
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I see it, it's moved so far away. I can't even see it anymore.

292
00:31:51.690 --> 00:32:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I put it in. I write it on a balloon I tie it and it has helium and I watched it drift away or put it in a space of rocket ship. And it takes off like

293
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.060
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

294
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Or it's so fast it's on a shooting star.

295
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, please.

296
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.610
Samantha Scott: Yeah, because it's like it just seems more natural, like that you would be standing there and

297
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:15.210
You know,

298
00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: A leaf on a river River.

299
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.120

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Idea, these, these right here will remain in my notes. They will follow us in our work together, which means that I can pull them up if you forget I can pull them up. I can interweave them when necessary, but they can also evolve and I want to keep saying that just because we said it.

312
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.940
Samantha Scott: Right, right.

313
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You may know that

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:37.650
Samantha Scott: I might be a different person and some point later. And I want to have a different person with me right

315
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.420
Samantha Scott: So although this seems like a great team right now.

320
00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.580
Exactly.

Gwenevere Abriel: I like the one I got one that's like, yes, Tony Stark, Tony.

322

Samantha Scott: That that's a good one. That is a good one.

323
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:14.970
Samantha Scott: Because he's so charismatic and he's just such a Robert Downey Jr, like all the things he's come over. He's such a rock star, you know,

324
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's not hard to look at either

325
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.100
Samantha Scott: Know exactly

326
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.150
Samantha Scott: It doesn't hurt.

327
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Her okay so nobody ever asked me, but mindset. I don't know who the actress from from Outlander is to Fraser

328
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.620
Samantha Scott: The fellow. Yeah, yeah.

329
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.090
Samantha Scott: Oh, yeah, yeah.

330
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: He's all of it for me.

331
00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:42.180
Samantha Scott: You know, my friend keeps telling me about Outlander. Like, literally. He's like, you've got to watch that show. I never have. Maybe I should

332
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Do. Okay.

333
00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

334
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll definitely consumed by. Okay, moving on. So now I'm going to show you something. Now I want to develop. I'm going to save the anchor room because it's a really

335
00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: in it of itself, it's a very powerful intervention and it can take quite a bit of time, we may get to it. We may not. But right now I want to start to fill out even three or two, or if we only get one that's fine. But I want to start to to fill in.

336
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What I call this a thermometer. It's a it sounds sort of like a robot, but it's the subjective unit of distress. So I want to get an idea when I'm talking with you this story. You say,

337
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And the emotion, the somatic response, the negative thought content and a number. And so I want to hear this snapshot in time. And I'm going to give it a number

338
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Bell house. So I would like to do that with you. And right now I want to find your 50 now 50 from zero to 100 now zero is chill relaxed.

339
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right 100 has to be super angry or super scared. Those are our fight, flight now.

340
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course people there is the negative 100 it's zero to negative 100 which means some of their trauma is in a dissociative state. So whenever trauma their big traumas, where there was a an immobilization

341
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Some people relaxation is not automatically a wonderful thing. I think I've got a little bit to that. So I just want you to know that there's that too. So if you say me. No, no, this is a freeze. I'm starting to like space out right now. I got my first clue.

342
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay. So you have the whole range you but I just, most, most people, they're going to his anger or fear.

343
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:42.510
Samantha Scott: Right, I tend to disassociate. So I think that it will be one to one.

344
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Or zero to 102. Now I want you to go just in your imagination. You don't have to say it out loud. I want you to go

345
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Pop. Don't say it out loud. Just go in your worst imagination, the hundred would be, or was

346
00:36:55.110 --> 00:37:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And drop it on not going to tell when that when I'm going to drop it down to what would 50 feel like in my body that's. There's just enough discomfort, let's say, or distress to have a meaningful story.

347
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can you are still, you still have access to all of your brain, which means you could still

348
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.180
Samantha Scott: Ride. Thanks. Right, right.

349
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.530
Samantha Scott: Okay, okay.

350
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me the story just a little

351
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.720
Samantha Scott: So I'm thankful. First, I'm thinking of 100 hundred

352
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.120
Samantha Scott: Be like

353
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.420
Samantha Scott: Yeah, that

354
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.510
Samantha Scott: I'm 50 would be a lie.

355
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:48.930
Samantha Scott: I would say 50 would be getting laid off for the second time.

356
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:52.530
Samantha Scott: Was that

357
00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:07.890
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I mean why I'd already been laid off like a couple years ago because of cost cutting and then when the came along. I was laid off again. But this time I was laid off with almost the whole rest of the staff.

358
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

359
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.300
Samantha Scott: But I didn't feel very upset about it, honestly.

360
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, we're going to remember it might look so we're going to go with that. Just go with that we go we're going to play it all the way through. So we're

361
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Able to were laid off for the second time.

362
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What is the predominant emotion.

363
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:36.510
Samantha Scott: Fear of not having money. I mean, that's like the number one thing with a job, fear of not having money.

364
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So the fear is not having money so the thought is

365
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch. I'm going to pull apart thought and belief now, so you have the thought, oh dear, I might not have money. And, of course, that causes fear.

366
00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to go a little layer underneath that. And I want to go to the belief about the self. This one takes time. Don't rush to it. Don't think you're supposed to get it right away. Okay.

367
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:06.150
Samantha Scott: Okay.

368
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It just be gentle you rule them out. So maybe it's this one. You can even say it out loud. And I'll say, Okay, keep going. Let's find it. So here we go sit with oh no I might not have enough money.

369
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to see what the belief about yourself is

370
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll know it by finishing the sentence, I am

371
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe a mountain myself to be I am

372
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.940
Samantha Scott: I am unable to take care of myself.

373
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't take care of myself.

374
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.860
Samantha Scott: I can't take care of my dogs.

375
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep going. One more underneath that, what does that say about you. I'm what

376
00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.090
Samantha Scott: I'm not a I'm

377
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.110
Samantha Scott: Irresponsible

378
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stay there. Is there anything underneath that

379
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.650
Samantha Scott: I'm not good enough.

380
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you got it.

381
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one that's typically one of those heavy hitters like that.

382
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.520
Samantha Scott: It seems to be a big one for me not good enough.

383
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But it gets fed by

384
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh dear, will be so awful. If I don't have money.

385
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:40.770
Samantha Scott: Also identity, you know, I mean, you have your job is like your prayer. If you like it, you call it your career and you it's part of your identity. I did like edit and loving and I think there is a certain sadness. That's going to be difficult to get another job like that.

386
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.750
Samantha Scott: But there were so many bad things about that place to

387
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me almost

388
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something there that may be iron

389
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Me, try this on.

390
00:40:54.870 --> 00:41:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back to the thought, oh no, I don't have money to feed my dogs and pay my bills.

391
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:04.320
Samantha Scott: Right.

392
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to tell me what's your identity. What, what do you believe yourself to be in that moment.

393
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.040
Samantha Scott: A loser.

394
00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:18.390
Samantha Scott: I don't want to think that I think that, but I think that

395
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You. That's another core one really core you found one you didn't take you about a second to get there. OK, now let's go to a happier place for a split second. That's uncomfortable.

396
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's go to

397
00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The positive cognition, what would be nice and convenient if you thought about yourself in a positive way. What would the I Am be no matter what you were Dolly Parton you were I'm always in what am I always thinking if I'm

398
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Smiling

399
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.300
Samantha Scott: I'm smiling. I'm good enough.

400
00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there we go. I'm good enough fun and that's it.

401
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:08.250
Samantha Scott: I'm like this. The I sold that you know from Saturday Night Live. But, you know, smart enough and gosh darn it, people like me.

402
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's actually a lot easier said than done, but it's a hard thing to get to know. Yeah, to actually believe that. Yeah, okay.

403
00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me check in. Now you're going to hear different scales. Just listen to the new one. There's lots of different skills, it's intentional. So how true is it today from one to 717 the penultimate of I'm good enough. How true is it today. I'm good enough.

404
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:47.070
Samantha Scott: Today, it feels really good like five or six

405
00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:47.880
Samantha Scott: Right now.

406
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.420
Samantha Scott: Right now. Yeah, let's say 5.5

407
00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: On a scale of

408
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:54.780
Samantha Scott: One a scorecard.

409
00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:58.980
Samantha Scott: One to seven. Okay. Right. I was thinking

410
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. You're good, you're good, you're good. Let me

411
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Rewind because like I got telemedicine issues. Let me just check in. Let me go, nice and slow. The scale was 1277 is the highest is 5.5 still a good number.

412
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.030
Samantha Scott: Let's say five

413
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so new scale. Here comes a new scale for new cognition. Let's rewind to that that uncomfortable when I'm using the word uncomfortable. You didn't say that. So let's go to the negative cognition of I'm not good enough. I'm a loser from one to 10 How true is that today.

414
00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.310
Samantha Scott: Three.

415
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got your passion.

416
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.670
Samantha Scott: Right right now.

417
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So trying on

418
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That feeling of fear around. I'm not good enough and the truth at a three.

419
00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you feel that truth in your body. I'm not good enough. I might not have the money to pay for things. I can't take

420
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:12.690
Samantha Scott: pit of my stomach.

421
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

422
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

423
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: 15 minutes

424
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Over here, so

425
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this.

426
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

427
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to, so feel those things. So we'll do all the pieces will go

428
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Gosh, I'm not gonna have enough money. That's what this means. Look, I look I'm laid off. Oh, I won't be able to pay this. Oh, I, I feel it in the pit of my stomach. I'm not good enough. Right. A little bit of it. Um, and

429
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back in time. Now, Bridget to the earliest time in your life that you had that pit in your stomach. How old is that pit.

430
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:33.330
Samantha Scott: I don't know exactly. But gone like kid like

431
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.010
Samantha Scott: You know,

432
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.490
Samantha Scott: Definitely before I was like five or six

433
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Before he

434
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.890
Samantha Scott: Bumped before like probably five

435
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But for

436
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.100
Samantha Scott: Like I mean I'll anything

437
00:45:51.210 --> 00:46:05.070
Samantha Scott: Like okay, opened up the thing I remember the thing that's coming to mind is opening up the refrigerator. My dad would say good to get some more to eat good

438
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Goodness.

439
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:18.600
Samantha Scott: And I was kind of pudgy I really like to like eat biscuits with like syrup and butter mash up together.

440
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And

441
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.420
Samantha Scott: You know, no.

442
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:33.960
Samantha Scott: Bounds on it was good but not every day. Um, but yeah like that really hurt. I actually stopped eating sort of in high school to try to get really skinny, but I never got really skinny.

443
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

444
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you, how's the gut right now.

445
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.090
Samantha Scott: Right now, it's okay.

446
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And

447
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.770
Samantha Scott: So I don't feel that I'm not there, you know,

448
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Some distance between that that memory. So how stressed, are you, what is your son, your subjective unit of distress right now around when you pull up into your working awareness.

449
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you going to get some more to eat good

450
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:07.470
Samantha Scott: How does it feel, how does it like that, like, now how does it feel

451
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.100
Yeah.

452
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:10.830
Samantha Scott: I'm

453
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.830
Samantha Scott: On a scale or just an award.

454
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: All of it I want I'm interested in. I gotta I'm going to place it on this scale the prompter. I'm also

455
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm also

456
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.970
Samantha Scott: There was one to seven or one to 10

457
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's. This one's actually on the one to the zero to 100 I'm trying to play.

458
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.700
Samantha Scott: Zero to 100

459
00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.770
Samantha Scott: Okay, I'm

460
00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:38.190
Samantha Scott: Right now feeling that it's like maybe a 25 or 30

461
00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.580
Samantha Scott: And it's a pissed off.

462
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

463
00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you know what the belief about yourself was then so get back into that memory, what did you believe I am what

464
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.170
At

465
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.200
Samantha Scott: unlovable.

466
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:15.180
Samantha Scott: Stupid. Although I never knew that one, but it just, I knew I wasn't stupid, but it's just something. It's one of those words, you say to yourself, you know, I know you're so stupid.

467
00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you say at and then unlovable, and then stupid.

468
00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. Okay.

469
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one seems about to that again that feeling.

470
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:33.030
Samantha Scott: Which one feels the most intense

471
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Which I'm kind of seems like it really captures the core belief about yourself. I am when he said that and you heard it your intention was to go eat something yummy.

472
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were being spontaneous and just a little girl, it's so yummy. And you know how to do. Okay. You know how to go get it and you are going to go get it.

473
00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and the shock.

474
00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.590
Samantha Scott: I guess I'm lovable out of those three um

475
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.010
Samantha Scott: But stupid feels right.

476
00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stupid, let's leave it.

477
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to kind of take this and also attach it to this is the bridge memory.

478
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you're just kicking butt to an all these cool things. This is going to move us along like so quickly. That's great.

479
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad we met.

480
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:42.090
Samantha Scott: This is a fun. This is like I've never had a therapy sessions like this. So this is really fun.

481
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, you're gonna, I think you're gonna like the anchor room to so we can kind of

482
00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We can start this one just a tiny bit. I'll just get maybe the first ones we've got just a second here.

483
00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I can start dilemma we can start to figure out the stuck spot. So let me just educate first and tell you what the destination is with an anchor room.

484
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's your happy place. That's definitely going to be a but it's more than just a happy place this anchor room never existed. It just, it's going to be from your imagination is going to be all of your unmet needs will be met in there.

485
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds awesome

486
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:31.650
Samantha Scott: It's like it's gonna be like my Pinterest want board like all

487
00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Totally. Yes.

488
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

489
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:37.980
Samantha Scott: And salt lamps everywhere.

490
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome. So, so, in and of itself and development of it. Like I said, can take many sessions and all sort of depends on on flow. There's no way. And I'll repeat this several times, no way you can do this wrong.

491
00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I can screw up, and I may, but you can't possibly do it wrong.

492
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Your next response is the right response. There's no way for you to get it wrong. You cannot miss step. Okay.

493
00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:07.470
Okay.

494
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:10.290
Samantha Scott: I believe you.

495
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Have good. So first let's let's see what a dilemma is so Sam when you kind of look at where you are in your life and you've been trying to hammer away at solving something

496
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, sort of a psycho biological stuff. Um, where are you stuck where you feeling like unblocked around something

497
00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.110
Samantha Scott: I mean,

498
00:51:43.500 --> 00:52:01.770
Samantha Scott: I mean, I guess I'm not feeling blocked right now. I mean, I know I must be somewhere. Um, but, like maybe what's hardest for me. I mean, the hardest thing right now is my mom. She keeps texting my husband.

499
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:12.540
Samantha Scott: Sending in pictures of her with her grandkids and Stephens, like I said you can block her. But he, I don't know if he did or not so

500
00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's give let's find words I have some I have ready in case you can't find some you like

501
00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That behavior ongoing she keeps doing that. What do we call that

502
00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:27.300
Samantha Scott: Ross moment.

503
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do it. So blocked around mom's harassment.

504
00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, you can always change it if you don't like it anymore. And later on. Okay. All right, now it's your body and make sure that that's true. So go in

505
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: This room is pretty important. So our starting point can be quite useful. If we have a really, really core starting point just touch in and see

506
00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I sure know how to do all of these things. I know how to handle these things, but I just am so blocked around my mom's harassment, check your body and see if it lands somewhere that resonates. Yep. That's true.

507
00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.240
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

508
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.400
Samantha Scott: Word here.

509
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you pointing

510
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:17.250
Samantha Scott: Those are key.

511
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:19.050
Samantha Scott: There.

512
00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah. Okay. Yep. Okay. And that's right. That's our intuition or gut feeling. And indeed, it's summer, right, the kind of high

513
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Low belly button.

514
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.260
Samantha Scott: Right. Yeah, like rib cage.

515
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay.

516
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

517
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to tell you a little bit more about this space and then we'll bring today to a close, so

518
00:53:51.660 --> 00:54:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're going to do is I'm going to kind of talk about it. We're not going to do more of it, but I've talked about it. So we're really ready. Next time we want to do this so

519
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Basically the structure of it is this I will be asking you to remember three things. So it's not a lot of memory. It's largely right brain fancy. It's magic. It's

520
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: All right brain imagination stuff, you will be tempted, because you're human to force memory, you're going to say. But it was pink. It was pink. Of course it's paint. Well, okay, it was

521
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.030
Samantha Scott: But should it be

522
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And it won't be should I'll never say it.

523
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be what

524
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.750
Samantha Scott: What do you want, would it be

525
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you, it'll be

526
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be, what, what do you want it to be right now. Oh, it's this right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now.

527
00:54:51.780 --> 00:55:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're sitting with that. So, you know, this need, right. So you're going to hear some of that, like, was that that's how you remember it. But now, then retune in and get in touch with what you really want.

528
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so there's going to be three pieces of me there's so few it's be like, How can so it's it'll be, how old are you, we've already used to that. I do that a lot. So you kind of

529
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Want. Okay, well, how old is that, and then there's another one which is what was your nickname. And then the third one I won't do until you're already in the room. Okay. We've already cultivated this room and that sort of this larger clinical piece.

530
00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But

531
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

532
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't ask it until it looks like that room is just right.

533
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

534
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.800
Samantha Scott: Okay, totally setup.

535
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.810
Samantha Scott: Yeah, okay.

536
00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:49.500
Samantha Scott: Cool. But the first two are how old and Nick.

537
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so there's not going to be big. It's not going to be pulling from memory.

538
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.190
Samantha Scott: about setting up the room than it is about

539
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:00.390
Samantha Scott: Yeah, okay.

540
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a minute and just reflect back and maybe maybe go into where to you maybe do the

541
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the opposite of what you think you should tell me just see if you can find that one a non Southern thing the non people pleasing thing.

542
00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Just to step outside your comfort zone. I don't know that I've ever asked anyone that question before, but just why don't you just see if you can find it. Find that find that toggle with this is the time for reflection and I look back and I share it was important to me, but

543
00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I have this compulsion that have this longing to want to say something else you know that's maybe not the good girl thing.

544
00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can at least find it.

545
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:56.190
Samantha Scott: Anything or

546
00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll just find it at least

547
00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:58.740
Samantha Scott: Like you

548
00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, oh, that's not very southern that's not very nice to say

549
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, about what

550
00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.200
Samantha Scott: No, you're wrong.

551
00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.880
Samantha Scott: That's a hard one.

552
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.510
Samantha Scott: For me,

553
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic.

554
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:20.040
Samantha Scott: Easier on on what I'm typing but in real life. It's really

555
00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So try it on for just a second and see how it feels. So, so, look me in the eye and just say right hands on the hip. The whole defiant girl. Woman You're wrong.

556
00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're wrong, or you got a bobble

557
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.740
Samantha Scott: You are all

558
00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.350
Samantha Scott: Really doesn't feel comfortable

559
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But right I can do it.

560
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:55.140
Samantha Scott: If it's necessary. That's a good skill to have.

561
00:57:56.610 --> 00:58:07.590
Samantha Scott: And I would like to be able to because like there's sometimes when you need to fight for things, you know, and I would like to be able to fight for things when I need to fight for things

562
00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and you have

563
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You have certain person in your life. It makes those calls. Don't you

564
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:15.210
Yeah.

565
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:30.450
Samantha Scott: So I am. Ah, yeah. Well, I mean, and I appreciate the fact that my husband does most of the beaching and all that stuff because he's like, way better than, than I am. He gets better results. He stays calm.

566
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:44.610
Samantha Scott: I'm but I would like to be, I would like to feel like it's alright for me to get pissed off about something or how somebody treats me and hold on to it and say,

567
00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:59.430
Samantha Scott: You know, yeah. That's bullshit. You know, rather than like getting to a point where it's like, whoa, they were loving all our time and you know I think that probably would be a good goal for me, actually.

568
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.080
Something to

569
00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The treatment plan at some point.

570
00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:15.150
Samantha Scott: Where I'm like really expressing my my feelings about something to somebody and not just saying what I think they want to hear need digger. That's very hard for

571
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice in. So the, the, we're going to bring it to a close. After this after hear from you is I'm just pay attention to what I invited. What I invited was just just tuned into

572
00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like

573
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That energy of, oh, I know I shouldn't say this in here today. I can't tell this woman, she's wrong.

574
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, like that was that was there today and not said certainly didn't say that organically. I sort of pulled it out of you, but not organically. So just, just notice that the you may have had some

575
00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have had

576
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Your off the mark when you're not quite spot on for me here or off the mark.

577
01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: If you find yourself having that experience. You can either say it. You can acknowledge it, you can do whatever you want with it. I mean, definitely. I want to tell you there's permission to do it because it it's a waste of your time. If I'm off the mark and we're not at least addressing

578
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:33.510
Samantha Scott: No, I wasn't. I thought you just wanted me to say something that was uncomfortable. Okay, good. I just didn't want you to think that I was actually saying that to you.

579
01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:34.530
Because, okay.

580
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But you just made my point. I don't want you to see it. I thought that you just right.

581
01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.230
Samantha Scott: You already asked me to do it. Yeah, okay.

582
01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But even that is uncomfortable, like you had to fix it. Just now. So that's what I'm trying to get out is

583
01:00:51.180 --> 01:01:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If the layer of people pleasing the heart is so entrenched, you might rob yourself of the defiance of the pushback.

584
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you get to practice that a little bit in here. Um, I mean you can't threaten my life and things like that. Otherwise, I've got it you know will be a problem. But you get my point like

585
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

586
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:21.210
Samantha Scott: That is a safe space to practice and express these things that I'm not comfortable doing in my life right now.

587
01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And as a role model that and then I got a bounce would be something like this. Like when

588
01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the right word for me.

589
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't, it doesn't land right

590
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:37.830
Right.

591
01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

592
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's

593
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: His plate and then you get to watch and see just the world fall apart. Do I manipulate you. Do I extort emotional flesh from you. What do I do

594
01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get to see in real time, that there's room for

595
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Even misjudging overreacting.

596
01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, there's all this room that you know you weren't giving others all this space.

597
01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:22.410
Samantha Scott: Right. Well, I mean, and like my mom. I mean, obviously that's on the president my mind. It's like if I said something like that to her at is basically what I said to her,

598
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.290
Samantha Scott: What was the worst that happened.

599
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.010
Samantha Scott: You know, so yeah.

600
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually the boat. Yes. So let's get going.

601
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.630
Samantha Scott: Now, I think we're on the same track like in terms of where I'm

602
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.040
Samantha Scott: Want to

603
01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.530
Samantha Scott: Burst out whatever

604
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, yeah, I'm so thrilled. We got to meet on the fly like that.

605
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:48.720
Samantha Scott: Yeah, that was cool. I'm glad I didn't miss it a warm. I was like, oh god.

606
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To do that.

607
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not the only one that I've done that too. I should start it with

608
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.650
Samantha Scott: You didn't miss an appointment.

609
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But offering a last minute, you didn't miss any point, I should do that. The same way when when with kids when there's a call from the school, they start with

610
01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your, your, your son daughters. Okay, literally, I'm not kidding, like they don't even say hi. They say, so you son and daughters. Okay.

611
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:17.910
Samantha Scott: But

612
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.490
Samantha Scott: I must be a very terrifying thing to hear that. First, second,

613
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If you see the phone number ringing and we know yeah

614
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

615
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:43.470
Samantha Scott: Well, thank you so much. I think this really helps me and it gives me a good point to go into the weekend from I was already feeling really good now I feel even better and more empowered to go

616
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking at my book and

617
01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to see what we schedule because

618
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:54.060

620
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:04.950
Samantha Scott: But let me find it.

621
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:11.790
Samantha Scott: I gotta get this notebook organized. Oh, here is what is it Wednesday at 10. No, that's what

622
01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see anything.

623
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:17.130
Samantha Scott: No we scheduled

624
01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It was that may so may 14 that

625
01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:29.040
Samantha Scott: 110 110. Okay, got it. That's a Thursday, right, yes.

626
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.350
