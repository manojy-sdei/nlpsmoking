And I think, you know, a lot of it is being, you know, we're like I said I've missed appointments, you know, and have been able to go to my bonus to get, you know, the medication. I need you know

307
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:29.760
Ashley Locklear: To keep me on the right track. And it's like it just, you know, I got to keep myself on track. And I think I'm in doing good with that and build me a lot. So I think it's helped me way more than you know the medication. They were prescribed me for depression.

308
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.850
Ashley Locklear: Yeah, I don't really think it was like

309
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.940
Ashley Locklear: I really think it was the drugs that were causing me know and majority of my depression.

310
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:48.000
Kathleen Marshall: You know, okay, that's what I was wondering if when you're stable on the Suboxone it for anxiety and depression kind of gets better.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:53.760
Ashley Locklear: Yeah, it really does. You know, and I liked it. I can do different old way around

327
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:22.710

Kathleen Marshall: You tell me when you're feeling it kind of regularly.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.040

Kathleen Marshall: And how much do you weigh about

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:30.900
Okay.

368
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:43.740
Kathleen Marshall: All right, we have your medicines, let me make sure I have your proper pharmacy. Before we talk about kind of how everything works right

369
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.480
Well,

370
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.610
Kathleen Marshall: And I'll double check your phone number is 910-736-7306

371
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.420
Ashley Locklear: Yes, ma'am.

372
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.250
Kathleen Marshall: And then I have a dot lock Lior dot 7341 at gmail

373
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.870
Ashley Locklear: Yes, ma'am. Okay, great.

374
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:38.520
Kathleen Marshall: Alright, they have this that going to Walmart 930 highway 711 I think it says that sound right.

375
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.300
Ashley Locklear: Yes, ma'am. Okay, how do I say leaving. Yes, ma'am.

376
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:52.110
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, so you know you've been doing well on those the current medication. The Suboxone film. So that's what we'll continue on.

377
00:29:53.400 --> 00:30:00.090
Kathleen Marshall: And typically, when people so Suboxone in case, no one's ever explained to you how it works. It's, it's a partial

378
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:18.510
Kathleen Marshall: opioid receptor medication. So on the street. When you get or when you get prescribed percocet oxy code on any of those opioids. They are attaching to different opioid receptors in your brain. They help control pain, but they also give you that kind of real good feeling.

379
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:29.160
Kathleen Marshall: The Suboxone the buprenorphine part of it attaches to those same receptors, but doesn't activate them in quite the same way. So it helps

380
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:38.280
Kathleen Marshall: Kind of have all those receptors be full so that you're not craving the opioid, but it doesn't give you that up and down, up and down feeling

381
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:57.090
Kathleen Marshall: You will have withdrawal. If you stop you know Suboxone as, you know, it's much less and a different feeling, but it's a different way that your body processes it and it helps you. As you know, the world not have cravings, not be chasing that that feeling.

382
00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:57.720
Kathleen Marshall: Yes.

383
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:08.370
Kathleen Marshall: But it has a higher what we call affinity, so it will grab on to those receptors, more than the Percocet and Oxycodone

384
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:17.820
Kathleen Marshall: So if you ever are if you ever have a relapse and you are taking, you know those other medicines and they're all in your brain. If you take the Suboxone

385
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.790
Kathleen Marshall: It will knock those off of the receptors and you'll go into fast withdrawal.

386
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:37.050
Kathleen Marshall: That's why when people start Suboxone initially you probably remember this, you had to be in a little bit of withdrawal and then you started slow to try to avoid knocking yourself into a really yucky feeling withdrawal. Yes.

387
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:52.080
Kathleen Marshall: So that's the way that part works now and has in the Suboxone. The other component, then the lock zone and that one blocks opioid receptors. So it attaches on and doesn't let anything happen.

388
00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:07.950
Kathleen Marshall: It doesn't work when you it's not active, the way we take Suboxone under the tongue so it doesn't have any effect, but it's the point of it is so that people don't try to take it the medicine and, you know, mix it up and injected

389
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:23.580
Kathleen Marshall: Or some other way. And it's to protect you. So that if people find out you're taking Suboxone. They're not trying to get that medicine from you to get high. Now sometimes use it on the street to prevent withdrawal. But that's us. That's not the same, you know,

390
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:36.960
Kathleen Marshall: Kind of danger for you, having to medication. So that's how that's how that part works. You have to put it under the tongue, because if you swallow the medicine, it goes through your gastrointestinal tract and it doesn't work as well.

391
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:46.560
Kathleen Marshall: The same way, it's not absorbed. So you want to take the Suboxone under the tongue. Let it fully dissolve. You know, when you take it. I'm sure you've been doing all of this.

392
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:52.350
Kathleen Marshall: And some people find it. They take the glass of water. First, it helps them with absorbing

393
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:58.380
Kathleen Marshall: The medicine, but you want to put out of the tongue and let it fully absorbed, you're doing it twice a day.

394
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:11.700
Kathleen Marshall: With the met the dose that you're on you're covering most of those receptors in your brain. So you're at a good dose. We sometimes in the future, after a year or two. We talked about

395
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:30.630
Kathleen Marshall: weaning a little bit and seeing if we can get to on a lower dose and the only reason we really do that is if you had another injury or even need a dental surgery, sometimes it's easier for us to treat pain on top when you're on a lower dose of the buprenorphine.

396
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:36.930
Ashley Locklear: Was saying now when I had my C section with my daughter. I actually didn't take any pain medication. I'm doing

397
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:50.940
Ashley Locklear: Yes, ma'am. I don't find we just, you know, taking some boats and like a, you know, very good. And I don't. Good. I didn't need, you know, when I had my son, they had to give me like a morphine drip and now that I didn't. I did not make any that

398
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:56.340
Ashley Locklear: Is tall. Yes. I actually don't. I actually doing good. You might have a surgery like that.

399
00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.960
Kathleen Marshall: That's amazing. To do take

400
00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.200
Ashley Locklear: It.

401
00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.260
Kathleen Marshall: More often, or the same as or take. Wow.

402
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.540
Ashley Locklear: Seven. Yes, ma'am. I took is saying and I was walking and doing everything in the same day.

403
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:07.740
Kathleen Marshall: As agree.

404
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:19.530
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, good. So you've done really well. You should feel really proud of yourself, and I hope that this program is easier for you, you know, managing your kids and your work and everything.

405
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:29.280
Kathleen Marshall: What we do is we set you up with a group and we have a group going right now. Tuesdays at 7pm. I don't know if that's a time that might work for you.

406
00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.300
Ashley Locklear: Know how long did the group's usually last

407
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.590
Kathleen Marshall: One hour.

408
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:49.020
Ashley Locklear: Okay, but now see how it works. If she have so anywhere from like 1230 to three of the 315 I might be at work and I till 1115 if it was like a 30 minute group or something like that. I can do it on my break it word

409
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.920
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah yeah

410
00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.160
Ashley Locklear: Y'all have groups earlier today.

411
00:34:53.730 --> 00:35:03.750
Kathleen Marshall: Yes, they just wouldn't be with me, but we can get you in with a group, I'll ask them to see about that. And it might be with you know people from different parts of the country.

412
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:12.750
Kathleen Marshall: different time zones and things, but we'll see. So let me when I email the care coordinator, the best times that work for you are what

413
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.430
Ashley Locklear: Are early morning

414
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:20.850
Ashley Locklear: Yes, ma'am. Anything from 730, you know, all the way to like 10 o'clock.

415
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:35.430
Kathleen Marshall: I will ask them to look into that for you. If there's not, something like that, possibly, we could have you do 30 minutes of the group, you know, check in and then check back out when you're off your break

416
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.220
Kathleen Marshall: If we're not able to find something at that time.

417
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:53.190
Kathleen Marshall: But typically, what we do is have a group once a week and then you'll probably meet with your counselor and get to meet that person as well your therapist and they're really you're just your help and your coach and they're really good.

418
00:35:54.660 --> 00:36:08.160
Kathleen Marshall: And then I depending on which group you're in. I checked in with you during group if it's mine. Or if you're in a different group we set up an appointment at least for the first few weeks just a 15 minute check in and see how you're doing.

419
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:18.480
Kathleen Marshall: And then we'll refill the medicine at those at those meetings. We also I'll prescribe you nor can I don't know if you've ever used that the nasal spray

420
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.980
Kathleen Marshall: And you've never had an overdose rain.

421
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:23.940
Ashley Locklear: No name.

422
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:32.850
Kathleen Marshall: Yes, but whenever we prescribe buprenorphine we prescribe this as well, just as a safety thing for you to have and I'll send you an email with the links on

423
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.650
Kathleen Marshall: How to use it. But it's a nasal spray that you would use if there was ever an overdose, or if a friend of yours had an overdose. And it's kind of safe to have

424
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:54.270
Kathleen Marshall: In case of that. But I'll send those medications at today. From then on, will just be refilling the Suboxone and we'll check in and see how your cravings are and how your doses doing any issues going on medically

425
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.910
Kathleen Marshall: Any other medications you're on all of those no concerns or problems that you might have.

426
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.530
Ashley Locklear: One question for you or for my lab work.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.180
Brittany Cifers: Now, I know.

782
01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.490
Kathleen Marshall: You must have been very motivated

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:10.200
Brittany Cifers: No, they didn't. They didn't try it all.

788
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.790
Okay, okay.

789
01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:22.020
Kathleen Marshall: And have you ever done any group sessions group counseling sessions.

790
01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:26.280
Brittany Cifers: I don't really like groups. I mean, I'm Tommy Lee sticking myself.

791
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:28.770
Kathleen Marshall: You may mystic to yourself.

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:36.210

807
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.310
Brittany Cifers: I take Tylenol.

808
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.490
Brittany Cifers: And I take a the Tylenol and my gabapentin the phone. Got it.

809
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.270
Okay.

810
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.760
Kathleen Marshall: And what's the OB PRESCRIBING THE Gabba Penton

811
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:54.540
Brittany Cifers: Know my family care was and now she was. She stopped subscribing it for me. So I've got to find somebody else or what helped me

812
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.120
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. How much were you taken

813
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.770
Brittany Cifers: And I was taking one three times a day.

814
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.110
Kathleen Marshall: Do you know what size, it was

815
01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:08.370
Brittany Cifers: 100 300 600. It was the 400 milligrams

816
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:20.430
Kathleen Marshall: And how has your OB ever given you oral contraceptives like the pill to try to help with the endometriosis.

817
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.660
Brittany Cifers: It wouldn't help

818
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:22.620
Kathleen Marshall: Didn't help it.

819
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:29.610
Brittany Cifers: Because I've also had this right here. I had an XP on but they had to take that out as well on the way to my heart.

820
01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:30.630
Okay.

821
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:35.160
Kathleen Marshall: So are you using anything for protection. Now,

822
01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:37.680
Brittany Cifers: I'm not too tired.

823
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:49.890
Brittany Cifers: But I'm when I went out. I think it was maybe a year or so ago I went in. They had no Pap smear, and they went in to take the chicken me for cervical cancer. Okay.

824
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.760
Kathleen Marshall: So you're following up with them to

825
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:58.440
Brittany Cifers: Monitor that I have another pair. I have a pap smear, and this October.

826
01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.310
Okay.

827
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:05.340
Kathleen Marshall: So the next one on is removed.

828
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.290
Kathleen Marshall: Yeah, okay.

829
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:10.740
Kathleen Marshall: It was migrating in your body.

830
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.120
Brittany Cifers: Yes, ma'am.

831
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:12.810
Okay.

832
01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:21.720
Kathleen Marshall: And you said the man, you're with or is that your boyfriend now.

833
01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:24.540
Brittany Cifers: I'm not just yet.

834
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.710
Okay, okay.

835
01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:33.930
Kathleen Marshall: Um, and we talked to you about stable living to have stable source of food you're able to

836
01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.610
Brittany Cifers: Provide for what. Yes, ma'am.

837
01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:47.820
Kathleen Marshall: So the Suboxone I'll talk to you about the films and the tabs. They all work the same way.

838
01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:54.240
Kathleen Marshall: So they have two medications in them and you may know this, but I'll review it so you understand

839
01:05:54.690 --> 01:06:05.580
Kathleen Marshall: The poop an orphan part is the part that helps with your cravings. So you have all these receptors in your brain that opioids Percocet, I lauded

840
01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:20.580
Kathleen Marshall: oxy cotton oxy quote on any of those attached to morphine heroin, all of those attached to those receptors and they relieve your pain, but they also give you that high, and then the low as you withdraw so

841
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:27.810
Kathleen Marshall: buprenorphine attaches to those same receptors, but it doesn't have the same effects it

842
01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:37.770
Kathleen Marshall: Um, so it helps you to not have the cravings, because those receptors are happy because they've got buprenorphine on them. They're not seeking out the other drugs.

843
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:52.290
Kathleen Marshall: But it doesn't give you that same high feeling and then withdrawal kind of that up and down and you get on a nice steady dose and you won't have any withdrawals and it'll help curb your cravings for regular drugs, as you know,

844
01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:52.680
Brittany Cifers: Because

845
01:06:53.130 --> 01:07:03.750
Kathleen Marshall: The naloxone part. The other part of the Suboxone is basically what attached to those receptors and block any effect at all. So,

846
01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:12.390
Kathleen Marshall: That one is just there for your safety. It's to avoid people trying to get the drug from you so that they inject it because if you inject

847
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:18.330
Kathleen Marshall: Suboxone you will get no effect at all because of that and Alok zone, that's in it.

848
01:07:18.930 --> 01:07:34.890
Kathleen Marshall: When you take Suboxone under the tongue than the lock zone doesn't get activated in your body. And that's how the buprenorphine works, but you can't use that drug. I can't crush it or injected or the naloxone will take over and you won't get any effect.

849
01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:36.060
Brittany Cifers: So they put them

850
01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:44.550
Kathleen Marshall: Out of sent to help it from being used on the street for high now it is sometimes sold on the street, people will use it to avoid their withdrawals.

851
01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:52.140
Kathleen Marshall: It's not as risky or as desired because it doesn't have that, you know, high that it's giving people. So that's why in there.

852
01:07:54.360 --> 01:08:05.730
Kathleen Marshall: If you swallow Suboxone it goes through your GI system and it won't really have very much effect. So it's important when you take it to put it under your tongue and let it fully dissolve.

853
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:15.180
Kathleen Marshall: That's the only way that the medicine really gets absorbed well into your system right in your bloodstream from under your tongue as opposed to going down into your stomach.

854
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:29.610
Kathleen Marshall: So you've been on 12 milligrams, which is one and a half films, generally the way we use Suboxone is usually twice a day. It's usually easiest for you to

855
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:42.480
Kathleen Marshall: Kind of, remember to dose that way and that's usually the effects are felt that way sometimes people use it three times a day in smaller doses, if they have pain issues.

856
01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:43.560
Brittany Cifers: And because it

857
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:51.600
Kathleen Marshall: Helps their pain. So four times a day. The way you're worried using it is a lot. And that's a lot to remember if

858
01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:55.440
Kathleen Marshall: You take a bigger dose at a smaller interval

859
01:08:55.710 --> 01:09:10.320
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, adjust that. If you think so, if you were doing one and a half. Some people find that they'll do you could do one full film, you know, full film in the nine and a half film in the evening.

860
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:26.730
Kathleen Marshall: Or the other way around. If you find that your cravings are worse than you could also do you know three quarters and then one and a half later, so three quarters full times. Okay. Um, do you know why you were still doing it four times a day.

861
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:33.990
Brittany Cifers: And because I'm a well because of any help my pain management, a lot more because I period get worse at nighttime.

862
01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:42.000
Kathleen Marshall: Okay, I understand that. I would suggest for you, Brittany, doing a half of a film three times a day.

863
01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:47.490
Kathleen Marshall: So Karen when you wake up one in the afternoon, and then another half at bedtime.

864
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:57.450
Kathleen Marshall: Okay that's that's 12 milligrams and that should give you that nice pain relief and then it's three times a day. So it's about every eight hours. Okay.

865
01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:07.710
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. And the way Brian heart health works is, I'll check in with you again in about a week. You can reach out if you need to sooner but we'll see how that dose is going for you.

866
01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:15.750
Kathleen Marshall: Or if we can make adjustments if we need you let us know if you're having cravings, or if you're feeling too sleepy, any of those problems that you're having and

867
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:35.850
Kathleen Marshall: kind of talk about that. It's important to know if you do if you had a relapse and the way that Suboxone works if you were on a lot of other medicines of opioids, or heroin and you took Suboxone without being in withdrawal. First, it would knock you into withdrawal so

868
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:36.150
Brittany Cifers: It.

869
01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.440
Kathleen Marshall: Are actors on to those receptors and knocks the opioid off.

870
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:54.960
Kathleen Marshall: And so, if any, if you ever were to relapse, just be aware of that you would want to get in touch with us and we could get you started on the Suboxone again. But you would want to be in some amount of withdrawal before you took it, or you're going to feel awful.

871
01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:04.560
Kathleen Marshall: Okay. Um so bright heart health. We do the group meetings. That's why I was asking you about that. It's a telephone meeting or or a

872
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:16.740
Kathleen Marshall: Video zoom meeting and there once a week. So they usually work well for people even better. Introverts are like sticking to themselves, because you don't have to go somewhere and you're just in the you know your own home.

873
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.550
Kathleen Marshall: While we ask is that you, you know, have a quiet area where there's not people kind of moving all around for

874
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:26.190
Brittany Cifers: Privacy, the main time. The only time that I have quiet.

875
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.750
Brittany Cifers: Is mainly on Sundays.

876
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:37.230
Kathleen Marshall: Sunday is OK. I'll reach out to the care coordinator and let them know what you're thinking. We have a North Carolina group running on Tuesdays at 7pm.

877
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.090
Brittany Cifers: Tuesdays this fun

878
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.360
Kathleen Marshall: You could do that one. Okay, we can see

879
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.680
Kathleen Marshall: And we do ask that you don't

880
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:57.030
Kathleen Marshall: smoke or drink, you could drink water or anything but or vapor anything because some people if they're trying to quit that, you know, can be hard for them to

881
01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:57.420
Brittany Cifers: Go.

882
01:11:57.570 --> 01:12:13.770
Kathleen Marshall: To see your watch and just for that period of time, the counselor there Serena is excellent. So she'll meet you then and I can plan on checking in with you at those meetings and then we can refill your medications, kind of going from there.

883
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:14.220
All right.

884
01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:24.270
Kathleen Marshall: You will get once a month, you're going to get a urine drug screen in the mail. You'll get the package and don't open it. That's the most important

885
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:36.390
Kathleen Marshall: Don't open the package until you're in with the virtual clinic and you're in front of someone your care coordinator and they'll have you open it on camera. And then you'll go pee and hold it up.

886
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:41.310
Kathleen Marshall: So that's one thing to remember people get it in the mail I open it and then if

887
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:42.300
Kathleen Marshall: We can't use it.

888
01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:51.900
Kathleen Marshall: The blood work I'll have them send you know will coordinate getting that at the lab that's closer. Is that what you were asking me about

889
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:54.270
Brittany Cifers: Yeah, it's ruining CREEK ROAD. We my closest

890
01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.140
Yeah.

891
01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.230
Kathleen Marshall: And some people are having some issues with coronavirus and labs, not being open so

892
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.540
Kathleen Marshall: We are understanding of that. But once you're

893
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:10.290
Kathleen Marshall: Able to

894
01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:12.330
Kathleen Marshall: Work and I'll review it.

895
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:22.110
Kathleen Marshall: Looks at our liver function tests and your urine test and some basic other labs that okay

896
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.250
Brittany Cifers: All right, that'll work.
