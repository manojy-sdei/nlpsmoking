00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.310

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Morning.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning when right so we got audio. Good morning to you.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you waiting in

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Virtual well

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really great at updating me these days.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, glad you're here. Let me get a note open and what time is your appointment to talk with your insurance company today 1120. Alright, well I'm hoping for good news.

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.670
Ateeq: Oh flow to do

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:01:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So if the answer's no. And they have to to say no to extending coverage. What can you afford. What, what can you do in order to still come in here and let me just say, I know what right her once at a minimum is once a month.

11
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And

12
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You pull that off.

13
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.980
Ateeq: Yeah okay let me do that.

14
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.790
Okay.

15
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what we may do

16
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I may meet with you.

17
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And if Dr. Solomon wants to come in and do a medication, check with you. He can come and do a drop in

18
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And if he can't. I may propose to you, maybe switching to dr brielle who who does do drop ins, she'll just come in for 15 minutes and do a check in, while you and I are scheduled so

19
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's open. I'm flexible and that's where the flexibility is having the doctor come into a session. But at a minimum, I do need to review treatment goals once a month.

20
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If you think you can pull that off. Tuck some money aside.

21
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: To at least sort of see me once a month, that'd be great. And then

22
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I and and so, no way. Can you get coverage under your wife right

23
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.640
Ateeq: Move and try to figure something out with hers.

24
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was wondering

25
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:23.550
Ateeq: Yeah, cuz she she's she has it, and she's good right now. So she actually just qualified for all that and so good for the next few years at the

26
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But you guys are you, you're, you're not officially married, do you think

27
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that maybe the problem today have a common law.

28
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.710
Ateeq: Thing that oh no it's nothing like that. No.

29
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.450
Ateeq: I'm pretty sure they do appear married and stuff like that. But no, not that it affects us from now with Bobby have going

30
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You wouldn't be able to get the benefit to get coverage.

31
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.170
Ateeq: Not probably not through her insurance.

32
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.670
Ateeq: Yeah, the way Medicaid word says it'll cover the individual

33
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.160
Ateeq: So right now the way she has it and

34
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.220
Ateeq: The reason she's getting covered is because she's under a single mom.

35
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.560
Ateeq: Yeah, so that's why she's getting down. Okay. Mm hmm.

36
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.620
Ateeq: Oh, actually, this helps us you know this way.

37
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I see it. I see it.

38
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um, let's focus a little bit. So we're meeting here today just to sort of refresh on

39
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Since I know we're going to continue to see you, the urgency of having to rush something isn't really there. But I do want to touch on some of the underlying things that that have come up when you incur are together.

40
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

41
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see if I can

42
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You can tell me you don't have to wait for me. But what do you, what would you say has been one of the things that has maybe surprised you that you know your your childhood or even being an adult around your family is affecting this relationship with Kara.

43
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.680
Ateeq: Um, well, as I was growing up, we were disciplined, you know her discipline was a little bit different from mine.

44
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:21.990
Ateeq: So it was we discussed a little bit before we had our daughter, you know, so she told me that I can, under any circumstances, what our daughter and I'm okay with that.

45
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. And tell me your history. So I get to know

46
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And how that affected you

47
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:38.280
Ateeq: Um, I just remember getting kid as a little kid, you know, I, I did get what I remember. Maybe, maybe I was three years old.

48
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:51.540
Ateeq: I remember that far back where I was running away from my dad and one of the situations I told care was that he had a full beer can. And he threw it and hit my back and it knocked air out of me.

49
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not common for people to remember that far back, but that's a significant event. So it's stuck with you.

50
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, in the air out of you and you fell

51
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.270
Ateeq: Yeah, I fell and hit the concrete.

52
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember anything else about that.

53
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.150
Ateeq: I just remember, I couldn't read

54
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.640
Ateeq: Yeah.

55
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.610
Ateeq: And it wasn't a regular I just remember it was a

56
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.350
Ateeq: 24 ounce can because it was a big. Can I have my back.

57
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.080
Ateeq: And it was pretty detailed for being really young, you know,

58
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a baby.

59
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you, what do you remember also. So those are as if watching a movie, you know, your can was this size or, you know, you felt an error, not wins knocked out of the hit the concrete. Do you know what emotion you had back then.

60
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.230
Ateeq: I was just scared. I didn't remember being scared.

61
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Scared and then

62
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Who helped who didn't help who comforted you who didn't come for you in your fear.

63
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.870
Ateeq: I just remember my mom being there.

64
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay Mom was there.

65
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:24.030
Ateeq: Yeah, I mean she wasn't outside this happened outside, but I just remember she came running from inside, outside and she grabbed me right away.

66
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.590
Ateeq: That's all I remember that moment.

67
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember being grabbed yeah

68
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it a welcoming feeling like I'm being

69
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:44.310
Ateeq: Oh no, she was panic cues and it too. I remember she was yelling and seeing. I don't know if he was yelling at me or my dad or what was going on.

70
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't know she was yelling at you scolding you

71
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.700
Ateeq: She wasn't scolding me she was just yelling and panic.

72
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.720
Ateeq: I think she was just more panicked about what had happened.

73
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:07.230
Ateeq: But I don't know if she was yelling at me to see if I was okay or yelling at my dad because he do that very Academy back

74
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.070
Ateeq: That part. I don't remember.

75
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever noticed that that memory is almost re experienced

76
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me when it comes up.

77
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.580
Ateeq: It comes

78
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.470
Ateeq: When I'm depressed.

79
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.980
Ateeq: If I feel depressed or something like that, it'll come up

80
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me take what you're sharing right now and I want to take this this memory and let's give it. Let's give it one of those numbers from zero to 100 how distressing. It is for you to even talk about it now how distressing. Is it for you.

81
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.950
Ateeq: Zero to me.

82
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.910
Ateeq: At first, what I talked to care about it. It was probably in the hundred

83
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:10.530
Ateeq: Range. But now that I've talked to her about in a meeting and I, we brought it up a couple times. It's when lower

84
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, just give it a number

85
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.630
Maybe 6060

86
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.040
Ateeq: Okay.

87
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:18.270
Ateeq: I'm

88
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna go 60 and this was age three. I'm

89
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Have something else in here at now. I wrote a question mark meeting, I have this this story snippet, but I don't have a subjective unit of distress, a number with it.

90
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was I was bullied by a group of people name calling rocks thrown at me, it came to the point when my mom and dad had to go to court.

91
00:08:47.610 --> 00:09:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: They got in trouble because I was missing school, but I never got from you what how distressing that was like right now, just as I brought that up how how distressing is that for you. Currently, even thinking about that memory from zero to 100

92
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.220
Ateeq: Probably like 30 okay now.

93
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I did have a number for that. I'm just going to move it.

94
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Down. Okay, so this one's higher so the

95
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually let's um let's take what client said and drop it verbatim into 60 said

96
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Including things like air knocked out.

97
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

98
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How so, okay, right, you said you said when you're depressed. You think of it.

99
00:09:48.810 --> 00:10:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's interesting that you do you describe that the depression happens and then you think about it, versus the other way around. So what you're aware of is depression happens first, and you start to think about your past. Yeah.

100
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, is are you in any depression. Currently, would you say

101
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:18.390
Ateeq: No, actually I feel pretty good. I've been feeling pretty good I you see it's weird because I get like that in the wintertime.

102
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I

103
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:19.980
Ateeq: You know I

104
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.150
Ateeq: Know that the winner is gone. Everything is not I haven't been depressed at all. I've been

105
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.660
Fine.

106
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't you share a little bit about how that history, your history impacts maybe what seems like it's going to be normal between you and your daughter and maybe how that might play out. Tell me, I need a little bit more about your

107
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.940
Ateeq: Thing.

108
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So my voice and more about you.

109
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.950
Ateeq: Well, let's see here. I just don't want her to really grow up the way I grew up.

110
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.290
Ateeq: You know, I feel like

111
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:07.320
Ateeq: As I was growing up those decisions. My dad would make because my mom was a stay at home mom for a long time, she did her best to get a job and start working too.

112
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.680
Ateeq: But most of the time she stayed at home and she raised us

113
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:20.850
Ateeq: Me and my sisters, but, um, I just remember as I was getting older, there was decisions. My dad was making, and I, I would tell them not to do that.

114
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:27.720
Ateeq: I remember I was 10 years old and I was saying not to do that. That's not a good decision. And it was just ignored. He did it anyway.

115
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:43.230
Ateeq: You know, and, and kept on and even when I became an adult, you know those still decisions being made and I would tell them, that's not a good decision. But he still did what he wanted to do and I was just try to help them out.

116
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's an interesting point can we stay there with that for just a moment. I'm going to check on something.

117
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: When you walk in the door and it's the end of your day from work and you see Kara.

118
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't smiling.

119
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And busy taking care of the baby or doing whatever but she's not looking at you and smiling at you.

120
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel

121
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.610
Ateeq: I feel irritated, like I did something

122
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:18.930
Okay.

123
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.590
Ateeq: All right, like I'm walking on eggshells

124
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.570
Ateeq: That I walk on. Okay.

125
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I did something finish that sentence like I did something

126
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.320
Ateeq: Like I did something wrong or I'm walking on eggshells

127
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrong. Yeah.

128
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever feel ignored.

129
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.840
Ateeq: And care. No.

130
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that same feeling that you had with Dad, it's different. It's not the same one. Okay, so that you do not feel ignored.

131
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you ever feel ignored.

132
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.000
Ateeq: Growing up, yes, I did feel ignored.

133
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:18.720
Ateeq: I felt like my dad. I was thought I was too little or too dumb to make decisions because he was older and he brought me into this role, not the other way around. So whatever had to say never really

134
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.660
Ateeq: Help out in any way.

135
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: too little or too dumb. Yeah, so now

136
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Again,

137
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It is common in our romantic relationships to have an unmet need, or a wound that happens and you had a few of them quite a few actually in childhood.

138
00:13:44.340 --> 00:14:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not uncommon for people to have that play out. They won't mean to, but they end up playing out in our romantic relationships because ultimately, we do want to heal. We're wired to heal. We, we want to feel better. We want to be happy and safe.

139
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just wonder if there's anything in common with when she's busy taking care of the baby and not smiling at you. I just wonder if there's anything that's similar between

140
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing her taking care and busy and to you feeling ignored when you were little. I wonder if there's anything in common.

141
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:36.270
Ateeq: Oh, it's that will use the she's asleep when I come home, you know, so I'll what I do is I come home. I know my stuff in the washer on quickly take a shower and then I go for the baby.

142
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:44.850
Ateeq: I take your the baby. As soon as I come home, even before us getting together. I have to be right now she's here. I better I changed her

143
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:51.270
Ateeq: So I do the baby taken care of and all that. As soon as I get home. So usually I feel like, you know,

144
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:58.260
Ateeq: Right now it's like nine o'clock in the morning and I feel like she wakes up at eight, and she takes her date for granted.

145
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:06.750
Ateeq: I mean, you know, I feel like there's people that can't even get out of bed or anything like that. And why is she getting up mad. So those are things that go through my mind.

146
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's useful. Thank you. So you think to yourself,

147
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You're taking your day for granted. Yeah, okay.

148
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And and there are people that can't even get out of bed. Yeah. And you can, but you're not you're choosing not to

149
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Do. Okay.

150
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been that person that was so depressed that you couldn't get out of bed.

151
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:51.180
Ateeq: I just remember when I was drawing I was really sick. And I got depression with that and it was maybe a couple weeks. I couldn't get out of bed until I started feeling better.

152
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's think about who you're thinking of

153
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: There are people who can't get out of bed. Who do you think we're talking about here.

154
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.010
Ateeq: People that I take care of that work.

155
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: At work okay so appreciate your youth, kind of like that. Yeah, and you're in your health. Appreciate it.

156
00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And now that makes perfect sense. And now let's just, they both can exist, what you just said. And this other piece which is, I wonder if because you guys aren't opposite schedules and she's primarily taking care of the baby. I'm wondering if I don't know. You'll have to tell me

157
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if

158
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This is this is normal for her.

159
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: As a new mom, I don't know. I mean, how I wonder if she's getting disrupted sleep. I'm wondering if this is the same thing someone who's not appreciated in their life, or is this someone who's just exhausted from having a newborn

160
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:57.570
Ateeq: Yeah, she's asleep. Today I didn't wake her up this morning because I wanted to do one on one with you.

161
00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

162
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:05.220
Ateeq: And I told her this fine. She wanted to join today but I told her, because last time we talked a little bit, we were going to do it then. So I told just sleep in today.

163
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:06.360
Smart

164
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't quite answer the question.

165
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.170
Ateeq: Oh well, I don't really know that

166
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:14.550
Ateeq: Her

167
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.120
Ateeq: Her her. I mean, she's talked to me a little bit about it. She'll tell me it's not you, it's just I wake up like that sometimes

168
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:29.610
Ateeq: She's told me, even when her sister used to wake her up. She would be mad like that, but she gets over it is just how she wakes up in the morning changed. Wake up, so

169
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now we're just talking about a number of our she's sleeping right now, just for a moment, we're just staying right there. So how many hours to she actually get. Have you asked her.

170
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.600
Know,

171
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe she's up and about when you are at work.

172
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:49.830
Yeah.

173
00:17:50.940 --> 00:18:00.960
Ateeq: She's told me she's you'll get a couple hours there her sleep is broken sleep. It's not straight. She'll get two hours here, three hours there ok now we're here. So,

174
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

175
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: On the front it looks like she's someone who doesn't appreciate right on the front on the surface. It looks like that. But when you investigate a little further. She's sleep deprived and she's taking those hours to catch up.

176
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but it can still feel like that like

177
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not appreciating

178
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What about this thing you said about

179
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I was treated as if I'm either too little or too dumb.

180
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't hear that phrase. Very often, tell me more about what that means. I was treated like that.

181
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:59.730
Ateeq: Well, that's how I felt when you know i'll try to say something to my dad or try to help them out in a way and that's what he would tell me you know you're too little or, you know, that's

182
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:08.730
Ateeq: He went home, you're too dumb, but he would say, you know, this is my business, not your business. I'm like, okay, but I'm your son. I'm just trying to help you, you know,

183
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

184
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to know.

185
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can share with me.

186
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Without waiting for me to ask

187
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm noticing that it's almost like you're waiting for me to ask a question.

188
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.500
Ateeq: Yes, it

189
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I want to know, you know, I want to know your history and you don't have to wait for me to ask a question, you can just share

190
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.100
Ateeq: I just don't know where to start, you know,

191
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The next thing that you think of

192
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.570
Ateeq: Maybe I guess we'll talk about, you know, when

193
00:19:52.620 --> 00:20:03.690
Ateeq: Back when I was in school when I'd get bullied by the kids that you know bullied me and I'd be out of school for long periods of time. Well, also, I was going through abuse at home with my dad.

194
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:12.510
Ateeq: So there was a little bit of that. And a little bit of that because I remember back when he did take me to school. My dad got in trouble for abuse.

195
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.130
Ateeq: So,

196
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:26.100
Ateeq: They were going to take him to court and my mom had to go to court with that and I had to go to court and they were asking us questions like, am I abused and stuff and i didn't i was little off like I'm I didn't even know what abused, Matt, I didn't know the

197
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.380
Ateeq: Right. Anything of that. So I said no.

198
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

199
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:39.930
Ateeq: You know, but the teachers would point out the bruises on me and stuff like that because i mean i got what with the belt and of Wire Hanger and things like that.

200
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:48.480
Ateeq: So, you know, like I didn't feel safe at home or I didn't feel safe in school when I was younger, you know,

201
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.190
Ateeq: But

202
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay there too.

203
00:20:52.740 --> 00:21:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. How did you cope. How did you survive neither feeling safe at school or at home with nowhere to go, well, how did you survive that because you did, you're here today. She did some things to survive. Do you know what you did.

204
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.010
Ateeq: Or just kind of a blank.

205
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, blank.

206
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so maybe forget

207
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's a, it's a technique we can minimize that one.

208
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to survive. I will remember all just

209
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:40.590
Ateeq: got older, I started looking to friends out in the neighborhood and stuff like that and

210
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.240
Ateeq: You know those my friends at that time they were out there doing bad. So I started going out there doing bad with them. But we thought it was fun.

211
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:59.460
Ateeq: So I looked at that as family at that time. Like they love me, they they're laughing with me. I'm having fun out here, even though I was doing something wrong. I thought it was fine. I didn't think it was bad at the time.

212
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so

213
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The need to be loved the need to feel welcome validated and to belong, especially as an adolescent

214
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right on time.

215
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Every out of us right in there starts to go. Dad, mom fit. Who cares what you think and the fairy preoccupied right with what their peer group. See how they view them. So what you what you did was right on time and on top of that.

216
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The importance of

217
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Those kids caring about you was even more important because you weren't getting it at home that long history of not feeling safe and finally you have a group of people, although you may not like what they're doing, at least they love you.

218
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And what age are we talking about right in here, right at this point when you started to hang out those kids.

219
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:14.370
Ateeq: I was 1314 up to my late teens. Yeah.

220
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And those kids were drinking were this petty theft.

221
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, analyzing things

222
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.210
Ateeq: Yeah, mainly card up

223
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.120
Ateeq: Yeah, okay.

224
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm assuming you didn't share that with anyone didn't share with family that was your

225
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that is the way you coped was

226
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll have fun. I'll feel cared for. That will be my second family over here.

227
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And when was the first time you got in arrested for some of those behaviors.

228
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.200
Ateeq: are in trouble. Well, I didn't really get arrested because I was under age.

229
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.710
Yeah.

230
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.860
Ateeq: Yeah, I got in trouble at 16

231
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.890
I was 16 years old.

232
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So there were at least three years where he kind of got away with it. Right. Nobody was

233
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying, stop. This is unhealthy for you and your parents didn't know

234
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's 16

235
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened.

236
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.970
Ateeq: Was when I got even worse. That's when the audit up became

237
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.850
Ateeq: Every weekend type of thing. It was something I was looking for to do every weekend.

238
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you end up getting arrested. Then at 16 someone catcher.

239
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Oh.

240
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.670
Ateeq: No, it wasn't until maybe I was 19

241
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And what happened.

242
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.830
Ateeq: That was a

243
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:09.150
Ateeq: What the drug charge that's when I got in trouble with marijuana liquor. I was driving under the influence. And I was drinking and driving

244
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's bring this history back up into the present.

245
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And like you to imagine it's your 13 year old daughter is in your life right her peers are going to be very important to her.

246
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably by about 10 or 11 they're going to be really important. Yeah.

247
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Um earlier.

248
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And that very thing that she she wants, which is acceptance. She wants to fit in, nothing wrong with it. It's right on time. We want to just, we don't want to stand out. We just want to be like everybody else.

249
00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how to teach her to both accept that that's a developmental milestone and to also teach her to hold on to herself, her truth, where you know how to teach for that.

250
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:20.010
Ateeq: I just like I tell her how to, I don't know if I can teach it to her. It's something that she's probably gonna have to experience but um

251
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:29.160
Ateeq: I just want to tell her that I'm her dad and I love her and I want to help her guide to make the right decisions.

252
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.740
Ateeq: Or group of peers.

253
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.290
Ateeq: seem like they're troublemakers and stuff. I wouldn't want anything else I would me as a

254
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.430
Ateeq: Parent is not to really be your friend. But the parents are

255
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:47.430
Ateeq: And if I feel like her friends are no good. I'm gonna do my best to keep them away from each other, even though it's important for

256
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Us is tricky.

257
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.690
Ateeq: I know, I know it is sounds tricky.

258
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.910
Ateeq: I'm probably gonna have care. I'll do it or

259
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.230
Ateeq: Talk to her and

260
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:04.410
Ateeq: Her way because I think she she could probably do a lot better than me with her. I'm not too sure yet.

261
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is more about what I just did was more about you than it was about this this imaginary 13 year old. So what I just did was, I'm trying to see if you can identify

262
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What it was that you actually need it at age 13 you need to do that 12 needed out of 11. What was the unmet need back then that you ended up finding it and those

263
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.340
Ateeq: Of us. I grew up with all sisters and I end to be my friends or

264
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.970
Ateeq: my cousins who had their brothers and stuff like that. I felt

265
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:48.930
Ateeq: Like all of them have got to play stuff together and I was kind of left out and all the girls hung out. So I was kind of a loner. I didn't want to do girl stuff or

266
00:27:49.470 --> 00:28:00.420
Ateeq: You know, I felt left out and I needed my dad back then, but he was too busy working or, you know, when he came home, he was always upset or something and it seemed like he took it out on me because I was only male and down.

267
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.940
Ateeq: So that's how I felt.

268
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I heard you say was, I needed a same

269
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say, same sex meaning same gender. I needed to do.

270
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Things that you enjoy you wanted to hang out and have someone that you didn't really didn't really like the stuff your sisters were doing.

271
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So now.

272
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you're picturing now go to the 13 year old daughter this imaginary it's gonna happen. She's gonna be 13 eventually okay now.

273
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You just said I cut her off from hanging out with her girlfriends, maybe, and the need is still there, though, to want to belong to one and do something. Notice that you found it in yourself. It's like, I want to do things that are like guys guys stuff.

274
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'll put aside the social norms of that because I'm not hung up on that. But for now, just to discuss it.

275
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you honor that in yourself and how do you honor that in this 13 year old girl to she's going to want to belong to. She's going to want to do

276
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:19.530
Ateeq: Things.

277
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe like her peers or we don't know what your peers are going to be

278
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what her interests are going to be. And I'm excited to find out. Yeah. Um, but

279
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That longing, she's going to have it to. How does she still get to express that in a safe way. Does she get to like what she likes like who she wants.

280
00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:46.200
Ateeq: I

281
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:49.320
Ateeq: Don't know.

282
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.880
Ateeq: I mean, she can tell me

283
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:58.470
Ateeq: I won't know what to do. But I would listen to what she has to say, you know, I felt like I was never listened to.

284
00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:01.290
Ateeq: Yeah.

285
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me if you can

286
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Would have been nice if someone in your life had done for you at that time.

287
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.470
Ateeq: Listen to me.

288
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the key. See, it's your unmet need was given for nice of my Dad could at least heard me out. I'm sick and tired of hang on my sister Stephanie says that I want to do these things.

289
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, teach me how to use the saw, teach me how to change the oil. I want to do. I want to go ride a TV. I'm not sure what your things are, but

290
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Spend time with me.

291
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And so your ability just now to to own that will give you my guess the confidence to be able to meet that 13 year old to be able to be present with your daughters need and not have to give it all away to Kara, you see.

292
00:30:59.520 --> 00:30:59.850
Yeah.

293
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've, you can sit with it yourself. It'll be easier for you to see it in your daughter.

294
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't ever just be one thing I'm just the parent. That's it. Again, to see those friends. Your friends suck. They're terrible influenced I'll sit down and shush.

295
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't be like that. Right.

296
00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Because remember that need you had

297
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she's gonna have something like that, too, and especially at 13 boy.

298
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong

299
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't make her bad

300
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:32.310
No.

301
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right on time and being able then the comforting you being able to share your own stories and saying, you know, sweetheart. I

302
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I struggle with both wanting to be your parent and protect you. That's not going anywhere. I know that's how I'm going to be as your dad.

303
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But at the same time I remember I really wanted to belong and I wanted to hang out with with people that I have the same I want to hang out doing fun things

304
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: How do we do this together. How do I both respect that you need to be able to freely hang out. But these kids.

305
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to get arrested. I don't want to expose to older kids that maybe you're drinking or drugging

306
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the job is to keep you safe. But at the same time, I want to listen to you.

307
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have to be more complicated than that.

308
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.160
Ateeq: No, no.

309
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, like you said, she'll tell you

310
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about right now. What's coming up for you.

311
00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.070
Ateeq: Well, I was thinking about a there was a time where I was.

312
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:49.650
Ateeq: Closer to maybe my late 19 and a half to Tony

313
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:50.880
Ateeq: And I just remember

314
00:32:52.170 --> 00:33:00.750
Ateeq: Around that time I had went to one of my friends is apartments and we were standing outside all of us. It was a big group guys older than me. But those guys.

315
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:08.790
Ateeq: There were two gang banging and stuff like that. And I remember every car that would pass by, they're grabbing Boulders from the form they were checking it out the car.

316
00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of

317
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:16.290
Ateeq: Ours came back. It made a U turn at the end of the stop and they came back and they started shooting at us. So

318
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.940
Ateeq: Then I just remember like

319
00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:31.320
Ateeq: Me running and hiding behind cars and jumping over walls and, you know, and after that, I was like, You know what, it's not the place for me and then maybe a couple weeks, months after that I met my first girlfriend and I moved from here.

320
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.710
Ateeq: I just didn't want to be there to where I just

321
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.460
Ateeq: That point, it just remember, like, this isn't for me.

322
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, was it that you could have died.

323
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.190
Yeah.

324
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And that guy hadn't really sunk in until that moment.

325
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.740
Ateeq: A moment. Yeah.

326
00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty common also developmentally right on time, because we think we're invincible.

327
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.480
Ateeq: Especially when you're a teenager. You think you're invincible.

328
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, and that is actually that's on time to develop mentally that's, you know, fun time.

329
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Well i a part of these glad that something got your attention and got you out of that because I don't know where you'd be right now. I don't know if you'd be in custody or shot or hurt.

330
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:21.750
Ateeq: You know,

331
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:22.800
I know

332
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your, what's your kind of end with this topic.

333
00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Your biggest concern about you as a father.

334
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:52.410
Ateeq: My concern is our health, you know. Yeah. Like I wouldn't want to get sick or come home and

335
00:34:52.950 --> 00:35:06.180
Ateeq: Or get sick with whatever's going on out there and I can be with them is my concern or dying at a young age to where she would have to grow up without me is the concern that I have been. I feel like

336
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.160
Ateeq: She's probably need me for the rest of her life, you know,

337
00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.480
Ateeq: That those are my concerns.

338
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you kind of need her for the rest of your life.

339
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.260
Ateeq: Yeah, of course I do. Yeah.

340
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I need her for the rest of my life. Yeah.

341
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.060
Okay.

342
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What steps are you taking to take care of your health. Are you in the solution or you just kind of keeping yourself worried about it and not really diving into the solution I

343
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.180
Ateeq: Haven't really because I still

344
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:48.420
Ateeq: I still smoke a lot. I still smoke a pack a day. I mean, I've cut down on the Swedes, I'm not really drinking isn't much

345
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.240
Ateeq: So cut that down.

346
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.960
Ateeq: But

347
00:35:52.590 --> 00:36:03.060
Ateeq: At the same time, to, you know, I know, put down you know on Suboxone and stuff, but I feel like because it's an opiate. It makes me want to smoke because I wasn't smoking.

348
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.940
Ateeq: like this before. I've ever done opiates.

349
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:10.380
Ateeq: So it's just one of those things they could kind of crosses paths with one another.

350
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting. So

351
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to, um,

352
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Address the smoking more directly in our work together. In other words, do you want to talk with the doctor about trying Wellbutrin. For example,

353
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To see if it helps the cravings, because it typically does. Yeah.

354
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

355
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

356
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to consider.

357
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.690
Ateeq: I consider talking

358
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.490
Ateeq: About it.

359
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, the other. So just to throw out a couple of things that I've watched really work.

360
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Couple of things.

361
00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting those cigarettes away, meaning and convenient.

362
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Leave them in your car or leave them in your trunk, because those few seconds I have to put my shoes on.

363
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get an hour out of I can wait 90 seconds. That's one. I can wait 90 seconds. Heck, I can do anything for 90 seconds. I can do this. And then I'll go work on my

364
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Car my mobile airplane. I'll go no scramble some eggs do something

365
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting those

366
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.540
Ateeq: Things, too, like I've been doing my hobby stuff and I started my RC helicopters.

367
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.280
Ateeq: Yeah.

368
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how many currently. So what we're adding is we're adding leaving

369
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The cigarettes somewhere inconvenient. Believe it or not, that amount of time that it takes because you're, you're going to immediately, you're going to have the thought to

370
00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It will happen, you'll just want to use it. Will you want to smoke but then you'll go where the heck are they. Oh, they're all the way outside. Look how many seconds, it takes

371
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Go put shoes.

372
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:08.790
Ateeq: Yeah.

373
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are my keys. Look, I'm looking now I'm looking for my keys and then I might think. What a stupid thing I'm doing right and what am I, I'm not going to smoke all do. I'll wait another 90 seconds but cookies down

374
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And then guess what another hour has passed, and that's one less cigarette. So believe it or not, this may seem over simplified, but what it can do is you can see the strength

375
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And having that inconvenience of reaching for it. You get to see in real time. You know what, I'll tell myself well, just wait another 90 seconds. Go BUSY YOURSELF. And then another hour will end up passing

376
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're going to consider if you want to talk with a doc about maybe maybe playing with another medication if you really do want

377
00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: To stop smoking, if that is a goal you have

378
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Because interestingly

379
00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The buprenorphine.

380
00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Tends to also what I'm hearing the doctor is bring down cravings. So craving in general. So it does surprise me a little bit. Yeah, it was a little surprised.

381
00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but

382
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But not for you. And so that's what we've got. It's not, that's not what it is for you.

383
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So how many cigarettes are you smoking. Currently, let's see if we can get that

384
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.250
Ateeq: baseline period I smoke a whole pack.

385
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so within 24 hours. Let's get that transcribed. Let's go within 24 hours. We've got a whole pack smoked and if we had a reasonable goal. What do you want to do over the next month, let's say,

386
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.490
Ateeq: Maybe bring it down by half.

387
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Off. Okay.

388
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So down. So maybe

389
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.240
Ateeq: Two days, I'd be happy with the outcome.

390
00:39:54.570 --> 00:40:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, why don't we start with that and just see where it goes. Now, um, what are two things that you can do differently of is coming month

391
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.240
Ateeq: Um,

392
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.750
Ateeq: Well, my secrets away from me.

393
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Where would they got a couple

394
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:21.570
Ateeq: Or. Great. What I can do is break the pack in half and a half in a pack and take and carry one pack with tap the pack with me all day.

395
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:23.040
Ateeq: And

396
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.360
Ateeq: You know, just make those dead last.

397
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And

398
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.270
Ateeq: They fill out the other half.

399
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.090
Ateeq: Like that.

400
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But where are they located where would they be located.

401
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:42.840
Ateeq: I have a box that I could put them in, or at least have them in the car.

402
00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about the time it takes to get to own that can make the difference because you're you're healthy thinking

403
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: will kick in.

404
00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be.

405
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: There for my daughter.

406
00:40:53.670 --> 00:41:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to have what happened to me. My parents were unavailable. And look what I ended up doing.

407
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we can take this negative history and we can leverage it to motivate. Okay, I don't want to do the same thing, but can use that sort of negative history, pull it up and say,

408
00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to do this, I can wait another 90 seconds. So let me leave it she's worth it. I'm worth it, she's worth it. I'm worth it and leave them in the car.

409
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell your wife to hide them.

410
00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Only give them to me when it's, you know, been an hour. I'm not saying to include her directly into that, but I'm trying to get you to brainstorm different ways to get distance from it. Okay.

411
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and waiting to 90 seconds. So let's schedule for now something about a month from now and then if you come back and you tell me

412
00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: To get to meet to

413
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.230
Ateeq: Find out good news. I'll come to group on Monday.

414
00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.090
Ateeq: Well, that's how you

415
00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Text me. I want to know.

416
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go over to June.

417
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear that later was

418
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: He so we're looking somewhere around maybe write a

419
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Go to

420
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: How about June 7

421
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:26.640
Ateeq: Seven.

422
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, June 16 because I want to try and keep it in a month. This is assuming that you're going to be budgeting. Okay, so I'm going at June 16 at 9am. Now it could be eight. Would you rather have it earlier if it's just going to

423
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.030
Ateeq: Go nine o'clock is fine.

424
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to catch your you're right you're done with your day and I didn't want to mess with your sleep.

425
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.160
Ateeq: Tonight.

426
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.420
Ateeq: For a while,

427
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we have June 16 9am

428
00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: As our next appointment. But if I hear from you that we can meet sooner. Let's we'll see if we can either do individual or couples. I still think I would like to spend a little bit more time with you individually.

429
00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can kind of do some some reprocessing about history.

430
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:12.750
Okay.

431
00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you have enough medication.

432
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.340
Ateeq: Yeah, because I got description yesterday.

433
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.010
Ateeq: Beautiful problem and wrote it for the month so

434
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. All right. My fingers are crossed. I sure hope the answer is yes.

435
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.020
Ateeq: Or no, I

436
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:41.310
Ateeq: Don't I don't remember her name from group yesterday she was telling me that about this three month extension.

437
00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: There was an Erica.

438
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: No, wait.

439
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see, what did she say

440
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:49.680
Ateeq: She was saying that

441
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: She has a kind of insurance. Who the heck was it. I mean, who is in that group.

442
00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.550
Ateeq: She's really nice.

443
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Erica J victorious or Nia Sean Elizabeth Brittany. Brittany Matt Erica.

444
00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe Erica.

445
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.910
Ateeq: I think it was the other one, Elizabeth.

446
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Elizabeth. She had her hair down that day.

447
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And Erica typically dark hair. She had it pulled back

448
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.160
Ateeq: Here because the one with the tattoos. Right.

449
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.430
Ateeq: Yes, it's not Erica. It was the windows.

450
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, yeah. And Sarah Nia

451
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Was the one talking about

452
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: She was fine. It doesn't matter. You liked it.

453
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

454
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so right using that as leverage and saying, hey,

455
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I know Medicaid is doing this for their participants. They're not sort of abandoning care for their right for their patients. And I'm just wondering if we could, if we could do this.

456
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

457
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Woody. What do you think, what's your best argument.

458
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:31.260
Ateeq: I'm just going to see if it's possible to get a three month extension. It was nice that the game you one month, but the lady I talked to last time was really nice. This person I might have to be might be a whole different

459
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:33.180
Ateeq: Same person.

460
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:40.680
Ateeq: So I'm going to see how this goes right now 1128 I'll find out

461
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, fingers crossed. I hope to see

462
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.380
Ateeq: You guys Monday and I'll text you to let you know.

463
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, sounds good. All right.

464
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.950
Ateeq: Thank you. Have a good day.
