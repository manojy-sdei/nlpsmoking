Ateeq Dean: This morning

25
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you just unload a little bit so that you can hear yourself kind of get it all off your chest, what's going on.

26
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:30.210
Ateeq Dean: Well, it's just a last night when I went in last night was payday. So then when I got my paycheck. I get it straight direct deposit. So I noticed on missing a $600

27
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot of money.

28
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.410
Ateeq Dean: Sure is. You know, so I don't know if the company I'm working for a silently shutting down without telling us what's going on.

29
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.120
You know,

30
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:53.100
Ateeq Dean: I don't really know what's going on. But yeah, it says, I called her and told her. Okay. Who are we both been stressed out with all that, you know, I'm the only one that's working.

31
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So you called who

32
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.240
Ateeq Dean: Called me sweetheart in Boulder.

33
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But what about your employer.

34
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.060
Ateeq Dean: Human Resources gets there at eight o'clock. Well, they're just there to all go once we're done here. I'm going to go over there and find out.

35
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so antique

36
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be okay.

37
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You if this one falls apart. They'll you're, you're really good employee incredibly hardworking intelligent, you've got this charming personality. It's you're going to be okay. I know it seems scary.

38
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.910
Ateeq Dean: When I come home and then, you know, it's just she's stressed out. And then, oh I just feel like I don't want to be here either. You know, okay.

39
00:04:42.420 --> 00:05:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's easy to forget right the sweet things the good things when all we're feeling is pressure as if I might lose this job, or I don't have enough money or now I have to confront someone, and now I'm being criticized or something. It can feel pretty overwhelming.

40
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn some light on, just so that there's you're completely black right now because the window behind me, that's why. Yeah, we'll get a light in front of you on thinking, then we should be good to go.

41
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.020
Ateeq Dean: Little bit better

42
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, totally.

43
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's hear it. What is it, what is it,

45
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.690

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Tara yeah okay so you come home, you're already like 600

48
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right on top. Yeah. So here's the thing, right. You've got to be able to say it, name it out loud. Together we haven't slept. We're going to be snippy short tempered and get pissed off at each other really easily.

49
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to tiptoe around, let's not take anything personally

50
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This is no time to be right, talking about big plans. This is just

51
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Content content. Content. Can you get a bottle. Can you help me with this. Can you do this the answer. Yes. Now we don't talk about big stories from the past, we just kind of address things that are right in front of us.

52
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

53
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but if one of you forgets that and takes it personally.

54
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So is that what's happening. This morning where you guys in a row.

55
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.620
Ateeq Dean: Is to make sure the attitude this morning. So it's, I'm already pissed off.

56
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.980
So,

57
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.540
Ateeq Dean: I'm sure she's up. She's in the room over there.

58
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to do a little, a little

59
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: A little conversation together to feel better this morning.

60
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.590
Ateeq Dean: I don't know. She's over there feeding the baby.

61
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.930
Ateeq Dean: Okay, yeah.

62
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it would feel good to her and for your relationship to invite she can say yes, that's her choice. You decide.

63
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:37.800
Ateeq Dean: I just know like she didn't really sleep well she barely fell asleep for like three or four this morning. So the baby was crying. So she woke up to Peter

64
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

65
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.590
Ateeq Dean: I just think she just really tired right now. Okay.

66
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But sometimes we like to be invited. So that's like completely up to you know, Tara better than I do because I I don't

67
00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it sounds like you've made up your mind that you're going to not ask and assume that she would prefer to not talk. Okay, okay. I gotcha.

68
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

69
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You got a plan together for

70
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: How to address the $600

71
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Besides that, right, that just happened today. Yeah.

72
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Walk me through LAST WEEKEND. WHAT WAS THE WEEKEND like

73
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:40.440
Ateeq Dean: A I've worked last Friday ended up going in. I'm usually on Friday and Saturday. Uh huh. The last week rules are bad, but I picked up my Friday. So I was really off one day.

74
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:50.340
Ateeq Dean: So that one day I was all Taya I went to my parents house. We went to the store we cut here at home. We weren't good, we're good. We made a

75
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.490
Ateeq Dean: Mashed potatoes. We made a

76
00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.020
Ateeq Dean: macaroni and cheese and we made BBQ ribs. It was good. We got to go.

77
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm noticing that you and I haven't done some of the sort of psycho therapeutic techniques for whatever reason, baby. I'm in withdrawal on talking with Tara. So let's do today and actually do some of the sort of

78
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapeutic techniques that maybe you've missed out on. Okay, so let's do

79
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk a little bit about a little preparation first and resourcing

80
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I think in group, you may, you may have developed the

81
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Most

82
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The container.

83
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Amazon dropping something off.

84
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.000
Oh,

85
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The. Can you remember the container that you may have developed. Okay, we'll do it. It takes just a second.

86
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.340
So,

87
00:09:51.600 --> 00:10:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think of any. It can be a container and here are the constraints of it, the container is for your emotional stuff. So it has to be big enough.

88
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong enough to hold all your stuff. Okay, can be as big or small made of whatever you want. So, kind of, what were some visualizations. You had a container for sort of that.

89
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Stuff that maybe you want to compartmentalize and maybe you don't want to address it right away, but we'll pick it up, you and I, safely together at another time. Okay, what comes up for you and your imagination.

90
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.150
Ateeq Dean: Does a lot of stuff that I do.

91
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me tell you what a container is yeah that'd be the stuff that we go in it. So I'll give you an example of a container.

92
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: One person did a jar. One person has done a train car, one person did a garbage can. One posted a wood box that was painted red with a lock on it. One person put us did a safe. So no or a story.

93
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Really puts up. So right now what I'm asking you to do is work the right side of your brain, which is your imagination.

94
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great. You're doing great. It's going to you're going to visualize a container.

95
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be any size any shape but but the requirements of it are no deceit, you said, yeah, all that stress that's going on. We would basically be psychically putting it in there. But first we need to design the box in your mind.

96
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So think about how big it would be, what is it, what's it made of

97
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.780
Ateeq Dean: I kind of had something similar to that that I've been kind of doing

98
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What, what was it,

99
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.860
Ateeq Dean: Oh, you remember I told you a while back, because I was going to the casino for a while there.

100
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.420
Ateeq Dean: And

101
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.260
Ateeq Dean: What I did was I just told myself that I was going to bury stuff like that so

102
00:11:53.280 --> 00:12:08.310
Ateeq Dean: In my mind I mentally vision myself digging a hole. Okay, very good. All that money inside the dirt. So my mind. So it grows into like a little tree destroys uprooting itself.

103
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.250
Ateeq Dean: And so that's

104
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.920
The mind.

105
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me that last part one more time.

106
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.110
Ateeq Dean: The last part two, where I buried the money the ground.

107
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:31.320
Ateeq Dean: Where it grows up to a little plant and starts going into a tree grows into a tree.

108
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's nice. So you take money that you don't gamble, but instead you bury it.

109
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:46.650
Ateeq Dean: No, no, that I lost gambling. So I mentally told myself, I'm going to take that loss and just bury it.

110
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the last gets buried. Okay, so I see it now. So let's do this. Um, I like it. I do, I do.

111
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it for that. This one's going to be stress at work stress with Tara recovery that you and I will put away because we're putting it away temporarily

112
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we ran out of time together and we couldn't finish a technique. And so we might bring it out again and safely.

113
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. He did it beautifully. That's a great I want to really want to sort of dive into that one later time.

114
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to picture a container that has a lead maybe that we can put stuff in and take back out, it will have a lock either combination key fingerprint lock. Use your imagination. What's something that you come up with

115
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.250
I love

116
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:40.710
Ateeq Dean: To

117
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it again.

118
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, file cabinet. Yeah, like it.

119
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And how is it locked

120
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:58.410
Ateeq Dean: It's got hand my hand on it and say, okay,

121
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.020
Ateeq Dean: Good. I

122
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:03.660
Ateeq Dean: Don't like that.

123
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and only you have the code. Okay. For some people they give me the code to but you decide that. But for now, you have just become okay finger finger thumbprint code beautiful file cabinet and another one is going to be a distancing metaphor. So let me go over an example of that.

124
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So a distancing metaphor would be same kind of thing. Let's say we were doing an activity together and you are getting very distressed. You were pulling up a memory and you're working awareness in your consciousness. I asked you to pull it up.

125
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst Picture, let's say, and you were holding it there and it was your body was starting to respond to your heart was racing your breath got shallow, you're like, Whoa, I'm just like, kind of freaking out here. So then I might say, let's take that thought and that memory.

126
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's put it on it.

127
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And use a distancing metaphor. And this is what you're going to use again imagination. I'm going to give you some examples, but you come up with your own

128
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So I invite you to close your eyes and really try not to just take my examples, unless you fall in love with one of them. You're more than welcome to one.

129
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But see, if you come up with your own so distancing metaphor. Let's say it is I'm on the shore of the river bank and I'm with my T rex

130
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: As a protective figure and I have my mom who's nurturing and I have my dad, who's wise and what I see passing down the river getting further and further away on a leaf is

131
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: fear, uncertainty.

132
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Unwanted

133
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I might see in a helium balloon floating further and further away into the atmosphere.

134
00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncertainty the unknown. And now I can't see it anymore. I might on a train car load everything right on. I just need some distance from this and I see it moving.

135
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I can't hear the train anymore, and it's now moved down the train tracks further and further away and then gone

136
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I might see a car passed by my left opposing lane and in my rearview mirror. I recognize that was my fear that was my uncertainty and now I look in the rearview mirror and I can't see it anymore. A distancing metaphor.

137
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Find your own a tea, what comes up for you. What's a metaphor that's personal for you. That seems like, ooh, I'm gonna like this one.

138
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.180
Ateeq Dean: Distancing metaphor.

139
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I just gave you some examples to do right

140
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.760
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, mine could be

141
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.960
Ateeq Dean: Like a comment. I will see in this slide.

142
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice a comment.

143
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So, see if this works for you.

144
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you going to get. So some people what they do is that they do a rocket ship.

145
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And it gets away fast. I noticed that your, your comment is moving extremely fast right

146
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But the thing, the mechanism that you have is, and you kind of did it within the earth to there's no container.

147
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way to get it on there. I don't know how to get it on there. So that's not true. It's kind of like the leaf your own planet. I think I got it now. So you're on the planet. And on that comment is the distress. Right. It's just going further like really fast away.

148
00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I got it.

149
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: The comment passing by it.

150
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it. I just needed to think about that a little bit longer comet speeding body.

151
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Past. Right. Okay. I like it.

152
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So it'll disappear quickly.

153
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

154
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's do. Are you talking right now using a phone or iPad.

155
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.590
Ateeq Dean: It's a laptop. Oh.

156
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. Nope. Perfect, perfect, perfect. So want to do

157
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: A technique with you today. That is, I may get to it depends on how far we get if I can get some target mapping done with you but

158
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking I might do some MTR with you just to get a sense of your comfort level with it.

159
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What end Arias, and I talked to you about it.

160
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so am dr is

161
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It has the word I movement in it, but it doesn't require the bilateral stimulation of it movement, you will be today.

162
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I also if you were here in person, you would have little paddles and your hand and each one would be vibrating.

163
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You might also have on over your ears headphones, where there's a sound in each year. The key mechanism of impact and influence has to do with bilateral left right

164
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Hemispheres being activated. So what we can do in here because we've only got visual right I wasn't able to do the audio. I tried it didn't work is

165
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A blue light, that I'll share with you.

166
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll do a quick test run a bit just to make sure

167
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I because I'm going to share it with you. But first, I want you to watch my eyes.

168
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:00.330
Oh,

169
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is what not to do. Notice how they're strained and they're pulling all the way over. That's too far. I would want to sit back, step back, I only want to do it like you want your eyes to look like this.

170
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See how they're moving left and right, but they're not like this. See how strange that's too hard. You want to sit back

171
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now look at left and right of the furthest corners of your nope for equate

172
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: For this corners of your laptop.

173
00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Just left, right, left, right, just at the top there. That's about as much as we want your eyes. Now that doesn't strain on does it

174
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. That's what we want. Okay, so I'm going to show a light to this and we're not starting activity. This is me doing preparation, just to make sure every part of the

175
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This is working. Oops, I guess I don't haven't shared yet. My bad.

176
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I want you to do is I'm going to try to watch your eyes just to see if they're moving left to right. So you want don't want to move your head, you just want to have the eyes land left and land right it's nice and slow right now. Sometimes it will be faster.

177
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:25.920
Ateeq Dean: So,

178
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel your eyes moving left and right. Correct.

179
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's great might have you move closer. When we do the activity that's just fine.

180
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, sometimes it will be faster. Um, that's during the desensitization phase. So, this particular technique does

181
00:21:52.560 --> 00:22:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of theories on what's actually the mechanism of change. The one I like the best. The one I think is actually happening is it's a combination of

182
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: A distraction. That's what this light is doing and cognitive behavioral piece where you're going to hold a negative self appraisal.

183
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe online worthy and you might pull up an incident from childhood. My mother kept telling me you're an idiot. Right. And I can see her ugly angry face so you hold that hold this and we might do a really fast.

184
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Bilateral stimulation and that would be to desensitize so there's a couple of things that are happening. One is in desensitization to that memory fragment that needs

185
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: More consolidation and re learning and re imprinting. There's also embedding positive imagery. So remember those those images of protective got T rex and we've got nurturing and we've got wise.

186
00:22:53.910 --> 00:23:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to interweave positive stuff into otherwise negative networks. So it does a lot for people that have experienced trauma. It's the go to intervention for that. But it also can help with compulsive behaviors, right, because you've got some compulsive behaviors, maybe not sure

187
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The gambling has been a problem for you. And it's also can be useful about anxiety about the future, there can be triggers currently that come up

188
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Even in and of itself just embedding right installing those positive images more and more and more so that you can get to them faster, all the better. So it can be effective in that way.

189
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So sorry my ears are really bad today.

190
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what we're up to. I have your curiosity.

191
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.530
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, okay.

192
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So first I want to do a little bit you know how earlier.

193
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I started developing a subjective unit of distress, like I was plugging in a couple of things. We had the 50% from zero to 100 and I was like you said about a year ago, driving to work and the tires were getting balled, it was pouring

194
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: car in front of me slammed on its brakes and I rear ended it. Right. You remember that as far as a distress level that was about a 50 from zero to 101 hundred was something like slamming hard and flying through the window. That was an actual car accident. Right.

195
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to think about an inner personal stressor. She to think about maybe one of the more difficult ones.

196
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.480
Ateeq Dean: Ones.

197
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can sometimes they're around the people were with sometimes they're around our family of origin, oftentimes, you have a pretty tumultuous time

198
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have. That's what's neat about this particular intervention. If you don't want to tell me you don't have to. But if you want to I can make some notes and then I can bring us back to it.

199
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: If we don't finish it today. So just now when I said inner personal and really distressing didn't you come up with a little story in your

200
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:24.240
Ateeq Dean: There was something tapped me last week, but there's also something that happened to me a few years back.

201
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me the last week one, I will take it from there.

202
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.660
Ateeq Dean: I went to the small shop to buy a pack of cigarettes.

203
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:41.190
Ateeq Dean: And I was standing behind this guy in line, looking around the shop and stuff and ultimately the town like this, a hammer fell out of his pocket.

204
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:52.410
Ateeq Dean: And when I looked good, they hit the for our sound like a like a hammer, but then when I looked in to the hit the floor. It was a gun and it was putting right in my face.

205
00:25:53.580 --> 00:26:04.680
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, I don't know if it was loaded to save people's on but it doesn't get my head blown off that day and I kind of went to work like thinking, Wow, I didn't even I thought it through. I don't know.

206
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you know if

207
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.260
Ateeq Dean: You die, you would

208
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.070
Ateeq Dean: You know, sounds like in my life that I die in my

209
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Gosh, like that. It was completed in for a couple hours. Oh lasted a couple hours at work. Okay.

210
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.790
Don't

211
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.330
Ateeq Dean: Mind is pretty high. Two Worlds feeling nauseated.

212
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: My goodness. Okay. Somatic we've got nauseated.

213
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Any other physiological response.

214
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.540
Ateeq Dean: I got stressed out like depressed.

215
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.560
Okay.

216
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were depressed during work those first couple hours.

217
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.180
Ateeq Dean: I think from the stress.

218
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:06.360
Ateeq Dean: Is kind of one of those moments where I felt like, um, I could have just lost my life.

219
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like that.

220
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And

221
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard to get to. So just take your time. Okay, just free associate and share what comes up. I felt like I could have lost just lost my life.

222
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what is the belief about yourself. At that time I am what it's hard to get to go nice and slow.

223
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.370
Ateeq Dean: Hey, I'm alive.

224
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a

225
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. And is that a positive

226
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Cognition is not a positive one. I'm alive. Is that a positive one.

227
00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So now go back to, now you're going to work, feeling nauseous right and depressed. What was the belief about yourself.

228
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.610
Ateeq Dean: Um,

229
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:18.810
Ateeq Dean: The reason we're depressed me as if I would have got shot or if I would have died my daughter would have to grow up without me being a part of her life.

230
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.790
Depressed me

231
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So an incident happened a near miss, right, almost a fatal near miss happened and it stayed with you you projected into the future. The event was over.

232
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But the register of danger and perceived threat continued

233
00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is. Yeah. And about how from zero to 100. What does stress level was that event.

234
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That was 100. Okay, yeah. Gotcha. Okay.

235
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go back to one more time. You're doing great. These are hard to get to. All right, just give yourself permission. Close your eyes. If you can just see, you're not distracted by some of the things, but how I'm saying okay these are hard to find.

236
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Get into the the cognition of if I had gotten shot my daughter would have to grow up without me.

237
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your belief about yourself when you were having that kind of thinking

238
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:47.850
Ateeq Dean: Um, I went through my dad got really sick teenagers. So it felt like I

239
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:54.510
Ateeq Dean: Didn't have my dad during that time. And it just felt like I really needed him to be there for me.

240
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.980
Ateeq Dean: So I just don't want to do that to my daughter or however go through

241
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So see if you can finish the sentence. Close your eyes are almost there be not be there. I needed my dad, my sick, just stay there. I needed my dad. My dad was sick when I need to come

242
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I needed down. Yeah, I am. What

243
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.590
Ateeq Dean: I am

244
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.740
Ateeq Dean: Here that I was gonna die.

245
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm scared.

246
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:38.550
Ateeq Dean: THAT I WAS GONNA DIE, DIE, DIE. Yeah, and I will die. Okay.

247
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't, did you know yeah

248
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.330
Okay.

249
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

250
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I do see some connection to this other stuff in history. My guess is you may find your way working through it through this particular technique.

251
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Because notice how you went there on your own. Just now you went from a current event you even reached that history of my dad wasn't there. That's what this activity does

252
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is what it'll look like when we do this, em, Dr. Together, it'll. So this is kind of how it'll look, I'll say this, I'll say, Hold that. Worst Picture don't do it now.

253
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, don't do it right now. I'm giving you an example so that you know what we're about to do.

254
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull up the worst picture of said event, the worst image of it right you pull it out in the memory bank out of the hippocampus where once it wasn't there earlier, you're thinking about Tara before and $600 now.

255
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And then so this isn't it if we were doing desensitisation, it would be that worst image that negative cognition.

256
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it'd be pretty rapid

257
00:31:54.300 --> 00:32:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Bilateral stimulation. And over time, a couple of inner iterations. The

258
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Distress level should go down. I also tend to interweave positive conditions with them so that people can have that distress level go down even faster.

259
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What it looks like is this right after I say hold it here. I do this iteration back and forth. Then I say, inhale through the nose and exhale. And I say, what's coming up for you.

260
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's where you go in and you catch a thought an emotion, a somatic response or write a belief and you share it quickly. It's not a long time process. And I say,

261
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Go with that I do this again. Inhale. Exhale, what's coming up for you. Oh, now I'm thinking about this, go with that. It's not talk, you and I are not going to process each time.

262
00:32:52.200 --> 00:33:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to say something. Instead, like, go with that. And then I'll do another iteration. Does that make sense, it's really different than back and forth and back and forth. This is letting your actual brain do the healing on its own is really an, an a, an amazing experience for people

263
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

264
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever comes up boutique

265
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what I want to hear about, oh, I just, I'm right now I'm thinking about so and so I want to hear that I may decide okay go without or I might integrate some positive cognition, I'll say, now I want you to think about this and this and then we would do that aeration.

266
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Your job is to understand there's no way for you to do this wrong. There's no way. Okay.

267
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:44.010
Ateeq Dean: Okay.

268
00:33:44.520 --> 00:34:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't do it wrong. So you can just exhale and let go the expectation that you're going to do it wrong all the pressure is on me. Okay, you, you, all you have to do, right. The job is self acceptance and paying attention to what comes up.

269
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I just had this image. I'm going to want to hear that. So that I can see what next to do

270
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Who I just got a tight gut, who I feel nauseous. Again, I'm going to want to hear it. And you can eat while I'm doing the iteration. If it gets so distressing want you to know. You can do this and we can just stop.

271
00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Literally after two seconds or one just stop.

272
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want more because you really like oh my gosh, I never thought about that because unconscious memory might start to come up in order to reprocess it. That's what this technique is doing, you might do this, like, oh, keep going.

273
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people don't do that. They're like,

274
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: They're like, No, no, that's enough. Trust me. They only last between depending on on what I see. They only last about 20 to 50 seconds.

275
00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:58.830
Oh,

276
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And then I

277
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Breeze. And I say,

278
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you and you tell me, and I say go with that. And then we look again fried.

279
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on for you. You tell me. Go with that and we do it again. Okay. Okay, so first I want to install so that you're feeling grounded and good

280
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to spend a little bit of time installing and really immersing yourself in the positive imagery of

281
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: T rex. So first, close your eyes.

282
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:49.050
Gwenevere Abriel: He wants you to picture that T rex dinosaur during childhood pictures of different shades of green and brown.

283
00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And his head and what his skin was and maybe even imagining what it would be like to, to feel him and he's protective nature.

284
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And if more comes up for you around a protective figure, you're welcome to add to it. I can always take a note on it because it's right here. I can add to it as something else comes up.

285
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And once you get solid in there. I want you to then

286
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture the nurturing quality of your mom.

287
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: She gave you unconditional love, no matter what, no matter how many times you weren't able to do something, just the way you wanted to there. She was loving you unconditionally.

288
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's wanting your development and your growth.

289
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And add to this space. Don't forget about T rex they're interacting with mom trying to figure kind of how they're interacting picture.

290
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And then bring in dad.

291
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds around you. Just notice them and let them go. Okay, come back to the imagery that's the way life is.

292
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to picture kids wanting you to do things the right way.

293
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, not having to do it the hard way he wanted that for you.

294
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: The wisdom right that's he's a wise figure

295
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And mom's unconditional love and the protective quality of T rex pictures and all interacting all around you within you somehow very much immersed saturating you

296
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of Nod your head when you're really in that visualization

297
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want you to open your eyes. And I'm going to kind of slow this one down.

298
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Think it's slow already

299
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to want you to hold that imagery of those

300
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: T rex Mom and Dad All together, you have them in your mind.

301
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, left and right. Keep your head still

302
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Continue to hold them in your awareness.

303
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective quality.

304
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing

305
00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And wisdom all

306
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: As a team for you.

307
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: To pay attention to your body.

308
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: In with your gut is your chest.

309
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: With your mind.

310
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Your arms.

311
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your feet.

312
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: All of you, your legs.

313
00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale. Nice. Inhale, all the way to the bottom of the launch nice belly breath. Inhale, and then exhale, it all out of your mouth.

314
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it all go

315
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me how you doing,

316
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

317
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:17.520
Ateeq Dean: Doing pretty good.

318
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Does it seem like you had a nice solid visualization of your, your team.

319
00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, excellent. And what does stress level are you out right now 02

320
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It went down. What number are you at now.

321
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.740
Ateeq Dean: Oh, well, when I started with you is pretty high. Like, and at night.

322
00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what's it now.

323
00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.060
Ateeq Dean: Well maybe down to 40

324
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:43.620
Right.

325
00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So 40 is a good place to actually be working at so that we're working with something actually meaningful.

326
00:40:53.640 --> 00:41:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can have a desensitization to it. So a take you're more than welcome without guidance to bring in that team when you want it. You can have it there all the time.

327
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'll invite for this first iteration is the desensitization part. Okay. You can decide to pull up that worst image from from childhood that piece I needed my dad wasn't there when I needed him that image you can see it right right there that picture. Yeah.

328
00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I needed him.

329
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I got to see what your what was, let's see what the negative cognition was around that. What was your belief about yourself at that time.

330
00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:47.070
Ateeq Dean: Well, I looked at my dad like a superhero at the time.

331
00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:58.890
Ateeq Dean: And I never thought anything could happen to my dad, but then when I saw him getting old and stuff. I didn't understand what was going on because my dad was always really sharp and really smart and

332
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:00.720
Ateeq Dean: He

333
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:07.170
Ateeq Dean: He just knew how to run things in the house. You know, we didn't really

334
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't understand.

335
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it right. He's my hero. He's not acting like my hero. I don't understand was that the predominant one. I'm confused. I was confused. Okay. The real I am confused. That's it. So then when I say the negative cognition, it's going to be. I am confused.

336
00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever comes up for you. So hold that piece. You haven't told me even much of the imagery with that but you have it in your memory. Pull it up. The Worst Picture with him. This is a desensitization.

337
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The lights going to go faster. So you're going to hold these two things at the same time picturing him the worst piece and I'm confused.

338
00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.010
Oh, you're not looking at it. Are you

339
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

340
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: On a good that does you

341
00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of clicking. I have to do.

342
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:07.620
Ateeq Dean: Oh really. Oh.

343
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: To get this screen share. Okay, here we go. I'm just playing with. Yes. Okay. There we go. Here we go. Okay, so I'm going to invite. And again, it's, it's easy to want to get out of that negative stuff isn't it so pull up that worst image to take the picture. The Worst Picture in that event.

344
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm confused.

345
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Nose.

346
00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale out all go

347
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just gently check in and see what's coming up for you.

348
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing

349
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm confused. Okay.

350
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling confused right now.

351
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.040
Okay.

352
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:40.740
Ateeq Dean: I feel relaxed.

353
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, the feeling is relaxed.

354
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you able to hold that that image that picture. Yeah. Okay. And I'm confused now.

355
00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, your body's relaxed. Is that right,

356
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything still in distress, though, is that a distressing thought, emotion or anything. Still in distress.

357
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but you're still in I'm confused. Right.

358
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm confused.

359
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this. Let's do one more piece here.

360
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember back to that image.

361
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Dad was my hero. He sick. I'm confused. What did you want to be thinking, believing about yourself not I'm confused. But the positive thought, what would have been nice if you had a positive thought about yourself back then, what would the positive thought have been

362
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to get to huh

363
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:26.220
Ateeq Dean: Yeah, it's hard to get to, because it was so traumatic like I was traumatized from what had happened at that time. So I don't know, you know,

364
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.280
Ateeq Dean: That I would

365
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.650
Ateeq Dean: It was a saying like

366
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:40.590
Ateeq Dean: I be wearing shoes. So I would take over. If something was to happen to him.

367
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.550
Ateeq Dean: I would have had to take over to pay the bills and stuff and

368
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to that too cold, that one go with that pull up the worst image. I'll have to take over.

369
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You still sharing hold go with that. Open your eyes.

370
00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: first picture.

371
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to take over.

372
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: inhale through the nose.

373
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, all the air out all in it. Let it all go

374
00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me thoughts and beliefs.

375
00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Body responses and emotions, what's coming up for you.

376
00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to edit it. I want to hear what you're thinking what's going on.

377
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.090
Nothing.

378
00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, there is there is but you're editing because it could be anything, a tweak anything

379
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your truth. Just now when I checked in with you. It literally could have been. I was focused on a feeling of the fan on my neck. I still want to know. I can hear my kids little sound.

380
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but what came up for you. Oh, my mind was so distracted. I'm so confused. Now, I don't even know what I'm doing. That's the truth. I take, I want to know what's coming up for you. You don't edit. I want to hear.

381
00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.270
Ateeq Dean: It gets stuck. Sometimes

382
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I get stuck. Yeah. So when this last iteration, when we have the light going

383
00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you feel stuck.

384
00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.080
Ateeq Dean: After

385
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: After he felt stuck. Okay.

386
00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

387
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to kind of do a little bit of containment because we're kind of near the end. So let's remember I was telling you there won't be time because we did a little tiny piece will be able to do this on nice and slow.

388
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: In the future.

389
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But this was kind of jammed in right near the end, just so you can get some idea of what this is.

390
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take, take, what is left stuck confused.

391
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's put it in the container.

392
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Use the thumb and lock it up. Can you picture, putting it in there in the file cabinet closing it push up close and it's locked. You and I can pick up

393
00:49:53.490 --> 00:50:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Concepts of feeling, you know, right, I get stuck. I'll have to take over. I'm confused. We can pick those concepts up at another time. You don't have to be putting work at analyzing them, you and I can do that together. Okay.

394
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's end today by revisiting

396
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Just picture your happy place place that you've either been to, or in your imagination.

397
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want you to see the team of yours join you there.

399
00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And breathe deeply into that makes that connection between the mind right in your imagination this imagery and make it also congruent with the safety recognition deep in the bottom of your long

400
00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's nice and connected. Okay. The mind is saying, I'm safe. I'm having a safe thought safe and let your body. No.

403
00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to the muscles of your face this morning.

404
00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: As it communicates to the outside world sometimes how we're feeling internally.

405
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let that can grow and see wash over your face as well the muscles of the temple.

406
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The forehead.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you go do that you're in problem solving mode, just that stuff fits in the container. You don't have to analyze it, we can pick it up again next time we meet and

412
00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule that now because these will get booked up and I won't have anything for you.

Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you have. Remember, you have the buds in your ears right so I can hear ambient sound. So, whatever. Anyway, I appreciate it. Thank you.

446
00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:21.150
Shaun w: You're welcome. Just sort of

447
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's hard sometimes to hear you guys, I need to be able to hear every little bit. Um, alright, so we've got

448
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Did our first end. Are we did just a little bit of it last time.

449
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:37.980
Shaun w: You grab the bottles off.

450
00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Just in case. Yeah.

451
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:41.700
Yeah.

452
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So what were your possible continued observations after group.

453
00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe something that you noticed about

454
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Those concepts that we, you know, those one through 40 maybe let's continue kind of processing a little bit with that. What else did you notice from that activity.

455
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.130
Shaun w: Now just nine and 10 I put us on

456
00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the ones that you notice you're still engaging and right

457
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:47.730
Yeah.

458
00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And what did you think of the list overall

459
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:56.910
Shaun w: What I think of it.

460
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:07.620
Shaun w: I don't know. I don't do a lot of those things, I guess, I guess I'm more straightforward. Well, I think I just that i again i guess you

461
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.600
Shaun w: I guess you don't tell the whole truth, I guess.

462
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't tell the whole truth, what, what does that mean

463
00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:18.000
Shaun w: Like, like with all my feelings.

464
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you don't tell the whole truth about your feelings so nine nine is act compliant when you don't want to. Oh, yeah. Okay, so that can show up here and treatment too. Right.

465
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:29.610
Shaun w: Yeah.

466
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be doing this stuff. I do it because I feel I have to is that the overarching thought

467
00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:38.820
Shaun w: Yeah, oh man. Okay.

468
00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then 10 is I lie about how I feel.

469
00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now besides in here. Where else does that show up where you find yourself doing

470
00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:56.970
Shaun w: I don't, I don't really talk to me. People slow. Yeah, I mean I just do myself. I work

471
00:58:58.590 --> 00:58:59.130
Yeah.

472
00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And would you say that comes from that baseline this trust of other. Do you think it starts there.

473
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.260
Shaun w: Why does. Yeah, yeah.

474
00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that makes sense. So what you were saying is also

475
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't see that you've ever played the victim, even in active addiction. You don't think you were doing that.

476
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:25.530
Shaun w: playing the victim. No, I'm not playing the victim. I was a victim.

477
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right.

478
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You've never done this one.

479
00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:45.780
Shaun w: Number 25 passive aggressive know

480
00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.180
Shaun w: Letting go

481
00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:53.970
Shaun w: Letting people walk all over you. No, no, no, I don't do that.

482
00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me define what passive aggressive is letting things go is the

483
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:59.460
Shaun w: Opposite of passive aggressive

484
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:06.330
Shaun w: I thought passive aggressive is when you, when someone's like, like you you shy away from things

485
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:09.210
Shaun w: No, no.

486
01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

487
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:16.170
Shaun w: No.

488
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to have

489
01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.720
Shaun w: Yeah. He wants me

490
01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just going to keep talking out to deal. Yep.

491
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.130
Shaun w: He now he ran off.

492
01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I gave up on you.

493
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:34.860
Shaun w: hear some noise.

494
01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is a pretty good one to know

495
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.610
Shaun w: You let things go

496
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I'm going to give you an example.

497
01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you, you can still see me right on the

498
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:51.030
Shaun w: Screen. Yeah.

499
01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: He's back. I don't get needs yet.

500
01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.070
Oh,

501
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so passive aggressive. So notice the word aggressive

502
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's still a hostile behavior, right, but it isn't punching kicking it isn't.

503
01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Overtly name calling. So watch. It's passive so

504
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not direct communication. So here's how it might show up. I'm going to give you some examples that you might say, Oh my gosh, I do this or oh my gosh, my friend, does this or someone at work or maybe someone else, you know, so watch

505
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Last night I purposely brought the car gas tank down to less than zero so that my husband would be stuck really inconvenienced even though I know he had a meeting in the morning.

506
01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And he had to go fill up his tunic.

507
01:01:55.410 --> 01:02:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, oh, he felt it. That was passive aggressive wasn't. I still hostile, but I didn't say I'm angry with you. I didn't say I'm going to retaliate against you.

508
01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.740
Shaun w: But guess what, it's

509
01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: All about it. Okay, so these are made up, but you get, you're going to get them to keep going.

510
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I

511
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know that.

512
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that my son likes to have his particular workout stuff cleaned and I deliberately left it out and didn't wash it so that he would get the point of appreciating

513
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm doing and he didn't have it available to him. I was angry. I didn't tell him I was right. I still hostile wasn't I

514
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.320
Shaun w: Guess.

515
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I got my

516
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.230
Shaun w: It's all good.

517
01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's awful. The recipient of it feels this burn. It's so awful.

518
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But we do it in some ways.

519
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: We do it with our face. Look at this, look at this face.

520
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, no, I'm fine. No, it's good.

521
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's my face saying, I'm fine. It's good. No, it can be that subtle okay so passive aggressive, you may start to notice it in other people and some people do it through sarcasm.

522
01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit back and forth and back and forth.

523
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:39.660
Shaun w: Right.

524
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We're cutting down each other. Oh, and I'm just kidding. We might say you can't hold me accountable. Why you so parents live so sensitive. I was only joking when

525
01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:59.910
Shaun w: You get that a lot. I get that a lot. I go, Why did up, man. I was only joking. Yeah. You weren't you'll keep

526
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so someone has done it to you.

527
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

528
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:06.960
Shaun w: Yeah, but I don't do that. Don't do that to people.

529
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So you find yourself really taking the road of just being direct

530
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.540
Shaun w: Yeah yeah

531
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Not everyone takes that road time

532
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.960
Shaun w: Well, a lot of people don't like me because of that because I'm super straightforward.

533
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:28.650
Shaun w: I don't like something I'll tell them I he, I don't like that. Don't do that or that you know

534
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:32.010
Shaun w: beat around the bush. I'll let them know. Don't do that.

535
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.530
Shaun w: If I don't like something I'll let them know

536
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think you are what you say you are. You say, I'm this then you present that way. There's a lot of congruence so people know when they meet you. He's going to say what he means.

537
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's some predictability in that

538
01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just and you're saying, sometimes people don't like it, who has said they don't like it. So,

539
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:04.440
Shaun w: Just, just people like me because I'm straightforward.

540
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but who has said they don't like you for that.

541
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:12.750
Shaun w: Was in prison people told me that that this is what my problem is

542
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, they say they label it a problem they label it a problem with you or that

543
01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:19.380
Shaun w: Yeah, with me.

544
01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

545
01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:23.730
Shaun w: But with personal relationships. Now,

546
01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's no, like, here's one. This one you don't do this one ever do.

547
01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:37.170
Shaun w: People pleasing. I guess everybody does that a little bit.

548
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So, wait, wait. So now the guys in the president, right, because that was the example you brought up.

549
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.600
You can pick another one.

550
01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are being straightforward.

551
01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of like, Dang, man, you really say what's on your mind right

552
01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When are you people pleasing with those friends or acquaintances.

553
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.810
Shaun w: I guess that's not

554
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's interesting. So one of the thing. I don't know if you've heard me say in in group that we develop these

555
01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes we develop them before.

556
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Active addiction we develop them basically as an adaptation to environment that may not

557
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Have sort of this free flowing resource available to us so

558
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm curious.

559
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Was everyone in your environment coming up as direct as you were

560
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:45.930
Shaun w: Yeah. Probably my moms like that.

561
01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah,

562
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And as I recall, there was not a lot of affection, either.

563
01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:56.070
Shaun w: Well, it was. Yeah.

564
01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you ever get the sense that she really knew you understood you and on an empathetic way like really understood your

565
01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:07.890
Emotion.

566
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.290
Shaun w: No, no.

567
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's what I wonder, you know, remember, way, way, way back, you hit brought up. Oh, I was

568
01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember you are labeled some stuff.

569
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.200
Yeah.

570
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And psychologist and they like to use those personality disorders, a lot

571
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But you mentioned. Oh, it says that I don't care about people remember that one that lacks empathy piece of

572
01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Personality or borderline. They all

573
01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: On attribute that that particular

574
01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.430
Shaun w: Feature

575
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lack of empathy.

576
01:07:55.290 --> 01:08:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't sound like that model for you coming up.

577
01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:04.890
Shaun w: No.

578
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:07.740
Shaun w: Model version.

579
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh modeling, meaning

580
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't maybe in your environment, your caregiver.

581
01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:16.740
Shaun w: At all.

582
01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just dip into some if I lose you just say, what does that mean, what does that mean, what does that mean, okay, because I'm going to dip into

583
01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:25.620
Education.

584
01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're tiny

585
01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: months old zero okay we we have no distinction when I'm an infant.

586
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't distinguish I've just got this little brain. I can't distinguish between me and the baby and you as my caregiver, we're all one. I can't. There's no object differentiation. So when you don't look at me and

587
01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: COO make sounds and are there for me.

588
01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:00.390
I'm in distress.

589
01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I can have a stress, even as a tiny little baby. And then I get older and I made one and two and three and four and five and that continues and my caregiver out here isn't mirroring

590
01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm

591
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Manage My emotions.

592
01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I come up with my own way of coping with an environment that didn't model.

593
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:27.810
That

594
01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I was or

595
01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The lack of empathy.

596
01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I absorbed my model of how to interact with the world. It's not safe. So it's possible that may have absorbed that very, very, very early on.

597
01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:49.350
Shaun w: And there

598
01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be a longing for it. Like there's, it's like, like maybe like going on a planet where people look like they're getting along fine. Everybody loves each other, but you're like what is that

599
01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: All about what

600
01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:16.800
Shaun w: I've done is can understand that, like people yeah I care so much they act like they care so much but i think that's that's people people pleasing because is it something that I think they got to be lying. How can a person care that much about somebody they don't know

601
01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So that right there. That thing that's a skill that I don't think you had modeled

602
01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about in the skill of sort of empathy and I was inviting you during group. I didn't follow up with you to see if you have done it, but

603
01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I hadn't learned I think last week to spend time just picture what this person might be

604
01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Looking at the other heads down. Oh, they just cross their arms or they don't, they're distracted or whatever, you know, just sort of imagining

605
01:10:54.180 --> 01:11:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder how they're feeling and come back itself. Of course, we don't want to stay outside for long, but just to start to practice that a little bit.

606
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: There are you, have you ever seen the ones that have us really strong capacity for

607
01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Empathy forgiveness. I

608
01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:12.720
Shaun w: Think they're lying.

609
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

610
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.320
Shaun w: Yeah, now

611
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: They have an over adaptive empathetic skill.

612
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:21.870
Shaun w: That means that

613
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:26.490
Shaun w: So they're modeling. They're modeling. He was over there. People probably overdid it.

614
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't quite black and white like that.

615
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And I see where you're going with it but but hold on to this little piece just for you though. Don't worry about other folks but just know that

616
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Our people were it's an adaptation, you had to adapt to your environment, you have an emotionally unavailable caregiver you then become emotionally unavailable to other

617
01:11:55.230 --> 01:12:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You had an emotionally unavailable caregiver, you become emotionally unavailable.

618
01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on to that if this hypothesis is true. I don't know. We'll keep talking right if it is true.

619
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just a skill. See, that's the problem. I have a personality, the labels that that psychiatrists and psychologists give

620
01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:20.550
Shaun w: Yeah, I'd be doing

621
01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.390
Shaun w: Right on that I read on that cell phones like what yeah

622
01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I think people can change. And maybe that's Pollyanna ish and naive.

623
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:31.350
Shaun w: I go blow my nose.

624
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:35.790
Shaun w: I'm listening to you.

625
01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of calls going out, people have been really wiped out.

626
01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:58.920
Shaun w: I feel like like dream.

627
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So Sean if we say this, if we say

628
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a missed learning opportunity.

629
01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Then it's exciting because it means I can learn the skill.

630
01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You to write can not look around and say they're full of shit, they're a bunch of liars. They're phonies, there's no way you could love that deeply. How can you trust people that

631
01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You too.

632
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Can have it right and trust it, but

633
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, because the flip side is what

634
01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Broken Hearted

635
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The flip side is broken hearted the opposite right of that love

636
01:13:46.260 --> 01:14:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is fear and yes it is scary. But when you think about the quality and value of your life, maybe just take it on with your children. We will just go there. We won't go to friendships and romantic stuff for a second that might be just way ahead down the line, but just hold it for your children.

637
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: This kind of intimacy that can be possible with your children.

638
01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It means risking with them. A heartache of loss that comes with deeply loving and it's terrifying. I can tell you it is scary to love deeply and and just trust blindly that they're gonna love you back. It's terrifying and it could be

639
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The most important thing you will do in your life.

640
01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:40.980
Shaun w: Well that's why i don't i don't have religion. I don't want a relationship. I don't want, I don't want a girlfriend writing because

641
01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:48.750
Shaun w: Once they lie to me once, I'll never trust them again and I mean I can't, I can't have a relationship. So I just see we

642
01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's but but let's just say my hypothesis is true, your

643
01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That thing I did with the object relations did that part. Makes sense that you may have absorbed. This

644
01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:11.820
Shaun w: This sense of like, okay, yeah. My mom, my mom's mean she's is she doing, she's mean really. Okay. Yeah.

645
01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so in order in that environment as well as a tiny little person.

646
01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you were a little four or five, three to all those tiny little ages.

647
01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: The body and mind want to keep you alive. They want you to survive and you will come up with an adaptation that will keep you protected psychically so you don't collapse into depression. Do you know that

648
01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You did, you did the best you could what you ended up probably doing was formulating a sense of identity.

649
01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I cannot trust the world, it will betray me, it will hurt me. It's unavailable to me. I cannot trust it.

650
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did that as an adaptation. But that was a child's solution, Sean.

651
01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All I'm introducing even if you let me just a little bit. Don't you don't have to say, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it. Just, just let me and just a crack, which is what if

652
01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: We add another skill and that one's still available to you can still go okay, this guy's a jerk. I can't trust him, you still hold on to that.

653
01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you add is this person watch shows up on time says what he means right has credibility, time after time after time after time doesn't cross boundaries.

654
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I will let him her in a little watch when they're in my circle of trust. Right, I'll let them in a little then there's room for they get to be human and make a mistake.

655
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:55.740
Shaun w: And where you're crazy that, you know, because that's crazy. You know me like that because that's weird because

656
01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:58.260
Shaun w: I'll start tripping if they make a mistake.

657
01:16:59.520 --> 01:16:59.790
Shaun w: But

658
01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's because you don't have this yet, you don't have this tolerance for people making mistakes.

659
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I'm saying is, that's where we are today what I'm proposing is over time. If you want to

660
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You might be able to let people in a little. See if you can handle it. Because the deal is.

661
01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: We're human. We won't mean just because I do let you down. Doesn't mean my intention was to betray you and hurt you. It's just because I am flawed.

662
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I will double specifically me because we only have us here. I'll accidentally double booked someone I will screw up. I will show up late doesn't happen very often. But it can happen, or I I have been hospitalized. I may not show up. Okay, I

663
01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:58.170
Shaun w: You know, it's funny. You know, it's funny, it's like okay I can make a mistake when no one else can

664
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.920
Oh,

665
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

666
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, I get it. But that's because you don't have this this window of tolerance is like anybody for you. There's no room for

667
01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm, what I'm proposing is that over time as your, your confidence is I'm still lovable. I'm okay. I'm working on this sense of identity. I didn't have a good modeling figure. When I was younger, I'm working on it.

668
01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to sit with this discomfort of being WITH someone who let me down and maybe it'll starting here with with you and I, because it's a safe place in here because my role here is to contain all that goes on. Right.

669
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: If you start, let's say you can tolerate someone making a mistake this much that's progress.

670
01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: still stay in the relationship, your value is not determined by my letting you down to understand. You're still valuable, you're still important even look a little bit more

671
01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit more.

672
01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That takes time. You didn't get that when you were younger, you need it. That

673
01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not too late. That's what therapy can do

674
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to because what it could open up and just think about your kids because your kids are gonna

675
01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my god.

676
01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:35.070
Shaun w: You should see my daughter, man. She calls me talking trash or like she gets her on her friends and then she'll call me and she just wants to talk shit to me. I'm like, although the DJ, you better quit calling me a line and talk like though, and as your, your calls from where I told her.

677
01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:43.500

678
01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you want that cold stuff that your mom did, or do you want to have an interest to see if there's another way to connect with your family. Yeah, yeah.

679
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:00.480
Shaun w: Yeah.

680
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

681
01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:08.940
Shaun w: I just don't want them treating me like that, you know, I mean, because he's my daughter's a trip. My son's school but my daughter like trips

682
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Your job doesn't change on

683
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It will feel threatening.

684
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: As if this way. She's treating you watch. I did it with me. Let's come back to me and we'll parallel it to your daughter.

685
01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Show up late. You may feel like I have betrayed you and insulted you, and

686
01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:35.280
Shaun w: I hate being people being late. He always show up early.

687
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And disrespected you. That's how you feel.

688
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you can. And this is where the the work and the skills come in. You remember. Oh wait, no, this is my work is to sit with the fact that

689
01:20:51.360 --> 01:21:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: She may have something going on. I'm going to hang on to myself long enough, not dismiss her and cut her off because she's an unsafe person. I'm going to hold on to this.

690
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Five more minutes 10 minutes I can do it. Oh, I noticed I'm getting angry. Nope, I can do it. I can do it. And then I show up.

691
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you say, Oh my gosh, I was getting so pissed off I were you, disrespecting me what was going on. And I say,

692
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, boy, I am sorry about that, you know, at the end of a session. Sometimes I've activated people so much. It just, I don't want them to stay so upset right at the end. And so we do some of that containing

693
01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Or there's something maybe someone's suicidal and I make the decision to stay there and care for them.

694
01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:36.930
Shaun w: And I am a

695
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:45.510
Shaun w: You know the other day at work I'll to those seats reason every other day at work. I work with this guy we build these machines together. He sits on the other side of the table, we do it together.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.570
Shaun w: And he was acting all CRAZY slamming stuff. And I said, a matter. You're right. These are your a

697
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:54.150
Shaun w: Lot to work with.

698
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.960
Shaun w: And I was all you know we go on my break, I said.

699
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:11.520
Shaun w: I'll handle it right now, break and then it was like break was like in 10 minutes and then when I said that he started. He started acting right I started talking to me and then I'll ever since that happened now he's cool. Ever since like

700
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:24.240
Shaun w: Like I guess he saw that I wasn't scared or something, I don't know, because he's always will have a data warehouse right now I break to what the ditch right now and what will handle this. And then there was anything now he's cool man like

701
01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.120
Shaun w: School. Do you

Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want me to say to that.

703
01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.460
Shaun w: I'm just telling you that's what I'm just telling you the situation.

704
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.210
But

705
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I know, I got a little sketchy. So I didn't hear all of the story.

706
01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:47.400
Shaun w: I wonder why my headsets are not connecting now they're like they cut out

707
01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, someone did just tell me the wind knocked down my internet again. I feel terrible. I'm so I wonder if you guys are having a lot of wind

708
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys having a lot of wind

709
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:03.570
Shaun w: Possibly

710
01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:05.790
Shaun w: We were then

711
01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.220
Shaun w: Yeah, me.

712
01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can hear you.

713
01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:22.020
Shaun w: You know it's it's back on. Yeah, I will know this guy. He told me he said he's a also a member, you're writing these are your rate and then he's all because if you're not array we go handle it afterward. Yes, the break was

714
01:23:22.770 --> 01:23:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: WHAT WAS BEFORE THAT YOU ALL RIGHT WHERE DO WHAT provokes that

715
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:32.070
Shaun w: Question, because you know he started slamming things on the camera. I didn't know why he was mad like he started slamming things on the

716
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:44.220
Shaun w: On the counter. So I said, hey man, or you're right. Like, like, why are you tripping. You know I'm saying, and then he's already. All right. And also, and he's all because we're not waiting on how to listen after work, and I said, you know, we will have to write down 10 minutes break. Okay, what

717
01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you trying to see if he was

718
01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:53.490
Shaun w: Angry go home.

719
01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Wait, originally

720
01:23:56.190 --> 01:24:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The very first inquiry. Hey, man. Are you all right, was it a I care about this other human being angry.

721
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.250
Shaun w: No, it was like you have a problem.

722
01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: His slamming stuff.

723
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:11.880
Shaun w: Yeah, so, so you know why he was acting like that. I know why he was doing

724
01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The way.

725
01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You presupposed. It was about you. Well, why would you go there. Do you think

726
01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:32.310
Shaun w: Because, because we're working on missions together. It's if we do it as a team, you know, I mean, he started like shiny stuff today. He's the one that he's been at that station for a year and I mean I just got there.

727
01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:45.180
Shaun w: Okay, so I didn't know what his problem was. And then when he said he right away. He got like he wanted to fight. And then when I said, all right, yeah 100 right now. Then he changed up and then he started being corner since then he's been real cool

728
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want my feedback on this exchange.

729
01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Do you

730
01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

731
01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's going to be nothing like the way you think.

732
01:24:57.330 --> 01:24:57.810
Shaun w: Yeah.

733
01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:00.780
Shaun w: You sure. Yeah, tell me what's up.

734
01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's some prison logic in there that

735
01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. The real world doesn't work like that.

736
01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:12.360
Shaun w: Yeah, well, you know, I tell you.

737
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.370
Shaun w: Learn this guy, this guy tells me

738
01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:17.910
Shaun w: He calls me a punk ass. And I said, April. What's your mouth. I said,

739
01:25:18.450 --> 01:25:24.930
Shaun w: Don't talk to me like that as well. BRO, HE'S ALL YOU'RE NOT IN PRISON AND WORK AS I don't care where I'm at. So you don't talk to your friends like that. You can call me a punk ass.

740
01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:29.910
Shaun w: Because in prison, we would have to fight immediately if you say that word, and then he

741
01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:40.080
Shaun w: He chilled out but I told me you don't talk to your friends like that. You call me up podcast I was already like he was joking. And then he's all you're not a prisoner more as I don't care where I'm at, you don't you don't do that.

742
01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we would need to date. First of all, let me just say you handle my feedback. Very well.

743
01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you kept it real.

744
01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying, I'm trying to do the same thing with you right. Just be very frank

745
01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but this concept of friend, I wonder, I wonder if he really is a friend.

746
01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:13.980
Shaun w: No he's not, he's an acquaintance, but I just, you know what I mean we're we're building a friendship beyond the like it's a big old fat anyway, I just bugs me.

747
01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:15.960
Shaun w: I work with them.

748
01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

749
01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that. So let's take out this scenario, let's just do a little bit of read your ability to register boundaries and what would be a reasonable friend, you're assessing whether this could have been a friend. What was he doing

750
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That was kind of like annoying already

751
01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:36.930
Shaun w: Oh, he's running his mouth. Yeah.

752
01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:42.210
Shaun w: Yeah, he's real disrespectful about people. Oh.

753
01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, if you got some about other people. Why then you may god

754
01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:48.150
Shaun w: Yeah yeah to

755
01:26:49.410 --> 01:27:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Good check. Hey, that's smart. So he's kind of off the list. So he's not someone you know you wouldn't want to tell a secret to, you're not going to do under the underbelly big fear. This is my childhood.

756
01:27:03.630 --> 01:27:04.770
Shaun w: When you get you with that fool.

757
01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, not even gonna hang out with them.

758
01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: How is he the one you're working right next to

759
01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.480
Shaun w: No, no, he just when might when the guy I work with called in. He comes and works for him.

760
01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.760
Shaun w: Okay, they put him in his place.

761
01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:29.160
Shaun w: The guy's been working with Paul's in a lot lately and I told him, I said, hey, you're gonna lose your job, but you keep calling in a lot. You're going to end up losing here and he's

762
01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:39.000
Shaun w: He's like the lead. He makes a lot of money and I i told me I was telling me yesterday. Now we're cool. We've been talking about. Ever since that up and I said hey man, you need to stop calling in so much because you're going to get fired.

763
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think you gave them that advice.

764
01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:54.450
Shaun w: Because it seems pretty cool. And then I told him a big they said mandatory overtime for for those workers and I told him. Maybe he don't want to do it. Yes, the science on paper. I said, We'll ask him if I can come in for you.

765
01:27:54.930 --> 01:28:00.870
Shaun w: I want the overtime. You don't think I told you all come into work for you is so he's gonna ask him to do if I come to work for him.

766
01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But the first part. The second one was self serving that was for you. But the first part around, make sure you show up on time. Don't lose this job.

767
01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now, was there any hidden agenda with that one, or did you actually care about this person under the category of he's cool and

768
01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:29.220
Shaun w: I don't know. I think he's a youngster, and I'm trying to talk to him because he's only like 27 so I'm trying to talk to me like a man you know i mean you're messing up

769
01:28:30.690 --> 01:28:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

770
01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.170
Shaun w: So you guys are methodology.

771
01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you can find that that empathetic moment when you see yourself in that youngster right

772
01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's empathy, you go outside, you go outside of her was serving me for a moment, you feel, what would it be like

773
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To be thinking you know it all already got it all figured out. When you're 23 sure as heck, don't you know

774
01:28:59.190 --> 01:29:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in for a rough awakening. Right. You go out there for a second. But you don't stay there.

775
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what you think. Right. These pushovers and these do gooders, these empathetic PEOPLE YOU THINK THEY STAY OUT HERE TOO LONG. Maybe

776
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That can't be real. They care cara, cara, cara, cara only about others. The trick is, you're right. People can do too much of that. And then the encouragement and therapy might be to come back to the self.

777
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You move back and forth. You go out. You say, Oh, man. That'd be this poor guy using for a rough time here.

778
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:31.560
So reality check.

779
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.500
Shaun w: One time, my wife was all she's all she was getting drunk drinking. She's all

780
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:44.910
Shaun w: She's all. What did you do when you were 21 I said I was fighting for my life facing the death penalty. So that's what I was doing. I wasn't out partying and drinking and

781
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:54.390
Shaun w: You know, I mean, that's all she wanted to do is drink all the time. I don't drink alcohol. I don't really care for you don't like it, and I remember she told me that. And I was like, when I was when

782
01:29:55.410 --> 01:29:59.010
Shaun w: I wasn't doing that at 21 I was fighting for my life.

783
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Story is

784
01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's intense

785
01:30:06.570 --> 01:30:17.010
Shaun w: Yeah, you can read about. There's a book on it, do that. There's a they wrote a book on it. The my private investigator wrote a book on it. He was a call for 30 years now. He's one of my good friends now.

786
01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: He's a good friend.

787
01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:22.230
Yeah.

788
01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I

789
01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a good friend here this brand new actually call and talk to

790
01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:37.080
Shaun w: No, I don't want to talk to nobody. But he's a good friend, or if I wanted to call and talk to my affect us need to our books.

791
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:41.460
Shaun w: We bet on the bronco game, neither he lost

792
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so

793
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We went to a lot of different places in this discussion.

794
01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:52.230
Shaun w: My mind was my mind wanders

795
01:30:54.210 --> 01:31:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But let me bring it back a little bit. Let's tether it to using the broken record which is repeating things. I know it's kind of boring, but it does sink in. When we repeat things

796
01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:08.100
Shaun w: Repeat a lot

797
01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's good because then we can remember. But so let's uh,

798
01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's use that technique now.

799
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about

800
01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did with the friend at work.

801
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you did with your daughter.

802
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Just for a second.

803
01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:33.630
Shaun w: I want you to hold on every time somebody calls my my headphones cut out

804
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody's does that we just gotta hit that mute button again.

805
01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.970
Shaun w: You don't even know who these people are.

806
01:31:41.670 --> 01:31:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there's a way to put it on on unavailable or something before a session. You know what I mean. So that people don't books.

807
01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:52.620
Shaun w: All there's a way to do that.

808
01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I haven't tested it.

809
01:31:57.150 --> 01:31:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be

810
01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, like, Do Not Disturb maybe mode. I think I haven't tested it. I do. I do it at night, so I don't get woken up. Alright, so let's come back. Can you hear me okay we back online because you're frozen right now.

811
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:18.330
Shaun w: Oh, did I freeze. Oh.

812
01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, of your audios back. Let's see.

813
01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: My ears are so bad today.

814
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:28.170
Shaun w: Are there that's

815
01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're frozen, I hear you fine. Waiting for video to come back on you may decide to actually if you want to, you could turn video off your bandwidth for audio will be even better.

816
01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:47.130
Shaun w: No, it's not that people are calling. Yeah, I didn't know that. I don't know who they are, their PCP know

817
01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So real quick, let's see, I've got I'm going to draw a line down my page. I want you to picture.

818
01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're thinking, you can find this. This is not an easy thing to do. So you're real challenged

819
01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You can figure out what your belief about yourself was when you're interacting with

820
01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What the heck was working next to what was his name.

821
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You swam and stuff.

822
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Chris, what's your belief about yourself when you saw Chris slamming stuff.

823
01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And then on the next screen so visualize like okay here's Chris. Here's my daughter.

824
01:33:25.890 --> 01:33:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can capture what's in common with those two scenes. Here's Chris doing his slam slam slam we work together. What do I believe about myself.

825
01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's my daughter.

826
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Behaving whatever that was. Do you see if you can find what's in common.

827
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:49.110
Shaun w: Yeah, they're both acting up

828
01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it, they're acting up so watch

829
01:33:55.950 --> 01:34:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now come back to you. You see that's the perceived threat. I know you don't register this threat, but just go with it, go with this for a second.

830
01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: acting up

831
01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I believe about myself when I'm in the proximity of someone acting up. What's the belief about myself.

832
01:34:15.570 --> 01:34:16.860
Shaun w: See if we can slap them.

833
01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. That's what, that's your solution, by the way.

834
01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.570
Shaun w: Yeah.

835
01:34:21.930 --> 01:34:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's not the same thing as a belief or almost there.

836
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: My solution is I'm going to slap them.

837
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the operating belief about myself and I'll know it with I am

838
01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I can find the belief about myself by finishing that sentence picture if you can just for a moment. See if you can do it picture him slamming stuff. Oh, I want to slap them.

839
01:34:56.010 --> 01:35:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the belief about yourself in that moment when you see this going on.

840
01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.080
Do you know

841
01:35:05.610 --> 01:35:07.140
Shaun w: My belief about myself.

842
01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish the sentence, I am you'll get there with that completed sentence I am

843
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.380
Shaun w: Tired this full slamming store.

844
01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If he doesn't quit, then I am

845
01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:24.690
Shaun w: Not his teeth out

846
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:28.140
Shaun w: Come back.

847
01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's still a solution slap not t is still a solution.

848
01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:33.780
Shaun w: Oh,

849
01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

850
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:42.000
Shaun w: Tired of this fall flat, Mr Obama Delia.

851
01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If he doesn't stop. Then I will be

852
01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:49.950
Shaun w: Forced to check in.

853
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can, you'll be able to win this word game, but I'll

854
01:35:56.610 --> 01:36:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Be pressing for so there's there's some resistance not resistance, but it's a hard actually thing to get to is the concept. It is running.

855
01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That solution that is running your perception about the threat response to someone slamming something to a daughter acting up we got to find it. We got to get that that core belief about the self. It takes a while to get to. It's not an easy thing we tried it a couple times just now.

856
01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're hard to get to, but they're running the show. Wouldn't it be nice to know what's

857
01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the puppeteer here.

858
01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:36.600
Shaun w: Master of Puppets

859
01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's running.

860
01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: If we can't get to that which I won't take, we can do it.

861
01:36:45.180 --> 01:37:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have a sense of control really understanding. Oh, I know what's up with me right now there is now time and distance between this full and his slamming stuff and my ability

862
01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: To be okay with it.

863
01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:07.320
Shaun w: Yeah, just let it go. I say, I can't let it go. That's, that's the thing.

864
01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because there's no. See, this is what I do. As an example, there's time and space you have none.

865
01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.360
Shaun w: You have

866
01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Any less response stimulus response stimulus response, over time, you will have member, little bit of time and space and there is choice agency and power inside there and it'll get wider and wider and wider.

867
01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But it takes practice.

868
01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's the, that's the journey that we're on. Okay.

869
01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: When the behavior doesn't land you back in jail doesn't catch police attention. Nothing we keep job right that

870
01:37:50.820 --> 01:38:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That space of where all I can. I can know, think for a second. Oh yeah, they ain't worth it. This was not worth it. He's gonna stay an idiot. And I'm going to be in jail. No, that's not how it's going down today.

871
01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:09.330
Shaun w: Right, because he's, you know, and then I almost it almost happened that's, that's the thing. He's the one that

872
01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:20.580
Shaun w: That back down and started talking to me because if he wouldn't have did that we were going to go on to it. You know, I mean, and at the same. I thought, Man, I should have more controller than than that because right away. I didn't even think about. I just thought about

873
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:25.170
Shaun w: kicking his ass, you know, I mean, I didn't even think about like stopping

874
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:29.460
Shaun w: I just kept going, you know what, man. I'm really gonna fuck this dude up and I mean is it

875
01:38:30.150 --> 01:38:31.470
Shaun w: I don't know what the problem is.

876
01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: This I have to kick his ass is

877
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It is because you didn't have to. There's, there's a set of rules that you know you better learn because your life is at stake, so

878
01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:51.330
Shaun w: There's killers in there, you get a fight your fight for your life.

879
01:38:52.410 --> 01:39:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so those rules, you're still applying out here in the community. And I'm assuming freedom is truly what you really want.

880
01:39:01.530 --> 01:39:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so

881
01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: There's steak. And so I'm on that side. I'm on the side of let's get those skills in place, one of them.

882
01:39:11.130 --> 01:39:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the breathing. I know it seems really wild, but when you do that vago break and you do that. That's when you do the box breathing when you do that when you see some cool or some daughter acting out

883
01:39:27.150 --> 01:39:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Really is your freedom, more important or is kicking their ass and punishing them more important, no more freedom is the most important thing. And I'm telling you that breath will give you T i m e

884
01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You will have time to go.

885
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:49.170
Shaun w: What am I didn't, you know, who cares about this do. Yeah.

886
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, but you need time and I'm telling you.

887
01:39:53.610 --> 01:40:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The brain. If you have any kind of ADHD history or trauma or anything like that. There's no time it's pushed so

888
01:40:03.810 --> 01:40:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to get the breath, then guess what blood gets to all of the parts of the brain, it gets to the prefrontal cortex you get to remember what was that things that

889
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You told me to do.

890
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not wearing red state. Yeah. Breathe absolutely gotta remember that one, but it'll give you time to remember. Other things like, oh, this is his problem, not mine. I work it out. I'm Sam, do you can work it out.

891
01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:33.480
Shaun w: That's why do Tommy do because I guess people were calling him telling them that I'm crazy trying to get me violated and I was all

892
01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:41.400
Shaun w: He's I've never had so many people calling me about you and I was like, What does. I don't even talk to nobody. Easy. He pulled me over. I was walking on the streets are there. My appeal rolled up on me.

893
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.350
Shaun w: And he started telling me something he told me some girl called acting like my cousin, trying to get my address and phone number. And I was like, You didn't give it your writings all know

894
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:56.130
Shaun w: Like, I don't know what brought that up, but it might feel it. It's just like tripping out. People are trying to give you violated or don't even know who they are.

895
01:40:57.570 --> 01:40:57.870
Shaun w: I mean,

896
01:40:59.850 --> 01:41:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to catch more attention.

897
01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:04.920
Shaun w: Yeah, Stephen myself. I don't even talk to somebody

898
01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I got scared just now, because that could have gone down badly. He could have accidentally hit his head. If you punched him slapped him, and it could have gone

899
01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:22.380
Shaun w: And I was, I got really mad, where I want to get everything I knew I

900
01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:32.160
Shaun w: Wanted to do. And then when you started talking to me I calm down and and I was like I was like it was the problem and why were you get mad. He's all I thought you're coming at me some type of girls or boys.

901
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:36.120
Shaun w: Coming at you know tag were just asked you what your bond was why, why are you getting mad.

902
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But shine.

903
01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.260
Shaun w: I know why he was getting mad, though I know why because

904
01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You

905
01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:49.500
Shaun w: Know, because what we do every time we're doing the bolts were racing or seen it is like for some reason. It's a competition, who's faster.

906
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:59.430
Shaun w: I kept beating and beating them and medium and he could be me. And then all of a sudden he started slamming stuff you know i mean he's been doing it for a year and I just started a couple days doing that thing and

907
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:06.990
Shaun w: I was beating him yeah i mean i think he started. That's why he's getting mad because everybody does like a race. Yeah, I mean, like, it's

908
01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an interesting because if it's a monotonous.

909
01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Job, at least you got competition. So we're going to talk about that next time that Derek, that is a positive thing. But at the same time, it might be time to do a different game in a sense.

910
01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:23.490
Shaun w: When

911
01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you're not winning if you're back in jail. So we got to keep

912
01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:29.280
Shaun w: Playing with

913
01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Different games to play. It's not just competition. There's other games to play so

914
01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You did really well you worked very hard. You, you listen to me and I was right, bringing up very different concepts and you I think you gave me just a little you let me in a little bit, right, listening to these different things.

915
01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:52.710
Shaun w: Yes, yeah.

916
01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, and we're still good for next week at nine.

917
01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:01.320
Shaun w: Yeah. Okay, excellent.

918
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Your big trick is going to be and I kid you not.

919
01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Sharpie this what, who cares what people think breeze.

920
01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:13.260
Shaun w: Yeah, well,

921
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But someone gives you shit about it. Can you say I'm

922
01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying not to pop off on any one, I need to keep it together. I need to breathe. Why is that embarrassing. I don't think that's embarrassing. Dude, your life is your freedoms breeze tattoo. And if you have to

923
01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.850
Shaun w: My little boy, I got a full sure again it just like that you that my whole body's full

924
01:43:37.530 --> 01:43:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You get my point is

925
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That that breath.

926
01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: All of a sudden there's blood in the rest of our brain that science that's just not the psychobabble the science working for you here.

927
01:43:50.820 --> 01:44:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be able to have all of the parts of your brain working and you will remember, the next thing which is this full is not worth it. Nobody is worth my freedom being lost. Cut it out. I mean, maybe right saving your daughter's something, but you get me.
