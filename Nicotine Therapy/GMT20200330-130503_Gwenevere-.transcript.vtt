52
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know, don't be hard on yourself, right, because maybe set these goals. And it's like, life gets in the way. But these are things that we're keeping an eye on things you want to accomplish this. I want a job.

53
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: On the ninth of March, made a little note I am still waiting to hear back from the hotel, a son said there will be a lot of openings. Okay, so where are we at with this now.

54
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.620
Christina haro: We're getting

55
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:48.150
Christina haro: Close. Yeah, it really united in, you know, I mean, With all this going on where we're like on a ship down here.

56
00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And is there anything. Have you played around with anything online that you might want to do

57
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.360
Christina haro: A few things like

58
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.700
Christina haro: There's some like

59
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:17.490
Christina haro: Produce companies and stuff that are hiring I applied I applied at some stocking positions. I haven't heard back. So who knows maybe somebody will call me.

60
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.900
Okay.

61
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.160
Right.

62
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you present like it's not affecting it's not causing stress, but that might be just what you're showing here. How much of the time. Do you worry.

63
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: About

64
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.040
Christina haro: Do

65
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:46.200
Christina haro: Worry, I say, maybe you know there's, you know, most of the day. I try to just not think about it, but I think like in the evening hours. I kind of stress before I go to sleep.

66
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:55.020
Christina haro: Because he knows quite a down the boys are in the room, I'm you know I have more time to think I do get a little anxious and stressed.

67
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's your, your evening routine looks like looks like you know from, like, you know, six or seven o'clock on what what do you, what's a typical evening for you.

68
00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:20.430
Christina haro: Usually I make dinner wash the dishes. And then, you know, everybody says, Good night, or we sit here and talk for a while, then I'll go to my room, watch some TV feed the cat that's the usual okay

69
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's during after dinner that you start to worry. Is it during tv time, is it feeling

70
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:31.230
Christina haro: About it. Yeah. I said, about eight I started to think about stuff.

71
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.590
Okay.

72
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I'm TV doesn't seem to get your mind off of it.

73
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.560
Christina haro: No.

74
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because

75
00:07:45.540 --> 00:08:03.630
Christina haro: You know, I haven't really I haven't really worried that much to say, you know, it's like the nightly thing, but I guess if we keep if you know life turns out like this, you know, and it extends longer. I think I probably going to get more worried, but

76
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.650
Christina haro: It hasn't been too bad. Yeah, okay.

77
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So how about how many minutes do you think you spend from

78
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.360
inky

79
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: 15 or

80
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.650
Christina haro: Maybe 1520 you know I think about it. And then, you know,

81
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:33.660
Christina haro: I think about it, and then I I just tell myself, you know, you're not the only one going through this right now. It's almost everybody right

82
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And we think about

83
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, on the ninth of March. You had mentioned, and she had gone to church over the weekend. It was a big step for you.

84
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: People that, you know, um, are you doing around spirituality and in your recovery. I know you had started to go there. How is it in your life are not

85
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:23.070
Christina haro: Ready to go. And now there is no church. So, um, recently I started watching the religious channel like yesterday I watched it on TV, which is nice. It made me feel good.

86
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you hear anything in there that kind of relates to a way for you to have sustained.

87
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Or hear anything in some of the sermons that kind of give you hope and strength. Like, do you remember hearing something

88
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.180
Christina haro: You know,

89
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:03.450
Christina haro: You'll only thing like I remembered you know these past couple of times that I've been doing the the the

90
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.430
Christina haro: The TV thing. And then when I went I did a

91
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:28.860
Christina haro: 111 thing kind of caught my mind is when he said on hard times when you're in hard times, you know, you should pray and think about you know what Jesus went through, you know, and just try to pray and ask, you know, but to help you. That's that to my mind because you know in in

92
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:42.690
Christina haro: In recent years, I was real close to that side of myself and I just totally lost that way. So it kind of it kind of made me think.

93
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So describe what Jesus went through, obviously it's a lot, but like, what's the imagery, you got

94
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.520
Christina haro: The imagery, I get is, you know, she

95
00:10:54.810 --> 00:11:05.760
Christina haro: To me, you know he he went through hard times, he was accused of a lot of stuff you know he did a lot of things people didn't approve of, you know,

96
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.250
Christina haro: And yet you know I think about all that. And I said, Well, you know,

97
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.160
Christina haro: I have to kind of think of what he went through.

98
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:30.930
Christina haro: And through and yet you know I don't tell you, I feel like I just feel like God's watching over me. That's how I feel.

99
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:38.670
Christina haro: Just like God watch over him. I. That's how I feel. But I feel I have be closer to him for him to help me.

100
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So God is watching over Jesus through his hard times and is watching over you.

101
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.380
Christina haro: Yeah, and I just feel like I haven't gotten there yet. You know, like I used to be.

102
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: The difference between what you were doing before. And now as well. Yes.

103
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:13.740
Christina haro: Yes, the difference. So different is that, you know, in the past, you know, I was really into church I go regularly. You know, I would tend to special masses and now

104
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:22.470
Christina haro: It didn't, you know, it had been a while since I've gone. I just like kind of lead myself away from there and I have to buy myself back

105
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So because of the

106
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Strength. Is there a way you mean you're watching some religious channels.

107
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, what's another way that you can still feel close and connected is having, having to physically attend special masses.

108
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.650
Christina haro: Well, I do a lot of reading. So, I bet about reading the Bible also

109
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:53.730
Christina haro: I used to read a lot. I used to read religious books and stuff. And now you haven't done that in a while.

110
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So made me think about from a

111
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you read at least twice a week. What would that be like even even a half hour. It's really intense reading

112
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.100
Christina haro: Guys think that would be good.

113
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay.

114
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.260
Christina haro: Yeah, I think that would be good, that would that would help me out a lot.

115
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it already by your bedside.

116
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.570
Yes.

117
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Tucked in a drawer.

118
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:26.940
Yes.

119
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's the trick.

120
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.350
Christina haro: Is to get it out. Yes.

121
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe after this

122
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Take the remote control. Maybe in flip positions the remote control goes into tour.

123
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Comes out and you just set it, set up for yourself and say, Hey, I'm just going to do this for a half hour or 20 minutes, whatever. Seems like reasonable to you or you're not going to talk yourself out of it because it's so daunting.

124
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And

125
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Effect on that worrying.

126
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.600
Christina haro: Okay.

127
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you like that idea.

128
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.010
Christina haro: I think that's a good idea.

129
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.720
Okay.

130
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'll just wrote down, we'll see if, if you read it twice a week. See what happens.

131
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. Okay. It's a way to stay connected

132
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.990
See, so

133
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Normal and work and not dependent on drugs. I want to be drug free. Okay. So, on March 2 in discussing tapering down, hoping that I am more myself. I hope I am more normal that's kind of how you had worded it

134
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

135
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.330
Let's see.

136
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a tricky one because I I don't know what normal is not sure is different for everybody.

137
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Hope at that I'm more myself more myself maybe we could explore that a little bit.

138
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me more about cuz you use yeah this were normal I've heard you use that before a couple of times in the goal. And then here in March, March 2 I hope I am more normal hope than I am more myself.

139
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.030
Christina haro: Oh, good.

140
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like you're most the authentic self. Then I don't know if we're saying the same thing but I tend to divide right the addict from the authentic self or the attics that one that

141
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of wants to escape the one that says, Hey, it's okay if you lie to people steal from people and you don't have to be responsible accountable for your word. You know that kind of

142
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And the authentic self is probably this one that you're talking about earlier about connecting with your spirit with faith.

143
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The love you have for yourself for your children that kind of authentic part of you.

144
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.260
Yeah.

145
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you define normal just, you don't have to answer right away that that's kind of a big question. What

146
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What are some behaviors that would constitute normal

147
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.240
Christina haro: Let him to me. I start, I started looking at

148
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:45.960
Christina haro: My ad itself and my normal self. And, you know, there's a lot of things that I just wasn't doing anymore.

149
00:16:46.650 --> 00:17:06.300
Christina haro: And that was like number one is like making dinner, making dinner and my house was like a big thing because I've made dinner every night. We all sat together and eight, but my ad itself. I was so busy doing other things I didn't even do that anymore. I wasn't even cooking anymore.

150
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.150
Christina haro: So to me, that's one of the things that

151
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:22.350
Christina haro: My kids noticed my kids noticed that I wasn't, I wasn't doing the things that I used to. So, little by little, I'm getting back to that.

152
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So one thing is cooking and sitting down.

153
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.370
Yeah.

154
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's great, in the sense that you can identify a very tangible sign that you're getting back to your authentic self, what you would call your normal self.

155
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And what about what about self talk. That's one thing. Like something anyone can see. Oh mom is cooking. Oh, she's not cooking.

156
00:17:53.730 --> 00:18:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not cooking. She hasn't been cooking regularly for the last couple months. I wonder if she's okay we might be able to look at you and see that that can be a sign.

157
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That an early slip or an early stinking thinking starting to kick in. That could be something some pick up on. Or you might pick up on it too. I wonder why I don't want to

158
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Cook wonder why I don't want to sit with my family. And then you could roll it back and say,

159
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if I'm hiding something. I don't want to talk with people. I'm isolating for some people. That's what that is. So for you, when you think about the self talk that when you go okay attic self versus what you call normal

160
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the difference between the inner voice that you have about yourself about your past. So that inner voice, how, how are they different

161
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.810
Christina haro: How are they different

162
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.370
Christina haro: Um,

163
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.130
Christina haro: I didn't know

164
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.320
Christina haro: my normal self. I

165
00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:03.330
Christina haro: my normal self will talk about doing family stuff my ad itself is like, oh,

166
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:14.430
Christina haro: Oh no, you don't have to, you know, oh, you know, it's okay. Oh, they will notice that time that you evil talk comes out.

167
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And so would you say that

168
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: When you said you got bikes. Tell me more about what you did in order to make that happen.

169
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:39.330
Christina haro: For the kid we had talked about spending time together, me and the kids and we're all like, Well, if we're going to be locked up with the house. What are we supposed to do, you know. So we started picking one

170
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:53.490
Christina haro: And then my son says, Hey, Mom, you know, maybe we should have, you know, pick up the bikes, we have. And then I thought, oh, well, we don't even have them anymore. I pulled my car, I thought I sold them in the yard sale. So then

171
00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:12.390
Christina haro: That was that, and then my son says, Well, maybe we should go buy some let's look around and buy some, he says. So we take the highlights. Like we used to. And I'm like, well, I guess. And then he's got some money. Let's look around. So we did. We bought somebody, and that's what we did.

172
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.420
Christina haro: And it's been fun. I mean, I'm having fun. I'm sore, but I'm having fun.

173
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. Excellent. So when you say doing family stuff it's family. It's walks family walks and you got those bikes. YOU'RE BIKING

174
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And when when you're in the other negative self talk the addict, it's, oh no, they won't notice and right you're not following through with the family time

175
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not pushing it.

176
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to encourage in or push it. Is that right,

177
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:49.920
Yeah.

178
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything else.

179
00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:05.160
Christina haro: No, I just I just noticed you know the addicts, that the little added part of me didn't do a lot of family stuff.

180
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:22.650
Christina haro: I kind of slipped away from that family thing. And now I'm looking back at you know the stuff that went on, especially this last one last year was the hardest part of my ad itself. And I noticed that last year, I didn't do much family stuff.

181
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:30.870
Christina haro: You know, we used to go to movies we used to, you know, go hiking ways to do other things. And that stopped.

182
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.730
Christina haro: So now I'm starting to Little by little, do more family stuff.

183
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What last year. Tell me about some of the things going on. Last year, that made it the worst part of your addiction.

184
00:21:51.120 --> 00:22:01.650
Christina haro: I think that will stress with my older daughter was the worst part of my I was really stressed, you know, it was a daily confrontation with her.

185
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:12.960
Christina haro: You know it wasn't you know we could have a couple of nice days and then all of a sudden, you know, she would just flip it. She was in my face and I didn't even want to come home. Most of the time.

186
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.980
Christina haro: It was hard.

187
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: She was living with you during that time. Is that right,

188
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.050
Christina haro: Yes.

189
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

190
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess it makes me wonder. There's been correct me if I'm wrong, little discussions about Katrina coming back living with you near you, you know,

191
00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it's wise to to be very mindful of your recovery and it puts your recovery in danger if she were to live with you.

192
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:13.590
Christina haro: Oh yeah, that's exactly one of the reasons I just tried to, you know, talk her into staying over there.

193
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:30.180
Christina haro: Are you know I didn't I, me and my son have gotten together and centers, the money, you know, just to help her out and hopefully you know she'll find your way over there. It's, you know, we've talked about it. Me and my son up talk about it from him and Kareena we're really close.

194
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:40.200
Christina haro: You know he's he's 29 she's 30 and there they were really, really close and you know he misses her and he tells me, but you know

195
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:50.190
Christina haro: He got to see the bad side of her which he never did. So he understands what I went through and he tells me it's not a good idea. She comes back and I said, I know.

196
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.230
Christina haro: I think it's the best she stays over there.

197
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Must be nice to have your son also sort of see it i'd i you know your family did not say mean things like, Oh, well, your, what kind of mom would do that. Do you have anyone saying negative is ugly things like that.

198
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:27.210
Christina haro: You know I'm, I'm going to tell you that last year before all this happened. My son was totally on her side.

199
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:34.980
Christina haro: But he had never seen. He had never seen my daughter, you know, blow up or he had never seen that ugly side of her

200
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:45.840
Christina haro: And I'm so happened that we that she she blew up one day and he got to see the ugliness in her

201
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:53.820
Christina haro: You got to see the way she treated me and now he tells me, you know, Mom. He says, I'm sorry. I never knew Kareena was like that.

202
00:24:54.510 --> 00:25:05.490
Christina haro: Because I never saw her life that he says, and he lived in Dallas with her, you know, they live close by. They were always together, but she never she never acted that way with him.

203
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:16.950
Christina haro: So now you know he understands and he tells me you know I wanted help or you know if she can stay over there you go. It's for the best.

204
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.070
Yeah.

205
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got a goal of I want to be happy.

206
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:42.540
Christina haro: everybody's always told me that I always have a smile on my face but you know how that is, you know, sometimes you put a smile on your face and you're not really happy.

207
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:59.010
Christina haro: But I can say I can actually say that, um, this year has turned out a lot better for me and I can actually put a smile on my face and it's for real, you know, I feel, I feel happy.

208
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.640
Christina haro: I've been doing good. I feel good.

209
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Over the last couple weeks. Are you able to tell me, maybe a little situation where you may have been challenged with maybe responding in a habitual way of reacting with anger, but instead you may have caught yourself.

210
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Skills different communication skills. Can you maybe share a story.

211
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.870
Christina haro: Yeah I past two weeks, I think it was probably last week.

212
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:54.150
Christina haro: When I had a little disagreement with my son, my younger one

213
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.350
Christina haro: Because

214
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.570
Christina haro: He's laid out and didn't want

215
00:26:59.520 --> 00:26:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To

216
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.750
Christina haro: End. It's all you know it. Yeah, he's the one that gives me the problems.

217
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:23.520
Christina haro: Because last week I was really angry because he left and I know I asked him when he left at home. Are you coming home and he says, Yeah, I'll be back. But he can come home and online and the whole next day I didn't see him.

218
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:35.010
Christina haro: Calling his friends because I had some numbers. And I finally found him and then when you did get home. I was so upset. I was like,

219
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.890
Christina haro: I think I blew up and I caught myself getting angry.

220
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:57.480
Christina haro: To you into his room. Later on he came out and he told me he was sorry he says, but he says, I'm sorry. He says, but I do remember telling you I wasn't going to come home. And I said, No, you didn't. I come you didn't tell me you weren't coming home. So I was pretty, I was pretty heated

221
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.080
Christina haro: And I caught myself.

222
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:10.080
Christina haro: Remember, you told me to kind of, you know, think about it, when I started getting upset with him.

223
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:26.790
Christina haro: I remember what you told me so I kind of calm down and I just told him you know that he really scared me. I, I tried to come down. I made the best of it afterwards. The nephew went to his room a while later, he told me he was sorry

224
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But same behavior still there.

225
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not quite correct. Yeah, it was still going on. He still goes out and

226
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether he told you, or he didn't tell you

227
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Now is that is that is your county okay with that. Is it okay that people call out

228
00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:09.930
Christina haro: Um, well that was last week. So I think the new rule now is there's a curfew. Now, I think it's after six, you're not supposed to be out anymore. So that's changed in the last few days.

229
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.190
Christina haro: He hasn't gone anywhere.

230
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.510
Christina haro: Because he knows he can. So that's the only reason now he's home.

231
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.420
Christina haro: Which makes me

232
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

233
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we say, you know, your goal is, I want to be happy and not bring baggage. Now, the way I had worded something for you to work on was

234
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Play will increase window of tolerance for somatic emotional and cognitive integration. So in other words, being able to sit with your body having tense muscles muscles having some activity.

235
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably. Right. Well, you tell me what was the thought that you happen to you. You're saying wasn't home.

236
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: son wasn't home he still not all me still not home. It's not hot.

237
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.730
Christina haro: Stove I was getting what I can see that I was angry.

238
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:15.750
So,

239
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's an emotion. What were you thinking, thinking,

240
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.980
Christina haro: I, oh, I was thinking the worst. I was thinking the worst.

241
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:28.170
Christina haro: I was thinking something happened to him.

242
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear it. I was thinking

243
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.710
Christina haro: Something happened to him. I was thinking that

244
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:46.320
Christina haro: I didn't know I was doing. I was just thinking that he was lying dead somewhere. That's how I felt. Because he's had a lot of friends lately that have gotten killed shot.

245
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.580
Christina haro: And it scares me. It's currently

246
00:30:51.630 --> 00:31:04.200
Christina haro: overdoses. You know, he's had a few friends that have died and he's been to funerals and it scares me not to say that my son's doing stuff because we talked about it and I know he hasn't but it still scares me.

247
00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I got it.

248
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.340
Give me just a second.

249
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:21.690
Christina haro: Okay.

250
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: A pretty good amount of time here. Why don't we, if you're open to it, share a little bit I'm

251
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Continuing to add to the subjective unit of distress thermometer.

252
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of add more items to it kind of learn more about some of your stories and get a sense of where they fall on distress and a couple of them. So far what we have

253
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: From zero to 100 about about 10 of his, you know, I tell my son on to wash the dishes and throw throw in the trash and get upset a little mad scolding years I used to get, I'm assuming, years ago, I used to get really mad and upset. I will just do it myself.

254
00:33:52.440 --> 00:34:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Much higher on the scale is about a 60 also around fun and this is would want to go out and does not tell me where he's going. I get upset and afraid that something bad will happen to him, but not to the point where I below.

255
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So the stomach feels flutters and the heart pounding.

256
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If he stays calm your thoughts are on going to have a good night and not full of stress and worry if he stays home and watches a movie with me. It feels great for safe and we're together and I feel happy and that he wants to be near you.

257
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And the thought is, I'm a good mother.

258
00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:44.970
Christina haro: Yeah, I remember that.

259
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Just thinking about it. Now as I bring bring us back to that memory. What do you notice about yourself.

260
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.260
Christina haro: I I've noticed that

261
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:12.510
Christina haro: Now when I get upset. I kind of caught myself with like sometimes I catch myself before I blow a and I tried to just read and

262
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:14.790
Christina haro: Kind of

263
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:35.700
Christina haro: A writer you word things differently than I would before and then like this last time when I blew up. I was, I think this last time that I blew up. It's because I was scared. You know, that was not that angry side of me. It was more the scared side of me.

264
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:52.140
Christina haro: But now that he may be mad like lately. I can't believe stays made me that angry or maybe it's because I've learned to deal with it differently. So I can more or less happy another level. Instead of blowing up.

265
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And if he were here.

266
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:55.950
What

267
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: He thinks that he would describe it the same way. Would he say if you were in a room right now. Well, what would he

268
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: How he described

269
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: How you're different.

270
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:14.370
Christina haro: Probably

271
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.060
Christina haro: Yell at him like they used to.

272
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.050
Christina haro: Okay, because he has told me that

273
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.450
Christina haro: He says he told me one day blame mom, he says you've calmed down a lot.

274
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

275
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.650
Christina haro: It feels good. It feels good.

276
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:47.190
Christina haro: It feels good. He tells me it tells me that counseling must be doing something for you. He says, Because you seem a lot calmer than you did.

277
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.040
Good.

278
00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just see earlier on I had done an inventory with you and you were feeling quite extreme experiences of jumpy and easily startled.

279
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that continuing to be an extremely frequent thing where you're jumpy and easily startled.

280
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:29.790
Christina haro: No, actually I've been really, no. I think this last maybe month

281
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.530
Christina haro: I've noticed a big change in me to where I don't feel

282
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.880
Christina haro: I don't feel too much anxiety anymore i'm i'm a little calmer.

283
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:47.580
Christina haro: But I don't know because I have everybody here. You know, I have my voice.

284
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.640
Christina haro: Hear me, isn't that bad because we're all here and that will have to worry about them being out or

285
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: jumpy. Give me an example of when you use

286
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Or easily startled.

287
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.010
Christina haro: Hmm, um,

288
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.870
Christina haro: I think I would go really, really.

289
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:24.990
Christina haro: Like

290
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:43.500
Christina haro: Like when my it was. It's weird. It was weird even like say a couple of months ago, I could say that I could be watching TV in the living room and you know my son's get home and they know they're coming home. But yeah, it

291
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.280
Christina haro: Was really dumb. It was like

292
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.530
Christina haro: I didn't know it was like an anxious feeling like

293
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.720
Christina haro: I don't, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it to you. It was weird.

294
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You just did. So let's take that for a second.

295
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember

296
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body when even though you're expecting them home but hearing the door open gives you an anxious feeling. Where do you feel that in your body.

297
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.570
Christina haro: Like in my stomach.

298
00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.160
Mm hmm.

299
00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.610
Christina haro: Like I'm scared of something

300
00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:34.380
Now,

301
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: How does the stomach feel again. What's it like, see if you can describe it. What's it doing in there in the stomach.

302
00:39:53.910 --> 00:40:01.830
Christina haro: Because like that feeling the roller coaster where it's going up and down. You know, like the lottery filling up and down.

303
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, funny feeling up and down.

304
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Do you know how far back that goes are the most intense time you had that feeling.

305
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:37.050
Christina haro: I think that goes back to when I was first when I my first husband Kareena and Martinez father and he used to be abused me a lot, and I think

306
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:49.530
Christina haro: It kind of takes me back to those days when he used to come home from work. I was always scared when he come home and open the door. I never knew it. What kind of mood. He was or

307
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.140
Christina haro: I was afraid.

308
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What level of distrust. Would you say that was that back then.

309
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:11.730
Christina haro: That

310
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.870
Christina haro: Yeah, that was up to like maybe 90

311
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.790
Christina haro: Or even more. It was the worst.

312
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You give me a number. We've got 90 all the way to 100 the one with 100 you can put it, whatever, like

313
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.340
Christina haro: I like 9595

314
00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's the ex husband.

315
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That knowing that when he gets home. You don't know whether he's going to be abusive, there's this anxiety, the stomach has this roller coaster feeling. And so now the the current trigger is you'll just hear the door or even the handle. Is that what's happening.

316
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:54.930
Yeah.

317
00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then you get that same fluttery roller coaster filling up and down filling in the stomach.

318
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:04.260
Yeah.

319
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stay there for a moment. See if we can have a little targeting this one. Maybe we can do DM Dr. Next time with this this event so that you don't get activated with the door.

320
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, we want to be mindful of it, but we want to be in a in a relaxed vigilance, not, not so activated. So it says fear response. So let me ask you something back then. Remember, these are the harder ones to get to

321
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Are the thoughts, the beliefs about the self, this is this is a challenge to just kind of go with it. Now keep guiding and steering and bringing us back so we can find the belief about the self. So just for a moment, to the degree that you can tolerate

322
00:42:51.360 --> 00:43:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not even all the way back to ex husband, maybe just to to reason with with your boys as they're starting to open the door.

323
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Check and see

324
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can catch

325
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What the underlying thoughts are right then.

326
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Truth, the sound. They're opening the door. Do you know what the first thought is,

327
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:33.420
Christina haro: For some reason, my first thought is, I wonder who's coming in and I know

328
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:41.130
Christina haro: But it's like my mind just wonders, who's coming in. I mean, I know what's coming home.

329
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. OK.

330
00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Will do. I can do all that analysis for you. You're doing great, that's a super comment because it's I wonder who's coming in now.

331
00:43:53.340 --> 00:44:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to that stay there with them go through it again bring that up into your working memory. You just thought it. I can hear the sound and I wonder who is coming in.

332
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Now see if you can identify what you believe about yourself in that moment. These are the most difficult to get to. So being patient with it and you might find it in the I Am. I Am.

333
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about yourself. I believe about myself. What I am

334
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing that comes to mind.

335
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:33.600
Christina haro: You know, like

336
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:46.740
Christina haro: I'm worried I I'm scared. It's going to be somebody else. They don't know. That's how I feel. I feel like it's going to be somebody else.

337
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you believe about you, if it's somebody else.

338
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.770
Christina haro: I believe I'm scared I'm scared.

339
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you stay scared. What do you, what do you believe will happen.

340
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:05.160
I

341
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.560
Christina haro: Don't know.

342
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's somebody else. What do you believe

343
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.590
Christina haro: Will happen that something bad will happen to me.

344
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about you. Something bad's going to happen to you.

345
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.040
Christina haro: That I'm going to get beat up.

346
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:36.720
Christina haro: Great.

347
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:50.850
Christina haro: And actually I did have somebody walk into my house. One time, this was a while back I was sitting in the living room watching TV, and I thought it was my son walking in and all sudden it was a weird guy. He just walked into my house.

348
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's terrifying.

349
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.770
Christina haro: But not getting what

350
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.380
Christina haro: You are seeing. And he was looking at me and I looked at my said, What are you doing,

351
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:14.160
Christina haro: He looked. No, he just looked at me and he wouldn't say anything. And I told him to get out and it was weird because my son was had just walked into the bathroom with this down the hall and

352
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:21.960
Christina haro: I got scared and I ended up going to the kitchen to get a knife and when I came out he ran

353
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:37.530
Christina haro: Then, and then he tells me. Who are you talking to, I said this weird guy walked into the house and then he tells me, let me go see and he ran out and he saw him, but he wasn't able to catch up to him that I was already running down the street.

354
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:42.690
Christina haro: So I think that's when it's one of the things

355
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:49.110
Christina haro: And if I would have been alone that day. I could have done better rate.

356
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.300
Christina haro: And my door wasn't locked, so I've learned my lesson about that one.

357
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And how's your body feeling right now.

358
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:10.050
Christina haro: I'm just thinking a heart starts pounding in my chest.

359
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.920
Christina haro: I start to get a little anxious

360
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're okay, you're okay now.

361
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:27.630
I'm

362
00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Batman didn't hurt you. You okay

363
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:41.580
Christina haro: Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, he did it. He did. I don't think he had a chance to you, but I think he heard my son in the bathroom and that's why he ran

364
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about yourself, see if we can find them. The

365
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely

366
00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:00.690
Christina haro: I can see I'm

367
00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.510
Christina haro: I worry I worry

368
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:08.430
Christina haro: I worry because I always think

369
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:16.860
Christina haro: That if I were to be in that situation. Again, I don't know if I freeze. I'd be able to defend myself.

370
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:30.990
Christina haro: And the reason is because I look back at when I was with my ex husband and the whole time that he beat me and beat me. I never defended myself.

371
00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:43.890
Christina haro: And yet, now I feel like if I were to be in a situation and even if it was a complete stranger. I don't know if I would freeze or I don't know how to defend myself. I don't know.

372
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember it all when

373
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's review when that stranger walked in the house. You and I don't know what he wanted. We don't know his intent.

374
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But you spoke Christina you demanded that he leave your house, you asked him a question. Were you in my house for you, demanded that you leave, I believe.

375
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:28.500
Christina haro: Mm hmm.

376
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you walked

377
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Over to the kitchen and you pulled out a knife.

378
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see you did not freeze.

379
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.840
Christina haro: I didn't, I didn't freeze know you

380
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Moved you protected the self. You were in motion.

381
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:53.070
Okay.

382
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Check how the hearts doing check. How you doing right now.

383
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: As you're aware that you actually were in motion, and you did there was no freezing. There was instinct and you were in motion.

384
00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that

385
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:15.210
Yeah.

386
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe

387
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.050
Christina haro: I'm stronger now than what I was going

388
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: To different perspective, isn't it.

389
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of maybe. Yeah, you've actually stood up freezing

390
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's also this

391
00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: immobility, that can happen. I think that might be what you're talking about is all freeze and I will move and I won't defend myself, but you didn't you stood up. Not only did you stand up, but you used words and you said, Get out of my house.

392
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.730
So,

393
00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You you instinctively did protect yourself.

394
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you to remember that part of it.

395
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:14.910
Christina haro: Okay, yeah.

396
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I did you are there for you. And in some really odd sort of small way, maybe that was an opportunity for us right now to say, you know what

397
00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Then before and now you'll recognize it when someone is even approaching you, that's not healthy. You will say no.

398
00:51:43.080 --> 00:52:00.120
