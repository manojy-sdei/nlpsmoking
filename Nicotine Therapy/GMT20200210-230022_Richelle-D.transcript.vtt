Richelle Direny: Did you check in through virtual cancer or you just came straight to the

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.960

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.420
Brock Simmons: I've tried nobody picks up for me. I had an appointment earlier today at 1130 and

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.680
Brock Simmons: What Dr. Austin, I believe group.

14
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:06.330
Brock Simmons: And I couldn't get nobody to pick up and then I tried to counsel, Danny. Like you just said, and I can't get nobody to pick up their needs are so

15
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:16.830
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right. Don't worry, I'm gonna let them know that you log in and I'm also going to let them know that you do, you said you tried to login so you didn't get to meet with Miss. Miss Austin today.

16
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:27.090
Brock Simmons: Oh no, actually they reschedule like every half hour, but every time me and my wife will try to get on it, but for some reason of what go through. So I'm not for sure what

17
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.850
Brock Simmons: The deal is. But, okay, hold on. They shouldn't see that I tried. Right. I mean, when they're in, they should be able to see

18
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.160
Brock Simmons: Me, trying to get into that room, right, or whatever it is meeting room.

19
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.680
Richelle Direny: Okay, hold on, let me let me let them know

20
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.940
Alright.

21
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.760
Brock Simmons: So I'm supposed to check in with her before I come to your meeting room. Is that how supposed to go.

22
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:11.340
Richelle Direny: Well, yes, it's because I will put in that you checked in. But typically, when you come to meet with whether it's myself, Miss Austin for group or group you check in with them so that they know that you came for your, your schedule a session.

23
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.600
Richelle Direny: And they put us checked in. I will check you in. Um, but I think they want to because like even like you see how I schedule your appointment with you.

24
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.500
Brock Simmons: Right.

25
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.380
Richelle Direny: I know that they told me that they want it to kind of, it's kind of like a doctor's office. You don't schedule direct you don't go straight to the doctor without checking in at the front.

26
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.320
Richelle Direny: Gotcha. Like right now. What you did was sneak past the front desk right into the therapist.

27
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:47.220
Brock Simmons: Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, but some reason they haven't picked up all day. So I'm not sure what's going on. Hopefully I have the right meeting ID number.

28
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.980
Richelle Direny: One for virtual counter

29
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.210
Brock Simmons: Yeah yeah

30
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:06.240
Brock Simmons: So you had texted me last week. See what happened was I was at another doctor's appointment for hepatitis and the lady CALL ME WANT ME TO DO A

31
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:21.300
Brock Simmons: Group with Mr. Austin right then and there, because somebody had called off, but I couldn't do it because I was at the doctor's office so they postponed it till today at 1130 so I'm not sure what's going on, but

32
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.720
Brock Simmons: I gotta get used to this whole thing and then we'll be okay. It's just different. Yeah.

33
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.980
Richelle Direny: You're I think you're the one that said like, this is the first time for you right

34
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.660
Richelle Direny: Right, yeah. Somebody else said this is like a first time. So they're getting used to live.

35
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.740
Brock Simmons: I love it because I get to stay at home, and it's convenient, but at the same time, it's kind of frustrating sometimes it's like, man.

36
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.480
Richelle Direny: You know if

37
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:56.730
Richelle Direny: you're ever having issues on I know sometimes like there's some, some of my patients if they're ever having issues. I'm like, getting to the provider or whatever the situation is to shoot me an email.

38
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.910
Richelle Direny: My emails I get throughout the day.

39
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.080

Richelle Direny: I think they should

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.900
Richelle Direny: They should change the American law, like a lot of those other countries where they get

47
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.940
Richelle Direny: I think they only have like four day week or four day work week or something like that.

48
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.410

Brock Simmons: I know you told me at the end of our session last week that they will be contacted me with that information.

56
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.780

62
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.290
Richelle Direny: That I won't be able to run the group this Thursday. So I might just go ahead and cancel it.

63
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:39.900
Richelle Direny: Because I'm not sure it was Austin will be there, but I'm going to put in that this Thursday group is going to, I was trying to find a way to see how I can say, neglect, but I don't think I can.

Richelle Direny: But then it's not for the groups for system specifically for the group's the same login room that you use to log in with me for individuals is will not be the same login so you would have to check in.

77
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:04.920
Richelle Direny: Through virtual counselor in order to to get the group ID, because the group ID for groups are always different.

78
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.040
Brock Simmons: Okay, do you have that meeting number by chance, just to double check and make sure I got the right one.

79
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.490
Richelle Direny: I sent them a message. So I'm waiting for them to respond.

Brock Simmons: Try to attend know she was just trying to help me out because she watched it tutorial on the zoom app thing when I first got it.

85
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:14.610
Brock Simmons: I was sleeping. Can I work those shifts, so I should have watched it myself. That way I would have been better prepared for it, but she was just trying to get me logged in with that.

86
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:25.620
Brock Simmons: Secretary part, but I had no luck. And then I had no luck it neither. It's like it would come on and then it would say, connect with

87
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:38.010
Brock Simmons: Internet or something like that. And I would just sit there with a blank black screen. So I'm not for sure what was going on, but they should be able to see that I tried to login several times.

88
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.580
Richelle Direny: No, she did say that

89
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.250

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.030
Brock Simmons: Gotcha. Yeah.

104
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:54.690
Richelle Direny: I have like a 15 minute rule after 15 minutes your session is cancelled, kind of like when you go to the doctor's office, you kind of have that 15 minute rule because what happens is that you cut into the next person session.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.470
Brock Simmons: Either

130
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:10.380
Brock Simmons: Yeah. All I need is that number. Now, if they do respond back to me, though I should be good to go.

131
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.130
Brock Simmons: I'm not mistaken. I haven't tried Miss Austin's

132
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.060
Brock Simmons: Personal number two, but I had no luck.

133
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.530
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I think.

134
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.270
Brock Simmons: So,

135
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.420
Brock Simmons: My. Another question is,

136
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:58.770
Brock Simmons: Your analysis. Now, when I first started when I first signed up, she was telling me about, I would have to take our them just random just come as you guys please, or do I have to go every so often to take a drug test.

137
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.920
Richelle Direny: And you know what I want to say, I don't think it's random. I don't believe random. I think they send it to you.

138
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.090
Do

139
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:07.980
Richelle Direny: That

140
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.840
Brock Simmons: I was just curious about that too. That way I'm just prepared for

141
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.440
Brock Simmons: My work schedule. That's all.

142
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.930
Richelle Direny: Do you do, do you do they send you a copy you doing and you send it in, or do you actually go

143
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.310
Brock Simmons: I'm not for sure that that's what really what I always ask

144
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.540
Richelle Direny: The first time.

145
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:31.740
Brock Simmons: What's that

146
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.690
Richelle Direny: Why did you do it the first time.

147
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.720
Brock Simmons: I believe is the labs.

148
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.290
Richelle Direny: Yeah, they will send you the instructions.

149
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.920
Richelle Direny: I have you for

150
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.730
Richelle Direny: The 17th. I have a pretty long.

151
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.800
Richelle Direny: For you worrying about right.

152
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:13.920
Brock Simmons: Yeah, I was just curious to how it works. When it was going to the friend of mine that referred me to you guys said that

153
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:21.930
Brock Simmons: They're random just whenever the doctor decides, and then I heard from her husband, it's

154
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.350
Brock Simmons: Like you said it, they'll mail you something in the mail.

155
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.480
Brock Simmons: So it's

156
00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.980
Richelle Direny: Someone who's already in Barnhart referred you

157
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:48.120
Brock Simmons: Yeah Yeah buddy of mine referred me to you guys is just a pain in the butt. Want to the doctor's appointments twice a week. I mean, counseling and then work in, it's just, it's a lot so I never went. I was buying them off the street.

158
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.500
Brock Simmons: That neither

159
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.960
Richelle Direny: Yeah, to answer as to exactly how they do it.

160
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.940
Richelle Direny: I'd be lying to you. I want to say it was once a month, but I'm not

161
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.500
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I know

162
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.770
Richelle Direny: He talks about. Now you said you've never been in a program before right look

163
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:43.200
Richelle Direny: They just sent me the number is 408-486-4762

164
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.150
Brock Simmons: Yeah, that's the number I have. I'm not for sure what's going on.

165
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.610
Brock Simmons: Hopefully,

166
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:57.210
Brock Simmons: I don't have something in my settings messed up to where it's not going to, but

167
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:13.470
Brock Simmons: Because the last week, it went. And it was like a white screen and it said waiting for Brian OUR HOUSE WAS A was a well this today. It was just black and it had like a white figure like a head on it. And that was, it wasn't like the waiting room that I used to wait.

168
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.330
I don't know if that

169
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.170
Brock Simmons: But what was your question as I ever. I was never in any treatment.

170
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:28.410
Richelle Direny: Okay, you said you went for a month with the time you only one for a month of the top from heroin. Right.

171
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:37.650
Brock Simmons: Yes, heroin and cocaine. It was yeah hello one just one. I never worked for

172
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.920
Richelle Direny: And then you had used to go to weekly counseling.

173
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.390
Brock Simmons: Yeah.

174
00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.150
Richelle Direny: And that you did that for five for five months.

175
00:17:52.620 --> 00:18:01.380
Brock Simmons: Well, yeah, five months at one time and then a year. The other time. A couple times I've been in treatment. Like I said, for

176
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.630
Brock Simmons: Quite a long time, often or do good and then I end up falling off.

177
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.080
Brock Simmons: Just here to Mansfield, Ohio. They want to do three days a week, three hours a day.

178
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.680
Brock Simmons: For 90 days and then two days a week.

179
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.020
Brock Simmons: Two hours a day, which I mean that's just a lot on top of work in and all my other appointments is like, wow.

180
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:47.490
Richelle Direny: And we have talked about, because I'm looking through and we did our initial because I know usually the first session we'll kind of pick apart as to

181
00:18:48.720 --> 00:19:06.870
Richelle Direny: What would you like to work on, like, what is your goal. And then we start, you know, kind of, to develop your treatment plan and then we'll start working on what your desired goal is what you would like to work on, like, when it comes down to individual therapy.

182
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.750
Richelle Direny: And I think we i don't know if i i can't remember if we had spoke about it a little bit that

183
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:28.920
Richelle Direny: Your addiction to anything that matter whether it's heroin so box on it doesn't matter what it is helping, whatever it is, there's always, you know, underlining issue. There's, there's something in terms of

184
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.340
Richelle Direny: Whatever your stressors are what are whatever it is that

185
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:44.820
Richelle Direny: Triggers, whatever your triggers are so triggers could be for you maybe don't necessarily like confrontation.

186
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:54.450
Richelle Direny: And maybe you're you and your wife had a disagreement of some sort and that triggered something and you lost sense of control and no

187
00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:04.140
Richelle Direny: Not really knowing how to cope with it and deal with it. And so how you handle that is you take a suppressing whatever it is that kind of calms you down, kind of, you know,

188
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:16.140
Richelle Direny: Something it and what triggered my thoughts just now is when I saw that the cigarettes. For some people, that it helps to calm them down from anxiety.

189
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.450
Richelle Direny: Anxiety.

190
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:32.130
Richelle Direny: Or stress or whether they are overwhelmed with that's one of the things I remember when I was younger, how you spell out. I'm not necessarily, not necessarily. I'm not a smoker, but I used to work with someone back. I mean,

191
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.180
Richelle Direny: every hour on the hour. She was going out to take a small

192
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:42.630
Richelle Direny: And I thought, okay, you know, every job gives you a legitimate 15 minutes what you know what I'm gonna do the invisible thing.

193
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:56.250
Richelle Direny: Right but but for her, you know, going out what each time I would take a break with her while she smoked, it's just getting understanding for her. The

194
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:03.060
Richelle Direny: The smoking was a relief from the stress of

195
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.680
Brock Simmons: The job yeah

196
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:15.000
Richelle Direny: The demand that they expected from you. On top of that, there were other stressors in her life. There were other overwhelming things that was going on in her life.

197
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:40.440
Richelle Direny: And the act of smoking was only to calm her down. Was it that I love cigarettes and it's so scrumptious. And it's yummy. And I know but the act of smoking. It's a it was a way for her to calm down and match to that same concept. It could be by anything. Anytime you know any

198
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:47.790
Brock Simmons: Lot of smokers that does apply, but a lot of smokers when they get nervous or something they want to fire up that's just

199
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:49.950
Brock Simmons: That's it.

200
00:21:50.640 --> 00:22:04.170
Richelle Direny: That's it. That's what it is. So some, you know, one. What is it that I have an addictive personality, if such as the case, then I think everyone, to some degree, have some degree if we're going to follow that.

201
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:10.050
Richelle Direny: Thought process of, well, maybe I just have an addictive personality. Well then, I guess, all of us.

202
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.190
Brock Simmons: Have some

203
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:20.520
Richelle Direny: addictive personality, because all of us. If you're human. We have things that are overwhelming and that are stressors.

204
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.030
Richelle Direny: Just have a better

205
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:26.130
Brock Simmons: Chance

206
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:41.730
Richelle Direny: Of coping with the stressors. Others have maybe grown life has not gotten a hand or grasp on how to deal with certain stressors.

207
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.200
Richelle Direny: In the reason why they use

208
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:51.330
Richelle Direny: Other stimulants, or you know depressants, whatever it is.

209
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.200
Richelle Direny: Whatever their issues are

210
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.460
Brock Simmons: And so

211
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.840
Richelle Direny: What I like to do, especially in our first session is talk about

212
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:10.110
Richelle Direny: A deeper look at what is it that you would like to work on during your time in therapy.

213
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.160
Richelle Direny: What comes to mind for you. What are some

214
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:22.410
Richelle Direny: I want to say the word stronghold. But what are some things that you can think of that.

215
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.150
Richelle Direny: kind of brings you to the edge. I'm a real

216
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.050
Brock Simmons: Time attendance usually a death in the family or something like that is what

217
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.380
Brock Simmons: Causes relapse. I know the past two relapses that's what is caused it. So,

218
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:53.190
Brock Simmons: I don't know if you get that like cooking skills. I can work on my coping skills and learn how to accept things and acceptance is a big thing for me.

219
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.910
Brock Simmons: To accept things that I have no control over.

220
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.970
Brock Simmons: I don't know, it's just really tough for me.

221
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.830
Brock Simmons: Like set in my ways. My wife tells me I've set my own ways and

222
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:13.800
Brock Simmons: Uncomfortable. And it's just uncomfortable to be outside the box. So

223
00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:15.870
Brock Simmons: Can you hear me.

224
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.550
Richelle Direny: I heard you when you your name popped up. I was hearing. I think you

225
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.250
Brock Simmons: Had somebody call, of course, but

226
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:33.120
Brock Simmons: Yeah, it's acceptance is a big thing for me. I don't know if that's what you're getting at is that what she was wanting to know some things to work on.

227
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:36.660
Brock Simmons: Now,

228
00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:42.300
Richelle Direny: When you think about so and death is something that's fruit for you the most.

229
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:44.610
Brock Simmons: Right.

230
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.650
Richelle Direny: When you look at

231
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:57.150
Richelle Direny: Acceptance is one thing that you would like to learning how to accept the things that you cannot control.

232
00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.380
Right.

233
00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:03.450
Richelle Direny: And what I think that's, that's one of the

234
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:05.730
Richelle Direny: The steps.

235
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.640
Richelle Direny: That one of the steps.

236
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.890
Brock Simmons: What are the, what

237
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.670
Richelle Direny: In that one of the facts or that's a part of the Serenity Prayer.

238
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.170
Richelle Direny: Not how

239
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:23.460
Brock Simmons: The Serenity Prayer, and I believe it is one of the steps as well. I think you're right on both of them.

240
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.810
Brock Simmons: I never was big into in a lot of that I never got into the steps, but I've heard them enough

241
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.710
Richelle Direny: I've heard him enough, but that is one of the something that is a part of the Serenity Prayer, but I think that's just

242
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:51.240
Richelle Direny: One of the rules of life. It's learning how to and we all have a very hard time and that's what you know kind of starts the downward spiral to one.

243
00:25:52.440 --> 00:26:02.250
Richelle Direny: Bad decision after the other, overall, it's because we struggle with learning how to accept the things we can control.

244
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.010
Brock Simmons: no control over.

245
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.580
Richelle Direny: That is just, it's just naturally is very hard for us. So, but for you.

246
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:14.070
Richelle Direny: About

247
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.900
Richelle Direny: Whether it's

248
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.710
Richelle Direny: Looking at your own personal history.

249
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.960
Richelle Direny: What are some things that

250
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.190
Richelle Direny: You can say for you.

251
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:35.760
Richelle Direny: That is a true like what's a big trigger point for you outside of the loss of a loved one or friend or what have you.

252
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:47.970
Brock Simmons: Biggest trigger is old friends. I know I run into a lot of friends and it's just always been bad news.

253
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:58.710
Richelle Direny: What about draw you draw you back in kind of rules you back. And what about them. What do you identify event that kind of brings you back into their company.

254
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.450
Brock Simmons: How do I identify them.

255
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:12.510
Richelle Direny: Know what is it that you identify with that person. What can you identify with that person that kind of brings you back to that.

256
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.380
Negative

257
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.550
Brock Simmons: Um, it's just, I don't know.

258
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.300
Brock Simmons: I don't know really how to explain it. It's

259
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:29.580
Brock Simmons: Kind of like two minds work together and you know what I mean we just get together and we just talked about old times, and then

260
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:46.590
Brock Simmons: One thing leads to another and sure not and it might not that day. It might take a couple days. It might take a week. But eventually, the more I keep meeting with them, you know, eventually end up doing things that I'm not supposed to. So, hmm.

261
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.910
Brock Simmons: I don't know, it's

262
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.490
Brock Simmons: It's tough. I don't know.

263
00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:57.870
Richelle Direny: Okay, so

264
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:10.320
Richelle Direny: The one thing that you talked about is learning how to accept the things you cannot control what is something else that if you you could identify right now. The three top things

265
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:11.610
Brock Simmons: I

266
00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.230
Richelle Direny: Want to work on.

267
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.940
Brock Simmons: It has to do with the acceptance part

268
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.430
Richelle Direny: No, just any. It doesn't have to do

269
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.380
Brock Simmons: Oh, you're talking about just like a small goals, pretty much.

270
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.470
Brock Simmons: Or just anything in general.

271
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.190
Anything.

272
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:48.210
Brock Simmons: To be honest, I've been taking Suboxone for a long time, I would like to taper off eventually. I don't know if that's one that you would consider it as the three but another is to start a better relationship with my son because he's actually

273
00:28:50.190 --> 00:29:03.870
Brock Simmons: I don't want to say fact, but he's homosexual or whatever and that it's hard for me to accept that. So I would like to better my relationship with him instead of harping all the time and giving him a hard time and

274
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.890
Brock Simmons: It's definitely something I gotta learn to do was

275
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.800
Brock Simmons: Try to work on. That's really

276
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.950
Richelle Direny: Identifies with

277
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.710
Things, same sex, religion,

278
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.690
Brock Simmons: Right, yeah.

279
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.390
Richelle Direny: So for you, what particular

280
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:23.460
That

281
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:33.540
Richelle Direny: Is troubling for you because you got you. It's working on picking that part. Um, what about that is troubling for you.

282
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.930
Brock Simmons: Every all of it, really. I mean, I don't know, like, I don't know if it's because I wasn't raised like

283
00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:54.000
Brock Simmons: It's just very disturbing. I just don't understand how that's my first born. So I, I just expect more out of him. I wanted a football player baseball player here I end up with

284
00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.740
Brock Simmons: It's just

285
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.670
Richelle Direny: With a person who is not interested in anything that you're interested in.

286
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:06.180
Brock Simmons: No, not at all, no context for us, no nothing. He's very feminine. He's just

287
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:18.660
Brock Simmons: Just very disappointing to me. I just was never raised like that I was taught that you know girls or boys take girls and real estate boys and that's just how it is.

288
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:29.610
Brock Simmons: But it's sad because I have friends that okay and I will talk to them and be all right with them, but I turned around to him, and it's totally different. I'm not saying

289
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.970
Richelle Direny: You use the word there was a word that you use.

290
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.550
Brock Simmons: Right. No, yeah, my wife's thinking

291
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.750
Richelle Direny: What was the word that you know

292
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.900
Richelle Direny: There was a word that you use.

293
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.240
Richelle Direny: In how you describe what you were looking for. There was one particular word

294
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:53.820
Brock Simmons: Acceptance.

295
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.510
Richelle Direny: Not even your acceptance your expectations.

296
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.030
Brock Simmons: Or expectations. Right. Yeah.

297
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:08.490
Richelle Direny: This is your child you expected him to be an image that you created

298
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.300
Brock Simmons: In your mouth.

299
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.120
Richelle Direny: And when he did not because

300
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:24.450
Richelle Direny: Outside of the him identifying as homosexual that really wasn't that is one of the things that we struggle with.

301
00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:30.540
Richelle Direny: But that's not the core of necessarily what you're struggling with because you're saying that you're accepting of

302
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:49.770
Richelle Direny: The lifestyle outside of your home because you have friends with everyone outside that identifies as being homosexual. But then when it comes to inside of your home as you would say the fruit of your line your offspring. Someone who directs beers your

303
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.800
Richelle Direny: Image your DNA, everything

304
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.670
Brock Simmons: Right.

305
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.710
You expected

306
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.130
Richelle Direny: Someone who will identify in what you identify with, because if he

307
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:13.770
Richelle Direny: If he didn't identify a homosexual, but he didn't want. He wasn't into sports. He wasn't into anything that you were into you would still have the same

308
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:24.870
Brock Simmons: Right. Yeah. And it's, it was really bad you know to go but it's actually, it's gotten a lot better. I've learned to deal with a lot

309
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:44.730
Brock Simmons: My wife and coach me along because I just, it's hard for me to understand that. I just don't. It's so acceptable nowadays, and then it's just, which I'm okay with it. But like I said, I just expect more from my side. I mean, I don't care what other people do. I don't really go

310
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.520
Brock Simmons: This is something that's really been eat.

311
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.090
Brock Simmons: Well, eat me up, I should say, my wife, except she's, she's been okay with it.

312
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.220
Brock Simmons: So,

313
00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:16.230
Brock Simmons: She's okay with it. Yeah, yeah, they, they, known for a long time. They hit it for me for quite a long time. And I always kind of knew, but then I just, I never wanted to believe it. I was hoping to grow out of that phase. I thought it was just a phase, but

314
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:21.150
Brock Simmons: It's definitely not he's 17 about to be 18 so

315
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.690
Richelle Direny: How long has he identified with me.

316
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.400
Brock Simmons: What's that

317
00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.310
Richelle Direny: How long have you identified with being homosexual.

318
00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.600
Brock Simmons: Oh man, probably since you've been 1112 years old.

319
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:35.400
Brock Simmons: Really old

320
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.770
Richelle Direny: But you're just finding out about it recently.

321
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.910
Brock Simmons: Finally, the last four years.

322
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:58.260
Brock Simmons: So they hit it for me for about three, four years and then I've known about it for four years, but he lived with my mom and dad. My dad was alive. He lived with them for by some time he's only been back with living with me for the past two years.

323
00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:05.700
Brock Simmons: It's been nasty relationship not nasty. I wouldn't say that is

324
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.150
Brock Simmons: We have misunderstandings a lot

325
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.010
Brock Simmons: To learn

326
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:12.840
Richelle Direny: Regardless,

327
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:14.700
Brock Simmons: Of what's

328
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.860
Richelle Direny: Left him regardless

329
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.520
Brock Simmons: Oh yeah, yeah, I love him. I do. I really do love you.

330
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.910
Brock Simmons: It's just, I don't know how to expose

331
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:29.730
Brock Simmons: You know, I just expected so much more. This is actually our birds.

332
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:37.740
Richelle Direny: Outside of the being a sports fan. What, what are some other things that you, what are some of the expectations that you

333
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:53.250
Brock Simmons: Know, just to graduate high school to go to college. That's another she's been really good and wants to go to cosmetology so he's into that right now. So what about

334
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.180
Richelle Direny: Are you are you not the biggest fan of human being.

335
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:16.350
Brock Simmons: I'm okay with it. I mean, he cuts my hair, I want to say they'll say me stuff like that. And this is something I wanted to talk about tonight. I just wanted to tell you about it and get it off my chest.

336
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:24.570
Brock Simmons: And hopefully in the future we can continue to talk about it. I have a bad time about it. I don't know, it's just

337
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.670
Brock Simmons: I'm just going to deal with it. I mean it is what it is. I can't change.

338
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.830
Brock Simmons: I don't want to seem fair the scene, but it's

339
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.600
Brock Simmons: That's just me thinking, oh,

340
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.430
Brock Simmons: You know,

341
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.170
Richelle Direny: It's funny, um,

342
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.660
Richelle Direny: So I don't know.

343
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.840
Richelle Direny: Necessarily what you are

344
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.250
Richelle Direny: Beliefs, particularly are

345
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:07.740
Richelle Direny: But I can give you. Someone a name and you can watch it on YouTube and maybe that can help. I would have to find the particular video that I watched

346
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.700
And it's more

347
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.090
Richelle Direny: How can I put it

348
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:17.070
Richelle Direny: I'm

349
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.550
Richelle Direny: The one, the one person who

350
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.310
Brock Simmons: Gave me

351
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.290
Richelle Direny: And it's something that we can work through

352
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.050
Richelle Direny: And

353
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:34.140
Richelle Direny: Definitely is a goal that you want to work through for you to learn how

354
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:42.690
Richelle Direny: Just to to love your son, and maybe

355
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:51.420
Richelle Direny: Come down to some degree with your expectations or what you have created in your mind of what you're looking for.

356
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.140
Richelle Direny: If that's how

357
00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:06.510
Brock Simmons: And that's it's gotten a lot better since the things that he does and the things that he says it's just very sometimes I lose it immediately just

358
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:12.990
Brock Simmons: I just have to learn that he's gonna like boys and that's just, there's no way around it. I just

359
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:23.760
Brock Simmons: actually tried to tell him not to talk about them things around me and stuff like that because I sleep, most of the day. So, I mean, I'm only up for four hours in the evening before I go to work.

360
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:34.080
Brock Simmons: So just, you don't wait till I leave to talk to mom about all that stuff. I don't want to hear about, you know, being in love with such and such, or what have you guys got more

361
00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.560
Brock Simmons: But it's getting better. I mean,

362
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:53.730
Brock Simmons: Hopefully, I do want to better my relationship because I don't want to get older and regret things. You know, I just have a feeling that's how I'm going to be, I'm going to get older. I'm only doing the things that I didn't be so hateful so need all the time.

363
00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:02.640
Brock Simmons: I don't know. I'm only 35. I don't know. She didn't midlife crisis at 35 but I feel like I'm hitting

364
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:15.060
Richelle Direny: I don't think you're ready to go midlife crisis. I don't you think that maybe because now you're trying to

365
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.450
Richelle Direny: Kind of

366
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:32.850
Richelle Direny: Look at life in handle life without somewhat being UNDER THE INFLUENCE ON EVERYTHING IS KIND OF EVERYTHING IS LIKE YOU WILL with a ton of bricks and you're trying to process all of these feelings and thoughts and not really knowing what to do with it all.

367
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.660
Brock Simmons: That actually, it's what I was saying about coping skills.

368
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.600
Brock Simmons: You know, it's just been so long.

369
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:49.530
Brock Simmons: Skills that I definitely have fresh, because that's what happens. It's just everything comes and then I just don't know how to deal with them.

370
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:59.970
Brock Simmons: Instead of walking away or, you know, going in and listen to music for 20 minutes or something like that. I just snap on me. It just comes out. I'm very blunt

371
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:09.180
Brock Simmons: I am mature on a lot. I do know that it's 510 years ago. I've

372
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:15.540
Brock Simmons: been way worse. But definitely oh my tongue a lot more nowadays and

373
00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.650
Brock Simmons: It's just so acceptable. I mean,

374
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.260
Brock Simmons: I don't know, what do you do

375
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.020
Brock Simmons: I don't know where

376
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:30.150
Richelle Direny: You work through it and I mean I get what you're saying is that for some people.

377
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.910
Richelle Direny: The world tells us

378
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.960
To accept many are you going to accept everything that tells you to accept.

379
00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.310
Richelle Direny: Or are you going to conform to everything. The world has you to conform to

380
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.800
Richelle Direny: Know there's a part of you that says there is a summary right about this one.

381
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.110
Boy Yeah.

382
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.420
Brock Simmons: I don't want kids don't have morals and values and morals just

383
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:03.840
Richelle Direny: Why kids not don't have morals and values. But is it because

384
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:08.580
Richelle Direny: That as parents we never taught them how to

385
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:18.480
Brock Simmons: See, I wasn't into teaching so yeah exactly has a lot to do with the I was incarcerated a lot when he was younger. So

386
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.690
Brock Simmons: My mom and dad raised teams. So yeah, there was never distilled and so your

387
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.210
Richelle Direny: Dad have certain morals and values that they have upheld and taught him.

388
00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:43.740
Brock Simmons: Well, they did with me and my sister, but there's like two grandkids come along and it was just totally I get this technology you have social media. I mean stuff has changed a lot since

389
00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.920
Brock Simmons: So, I mean, hi, sis.

390
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.440
Brock Simmons: Totally different. But what was the video, you're going to leave the

391
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:57.600
Brock Simmons: YouTube video.

392
00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:02.940
Richelle Direny: You to be like I become the YouTube follower type of thing.

393
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.820
Brock Simmons: I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos.

394
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:10.620
Richelle Direny: I don't know why you have checked out the regular TV. I'm watching when there's YouTube

395
00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:23.400
Richelle Direny: Like, that's my new TV. That's my new TV YouTube. Um, but the people who I get to the video. The thing about

396
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:34.590
Richelle Direny: I think that this error in comparison to, you know, like you said back in the 70s at

397
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:50.700
Richelle Direny: Children today have a lot more time given them a whole lot more rights. There's so much free to say and do and think and act and you understand. So it's very hard.

398
00:41:52.680 --> 00:42:06.210
Richelle Direny: This is the struggle, maybe you can tell me if you know I'm wrong on that. But the struggle as a parent is when you talk about instilling

399
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.290
Richelle Direny: morals and values your children.

400
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:14.730
Richelle Direny: You as a parent become the minority.

401
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:27.990
Richelle Direny: The outside world has become the majority, you know, the outside world seems to speak so much louder and give children so much rights.

402
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:45.660
Richelle Direny: And hey, you know, you could do this, you can do that. And so whatever little morals and values. You're trying to instill in them, you're fighting with what the outside world is kind of teaching them. So it's almost like the rug has been pulled from under you as a parent.

403
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.250
Brock Simmons: And so

404
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:56.850
Richelle Direny: You're fighting with how do I get my children to buy into what I'm telling them because I love and care for them more than the world does

405
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.070
Brock Simmons: And how

406
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:06.330
Richelle Direny: Do I contend with what a million people on the outside is telling them in comparison to one person.

407
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.400
Richelle Direny: And so for you. Maybe you struggle with.

408
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:15.090
Richelle Direny: Well, what do I do, I haven't been in his life.

409
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:18.720
Richelle Direny: For a majority of his life. So

410
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.220
Brock Simmons: Yeah, it's just

411
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:32.250
Brock Simmons: We're trying, we're going to get to a regardless, we are getting to it. Like I said, it's gotten a lot better. I just wish.

412
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:45.060
Brock Simmons: I could turn back the hands of time and just do things different. And then therefore amen because it has a lot to do with it. I mean, yeah, no father figure he didn't have somebody to teaching them things so

413
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.030
Brock Simmons: I'm going to accepting for me is, and that's just

414
00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.570
Brock Simmons: how it's gonna be. I mean, I love him. This is

415
00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:02.880
Brock Simmons: Just something I wanted to bring up to you about the whole acceptance thing is is kind of hit the nail right on the head, so

416
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.660
Brock Simmons: You do you have kids, if you don't mind me asking

Brock Simmons: Things is too convenient for people on set to tip your fingers on a big game, whatever you want. Now, it's like, wow.

420
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.950
Richelle Direny: I mean, the thing is with social media. Social media was never originally

Richelle Direny: intended purpose of what what it's used for now the

422
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:57.600
Richelle Direny: People's Voice got so loud that a lot of the barriers have been torn down from social media. So social media was really truly not meant the way or it wasn't

423
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.240
Richelle Direny: intended purpose wasn't

424
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.430
Brock Simmons: Right.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:54.240
Richelle Direny: And you know there is and I'm gonna there is one particular one where she's someone shares for her own story.

435
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.300
Richelle Direny: And what was interesting.

436
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:04.110
Richelle Direny: If a lot that she says is very interesting, actually, and kind of giving you

437
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.840
Richelle Direny: A different perspective.

438
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:10.320
Richelle Direny: On how to

439
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:21.570
Richelle Direny: Not so much acceptance as as much as she speaks as more of it is from a place of love.

440
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:30.030
Richelle Direny: But it is more. Now I am going to tell you it is more from a Christian perspective.

441
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:31.230
Brock Simmons: I love it.

442
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.530
Brock Simmons: It is more from a Christian perspective.

443
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:37.680
Richelle Direny: But it is

444
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:59.610
Richelle Direny: Just when you when you look her up on on YouTube, more look at her story where there is one where she gives her. I'm going to tell you which one I'm going to tell you that the title of the one where she gives her story. And it was quite interesting how

445
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:09.150
Richelle Direny: Was a lot more about how you just love the person and not condemned the person

446
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:23.850
Richelle Direny: She herself was homosexual and identified as being homosexual, for she identified as being homosexual sees. She said, as long as she did not herself at the age of four.

447
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:36.930
Richelle Direny: Now she's no longer she is married with children. Um, but it's just hearing her story and listening to how she shared the story from a Christian perspective.

448
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:48.510
Richelle Direny: And it was just really it was really truly interesting but when you have a spare time, you can listen to it. And, you know, and then we can talk about it.

449
00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.400
Brock Simmons: Okay.

Richelle Direny: Can you hear me.

510
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:27.840
Okay.

511
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.620
Richelle Direny: How do you pronounce your first name.

512
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.770
Letita W: Yes, ma'am.

513
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.960
Richelle Direny: Let's see a Williams. Right.

514
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:47.430
Letita W: That is correct.

515
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:58.290
Richelle Direny: All right, and see my name is Rochelle and I know you checked in a little bit early, so you're checking into do your bio psychosocial right

516
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:01.770
Letita W: I guess I'm just doing whatever they told me to do my help.

517
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:19.290
Richelle Direny: So I know, I know you're a little because they did send me an email. I'm about a week or so ago, and I know you, I guess you were a little bit confused. After you did your initial as to kind of why you had to still cutting go through with the program.

518
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:28.500
Letita W: Wow was good. They just come to go in and do it and get it done and be done with it. So that's what I'm doing. Okay. Okay.

519
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:35.070
Richelle Direny: And that on that there are weekly groups and they tell you whether or not you had to attend the weekly groups.

520
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:41.850
Letita W: They said they would you will let me know or how often I had to do on like a weekly group. So how long

521
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.910
Letita W: They said I will get that information from you.

522
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:50.550
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, the groups, particularly, and are you going to be on Suboxone

523
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.710
Letita W: Was that

524
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:57.690
Richelle Direny: Are you taking any medication. DID YOU MEET WITH NATALIE at all.

525
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.290
Letita W: No, ma'am. No, ma'am. I just supposed to do this video chat be done.

526
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.000
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I'll get on further information because

527
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:32.580
Richelle Direny: For the medical piece of it typically um you meet with a medical provider and then you meet with new therapist and fruit in terms of meeting with me, whether it's weekly every other week monthly every other month that's for therapy, but for

528
00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:41.910
Richelle Direny: Groups is a little bit different groups is if you're under any type of medication management, then you will do that weekly

529
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:56.280
Richelle Direny: But again, that's based on the medical provider. They determine whether or not they feel is best for you to do to do a check in once a month, once a week, or if you're just doing this program just for therapy and all, but

530
00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:56.760
That's

531
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:06.390
Letita W: That's what they informed me, Rochelle. Did I was just doing this for therapy. They said, I won't be on medication on have to go see a provider or nothing. I doodles.

532
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:20.010
Richelle Direny: Well, okay. All right, then. And so at the end of our session today, we will determine if we how often you would meet in if you know if it's once a month or once every other month

533
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:33.150
Richelle Direny: Then that we can have a set schedule for that if you want it for additional supporting you want to check in more often, then that will be up to you, but we will have what we set up at the end. Okay.

534
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:38.310
Letita W: Alright, cool. Alright, one more. Just give me one second. Sure.

535
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.820
Richelle Direny: Okay.

536
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.980
Richelle Direny: How did you hear about what before I go into how'd you hear about the program.

537
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:19.950
Richelle Direny: Just to go over just just housekeeping rules we just

538
00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:23.580
Richelle Direny: Were the one each time that we meet, however.

539
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:37.500
Richelle Direny: Is that this is the platform in which we need, it's always going to be on video chat like this, um, you we just ask that each time that you have. If you're not able to meet for whatever

540
00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:38.100
For me,

541
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:41.760
Letita W: If you could just send me an

542
00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:51.480
Richelle Direny: Email or something. Just saying, hey, Rochelle I have to cancel our session. I won't be able to, because typically I'm like literally sitting here waiting for someone to pop up on my screen.

543
00:57:52.920 --> 00:58:01.590
Richelle Direny: If you don't show up. I'm sitting here for a minute, waiting for someone to pop up on my screen. Um, so that's the first thing. Second thing is that you're always in Wi Fi.

544
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:17.700
Richelle Direny: Just ensure that you have Wi Fi because of everything is over Wi Fi our sessions for the most part are confidential. It is dictated so you know dictated just means that someone does the notes, but overall it's confidential and it is a recorded session.

545
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:31.920
Richelle Direny: And if you voice anything indicating that you are having thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else then at that point you know confidentially kind of moseys on out the door.

546
00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:40.530
Richelle Direny: Um, but outside of that, you know, that's pretty much kind of how I do and we all and I always ask

547
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:53.580
Richelle Direny: And I think the rule for bright heart is that if you are not in a room where it offers some type of privacy, especially if it is a group setting or what have you. We always ask them to wear a headset.

548
00:58:54.660 --> 00:59:02.220
Richelle Direny: Because if anybody else is sharing anything but if we're just meeting for individual then you know it's your information you're sharing

549
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:03.900
Letita W: Away. Cool.

550
00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:04.710
Right.

551
00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.090
Letita W: Right.

552
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:16.290
Richelle Direny: Okay. All right, then. So our time together is just me asking questions, just kind of gathering information. And that's really our session for today. Okay.

553
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:21.150
Richelle Direny: Cool. Um, how did you hear about Bret Hart.

554
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:26.130
Letita W: Um, the my probation officer.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:13.530
Letita W: RJ yeah yeah I said it wasn't gonna benefit me. No way. This is just a waste of my time, you know, but

Richelle Direny: Away from my fun. It's not a waste of my time because the thing is

686
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:03.990
Richelle Direny: I hear what you're saying. You're saying that you have no history. What, substance abuse, you're saying that

687
01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:18.420
Richelle Direny: YC here. But the thing is your, it seems like for a person who has, who drinks twice a year, and for the two times in a year that you've consumed alcohol you've received

688
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.900

Richelle Direny: And I get that, but here it is.

692
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:34.920
Richelle Direny: So in all of this.

693
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:46.290
Richelle Direny: I'm looking at it from the lens of okay well that's pretty harsh punishment to a whole year of probation and saying, going through a treatment program.

694
01:11:46.890 --> 01:12:02.670
Richelle Direny: Right, so then it makes me from a clinical hey I'm therapist from a clinical perspective, or is there more to this. I mean, I know for you right now you're saying that this is just a waste of my time. Um,

695
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.000
But

696
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:11.970
Richelle Direny: You don't have to go through the treatment portion, but there is

697
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.530
Richelle Direny: A side of it.

698
01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:14.820
Letita W: When I

699
01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:34.980
Richelle Direny: Say reputed the clinical side of it, whether you check in once a month or once every other month, it can still benefit you in some way, because in those in those two times that you've done it for the year. You didn't just drink a wine cooler and just say, Okay, I'm done.

700
01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:40.590
Richelle Direny: Here was one maybe after the other, where your judgment was impaired.

701
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.530
Richelle Direny: During this time,

702
01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:58.860
Richelle Direny: And when your judgment. God, he was like, Okay, well you know what, I went to a party. I came home and I was drinking one too many. And I feel I having nobody drive me home was that the situation. What was, what was the events proceeding.

703
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.130
Richelle Direny: You drinking and getting behind the wheel so

704
01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:10.380
Letita W: I just figured, you know, hey, I had, you know, only had about, you know, one, one and a half, you know, drinks. Hey, I'm gonna drive one home.

705
01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:21.390
Letita W: You know, and that's what I did. I just drove one home. But now I know if I'm going to drink or whether if I drink in the future when I do drink, you know, either stay at home or be somewhere safe.

706
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:24.120
Letita W: You know where I don't have to drop

707
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.980
Off.

708
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.900
Richelle Direny: Now with

709
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:49.950
Richelle Direny: No family history of substance abuse, no family history of mental illness. Say you don't have any children. I'm yourself no history of mental illness, no history of substance abuse, know that. Is there any history of suicidal thoughts or homicidal thoughts.

710
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:55.140
Letita W: No, ma'am. I love myself dearly. There will never be no thought to that. Okay.

711
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:55.350
What

712
01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.270
Richelle Direny: Else.

713
01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.880
Letita W: Know, there were never been no thought to that I got a reason to hurt. Nobody else

714
01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:11.160
Richelle Direny: Now, with no history whatsoever. What about family history of suicide or

715
01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:14.550
Letita W: No man. Ain't none of my family never did suicide.

716
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:22.140
Richelle Direny: Now, with no history and you've never taken medications and

717
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.910
Letita W: No man, no man.

718
01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:25.470
Richelle Direny: So,

719
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:31.470
Richelle Direny: The question then comes down to this.

720
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.670
Richelle Direny: You're saying no history of nothing.

721
01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:36.870
No.

722
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.350
Richelle Direny: And you don't eat your opinion when you think about

723
01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:50.670
Richelle Direny: Where you are right now. You do not feel like there is anything

724
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.900
Richelle Direny: Where you would benefit just from individual therapy at all.

725
01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:56.700
Letita W: No man.

726
01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:58.560
Letita W: Nope.

727
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.840
Richelle Direny: And so with your probation officer recommending

728
01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.170
Richelle Direny: Program to do therapy.

729
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:24.630
Richelle Direny: I mean to recommend a program like this to say either you go to jail for 10 days beyond probation for a year or go on house arrest was it

730
01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:28.770
Letita W: That that's what the judge recommended not my probation officer to Jill.

731
01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:29.820
Richelle Direny: Good job.

732
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.420
Yeah.

733
01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:37.350
Letita W: Because you got to do something. When you do a crime, you got to do some to, you know, pay for you gotta do something.

734
01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.760
Letita W: But as being honest, what you gotta do something on a

735
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:44.580
Letita W: Walk scot free, you know,

736
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:47.790
Richelle Direny: I can't hear you, I hear you.

737
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:49.860
But

738
01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:59.850
Richelle Direny: You have three choices in 10 days might seem like a lifetime but 10 days one whole year of being in the program.

739
01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:02.910
Richelle Direny: And a program

740
01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:09.870
Richelle Direny: Like this where you're like, ah, this doesn't benefit me. I only

741
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:10.470
Letita W: Write

742
01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:12.210
Richelle Direny: Your I made a wrong.

743
01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:13.620
Letita W: Decision to say

744
01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.530
Richelle Direny: Way all of your options.

745
01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.430
Richelle Direny: Why not

746
01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:23.700
Richelle Direny: Why not, why not choose the 10 days and put it all behind you and move on with try

747
01:16:24.090 --> 01:16:25.230
Letita W: And get on. No, no.

748
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:36.420
Letita W: No, no, you can't. You couldn't get I can either do the 10 days or the probation. You can't get out. They said I had to do the probation. I got to do that no matter what.

749
01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.370
Letita W: So I can't get out and get probation.

750
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.450
Richelle Direny: Last month vacation.

751
01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:50.700
Letita W: That was a mouse, the probation. Now what they gave me an option on was to do with or 10 days in jail or do the house arrest, so I could continue to go to work. So we'll lose my job.

752
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:53.400
Letita W: So I told the house around

753
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.310
Letita W: So I can continue to go to work and while there's my job.

754
01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:15.630
Letita W: The program they did in court date never told me that I had to do this program. Once I got back to, you know, talking to. And this wasn't in my probation officer. I was just talking to one of the people that work in a probation department. She said, Well, I want you to take this assessment.

755
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:21.330
Letita W: Which was what bright heart. Cool. She said, depending on your answers.

756
01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:30.330
Letita W: You know, they can call you back and see, you know, if they want you to do the program you can if they don't call you back, then you don't have to do it.

757
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:42.330
Letita W: So urging end up calling me back, you know, and based off my answers the answers that I gave you, you know, I'm figuring I shouldn't even have to do this, you know, but based off what she's saying.

758
01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:50.100
Letita W: Is that well go ahead and do this. And, you know, and you're basically going to do this. And I'm like, for what this is pointless to me.

759
01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:55.440
Letita W: So really, my court my Justin order this for me this treatment.

760
01:17:56.730 --> 01:18:00.570
Letita W: This is what our Jane. This is what's going on for RJ what she wants me today.

761
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:06.330
Richelle Direny: This is not what RJ wants you to do because I did read that assessment.

762
01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:07.020
Letita W: Mm hmm.

763
01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.280
Richelle Direny: Just like how you're answering. Now, everything was pretty much no one on the list.

764
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:13.560
Letita W: Only drive your no

765
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:15.060

Richelle Direny: No cigarettes you smoke cigarettes.

770
01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:30.300
Letita W: Yeah, smoke cigarettes, but that will make you need no therapy for no damn cigarettes.

771
01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:37.110
Richelle Direny: I smoke. I said on the form only thing that was on there was that you smoke, drink.

772
01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:40.890
Letita W: Twice. And you're right. That's the only thing that was

773
01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:49.860
Richelle Direny: On the forum that listed. So one would suggest. Well, there's no real history of alcohol abuse.

774
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:51.030
Letita W: There's no right.

775
01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.960
Richelle Direny: No history of mental illness. It doesn't mean that

776
01:18:56.490 --> 01:19:06.360
Richelle Direny: It can be recommended for me. Well, there are still the probation, because of the he was

777
01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.970
Letita W: Correct to we need to look

778
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:09.870
Into

779
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:17.760
Richelle Direny: The wise, like what was surrounding the wise, what was on that cause to the wise.

780
01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:23.010
Letita W: I just told you, I made a bad decision at that on them days in

781
01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:29.400
Letita W: The early days, you know, you see that too often, you know, I don't drink that often. So my tolerance is low.

782
01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:43.020
Letita W: So I probably made a bad judgment got behind the wheel drove home and they end up pulling me over. And that's what i think you know i'm not i don't have no other detail to go into because that's what happened.

783
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.410
Letita W: That's all I can say.

784
01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:49.560

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:27.180
Richelle Direny: Well, the only thing that I can recommend and suggest because based on everything that you're saying with no history.

789
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:34.140
Richelle Direny: You know, I can just turn into the report just stating that for you.

790

797
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.340
Letita W: Or not, they're not

798
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:12.630
Letita W: But I'm based off. I'm only going to listen to my opinion and God's. You know what I'm saying that's all the person I'm going to have faith in is, my lord.

799
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:29.490
Letita W: You know, these programs. It's just unnecessary for me. You know I'm saying, I'm very strong wield I know who I am, you know I'm saying if I knew I needed a treatment i would i baby please submit me into this. I need some help. You don't need to get myself together real talk.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.650
Letita W: I have no use for this.

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:32.790

1140
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:42.120
zachariah Giffin: I feel like I Hurley getting sleep at night. Now, like I'm up and down all night long.

1141
01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:46.740
Richelle Direny: My prior to the hospitalization. Are you getting any sleep.

1142
01:53:47.490 --> 01:53:50.010
zachariah Giffin: Prior to that, I was sleeping. Good.

1143
01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:53.190
Richelle Direny: You were sleeping. Fine.

1144
01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:55.230
zachariah Giffin: Yeah.

1145
01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:01.290
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1146
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:10.200
Richelle Direny: And so because of the amount the voices were giving you a break, you were hearing it all the time.

1147
01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:16.890
zachariah Giffin: I'm not 24 seven but I was hitting a lot

1148
01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:24.690
zachariah Giffin: It wasn't like a constant someone talking constantly 20 like all day long.

1149
01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:28.860
zachariah Giffin: It would be like on and off.

1150
01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:36.960
Richelle Direny: Okay, and that's so that became scary for you or you went to the hospital.

1151
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:39.030
zachariah Giffin: Yeah.

1152
01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:45.840
Richelle Direny: And how long were you in the hospital for

1153
01:54:48.150 --> 01:54:49.290
zachariah Giffin: 15 days.

1154
01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:50.550
Yes.

zachariah Giffin: Yes, as long as I've ever been in there.

1156
01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:09.870
zachariah Giffin: I think is because at first when I went in, they started me on rest of it all and I was on it for like four days and then they give me them Vegas shot and a week later, I'd have the shot again.

1157
01:55:11.370 --> 01:55:17.430

zachariah Giffin: Now I get the shot once a month.

1159
01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:29.640
zachariah Giffin: But that's why I think I was in there so long because they wanted to monitor me on the new medicine.

1235
02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:54.930

1239
02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.290
zachariah Giffin: But like

1240
02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:15.270
zachariah Giffin: I could put a paper up and have people sign up at the same one is like some one on one tutoring sessions.

1241
02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:19.170

1244
02:03:32.190 --> 02:03:33.210

1245
02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:47.400

1249
02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:20.130
Richelle Direny: Okay.

1250
02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:34.560
Richelle Direny: That's definitely because you know the the frequency in your admissions surrounding with the fact that there's not in business based on every time I speak with you.

1251
02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:44.070

zachariah Giffin: And I rather have a roof over my head.

1255
02:05:04.590 --> 02:05:13.980
Richelle Direny: So the people you live with. They seem to have a lot of opinions at what what you do. Are you renting a room from them, are they

02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:20.340
zachariah Giffin: Oh, I'm I'm helping them and they're helping me

1257
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:24.720

1308
02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:06.600
zachariah Giffin: Hey, I once had the phone number one second. It's, I can go used about tomorrow.

1309
02:12:05.070 --> 02:12:07.770
zachariah Giffin: I didn't even realize I had them boxers on my shoulder.

1310
02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:14.640
zachariah Giffin: Did you see a pair of boxers my shoulders, the whole time.

1311
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:18.210
Richelle Direny: No, I was just looking at your suit your shirt.

1312
02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:25.080
zachariah Giffin: Before I got on with you.

1313
02:12:26.370 --> 02:12:33.330
zachariah Giffin: I got some clean clothes out to take a shower and I had a pair of boxers laying over my shoulder and forgot about it.

1314
02:12:37.590 --> 02:12:38.370
Richelle Direny: Your own okay

1315
02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:40.950
Richelle Direny: All right.

1316
02:12:44.670 --> 02:12:55.380
Richelle Direny: So let us. Um, I mean, I really truly believe that you don't working with your case manager to help you to get, like, whether it's to volunteer.

1317
02:12:55.860 --> 02:13:06.060
Richelle Direny: Or just learn some and maybe we could start working on some life skills or what have you. I know, living you know in the middle of nowhere 30 miles away from the town.

1318
02:13:06.570 --> 02:13:12.600
Richelle Direny: Makes it very difficult not having a corporate you're saying you don't have a car right so you would have to rely on your case manager.

1319
02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:19.290
zachariah Giffin: Know that these guys I stay with they take me where I need to go to

1320
02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.960
Richelle Direny: Yeah, but if you go you do some

1321
02:13:22.590 --> 02:13:35.820
zachariah Giffin: Other stuff. But the other stuff like what we're talking about volunteering or getting involved in a group that would be something. It'd be better for the case manager to take me to then these guys.

1322
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:43.980
Richelle Direny: Yeah. So I think, you know, working with them to get you connected with that would be

1323
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:45.870
Richelle Direny: Definitely

1324
02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:48.090
Richelle Direny: Something that

1325
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:51.330
Richelle Direny: I believe would be beneficial for you.

1326
02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:58.860
Richelle Direny: So maybe you can talk to your case manager.

1327
02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:00.720
And can

1328
02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:11.070
Richelle Direny: I just believe that it would be. It was definitely very beneficial.

1329
02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:18.300
Richelle Direny: So when you, when do you meet with your case manager this week.

1330
