00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:06.990
Adam Vallejos: No.

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:18.720
Adam Vallejos: I'm sorry, I have been. I didn't even have that setup. They told me I remember you told me they have that little setup with the bone in two things on the side, but

3
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. We're going to do it right now. So go look around your room stack up either some books or boxes so that when you stack it up. That's your cameras sitting

4
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm kind of I level with you. So it's just take your time and do that while you're doing that. I'll go open up a note.

5
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so put your arms out about arm's length.

6
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go. Beautiful. I know I got it. Excellent. And then what you want to do is try and find let's say a couple of candle holders or

7
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Like little cups things that you can put the right next to it that are, you know, maybe they could be the same heights of your phone or maybe

8
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: A little higher, and just put them right next to your phone. So there'll be a shoulder width apart and they'll be out about arm's distance right on the outside, left and right.

9
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.530
Adam Vallejos: Of your device cups. Yeah, that could work.

10
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to have your glasses on. I can't remember if you're nearsighted or farsighted.

11
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.400
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

12
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.430

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.080
Adam Vallejos: That's what I had put my schedule for my dad's

15
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.200
Adam Vallejos: My dad's thing on hold because we're supposed to have it this weekend and then they have canceled it and then

16
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:55.410
Adam Vallejos: They weren't going to let us do it until like that. Like it was gonna be like weeks, but then they call my mom and said, if you wanted to do it yesterday. Then we could do it, but we couldn't have more than like 100 people who would ever

17
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so was a last minute scheduling.

18
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.690
Adam Vallejos: Yeah yeah

19
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: How you doing around that.

20
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.550
Adam Vallejos: Because I guess the last

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.760
Adam Vallejos: Last goodbye. The last thing we had to do for you. I thought his

22
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.010
Adam Vallejos: Okay, she cremated him or whatever. So I got like this little thing.

23
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.270
Adam Vallejos: With his own his ashes in it and then

24
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.070
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

25
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.670
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I just couldn't learn and then

26
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.000
Adam Vallejos: Just everything else and says these last two days or

27
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice you're feeling supported by other family and friends yesterday. Does it feel like people were coming together and you felt connection with other people.

28
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.180
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I did. There's

29
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.270
Adam Vallejos: There's a lot of support there that people that were just yeah brand that really didn't even

30
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.750
Adam Vallejos: Know him that well because like he's been in prison for the last, like, seven, eight years or whatever and then

31
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.030
Adam Vallejos: He saw like it was just some like my mom's friends, I guess, showed up there in alleys supported her, I guess, but

32
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.680
Adam Vallejos: That's cool.

33
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.390
Adam Vallejos: I like that too because she made in my support right now.

34
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But what about you, did you feel like you are able to have conversations with people that you weren't having before I mean I'm

35
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me, tell me someone maybe you got to talk to that was

Adam Vallejos: My uncle. That's why I guess like she always better when they're together and stuff. And she's, she's a nice person. And she's, she's a good person. She

38
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.700
Adam Vallejos: Haven't seen for a long time and she just she was there.

39
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.270
Adam Vallejos: She talked to me and stuff.

40
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Any men. I know men male, male role ballers most role models have kind of been a challenge in your life. Were there any men do that you were able to talk to you.

41
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.590
Adam Vallejos: More in the, I mean, not really.

Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes people will find sort of that real male role models through through fellowship anytime that you've ever gone to any meetings through maybe the church or in your community. If you ever heard.

46
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: A man that you kind of respected someone that seemed admirable that maybe you had a passing thought of walking up to and saying, Hey, you know, said ever happened where you you've seen someone you kind of admired a respected and didn't go up to them, but you at least thought about it.

47
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.000
Adam Vallejos: No.

48
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.980

55
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What's respectable about him. From your perspective, not what I would assess. But what do you admire about him.

56
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.990

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.990
Adam Vallejos: He just, I guess, you know, we're trying and then

112
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:50.280
Adam Vallejos: We did all right for we didn't ask him. Appreciate like couple months and then

113
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.630
Adam Vallejos: Fill up again because this was about like

114
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.610
Adam Vallejos: It was about, like, three years ago or something and then

115
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.680
Adam Vallejos: He

116
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.880
Adam Vallejos: And then they and then even though

117
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.440
Adam Vallejos: The mom would help us like behind his back sometimes

118
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.360
Adam Vallejos: It was her daughter her daughter and

119
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.280
Adam Vallejos: She would

120
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.200
Adam Vallejos: Then up he stopped for a couple months because you've seen that

121
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:29.130
Adam Vallejos: And then when we fell off again. He was like there. I see me going to try and over no tired because he

122
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.810
Adam Vallejos: He had he was a heroin addict to couple years.

123
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.900
Adam Vallejos: He had stopped and he's on the Suboxone

124
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.080
Adam Vallejos: So he knows how it is going

125
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: To do you not know any men who are not drug users.

126
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Holy shit, Adam.

127
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.050
Adam Vallejos: I don't know how you say that

128
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.830
Adam Vallejos: I mean,

129
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about it, right. That's just, like, how is that happening.

130
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:09.600
Adam Vallejos: Every

131
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.770
Adam Vallejos: Everybody

132
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:17.580
Adam Vallejos: Every

133
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.520
Adam Vallejos: Every Male Yeah.

134
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.220
Adam Vallejos: Some kind of really

135
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.500
Adam Vallejos: Mostly is heroin or men, that's all.

136
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's shift gears for a minute. I mean, yes, it's on my mind it's incredibly unfortunate your, your environment has

137
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Has given you so few opportunities to see that there's a way to kind of move through your life as a man without this substance or or criminal life or any of that stuff, you know that there's another way to go about this.

138
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's focus on what you're doing. Okay. Because I think you want to be that man. I think there's a part of you that wants that, at least for your children to be that for them. So you can change future generations.

139
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So some of the things you've test yourself with doing you've been able to accomplish, even under incredible adversity and now we have an additional economic

140
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Pressure with what's going on in our economy. And we also have this. I think it's secondary to what's going on with this this global virus that's going on with the coronavirus so there's additional pressures and we're all feeling that doesn't matter what your socio economic statuses.

141
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We're all feeling it. Right. It doesn't everyone feels this so

142
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But life goes on. We, you know, we sort of measure how do we adapt. You've had this recent loss.

143
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And you also have this blessing of having more time with your children.

144
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's complicated. Some of its positive some of its negative

145
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are looking around and I you may have put a pin in it not have wanted to go out in the community and do a job search

146
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you put some of the job plans on hold while you kind of take care of your mom's feelings and taking care of kids while their home. You put a

147
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.200
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I guess so, yeah, I have really ever really been even

148
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.830
Adam Vallejos: Okay, I've been doing nothing.

149
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotcha. Okay.

150
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

151
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

152
00:16:52.830 --> 00:17:00.330
Adam Vallejos: I don't, I don't even think anybody will call it pre interview right now because everything that's going on in

153
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There. Well, you don't you don't know that what you don't know is if they need people to stop. You don't know. I mean there. We still have to eat.

154
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean, there's certain things that don't change. We're still going to go out and we're going to, we're going to order things maybe there'll be more online. I don't know.

155
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But we still eat, you know, we're still consumers. We still have to get products.

156
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not all become farmers, all of a sudden, because we don't have land to do it. We don't have seeds. We don't have the infrastructure. To do that, we still have to go to Target. We still have to go to Walmart and and your equivalent of a Publix out here. We still have to shop.

157
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we put gas in our car. So you say that, but that doesn't mean maybe places like the Dollar Store. Maybe the, the, maybe it would do better. I mean, you know, because if

158
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't know and don't I would invite you, not to get ahead of it and go find out in real time what people might be hiring for

159
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But again, just wanted to check on that.

160
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes sense.

161
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now has the grief hit you. Yet, or is it still like okay I still kind of the impact of this is still feels pretty distant

162
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.970
Adam Vallejos: I don't know, I just

163
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.330
Adam Vallejos: Really

164
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.630
A little bit yesterday.

165
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:44.610
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, I don't know, it's, I have, I don't know, it's weird how I just hold

166
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.450
Adam Vallejos: Hold a lot of things in and I'm like, cool.

167
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.950
Adam Vallejos: Numbers that one. I'm like alone.

168
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.330
Adam Vallejos: But I haven't really been alone. So it's kind of

169
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:07.470
Adam Vallejos: Like when I'm not thinking about it, I, I'm thinking about other things. So, because if there's people here with the

170
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.210
Adam Vallejos: Only time. I really like tried all crazy was for his viewing or whatever.

171
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes sense. Other people were probably crying as well.

172
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.190
Adam Vallejos: Yeah yeah

173
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about how your kids are doing

174
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:30.780
Adam Vallejos: They're doing

175
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.920
Adam Vallejos: Their oldest son, of course, happy, there's no school for like three weeks.

176
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:40.350
Adam Vallejos: So,

177
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.880
Adam Vallejos: They're doing right than

178
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.100
Adam Vallejos: They did when we went to do his thing. Yesterday was

179
00:19:52.080 --> 00:20:01.050
Adam Vallejos: I think they cry tears because of his body because of the viewing internet. I mean, they're not in ever seen a dead body or and

180
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:08.880
Adam Vallejos: That's where the Christ. So yesterday, wondering when they just were asking questions like a thought he was gonna be there and stuff.

181
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.900
Adam Vallejos: And to tell him that he was in that the vase or it over the thing

182
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.750
Adam Vallejos: And then, yeah, but then they were there right and

183
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.410
Adam Vallejos: They've been good.

184
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Adam, what would it be like and and don't feel like you have to say yes, I just want to ask you, um, I have someone in this program.

185
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: He's been here for a little while and

186
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of what he is doing is wanting to give back to the community.

187
00:20:55.410 --> 00:21:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And He very much wants to be what's like a peer support, where he can talk with people like you who are kind of working on their recovery. He's not a clinician, he's not someone like me. He's a client.

188
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:13.950
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

189
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And he said, a part of the phase that he's in his recovery is he wants to give back. He wants to talk with people. He wants to share his stories of success, you know, things that have kind of work for him and kind of connect with people that are going through similar struggle.

190
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's mentioned to me many, many times that she wants to do it.

191
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: A bright heart health initially was going to create this whole peer support program. I think they were going to do a proper training around it and create this whole like entity, where

192
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it could be like, Okay, well, here's your peer support person they're going to kind of someone you could call like literally you know when was my group again. And what am I supposed to do.

193
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And it just, it fell apart like it didn't happen.

194
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I think there's still a real need for

195
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It not only in that early recovery, because we can't remember how to login to zoom or

196
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: All these appointments. What, what, you know, it's like labs, go to what you know it's a lot up front. Not only that, but right now for you, like what you're going through right now.

197
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Or what you went through with with, you know, your baby mama and see why EFT and now with with the grief response and the temptation of wanting to kind of

198
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, to, I want to go us again to I want to do with the men in my life have always done so it's it's not just joining into the program and learning procedures. It's also about being able to talk to someone. And the reason why I'm thinking of this man is because he he's a male

199
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know him very well.

200
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think it would be a great fit.

201
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: If you guys have a match out on personality, you know, yours is kind of kind of low key. You know, I'm kind of hyper and high energy kind of thing and you're kind of low key. I think it would be a good, a good match.

202
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And he would feel good, giving meaning creating time to talk. There's some specifics to his story that that's not my story to tell. He would want to either tell them or not. Tell them to sing with you.

203
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: tell the stories, whatever mean this concept of think of it like you ever heard of a sponsor in an A or a

204
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. It'd be like that where you could talk about whatever you want it to. But there's no limitations, meaning you guys could go have dinner together. You guys could drive in the same car. You can't do that with your therapist. Nevermind that I'm in Florida.

205
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but it's unethical to do that with with your, with your therapist and

206
00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's really just not quite the same structural rules with peer support, you guys can spend time together, talking about what's going on and also be meeting in person out in the community. So it's a really different kind of relationship.

207
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: just me talking about it. Does it seem like, Oh, that's too weird. No, no, no, no. Or Hmm, wonder what that would be like, like, What's your first impression of this peer support idea.

208
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.110
Adam Vallejos: Kind of like, yeah, I would like to see how it would go, I guess.

209
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So, um, if you like this idea. What I'd like to do, and I've done this with with other clients is I start with this kind of conversation.

210
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it moves to a consent form because you're you'd be sharing your personal information with this other person this other person would need to consent.

211
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To you. So you'd both be consenting to each other.

212
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'd be out of the loop you guys would take it from there. And I'm just like you decided to say hey I connected with someone. So that's your business, but you could never talk about it to me again if you wanted to, but I'd be out of it.

213
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.700
Adam Vallejos: All right.

214
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're open to that, then what I can do is

215
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I can have. You remember you've signed releases of information, maybe for your mom or someone like that Monday first started

216
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'll do is I'll talk to this person and I'll say, are you interested in doing this, I won't say your name yet for so I'll just ask. And if he says as he always does. Yes. Then I'm going to kind of give you his name and then you can

217
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: sign the release, if you want to. And that means that you guys can talk to each other and kind of I can get out of the loop.

218
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.180
Adam Vallejos: Hey,

219
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean, like, Hey, here's my number. Hey, here's mine. What's up, and you can be like, Yeah, this is weird and

220
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But he would take the lead you wouldn't have to be the one to do it. He'd be like, Hey, you know, how's it going, and

221
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how long you been in the program. My guess is he would do is just like a hi how you doing kind of conversation. And then you guys would take it from there. And if you click that made sense. Maybe after a couple of times.

222
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: He could be a resource for you when you're in distress, you're scared, you're sad or you just you want to talk to somebody about what you're going through on the fly, then he's someone you could reach out to

223
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you do

224
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.890
Adam Vallejos: Yeah yeah

225
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Then all I'll see if I can get away for you to get connected. For us, it's going to start with probably want to look in your email for a link for the release of information. Okay. Okay. Cool. And I'll and I'll talk with him about whether he's up for it.

226
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And his the context of his life changes here and there, too. So that's kind of neat. Well, I'm, I'm excited for I'm glad you're open to that that can be pretty cool.

227
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, especially around that that male role model thing. It makes me think, boy, it'd be nice to have have a connection to hear, hear the male perspective.

228
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.670
Adam Vallejos: Yeah. Okay. Very nice.

229
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

230
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And

231
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on with the dynamics between you and your mom. These days, you're living together. I know she was she's really this is hidden hurt very hard.

232
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: How is she doing

233
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.360
Adam Vallejos: He's been okay

234
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.220
Adam Vallejos: She's been good actually. She went back to work and stuff and

235
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.800
Adam Vallejos: She'd been

236
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.770
Adam Vallejos: A little brother. It's kind of taking it.

237
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember that. And when you say taking it hard. What is he doing that makes you think he's taking it hard.

238
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:14.520
Adam Vallejos: To look at the house. It's little bit because here. He has my boys like they're always playing together and the work

239
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:15.960
Adam Vallejos: On

240
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.280
Adam Vallejos: It was more I guess like as soon as everybody, I guess, or anybody would just like

241
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.760
Adam Vallejos: It when we were like at the at the viewing or whatever in my aunt was trying to tell him.

242
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.670
Adam Vallejos: Because he wanted his, his that to be like smiling or whatever.

243
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.230
Adam Vallejos: But

244
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:47.160
Adam Vallejos: My auntie, my aunt Kathy was just trying to like tell them how and what how it is, you know, I mean, but, and he just got like

245
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.350
Adam Vallejos: He got upset with her and he hasn't since that day. He hasn't like talk to her.

246
00:28:53.850 --> 00:29:00.570
Adam Vallejos: Because yesterday she was like trying to like give them a hug and stuff. And he was just like pushing her away. So I didn't know he just

247
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.300
Adam Vallejos: He just got mad at her.

248
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:16.050
Adam Vallejos: Because she wasn't like talking shit about her is data nothing but huge is she was just saying, and then like he's very well be that like says something that he don't like about him, he's just taking

249
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.460
Adam Vallejos: More crazy and just

250
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.710
Adam Vallejos: Been

251
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.150
Adam Vallejos: So,

252
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: He's a little defensive. He's not seeking affection from people. He's not able to kind of talk with people about both negative things about him and the dad, as well as positive things like he can't tolerate anything negative and no negative stories that right

253
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.770
Adam Vallejos: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. And you don't

254
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.180
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, pretty much set. Yeah, he just

255
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.070
Adam Vallejos: Been

256
00:29:54.780 --> 00:30:01.500
Adam Vallejos: I don't think he has, like, because he hasn't already. They're going to step for like the viewing or whatever. That's pretty much everybody whether

257
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.110
Adam Vallejos: You see him or whatever but

258
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.960
Adam Vallejos: He hasn't really like

259
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:14.730
Adam Vallejos: Talked about how he's feeling he, I think he holds everything in to like I do like

260
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.130
Adam Vallejos: You don't talk about it.

261
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.560
Adam Vallejos: And I think one day he just gonna just gonna burst and start

262
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.750
Adam Vallejos: Going crazy

263
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.520
Adam Vallejos: So,

264
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't think, I mean, so you know when we're grieving. We're supposed to cry. We're supposed to feel sad that actually is not

265
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Depression, that's not a clinical depression, will we cry that shows that we cared about someone and we recognize the loss in our life that we're losing someone nearby that we love.

266
00:30:52.290 --> 00:31:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's multiple grief for you right it's multiple it's attached to. I had missing big pieces of of having a father. Now, this, this one that I just really getting to know like there's multiple levels of grief. So it's not just, I just lost him to death but

267
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: There's probably going to be layers of I never had one.

268
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I mean, this is this is multi layered

269
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But crying fits

270
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's when we, you know, it goes on for days and we can't get out of bed and we're neglecting responsibilities with our children and we're not eating.

271
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When it gets into that. That's what we're, you know, and the duration that that goes on. That's where we're getting into depression and like you said what he does is he acts out in anger. Instead of feeling the feelings were kind of supposed to grief is sadness. We cry, we miss them.

272
00:31:52.860 --> 00:32:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're seeing in him. He may not cry instead Hill, maybe get violent or he might do something in the community, where he, what do you think he might get himself in in jail. Eventually, with his acting out

273
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.750
Adam Vallejos: I don't think like that. He's a good kid. He's

274
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:21.360
Adam Vallejos: I think he's good. He is not like he's not really violent either this more as just like

275
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.630
Adam Vallejos: Like he'll just go and

276
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.690
Adam Vallejos: Like, just go in his room or something and just

277
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.490
Adam Vallejos: Put like just like everybody else and be themselves.

278
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.980
Adam Vallejos: For a while and but he's not like violent. He's not violent

279
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.150
Adam Vallejos: He's just

280
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.150
Adam Vallejos: I don't know how to put it. He is just like

281
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:59.700
Adam Vallejos: He is just pretty much like I was he just sold everything in one and if it nothing if anything bothering him, then you'll just

282
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:13.890
Adam Vallejos: Go and go in his room and close the grumpy by himself until he feels better. What did I remember I used to doing. And I would just want to be with myself. Even if somebody was trying to talk to me and like

283
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:16.830
Adam Vallejos: For me, or whatever.

284
00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.510
Adam Vallejos: I would just not want to hear it until you're ready and

285
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So Adam

286
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's one thing to choose to isolate. It's another one to have to. So the fact that, like, let's say you decide to reach out to him.

287
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Every day. Every other day every three days, something like that.

288
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: When we know there is someone there that cares. It feels very different than isolating and thinking there's no one there.

289
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So you may think you're reaching out to him as a waste of time.

290
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But think about it for you to yes you might like to go into your own quiet to process the feelings, maybe to have a crime spell.

291
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: To let it out.

292
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.900
Adam Vallejos: But

293
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Your knowing that someone's they're interested in cares and it's checking in on you. Isn't that still important.

294
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.530
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

295
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.090
Adam Vallejos: What memory and I would do that.

296
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:35.160
Adam Vallejos: Sometimes there would be nobody that would come and check or whatever out like when I would go do that. And then it would make me feel some type of way. But when somebody would

297
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:43.350
Adam Vallejos: Come in and try to still be there and talk to you. This would make you feel better.

298
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It is suffering is one thing I'm taking a look at my actions or my actions.

299
00:34:51.360 --> 00:35:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I feel remorse or with great fits. I missed this person and I have this sense of loss is one thing to suffer and a whole other nother level to suffer alone.

300
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: We're wired to know that we're connected to other people. So even though you may say yourself. Oh, he's like me. He likes to be alone.

301
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember how good it feels to know that someone cares I would invite you to check in and say, Hey, I'm here whenever you want to kind of hang just thinking about. I wonder if you and I are the same kind of like to do her own thing, quietly, but I'm here.

302
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just even giving that to him can reinforce the, you're not alone either. So it's not only helping him it bounces back and gives back to you too. I highly invite you to continue that connection. Okay.

303
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:42.870
Adam Vallejos: Good.

304
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:43.650
Yeah.

305
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And don't get defensive, you already know. He gets he uses anger to protect his, his vulnerability and his sad, the sadness. So don't don't get yourself offended by it, it won't be about you.

306
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What's his file. Right. Yeah.

307
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. And you never know. You know, he could be one of the first people where you're modeling what it's like to process through grief versus trying to jump over it.

308
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And we jump over it by acting out angry, we can jump over it by using drugs, we can jump over it by doing any number of compulsive behaviors overworking right we can overdo anything.

309
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Over eating over sex over gambling. Over. Over. Over. We can leap over the grief and try and bypass it but that grief will still be there if we don't go through it, which means crying.

310
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean I don't literally mean without the tears. We can't grieve. I just mean we sit with it. And like I was saying we sit with

311
00:36:52.890 --> 00:37:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: On what am I going to miss most about him. What do I wish, I wish. She was here more. I wish she wasn't locked up for some of these years out of that and

312
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we feel our own feelings and not try and skip it, they'll still be there waiting for you wait for you to move move through them.

313
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't do they don't

314
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sit there in our psyche. We need to get processed.

315
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep.

316
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's um now.

317
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me get into

318
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: With we have this doctor all women who has been out. I think for two weeks. He's on vacation. So Dr. Ralph has taken on all of his clients and she's had a lot more groups and prescriptions and so it's it's more than one person can really do.

319
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm right now I'm in this program called slack and I'm going to write her

320
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Your next individual therapy will schedule that one but your next group is next Tuesday. Okay, so

321
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I did touch base with her got a little confusing, but her records show that she's I can look in there myself. I don't I do that, let me just go in here, education,

322
00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It looks like.

323
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been at to film so 16 milligrams as of there's a prescription for March 11 and there's one for March 17 which was yesterday.

324
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So there was some confusion. I don't know how it went. I don't really have time to get into it, but we'll stay here. Okay, we'll stay at the 16

325
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: will explore tapering when everything's kind of settled in a little bit more but for now be okay with that. I mean, you're welcome to taper one milligram at a time. If you decide to do that but I prefer you be in close connection with the physician if you do that.

326
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.980
Adam Vallejos: Yeah, when

327
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.610
Adam Vallejos: You have to to those 16

328
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll do that for now we'll take a little look at it another time. So I'm gonna go back in and in here and let me just send her a quick message. Okay.

329
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: She can order it. She's probably up so she should probably get this, you may want to check your pharmacy and a half hour.

330
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:49.830
Adam Vallejos: What did she said she right if you said that she said one yesterday that should be there right

331
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, it was, I think, only two films, so you didn't. You didn't have to pick it up. You already got some leftover

332
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:19.200
Adam Vallejos: Well, yeah. Because my, on my insurance. Don't ever let me pick it up until today. So like once every time she ordered it on Tuesdays, a call, but they say my true so pay for it until today. So I was going to call today to because I didn't. I don't have those for today to cook anything

333
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, listen.

334
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen close like

335
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: If you pick up the wrong order. Listen closely this can really screw you. So listen, if you pick up the one that's only to stress.

336
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll have to stress. If you do not pick up the order for two strips. Instead, you do the one that's probably going to be ordered today, which is going to get you to Tuesday. Right.

337
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:44.640
Adam Vallejos: That's

338
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be the one I would pick up. Do not drive away until you get the right ones that make sense. Yeah.

339
00:40:54.570 --> 00:41:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, dude. I this is for everyone. I tell everyone counts your medication or make the tech town it right in front of you, because people have left, and they were short

340
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:06.450
Adam Vallejos: Yeah.

341
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That's on y'all because it doesn't matter whether somebody stolen or lost or wasn't given to you properly. There's nothing we can do.

342
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so counted. All right, so let me just get this message. Okay.

343
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

344
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.260
Okay.

345
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's schedule another our next individual therapy.

346
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What's possible here.

347
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'll see you for individual on March 25 at 10am ok
