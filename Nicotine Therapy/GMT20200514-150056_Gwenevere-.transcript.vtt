00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.980
9am

2
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:10.650
Ateeq: Morning.

3
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was thinking this morning.

4
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you have something really sort of pressing

5
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm with your wife maybe what we could do this morning is is do a little bit of work.

6
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Together individually with some underlying stuff. I don't know if you want to create a little bit more privacy completely up to you but you're going to want it for the kind of work I want to do with you.

7
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.970
Ateeq: Okay. Um, I did wake her up for luck.

8
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.950
Ateeq: Yeah, she's here now, but I see you again on the team.

9
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.770
Ateeq: Is the next time we can do it on the team.

10
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.510
Ateeq: The team.

11
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you guys settle in.

12
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll open up while you're doing that.

13
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.390
Okay.

14
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And just so you know, and let Cara know that my ears are really bad today. So I'm going to be flipping my head up and down a lot today.

15
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:11.580
Okay.

16
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Honey, and to do the body is an imperfect thing.

17
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.210
Yeah.

18
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can share with me if you like while I'm hosting this note a little bit about how you've been doing at work emotionally

19
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.530
Ateeq: I bet. Okay. I work. Yeah, I've been. I mean, you know, I go up there and do my work part

20
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.070
Ateeq: But I mean, work is his own drama.

21
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how is it affecting you on an emotional level how intense. Are you feeling stress from what's going on there.

22
00:12:55.830 --> 00:13:07.740
Ateeq: Yeah, well, you got it or and then I found out one of the guys I work with MS facility. He passed away recently with cove. It also. So I get to hear it every time I'm at work.

23
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:16.470
Ateeq: And then we had a meeting yesterday and I ended up getting in trouble because I was giving out too many mass

24
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.410
Ateeq: So those two

25
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But how did that affect you. So it's one thing to say these are the facts. I was reprimanded and told not to give out as many, but it's a different question to ask, how is it affecting you.

26
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:45.060
Ateeq: To have been I just felt irritated from me getting in trouble by that because I do so much more for the company. And it's like it didn't matter what I did. They

27
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.130
Ateeq: Hear some mass. Yeah.

28
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.640
Ateeq: They care more about the supplies.

29
00:13:54.150 --> 00:14:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, so their focus was on something other than what you value yeah out that is very annoying pretty common for an employer, though I gotta say.

30
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To do that, and only focus on what we mistakes we make. And that's kind of what supervisors are for they're only looking out for what goes wrong with their staff so

31
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So, Karen, how are you doing

32
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.550
Ateeq: Are you

33
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Not bad. I was letting a teeth, know that my ears are bad today. So you're going to see me doing some head slippage.

34
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, just letting you know just keeping you in the loop.

35
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me

36
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me kind of see where we left off last night last time I'm just orient myself a little bit, but that doesn't preclude you guys from kind of updating me

37
00:14:49.980 --> 00:15:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had sort of a leveling out is there improved communication. What are you noticing Kara for you as far as how the relationship is right now.

38
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

39
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and I'm saying Kira instead of carra so I think I should change that. Sorry.

40
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we're fighting a lot and is the is the content, I'm

41
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The important part, or is it, like, Oh, we're fighting a lot over silliness. And we don't even doesn't even matter what it is, or is it really there's there's some important things going on in content.

42
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.570
Same stuff we can find about

43
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.100
Okay.

44
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.330
Ateeq: I just feel like now that uh she, uh, she got the marina.

45
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.100
Ateeq: A while back, and I feel like it's just making a really hormonal

46
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.120
Ateeq: Oh, yeah. So I think it's affecting your hormones.

47
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And she's

48
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.140
Ateeq: Just been very snappy with me. That's my feeling

49
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, snappy. So maybe we can get into that. So you have a theory.

50
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And car for you. What do you think is contributing to an increased arguing what do you think's going on.

51
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.230
Ateeq: No are you, I'm very sensitive to hormones.

52
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:19.800
Ateeq: I do notice a difference when I'm off of birth control because I was on Devo at the beginning of the year, then

53
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:36.570
Ateeq: It faded away like in February. And I was, I did notice a difference. But that's not really an option for me right now to not be on birth control. So I've tried this is basically my last shot. I've tried everything.

54
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:46.800
Ateeq: Okay, so basically Marina is the last thing that is available to me. Okay. Um, so I it's difficult for me.

55
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.540
Ateeq: Um,

56
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.060
Ateeq: I guess in the midst of it to notice if I'm being like that.

57
00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.930
Ateeq: I do believe him that I am probably being more snappy. I don't really notice it.

58
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.460
Ateeq: It's just seems normal to me. I, I feel normal.

59
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:11.490
Ateeq: Um, but I probably I know what this probably not the way it is.

60
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.570
I feel

61
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.970
Ateeq: I feel normal. But I do notice a difference when I'm off of or control.

62
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice when you're off of it.

63
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.550
I

64
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.360
Ateeq: I guess I'm just more calm more mellow. I'm not. I don't react to things as harshly.

65
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:38.340
Ateeq: But I don't notice that I do it well are on birth control like it's I look back, and I'm like, oh, that was kind of rude click

66
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so what I'm hearing you say as you can recognize a difference.

67
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're off of hormones.

68
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.780
Ateeq: Yes, but

69
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In the moment

70
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:56.790
Ateeq: It's very difficult for me to I just kind of leave it on him. I'm like, why, why don't you understand me. Why don't you give me some space like

71
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:09.900
Ateeq: I yeah okay it's pretty much like telling a bipolar person they're bipolar the, you know, or when they're having their ups and downs. It's like telling them because my dad's bipolar.

72
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:18.420
Ateeq: With them, you know, so it's like he didn't know what was going on during the time it was going on. He thought everything was okay.

73
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.600
Ateeq: But, but then after he came down from his high point. He then realized he was

74
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So the big difference here is that a car is not

75
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, so just because we have additional hormones that dial up a response. It doesn't mean that she's not able to access all of the different parts of her brain.

76
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:44.790
So,

77
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're, you have a really sort of almost traumatic really history with

78
00:18:53.610 --> 00:19:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing things with your own senses, seeing and hearing them and not being able to communicate it to your father, but she is not your father. And so let's spend a little bit of time about how you can see her in a way

79
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not him.

80
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:17.550
Ateeq: No, no, that's not what I'm saying. I mean, I just want to give an example to like our were at the store the other day.

81
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:28.410
Ateeq: He said he, he said, You sound a little hormonal you sounded creepy hormonal and I was like, and at the time I was like that just not healthy at all like, but that just makes me mad.

82
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so notice it's about

83
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want to have some productivity here today, right, we want to move and have some new ation new experiences. So let's not get too hung up on my failure to deliver my sales pitch well enough, and I apologize. I didn't say it the right way.

84
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you see your wife. I know you don't see your dad. But what happens is, notice that

85
00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What may happen is you may inhibit a communication. Because of this, this old history. That's all. So let's just get into number one.

86
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: No woman on this planet is probably going to respond well to

87
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Your PMS saying your hormonal there's very few women on this planet that will want

88
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This this assignment instead of the validity of the content of what's being said it's a pretty universal experience.

89
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, you know, you may be thinking, it's the hormones and she may actually if you gave it 60 seconds or hundred and 20 seconds if you said it in a slightly different way. She might be able to hear it. Um, but what happens when we say

90
00:20:52.500 --> 00:21:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Imagine the other way around. Imagine you said to her, that's your bipolar disorder and her concern was actually a real one, as in

91
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's really going on. What happens is the content of what we're talking about gets dismissed because of a condition and that feels crappy for all of us. So it takes five and said to you. Oh, that's, that's just because you're an addict.

92
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You might feel dismissed unimportant not valued not character would you say

93
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:21.840
Ateeq: Yeah.

94
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.090
Ateeq: But see, the reason I even said that

95
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:33.330
Ateeq: Whereas, because he told me, I'm on this Marina. And I remember how it was acting on the demo. Let me know if I like that. And I just let her know that was it.

96
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to start right there. We're going to talk about a phrase that doesn't piss her off and make her feel defensive. We're just going to pick one. See how she's smiling. She's already giggling because it's like, yeah, we gotta have a better phrase.

97
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so look at her face. You see, you see your smile.

98
00:21:52.710 --> 00:22:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not about it is we like things delivered in a particular way. We all do you have a particular thing that information can go in more palatable. And so to shape.

99
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't mind being called out when I'm all dialed up but I'd like it said in a way that's loving and kind. So let's come up with a phrase so Cara. What is something you would not immediately get ticked off by

100
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:21.840
Ateeq: Just

101
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:29.550
Ateeq: Hold me like a situation just be like baby kind of snapping and be a little bit like I don't think that's fair or like or

102
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:40.620
Ateeq: Something like that, just like you're kind of short with me, like what's going on, or just something that recognizes the behavior, instead of just waiting on

103
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:51.150
Ateeq: Hormones or something because sometimes I am a little snappy, but it's because I'm irritated about something in particular, it's not just all the work, but sometimes I feel like my presence around or make sure

104
00:22:51.900 --> 00:23:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to get to that when we're almost there. Notice that we're focusing on Kara for just a second and never going to get to your my presence seems to irritate you, Kara. So we're going to get into that in a second.

105
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to to snappy. So what you liked about that scenario is that it was behavior, not me. I'm not hormone. It's you like that better. And we are helping out. So a teak what is something. So did you hear her just now, or she says I like

106
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.600
Ateeq: Oh,

107
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.500
Ateeq: I heard

108
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.250
Ateeq: I heard her

109
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:35.460
Ateeq: She said that she would she would rather hear me say it in a different way instead of calling her straight out and saying you're being hormonal just say you're being a little bit snappy with me, you're being a little short with me.

110
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's see if it works. So talk directly to her. I know this is more uncomfortable, but this is real life, see if it works.

111
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so, uh, take hey you're going to say, Hey, oh yes. Right, I'm noticing you're being a little, a little snappy. And then let's see how you feel when you hear that, so look at each other. Go away from me look at each other. Go ahead.

112
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.410
Ateeq: Hey, I noticed that you're being a little bit snappy.

113
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's see, just

114
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so now Cairo, you have to decide how you're going to take that in you can be defensive. If you want to

115
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Or you could say it's not all of me that he's addressing it's well let me see. Was I short, do I have a short fuse right now. Am I feeling and patient or is he just not like a topic I'm bringing up like so what just happened just now. Did it go in, or did you want to reject that too.

116
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.340
If

117
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

118
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

119
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Kara. How did it feel. Did you feel offended. Did you get as pest. How did, how did you receive that

120
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:49.890
Ateeq: Return.

121
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

122
00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, see you don't mind that.

123
00:25:53.910 --> 00:26:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay, so in my world right I'm wanting I feel

124
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me check on something. Hey, a teak when she snippy when she snapping

125
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just curious. How does it feel when she snapping at you.

126
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.260
Ateeq: It just makes me defensive

127
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:17.160
Okay.

128
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.640
Ateeq: If I start to wonder, like, what did I do, I do. I didn't do nothing.

129
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.510
Ateeq: Okay.

130
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me ask, let me see what happens if you send that to her just just indulge me because you know how much I love the I feels

131
00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So good to see if you can add that piece to it. Hey, sweetie, I'm I feel defensive. It seems like you're snapping at me try that. Look at her and try something like that.

132
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.510
It girl.

133
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.730
Ateeq: I feel like juice snapping at me is making me defensive

134
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.090
Ateeq: Did that

135
00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How did that feel Kara.

136
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:03.750
Fake

137
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Fake

138
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Fake. Okay, so we don't want fake. So that was a lot of the one of our in there, but you'll you'll take it in with just the behavior observations. So what will put us. Okay, fine.

139
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.570
Ateeq: I'll do it again.

140
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.780
Ateeq: Me, I get defensive. I don't like it. That's

141
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.390
Ateeq: That's me really

142
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you like that. You also know about your sweetheart and how he feels. Did you like that part.

143
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.940
Included

144
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, no.

145
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, you don't think that's true. So

146
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.400
Ateeq: I feel like

147
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but if you're already feeling, in a sense, and patient and irritable, we might miss or even not care because we're irritable. It's like, oh, I've already got enough on my plate.

148
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:58.530
Ateeq: Yeah.

149
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to nail feel we feel and on a mirror that and just want this moment over with. Okay, so

150
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh teak

151
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Which one are you more likely to do. Hey, hey, Kara, sweetie, kind of seeming snippy

152
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you okay, that's one of our style um but Carol all you care about. All you need is just bring it to my attention or do you need more

153
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.490
Ateeq: And you'll know what are you okay with that would be good.

154
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.610
Ateeq: What I usually do is if I get a negative vibe my way I always push it back.

155
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:49.380
Ateeq: I'm like fire with fire, and I try not to do that, you know, I don't do it as much as I used to. But sometimes, it still comes there where I'd like that.

156
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.930
Ateeq: At the time, it's happening.

157
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.390
Ateeq: I'm getting more defensive and then I'm getting more mad and irritated to and cheese irritated.

158
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But just know we had a little

159
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Delay in our we were meeting, back to back for a while and I was starting to get a sense that some progress was being made. And I think that when we haven't been needing and we might default back to our old ways that's pretty common RIGHT TO GO BACK TO to that.

160
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.010
Ateeq: We haven't met for a while. It's been a wild that we met.

161
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. So I like it. I think it's pretty cool. Um, I want you to think about how, how does it feel Kara to know that he's owning he's not blaming you for his defensiveness. He's just saying I feel defensive when I sense that you're being snippy

162
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see the difference like he's owning it.

163
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus showing you defensiveness. Do you see the difference.

164
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.230
Ateeq: I like

165
00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.530
Ateeq: A lot of times

166
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:08.610
Ateeq: His emotions are my fault. Like I feel like a certain way, if that makes her feel a certain way, it just that just blows up with something bigger.

167
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know it seems part because I heard you say a little phony earlier, a key. One of the reasons why this thing I asked you guys to do of the I feel. Notice how she just said.

168
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I get the sense that a teak I'm responsible for how you feel. Do you know we're not actually we're not responsible for each other's feelings. I actually am

169
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.400
Ateeq: Responsible. No, I know.

170
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:40.320
Ateeq: I know, but it has to do, and I know where where it's coming from, is because when I feel

171
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:56.130
Ateeq: Her in a negative way, I throw that negative at her too. And she feels like because she's like that she's responsible or I feel like I'm responsible for her feeling because not that I just get naked up right away to

172
00:30:58.890 --> 00:30:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk to you guys.

173
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:05.340
Ateeq: It's kind of what I'm trying to do is odd because she's back with me. I'm planning cater bar.

174
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Pretty common pretty common one. Do you remember this invitation around making a commitment to each other about

175
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody first the first person to notice.

176
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on with the self.

177
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You know if they say it. That is, it's a real deliberate, intentional thing. It doesn't sound like either the commitment was made or that it was followed through with I could have sworn we did a little something with that. I don't know if we follow through with it, you

178
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:37.770
Know,

179
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:50.040
Ateeq: Yesterday, what happened was I, I have literally just woken up. He was in the shower. The baby was crying. I had just woken up

180
00:31:50.850 --> 00:32:04.920
Ateeq: I had to change your DIAPERS. SHE HAD A BIG messy diaper and he I came up here to throw it away and he told me. Good morning, and I was like, like I could barely get it out. She didn't say nothing. I did tell you. Good morning, she ignored me and went to the room. No, I didn't.

181
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.550
Ateeq: I don't blow flying here.

182
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's happening right here. So here's, here's the thing.

183
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so many can be going on a maybe he didn't hear you be he may have already been in such a distress reaction that he couldn't hear you.

184
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.100
Ateeq: Well he's halfway deaths. Are you surprised if he did

185
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So right so he doesn't mean it wasn't said, but notice that you were both here's a tea Kevin good intentions meeting someone who's already barely coping with the morning it's like really

186
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

187
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:55.020
Ateeq: Yeah, I just woke up to it exploded diaper her clothes were dirty. I was exhausted. I was. Yeah, but, but this is the part I was talking about, not even that

188
00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:08.520
Ateeq: After that we were fine. We were talking, everything was normal and then bam you would laugh about what happened earlier. I was like, what's wrong with you, there's like hours later, I was like what's going on.

189
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

190
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: He's

191
00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:24.840
Ateeq: He's already tried to get over it, but he couldn't do it was making me mad because all of a sudden she was rude to me. And then she was being all nice to me. So I told her, because I have welcome to be nice to me. If you're gonna be rude to me. That'd be rude to me.

192
00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So I take this is what happens if you knew you had this choice in that morning. So this is how could have played out care. And I wonder if the day would have been different. And I wonder if the day would have been different if you did it like this.

193
00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, sweetie.

194
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm still offended from an from two hours ago I got my feelings hurt like you weren't happy to see me in the morning. Remember, I've talked with Glenn about how I vibe with whatever mood, you're in. I'm still stuck two hours ago. I'm still stuck in it.

195
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine Kara hearing him say that

196
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:06.390
Ateeq: But the happy more me yeah automated worse know

197
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:15.780
Ateeq: If you tell me how you're feeling instead of hiding to get pissed off, you think that would know September I could get that she can read my mind.

198
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's so, so important. You said

199
00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys are so

200
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. I know.

201
00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I tell you something.

202
00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We women are really good at guessing, but it's really not our responsibility.

203
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: To do.

204
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The thinking for you. And it's actually can feel sometimes intrusive, like, get out of my head like don't read my mind. So on one hand it's a good thing. She can't read your mind. Okay.

205
00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are your private thoughts. So one of the reasons why I keep focusing and refocusing and focusing on feeling

206
00:34:52.500 --> 00:35:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is because whether you have an opinion about feelings or not. There they are. And they run the show. So you're either in charge and conscious of them, or you're going to be making decisions on unconscious motivating emotions so

207
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Look what happened because you i'm guessing your belief system is its weak or you should already know what I'm thinking.

208
00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That you decided, I'm not going to say to her, or maybe you're embarrassed, why can I get over these feelings from earlier in the morning. Or maybe I'm supposed to

209
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Be a man or something like it doesn't fit that image that someone could hold on to feelings for three hours. I don't know what belief you have underneath it. That's kind of why I want to keep doing the individual therapy piece.

210
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how you just said it. I kind of expect her to already know what I'm thinking. And she should know

211
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We've known each other long enough.

212
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What, go ahead.

213
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:55.110
Ateeq: I have kind of an idea like his parents don't talk about stuff like that. Like, they don't have conversations like that if his mom is mad, his mom will

214
00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:07.050
Ateeq: Yell his dad down and he just sits there and says, okay, like they don't talk about emotions like that. They never did. I'm sure they never did with their growth. No. Yeah.

215
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:16.830
Ateeq: The previous long term relationships. He's had if they would get to fight it would just stop talking for weeks. Like he literally lived with her and they will stop talking for yeah look sleep.

216
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Us to

217
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.630
Ateeq: Matthew to stop talking.

218
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let's do this. Go grab a nice clean, fresh white piece of paper.

219
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to have an emergency communication list. Okay.

220
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:35.640
Ateeq: Okay.

221
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna go see if I can find one that I used in the past, you go find that one. And I'll go see if I can find the one that I used to have hide it around.

222
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see here.

223
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be convenient if

224
00:36:53.010 --> 00:37:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to have this around and I'd like it to be laminated maybe down the line. If you guys like it you can create one. It could be laminated, you know, you could do like an online order kind of thing.

225
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: See right back.

226
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:10.770
Ateeq: Okay.

227
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.210
Do you want

228
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.530
Ateeq: Okay. Do you want to play. I can

229
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.830
Ateeq: Hear a typical Grover. I want her but she's not planning.

230
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.260
Ateeq: Your stuff up the interface.

231
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:52.860
Ateeq: To this Ruby. Do you want to give her some medicine like you're not the Tylenol. Where is it, it's at the packets. There should be a single packet out oh inside the box because I through the foil away. But there's one of the little things in there. You don't say.

232
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.650
Ateeq: He smell.

233
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.120
Ateeq: She didn't put for you this morning when he changed her maybe

234
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.700
Ateeq: That's why she slapped

235
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.570
Ateeq: If I can stop her from pooping of the board inch asleep.

236
00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:15.750
Ateeq: There should be one just a single one in here. Yeah. Now with the foil. Do you want to bring it here. And if you get it.

237
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.160
Ateeq: OK.

238
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so grab that piece of paper.

239
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm thinking some good ones.

240
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.290
Up.

241
00:38:53.130 --> 00:39:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: At the top, nice and big and leave spaces in between because maybe some maybe you could even like that idea. You ever have these things, you know, the plastic covers that go over like

242
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.800
Ateeq: Yeah yeah

243
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So instead of laminating

244
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And down the line. They're kind of fun for crafting you guys I'm if you ever again eliminator they're good, because then you can use a dry erase. And so here's what my my thought is, um, so at the top. Let's put

245
00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I nice and big nice and clear big like fun like this big. You know, I mean like big so it's nice and easy to see. I feel

246
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Defensive

247
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you something. This is so handy and then put dot dot dot

248
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And then leave some space, maybe a couple lines and then let's put

249
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I

250
00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:03.420
Ateeq: was quick. Oh no. Yeah, I couldn't hear nothing. You're back now.

251
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's okay. I didn't even say the second one. So the second was, what's a frequent you when you feel car. What's a frequent experience. I feel impatient grumpy tired. What's a frequent one for you.

252
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.850
Emergency

253
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't log back in, it won't let you

254
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what yeah I'm going to log out myself and just see if that snaps it away come in to come out.
