TCL A501DL: Okay.

30
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're you're you're in a unique situation where your how you have someone that sort of supervising what you're doing a lot of people don't have that some people do.

31
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If showing up was all it was.

32
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you would just check in a virtual clinic. Right.

33
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.510
TCL A501DL: Yeah yeah

34
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this this treatment is 45 minutes to 60 minutes you'll either take that dose of treatment or you won't be taking the treatment as prescribed.

35
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's probably a hard thing to hear right

36
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.200
TCL A501DL: Now, I really I've heard

37
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um let you've got some kind of shelving behind you. I have a long day ahead of me. Let's see if we can prop this phone up so that I don't feel nauseous. You got some shelving.

38
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: over to your right and see if it can prop me up over there.

39
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so difficult.

40
00:04:48.780 --> 00:05:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Alright, cool. Um, how are you feeling around being in group as it's you've been in there. A couple times you noticing any a little bit more comfort anything changing in there for you.

41
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.040
TCL A501DL: I'm not really just kind of about the same exchange, but

42
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.180
TCL A501DL: It's actually kind of pretty cool. Yeah.

43
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you heard anything in there that you kind of relate to a little bit

44
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.110
TCL A501DL: Oh. Not yet. Not quite yet.

45
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And is the particular because each group is very different. There's different people, different stages of change people sort of getting, you know,

46
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Into their recovery process is there is the composition of the group. Are these people that you think that you could start to to trust and open up to a little bit over time.

47
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.890
TCL A501DL: Probably

48
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.350
TCL A501DL: Holding daddy is just going to take some time. Okay.

49
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You might feel you might be one of the younger people in there. Does it seem like they're the age difference feels like it has an impact.

50
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.100
TCL A501DL: No, not really. I mean, I've never taken ages like something that's going to impact how I look at somebody.

51
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, no ages and for you.

52
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.310
TCL A501DL: Okay, yeah.

53
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, cool. Um, yeah, I'm trying to think. Here in that seven in the morning, who's in there that that group has a lot of people. It's a very open group, which means there'll be people in it and then you know we just start to get to know somebody and then, you know, they move to

54
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, a different group time or they've left out of state or something shifts in their schedule significantly. So there's a lot of flow in that one.

55
00:06:47.400 --> 00:07:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So for anyone who experiences like trust challenges and opening up this will be a real test for you because there'll be new faces and then we'll do an icebreaker and then you'll get to know them, then they'll be a new face. So it's a there'll be a constant flow in there.

56
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see. I hadn't

57
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I had an idea about a place that we could start today, but I'm open to hearing about maybe any changes that are going on at home any significant changes like anyone move into the house. That's new. Any personality changes going on.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.970

83
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:48.960
TCL A501DL: Oh no, not really. They just kind of let me go and told me that they're going to talk to my PO and shit. And my P O called me yesterday and I went into the pitch test. And yeah, so far, everything's all right there, just

84
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:50.850
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

85
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.470

88
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:08.910
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

89
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this happened.

90
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.740
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

91
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this happened out of the blue.

92
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.430
TCL A501DL: Yeah, because, I mean, I was doing good things over. I was doing all the shit I need to do.

93
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.290
TCL A501DL: And then I just slipped appliances and this shit happen.

94
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go over here and let's see if this has any applicability. This is something I want to

95
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:52.680
Do

96
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.480
TCL A501DL: Today, anyway. So let's just see

97
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like you got helicopter about that place ears. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

98
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:15.180
TCL A501DL: Know the air compressor just picked on it scared the shit out of me. I forgot there's an air compressor.

99
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Landed on your head.

100
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.540
TCL A501DL: I'll turn off in about a minute or two.

101
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, alright. Well, look at this activity is a reading one anyway. So, it introduces some kind of cool concepts that you're going to hear a lot in group. You'll hear a lot when I'm talking

102
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: To you about the difference between the attic voice.

103
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.760
TCL A501DL: And

104
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Your authentic self. So these are terms that will be useful in future conversation. So I'm going to share the screen with you and we'll do this together. Okay.

105
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.050
TCL A501DL: All right.

106
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

107
00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a really informal way to have a discussion around three concepts. The first concept.

108
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Is recovery mindset.

109
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So although I haven't defined it in here. You kind of pick up on it, but I'll give a basic understanding so recovery mindset is the authentic self. You

110
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That wants you to get into maybe maybe the Navy, the one that wants to finish what you start the one that probably wants health, happiness, whatever it is that you kind of idealize is health recovery mindset, you're honest.

111
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're industrious you keep your promises. You're in a recovery mindset. So that's what that is. And then there's this concept in active addiction, so

112
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: When one

113
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Is in active addiction where omitting you know that word, right. We don't tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth that one, you kind of hold them back so

114
00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, some pretty important details. So there's that. There's straight up line straight up stealing when we're in active edition will do anything to make sure

115
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't own responsibility, accountability and we're probably at times, either already using or pretty much setting our life up or a slip

116
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay that's active addiction, you don't actually have to be using the substance like alcohol.

117
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Or another drug to be in an active addiction mindset. You can be in it and still not using the mood altering substance, but you're just about to. You might be three months away. You might be a year away, but you're setting yourself up. Then there's this one. Look at the difference

118
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this has not this one chemical dependence has nothing to do with a moral compass of lying. This has to do with neuro transmitters has to do with withdrawal as to do a physiological

119
00:13:52.650 --> 00:14:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Dependence okay so this one kind of has that deviation deviation from our moral code. This one we're following our moral code is when we're deviating from our moral code. This one has nothing to do with moral code at all. This is our physiology.

120
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready, set,

121
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.230
TCL A501DL: Yeah, go.

122
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.950

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.350
TCL A501DL: I can read it.

127
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's read it out loud. Let me hear you.

128
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:35.220
TCL A501DL: Oh, I told my supervisor that my son was sick when I really needed a few hours in the morning to score dope because was dope tick. I was astonished, in order to avoid the responsibility.

129
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think's going on there.

130
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Could be multiple things.

131
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:42.300
TCL A501DL: For me personally,

132
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.760

167
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. But notice how I gave the reader the dope sick. You're right. So if it was, if we were just looking at dope sick. It would be chemical dependence that is 100% on point.

168
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm steering the reader to focus somewhere else. Where am I steering the reader to focus on in here.

TCL A501DL: This honesty. Yeah.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:13.110

171
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:21.120

Gwenevere Abriel: It's not in health, happiness, long term. It's in short term, let me just feel good now. Okay, that one took us a while to see how we do on the next one, do the same exact thing. Notice that I give really

180
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Clear hints on where to focus and sometimes it is a dual answer, but this is getting your brain really working today. So if I hadn't read the SEC. Second one.

190
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Isolating if I want to. If I want to drink if I want a drug.

191

192
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:52.290

193
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.580

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now

200
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:34.680
What's that, let me

201
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, so tolerance is a physiological experience and I said tolerance means you need more and more. So for example, you don't

202
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't get a buzz a higher intoxication probably any more from a half a glass of beer. You now need three shots.

203
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And four beers. That's tolerance. We taught, we have, we need more and more and more. That's a part of chemical dependence that has nothing to do with a moral

204
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Decision. That's just your body saying you need more in order to experience euphoria period you got no say on that, you know, you used to be a cheat day he was one beer would do it for you. Now it takes to six packs. Okay, that's tolerance. I got nothing to do with morals.

TCL A501DL: Right, yeah.

206
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:37.500

296
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:56.310
TCL A501DL: Ashamed and could not stand feeling ashamed yesterday, but then I remembered to replace the shame thinking with healthy account and Bill ability with the saw. I am not my bad behaviors.

297
00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:06.660
TCL A501DL: I can be guilty of behavior and still be a good person. I am shifting away from toxic shame replacing it with the guilt that I learned from learn from

Gwenevere Abriel: That our physiology. Our brain has a chemical response. It has tolerance, it has withdrawal. You know when you're hung over. You know when you don't have the alcohol you because you didn't took too much up here. And then the next day you're miserable. That's

303
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a chemical response. It's not like you said, you know what tomorrow. I want to feel like shit.

304
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That just happens without your consent.

310
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To Own it to not sit in guilt or shame to own it. And that was really smart because what that does to the addict inside. Is it says

311
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:30.090
