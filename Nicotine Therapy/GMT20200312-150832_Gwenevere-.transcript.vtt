1
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.060
Daniel Guerrero: Good morning.

2
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing pretty good. My apologies doing one of those bio psychosocial, you know, the ones with all those questions.

3
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.950
Daniel Guerrero: Right, right.

4
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: They never are exactly 60 minutes it's

5
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.500
Daniel Guerrero: Possible right

6
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I sure had been thinking about you're wondering if you're reaching your limit with that Java years have you been doing

7
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.120
Daniel Guerrero: Well, you know, it's kind of funny you mentioned that because yesterday. My boss, you know, talks to me pulls me outside. He's like, go.

8
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.510
Daniel Guerrero: Because we'd like to move you.

9
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:05.520
Daniel Guerrero: Have not only the daytime nighttime manager, but also to the daytime manager as well and give you an opportunity to work during the day.

10
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.680
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm like, well, I guess because of a certain person has been calling in quite often. Right. It's an opener.

11
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:25.740
Daniel Guerrero: And then one of the girls at night. You know, it's proven herself that she could run a shift, you know, because we give her one night, you know, week to run a shift and so

12
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:40.050
Daniel Guerrero: But you know, I asked. I asked for more money and I told him, I said, Listen, I don't think you know I'm going to be able to pay my bills, you know, with just the money that I'm making.

13
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.190
Daniel Guerrero: And he's like, well,

14
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.930
Daniel Guerrero: I can't promise you that we're going to move you up, you know, anytime soon.

15
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.450
Daniel Guerrero: But this is what we want. We want to be able to cross train you for the daytime.

16
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:07.470
Daniel Guerrero: I just, I'm just not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing because if he's not willing to, you know, help me move up, but he's willing for me to come in and you know

17
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:18.180
Daniel Guerrero: I guess be a spot jeweler I guess you can call it because basically at the end of the day, that's what I am. Because there's somebody calling in and I'm taking their spot you know that I'm just a spot filler.

18
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me, let me ask you something.

19
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: If it has a title and no compensation money.

20
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That title can land on the resume and that down the line could be great if it's spot fillers meaningless.

21
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you said, okay, you're not willing to compensate me, obviously I deserve this. Then I want the title of the following

22
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So that I can have a letter of recommendation for you. So, this can be a resume building experience for me and I can be learning these skills.

23
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I'll do that for this amount of time and then I do need to see the compensation for this this this work for you when you said spot filler. That's not a title. That's not manager. That's not your. So what does that mean, like, what

24
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you benefiting from from this

25
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.250
Daniel Guerrero: Well, you know, the only benefit would have is that I would be able to be home, you know, during the day to see my kids you know cuz I

26
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.550
Daniel Guerrero: You know I get up in the morning I take my kids to school. I come home, they're asleep, you know, get up in the morning, take them to school.

27
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.930
Yeah.

28
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.740
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, can't do. I can't interact with them in

29
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:47.190
Daniel Guerrero: And you know, it's something that it's important to me is their education because I don't have one. So it's important for me to drive for them to have an education right

30
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:56.700
Daniel Guerrero: And so, you know, I like to study with my kids, you know, pick their in the second, third, and fourth grade, and I'm still learning from them, you know,

31
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm leaving. Seriously, and there's learning stuff. I saw

32
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: A sixth grader. I'm like,

33
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

34
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.190
Daniel Guerrero: I know my daughter, she's you know she's the kidney garden going to first grade, and she's already learning place value.

35
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Kiss me

36
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.080
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I'm like, I didn't learn place value. I was like in seventh grade know and now they're teaching it and kidney guardian.

37
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If they're going too fast, in my opinion, but I'll keep my my opinion of myself.

38
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, so, okay, you want to spend time. So the upside is a work, family life balance. I get to spend

39
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.580
time with my family.

40
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And what he what he was talking about money. How did that land with you.

41
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.000
Daniel Guerrero: Well, the one that brought it up right because I'm like

42
00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:01.200
Daniel Guerrero: At the beginning of the year, I guess like minimum wage went up in New Mexico to like $9. I don't know if you went up everywhere, but I know in New Mexico, it went up to $9 an hour.

43
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.940
Daniel Guerrero: And

44
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.170
Daniel Guerrero: You know we have some employees that were only making

45
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.870
Daniel Guerrero: You know 757 making hate. And so when this initial

46
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.170
Daniel Guerrero: employment rates went up to $9 an hour.

47
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.700
Daniel Guerrero: Those who were making 750 or those who are making eight

48
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.540
Daniel Guerrero: You know, got a dramatic you know ratings.

49
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.660
Daniel Guerrero: And to where I was already above $9 an hour. I was making

50
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.200
Daniel Guerrero: And he moved me to 10 bucks. You know, I kind of felt insulted. Honestly, because

51
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.020
Daniel Guerrero: Up. I mean, I want to be honest.

52
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:58.050
Daniel Guerrero: Not, not because I you know I feel like did I deserved, you know, whatever dollar whatever else that everyone else got it, no one else's basically worth the money that we're paying them.

53
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.760
Yeah, I believe. Yeah.

54
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:11.280
Daniel Guerrero: And so they're making $9 an hour and they're, they're still working at that 750 rate, you know, they're not picking it up there. They're still slacking, you know,

55
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:21.990
Daniel Guerrero: And I have to pick up a lot of that slack, you know, being the night manager. You know, I don't want, I don't want the store manager and the owner coming in.

56
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:31.200
Daniel Guerrero: You know, to a CD store because that kind of makes me looks, you know, so, so I make sure everything is is done. And even if I have to do it myself.

57
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now we've been here before. So

58
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Today is a day where we review your goals. So let's let's shift gears just somewhat see if how you're doing. One of them is I want to build a resume. There were some challenges with some technology has that been resolved for you still kind of

59
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.600

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:10.500
Daniel Guerrero: My resume or something like that. And well, for I don't know how the hell they happen but it ended up on my Gmail and so I guess what this

61
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.670
Daniel Guerrero: This app does is it picks up local jobs in town.

62
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:29.580
Daniel Guerrero: And you fill out the resume and then you go to, like, for example, if Arby's is hiring you click on it, you fill out the application and automatically send the resume with the application.

63
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.280
Daniel Guerrero: Okay and so

64
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:39.960
Daniel Guerrero: But it's just a plain Jane resume is just like like your name subtitle yeah employment history.

65
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.650
Daniel Guerrero: Education, you know, and

88
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.400
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it kind of sucks because it's not just like a

89
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:30.180
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, it's like one of the worst felonies. It could be, you know, possession of controlled substance with the intent to traffic and that's that's a pretty tough felony to, you know,

90
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:45.570
Daniel Guerrero: And you know, when employer see that you know intent to traffic or possession. You know of a controlled substance to the Controlled Substances methamphetamines they automatically just blow that application in the trash. You know, they don't want, they don't want to do it.

91
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.460
Daniel Guerrero: And so I'm in August.

92
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.170

Yeah, that's

95
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:17.100
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, so like we're almost there. No two and a half years. And so in those two and a half years when I'm trying to do is, you know, trying to build up the good work resume, you know, have some kind of education so that when I get ready to go into this, you know, they can overlook that

96
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:25.080
Daniel Guerrero: But I haven't been in any trouble sense, then you know not. I don't even have to, you know,

97
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.050
Daniel Guerrero: Like

98
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:37.620
Daniel Guerrero: Numerous times understand charge because of probation or parole no standards in New Mexico reverse that.

99
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.060
Daniel Guerrero: They sent me back to prison for being late going home.

100
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:52.050
Daniel Guerrero: From work, you know, they're like, oh, you should have called us and told us you would be like going on. I was like, well, I think it was that big a deal. You know what I mean.

101
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:59.550
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I'm coming home from work and I like I've come home from the globe know so they decided to go ahead and send me back to prison on that.

102
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.820
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, so it's just a bunch of like Petty, petty stuff that you know

103
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:14.370
Daniel Guerrero: I've been back and forth. And that's a pretty good resume for myself as a criminal going back and forth to prison because I'm sure they can see all that once

104
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I know but

105
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:18.570
It.

106
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.570
Daniel Guerrero: Doesn't it seem like the choices either go back to

107
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That line.

108
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.110
Daniel Guerrero: Or lean in and go ahead and you do that.

Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's a pain in the butt to hold all that BS like you got to keep your story straight. Which one did I tell what to

121
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to run that game. And now it's just, I've got to hold myself accountable.

122
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm telling you, you may not know you're going to feel really good about yourself and, I believe, Daniel. I know I keep saying this to you and I don't say it to everyone. You're going to just keep showing up in person to these places that you're going to want to work be a driver.

123
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just tell them I know you see the ink. I know you're going to see this on my background.

124
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me a chance. Here's my story. I did it for this and this reasons I'm not that man anymore. I have changed in the following ways. Please give me a chance. I won't let you down, please. And you

125
00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Hang in there. The first guy no second guy no third guy. Maybe we don't know when. But you keep showing up someone's going to give you a chance

Gwenevere Abriel: I really do believe that, you know, and that's all

Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know, and I believe you know and chances. I believe in second chances. That's why I always give them, you know,

128
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:24.300
Daniel Guerrero: You know, especially like when my kids, you know, they always on some bullshit. You know, but I'm just like,

129
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:36.930
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know, I look over it, you know. It's that it's that petty shit. You know, I try not to hold on to pity shit. You know, I try not to hold on to it too long. Yes. At first, it just seems like

130
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:47.910
Daniel Guerrero: I like for real like down. But then, I've just like you know about 10 minutes later, I'm just like, is just updating you know you're trying to hold on to that shit so

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm checking in on on goals. I want to spend more time with the Lord and in prayer. Last time we touch base on this. It was about January 22

132
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You had shared i highly believe in Jesus Christ. There are teachings that we have to submit. If I put myself last I can step back and say, let me provide for you. Get out of the way and serve you better. Okay, I believe that's what Jesus is teaching us

133
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:20.940
Daniel Guerrero: So,

134
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: For you. Now, when you think about the relationship between the Lord in prayer.

135
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And your mental health or the Lord in prayer and your recovery. What's the relationship between your relationship with the Lord and your prayer and your goals around. I don't know whether you think of it as mental health or recovery, different people think about it differently.

136
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:56.100
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, tell me, Oh, I understand. I understand what you're saying. Um, for me, it's, it's like I couldn't

137
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:03.840
Daniel Guerrero: I wouldn't be able to be in sobriety that I am right now, you know, without him no cuz he's

138
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.110
Daniel Guerrero: You know, he guides. My overstep

139
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:25.710
Daniel Guerrero: As go on, you know, I'm not as faithful as I should be. But I think that he I think God that he's faithful knowing he's faithful. You were unfaithful, you know He loves us and we're unlovable. And so for me, that's very important because

140
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.460
Daniel Guerrero: Without him. I wouldn't have what I have today, I'll probably wouldn't even be the person I am today, you know,

141
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:43.950
Daniel Guerrero: Without him I'd probably be, you know, I don't know, who knows worse off, probably still in prison, even with the longer case, you know, or whatever because you know

142
00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:51.360
Daniel Guerrero: Or even or even with my family, you know, because you know he has put my family back together because you know we were

143
00:15:52.980 --> 00:16:06.660
Daniel Guerrero: YOU KNOW, YOU EVER, EVER SEEN Window shatters like if you just grab it and just drop it, how it shatters on the see Matt that's how my family was we were just scattered no broken glass everywhere.

144
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.810
Daniel Guerrero: But today, you know,

145
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:19.560
Daniel Guerrero: We're pretty we're pretty much done. We're pretty back together. And you know, that's all 3am and I was nothing that I've done is directed at my wife's done

146
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:31.800
Daniel Guerrero: You know so and that's something that we do in our house, you know we we try to have a Bible study you know couple times a week in my own, you know, we try to study with my kids a lot

147
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:47.190
Daniel Guerrero: And you know, we make sure that you know they know that Jesus loves them more than we do. You know what I mean, because we would never be able to love our kids as much as God there's and so we make sure that they know that so that's important to us.

148
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is a goal, you've set for yourself, not my goal short

149
00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to look at it again. I, I heard you talking about how important it is to

150
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.820
Daniel Guerrero: Someone every day.

151
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's measure it, because it's a goal. So we got to know when it's reached

152
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:07.920
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

153
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to spend more. This is you.

154
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: See, you want to spend more time with the Lord in prayer. Let's see if

155
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: We can measure it.

156
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:16.680
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

157
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know you haven't reached that goal. Why

158
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.380
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, I just I just know what happened.

159
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.150
Because

160
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:36.270
Daniel Guerrero: I'm always too preoccupied. You know I'm always I'm always busy, you know, and that's an excuse you know it's it's a sorry ass excuse you know to be honest with you, because

161
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:45.870
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you're never too busy to make time for for someone who is, you know, loving you, the way he does holding you down the way he does.

162
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.180
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's so

163
00:17:48.360 --> 00:18:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: How will you measure this. Sometimes it's in time. Sometimes it's a frequency. Sometimes it's the way you're doing it. That's a way you can measure yourself and you put it in time. Your goal you put it in a framework of time.

164
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So if that's how you're measuring yourself go in side and just assess time today. This year, this month. Let's go this month this month when I assess how much time I spent

165
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: With the Lord in prayer. It's this number. And you might say, I would like it to be this number. Once you figure out those numbers and take take a few minutes right now and do that, and then I'd like to hear, Oh, I'm at this Michael used to be at this

166
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take some time to think about

167
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.910
Daniel Guerrero: I think that, uh,

168
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:05.460
Daniel Guerrero: You know, my, my initial goal was, you know you personally is at least an hour, you know,

169
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:18.990
Daniel Guerrero: An hour a day, you know, to give you know to give to him because you know we can do an hour a day. We can get up, you know, go to bed early get up at six o'clock in the morning or whatever, you know, before I take the kids to school and

170
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.410
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just have a cup of coffee and, you know, sit back and read the word and you will have time to meditate.

171
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:27.630
Daniel Guerrero: With prayer.

172
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.070
Daniel Guerrero: But I just we have I just haven't done it, you know, and it's

173
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Much you doing

174
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.310
Daniel Guerrero: I'm not, you might be lucky if you get two minutes, I'll be right now. We honestly

175
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Day well

176
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's where we're at. We're two minutes for about what 58 short

177
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.220
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, we're

178
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: We're 58 minutes right okay so Glenn reports currently spending about two

179
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: In I'm on divided

180
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Meditation slush prayer and once an hour day. Okay, got it.

181
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:17.400
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because, you know, once I believe you know because I've done it before, you know, the more time that you spend with them, it becomes

182
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.700
Daniel Guerrero: It just becomes second to, you know what I mean, it's like walking, you know. So before you know it you're just

183
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:37.680
Daniel Guerrero: Everyday of your every moment of your time. You know, you're just, you're just having a conversation with him in your head, you know, just doing your thing with them and you know you're always asking, you know, for guidance and reference and he's always providing that for you.

184
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:39.720
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because

185
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:50.850
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you know, when you're in prison, you know, we have all this time. Right. And everybody says all you go to prison and find Jesus, you go to prison, you find God, you know, this is an excuse. But you know, I bring them with me, you know,

186
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:52.380
Daniel Guerrero: What I mean

187
00:20:52.830 --> 00:21:09.270
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, no I you know I try to go to church every Sunday. But I don't make it every Sunday. You know, I try to make it, you know. So, you know, we go at least twice a month, you know, and when honestly you know there's church, about six days a week, and we're only going twice a month, you know, that's

188
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.110
Daniel Guerrero: That's, that's, you know, that's damn excuse you know

189
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:21.780
Daniel Guerrero: We should be making it all the time. We should be at least making it you know I'm off on Sundays. You know, it's the one day that I am on I should be at least making it that day.

190
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:29.460
Daniel Guerrero: You know, instead of, you know, making excuses. I'm too tired or, you know, oh we got up late. We went to bed late, you know,

191
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.960
Daniel Guerrero: I was just

192
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's touch base on another one. Let's touch base on another goal. Today's lightly touching on how you assess how you're doing. Okay, so you've got another goal you

193
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Got a few here.

194
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I want more self control, you mentioned something earlier on a different topic which had to do with that you haven't been holding

195
00:21:50.580 --> 00:22:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Resentment you my words, not yours. You said holding on to. So I'm guessing you're saying to me, I've not been holding onto resentment and anger for petty things. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm guessing it's that your children are

196
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of given you an attitude or not compliant with something you're asking, and you don't remain angry, but I'd rather hear right around this writing here.

197
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: self control. See, this is, this is one of those really like we can say self control, but how are you measuring self control again, much like the prayer.

198
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you showing up as self control. Now, how will you know when it's better in the future. Right. So we want to be able to measure it. Where will it show up. Hey,

199
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: When my son catches an attitude he raises his voice I no longer raise mine that will be evidence for me that I am in more self control.

200
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Another one.

201
00:22:52.920 --> 00:23:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be I noticed. Now I remember to breathe. I walk outside for 10 minutes I come back, and then I, whatever. So I'm giving you examples of ways that people measure themselves and how they're doing around self control Daniel How do you measure your self control.

202
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.630
Daniel Guerrero: You know, uh,

203
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.870
Daniel Guerrero: I do take more time.

204
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:31.320
Daniel Guerrero: You know, to try to look at the whole picture. The whole scenario, I guess. I don't know if that's the right word, but you know I just I just tried to look at it, you know, look at all of it, instead of immediately blowing up now.

205
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.790
Daniel Guerrero: Because before I'd be like, I first offense was, you know,

206
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:37.860
Daniel Guerrero: You know, like

207
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.370
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I would get upset you know like

208
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.640
Daniel Guerrero: Um, but now it's

209
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:55.830
Daniel Guerrero: It's more time, you know, I take more time, you know, I do a the box breathing when it gets to really get too too intense. I'm just like,

210
00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:58.200
Daniel Guerrero: Whoa.

211
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:13.140
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it goes over here and then come back to it and it's just like, yeah, no, it's just like, you're not going to listen anyway. You're not gonna do it anyway. You're never going to grow up, you're always going to be the same.

212
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:27.900
Daniel Guerrero: If I you know I try to lead by example. And if you can't see the example I'm setting for you, then you're never going to see it, you know, basically. So I see that now and it's just like, you know, because I was watching

213
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:34.830
Daniel Guerrero: I was watching this guy on TV. His name is TD Jakes and he's a pastor in Dallas, Texas.

214
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:43.830
Daniel Guerrero: And we were talking about that. Oh, he was talking about that petty, you know, it's just Petty's like Petty's like

215
00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:52.020
Daniel Guerrero: You know, if it's not affecting you. And it's, you know, and he made a really good point because it's like

216
00:24:53.310 --> 00:25:06.180
Daniel Guerrero: And this is the way he the point that he made. He was like, if they take your money you're working, you have a job, you can make more okay I get that, you know, and if you let somebody you know

217
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.960
Daniel Guerrero: Take the way you conduct yourself.

218
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:19.530
Daniel Guerrero: Then you're falling, you're, you're, you're being petty if you're allowing somebody to change the way your vibe, you are you're you're changing the way

219
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:40.110
Daniel Guerrero: You react to something. And so like I tried it, I try to reflect on that. I'm just like, why am I gonna let this person ruin my dream. You know, because I'm having a pretty good day, you know, after that so small, blow it up into something is so big. Why am I going to do that, you know, so

220
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:50.160
Daniel Guerrero: It was just, you know, stress relievers that you know I'm having like my bills. Yeah, I have built up the ass but

221
00:25:50.700 --> 00:26:03.900
Daniel Guerrero: I can't control them all at once. I can tell them, little by little, so I don't you know i don't i don't worry about them anymore. I can control what I can control and what is out of my control or then you know that's above my pay rate. So I just let it go.

222
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: There's going to be things so

223
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you just described.

224
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You can call it anything self talk, you're able to use thought

225
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To shift, whether you need to yell at this person get them to change you're able to use your thoughts to bring the worry down

226
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do, you're doing that, you're, you're, think of something and you're like, oh, this is silly. I'm not going to worry about it right now. It's not something I can control.

227
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's addressing your mood. That's addressing the immediate feeling

228
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but it's a little different when it's with a child. And let me just add this

229
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic for addressing the mood. Once we're calm, we're in a con body, we can think better. We talked about that. Right.

230
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But the

231
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Situation itself. The lesson. Let's say you wanted to teach a child is still there.

232
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:14.520
Daniel Guerrero: So,

233
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not quite. We're not. They're not mutually exclusive. You get to always come right bring yourself to a rational, reasonable state, but the lesson, the role of being father, the desire to have son understand something. Learn something right to shape his behavior.

234
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: may continue. Notice how earlier you said

235
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I lead by example. He'll either get it or a while.

236
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember I was talking to you about how the

237
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: brain isn't fully developed until about age 27 for for boys.

238
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.050
Right.

239
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's even more significantly

240
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Different or a brain that has any kind of attention difficulties, if a child's ever been diagnosed with

241
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: An attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There's going to be even more under development of the executive functioning. That's the frontal lobe.

242
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: No amount of modeling, no matter how amazingly successful you are he's going to make a difference.

243
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.420
So I can make a difference.

244
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be really hard to hear.

245
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.440
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I'd say that should

246
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. Well, wait, you can flip it pretty quick. Watch. If you had wanted when you were coming up.

247
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And you ran across something on a TV show or in the city. You saw somewhere like he's got a nice ride your look like he's got his shit together right you're looking at him.

248
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Why didn't you do it that way. He's a good role model.

249
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not enough, it's not enough.

250
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and it's no disrespect to to the fact that there it is. I remember I talked about the brain. It's not just, it's not just a floating fact

251
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It means that there are parts of the brain that are under developed the ones that you and I, you know, that one where you can now use your brain and think this isn't worth it. I'm not going to pop off on this person.

252
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the part of the brain that's not developed in the kid, the one that can use for thought. The one that can say if then cause effect this. This is not, I can postpone immediate gratification for a long term goal. That's the part of the brain. It's not developed

253
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You wanting it to be there would be. Believe me, I feel, yeah, it would be so convenient if you know my five year old had it and he planned out his little morning my seven year

254
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:00.210
Daniel Guerrero: That

255
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Those little brains are not developed that way.

256
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

257
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:06.060
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

258
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you got some people walking in not you want to say goodbye to your wife or something.

259
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.220
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, she's about to leave work.

260
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.560
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, sorry about that.

261
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:15.960
Daniel Guerrero: What are you saying

262
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.820
Daniel Guerrero: Are you saying

263
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:26.430
Daniel Guerrero: Give you his penny.

264
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.020
Daniel Guerrero: Are going to give

265
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.420
Daniel Guerrero: Us your thing this morning.

266
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.760
Daniel Guerrero: All right. Love you.

267
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:36.420
Daniel Guerrero: Bye.

268
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:39.750
Daniel Guerrero: All right. Sorry about that.

269
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So just to review.

270
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that stuff's hard to hear.

271
00:30:45.420 --> 00:31:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep in mind, you're going to need a lot of compassion, as you go. This self compassion because you're modeling it didn't have it didn't have good role modeling. It was abusive. I mean, it just there was lots of missed opportunities for good parenting when you were coming up.

272
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.350
Daniel Guerrero: Right there really was.

273
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:05.850
Daniel Guerrero: No.

274
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but it's not too late. It's really not because when you learn new ways of parenting your children it heals you along the way to it does. It'll. It'll feel kind of uncomfortable at first, but it's like, oh,

275
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I trust my child that I can shape this behavior. I can both be firm consistent, reliable.

276
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't have to get upset. I'm just going to follow through with what I said I'm going to follow through. I'm not going to abuse physically or emotionally. I'm just gonna be consistent.

277
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But role modeling. It's done enough

278
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Plenty of

279
00:31:49.590 --> 00:32:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Plant parents don't do drugs crime and their children are doing. It doesn't work like that. It just doesn't. We have to shape it we've got to be sort of involved in shaping that behavior. My guess is, you're not quite sure what to do.

280
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.070
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, well, you know,

281
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:15.570
Daniel Guerrero: For my my younger kids you know I have, I have some younger kids you know they're 10 eight

282
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.500
Daniel Guerrero: Seven as soon to be six.

283
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:29.370
Daniel Guerrero: So what I have done what my wife and I have done there's, you know, we've enrolled him and activities to keep them busy.

284
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:40.020
Daniel Guerrero: And, you know, we've we've signed him up for softball my two older my 19 year old we signed him up for softball.

285
00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:46.110
Daniel Guerrero: And my son is eight. We put him in taekwondo

286
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:47.940
Daniel Guerrero: And then

287
00:32:48.990 --> 00:33:01.260
Daniel Guerrero: My youngest daughter, you know, she's flipping between cheerleading and dance and karate. And, you know, she just wants to do everything right, but she doesn't want she doesn't know exactly, so

288
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:13.530
Daniel Guerrero: But for us, you know, we take it. It's important you know to keep them busy keep them occupied to do something else besides sit around the house would be under down tablets and phones all damn day you know where

289
00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:23.580
Daniel Guerrero: Versus these other kids that are teenagers that should be setting the example for my younger kids are just stuck at home on their down phones or, you know,

290
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:31.080
Daniel Guerrero: Not doing shit, you know, so I so I'm like down. I can't reach them so I better start trying to reach these ones, you know,

291
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:42.810
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and I give them responsibilities, you know, for example, my son's when they come home every day. They know that throughout the garbage and now you know put trash bags in the garbage cans and, you know, and it's just a little shit, you know,

292
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:54.450
Daniel Guerrero: Before you go to school in the morning, you know, make sure you pick up your dirty clothes in the hamper, you know, make sure your doors are all pushed in and make sure there's no clothes, you know, coming out of your joy, you know, just little shit, you know,

293
00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:05.400
Daniel Guerrero: To me it's just little shit. But to me, I think that, you know, getting them to do these things as teaching them responsibility at the same time. And so that's something that I try to pour into them.

294
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:11.970
Daniel Guerrero: And you know, it's like this morning on my way to work. I mean, I'm away taking my daughter to school.

295
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:26.250
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I had a conversation with them. I said, Look, man, I want you to be completely open minded. We're about to tell you, but I think this is what you're doing wrong and you know we'd like for you to improve in these areas because I know that you're worth it. I know that you can do it.

296
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:38.580
Daniel Guerrero: And usually that turns into this big old thing like you just don't get me, you know, and this and that. But instead of that it was like, all right, Dad. I'll try harder, you know,

297
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:45.990
Daniel Guerrero: And it to me that made me feel good, you know, she goes, You're right, Dad, I could be trying harder. You know, I could be doing things differently.

298
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:55.020
Daniel Guerrero: And you know I want. I'll try to do better. I'm like, all right, cool, you know. And to me, that kind of feel good, you know, because it didn't turn into a big argument.

299
00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:02.010
Daniel Guerrero: You know, so when I approach things when I approach things in the dude, I've noticed that when I approach things in a different manner.

300
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:12.390
Daniel Guerrero: I get a better response, you know, but if I like of auditory. You know what I think you're doing. I think you're fucking up and you're not, you know, putting your mind until you're not working that hard.

301
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:23.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and then her responses have been like I got, you know, I'll go to school or anybody else. And I, you know, instead of it turned into a big argument you know I approached it with it, you know.

302
00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:31.890
Daniel Guerrero: You know, keep, keep yourself open minded to this, you know, and so it turned into something better. I just

303
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.850
Nice.

304
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So if it's working. Keep doing it right.

305
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:37.950
Daniel Guerrero: Right, right.

306
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: eilis. Keep it up.

307
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:53.850
Daniel Guerrero: I didn't know that. Another thing that I've noticed I've catch myself doing too is like, you know, before they would. They're always on their phones, you know, they're always looking at, you know, Facebook, whatever the hell they're doing and so

308
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.740
Daniel Guerrero: You know, before that I there would be like a day. Check this shit out. And I'm like,

309
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:06.060
Daniel Guerrero: My damn really man like I'm busy, you know, but instead I'm finding time to be like, All right, let me check it out, you know,

310
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

311
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:13.890
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, then let me dig into what they're what they're digging and that way you know it can build some kind of communication, other than

312
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:25.290
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you need to do something better with your time. You don't want to go wash dishes or something, you know, financial, the better to do. Right. You know, so I dig into their time a little bit and I you know I see a better response, you know, to that and

313
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:36.660
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I just I just feel like it's important to know it's important to them. And I think I should be putting a decent little effort into their importance, you know, and just trying it out with them so

314
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice.

315
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.280
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

316
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

317
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:46.890
So,

318
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: In general, I would say, it sounds like the goals that you set for yourself, you're clipping right along.

319
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything that's going to throw you off.

320
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.650

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Well, keep up the good work and be curious to see how this how this works out with this job.

358
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.240
Daniel Guerrero: You definitely. Yeah, me too. Because like

359
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:29.340
Daniel Guerrero: I know

360
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:38.430
Daniel Guerrero: I hate to be selfish, right, because I'm thankful that I even have a job, you know, there's some people out there that are struggling to get a job, especially at the pay rate that I'm feeling right now.

361
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:51.810
Daniel Guerrero: But I mean it didn't happen overnight. You know, I've been here almost a year and I did when I told this dude that i when i at the interview, you know. He's uh, he's asking me, he goes like or what is your desired

362
00:40:52.470 --> 00:41:04.470
Daniel Guerrero: Number. Yeah. And I'm like, I want to 10 books do you know because I'm worked it, you know, and it took me a whole year to get the 10 books and now he's all like, well, I checked the $10 you know like you originally wanted. I'm like, whoa.

363
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.540
Daniel Guerrero: We're gonna if we're gonna talk like that, then I should be at 1150

364
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:18.930
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because I I asked you to bring the unit 10 you brought me in at 815 now I made the change and you're like, Well, I got to attend or you wanted like like he's

365
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel. That's a game that's a word game and he's winning another way. Another way to approach it is

366
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to continue to see incremental raises that are based on cost of living. That's another conversation that's not the word game he's setting. It could be every six months. I'd like to be reevaluated like to be based on

367
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Performance, I'd like to. You see it's very different than he's playing a word game.

368
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:48.480
And he's winning

369
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:50.250
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

370
00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:57.330
Daniel Guerrero: And, you know, is and I think it's bullshit. You know, because you know I'm going to be honest, you know, like

371
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:09.450
Daniel Guerrero: You know, he is the owner of this place, but he's only been owning the plate. I've been working longer and and this kind of business that he's been out been an owner and you know he's never done this before in his life.

372
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:24.690
Daniel Guerrero: But like his dad's a senator, you know, he was. He's the governor of New Mexico, his dad's over New Mexico. So he feels like he's like super knowledgeable and all this shit, you know, any. I mean, he might have a high school diploma or whatever associates degree, whatever the hell he has

373
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.280
Daniel Guerrero: But

374
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:37.080
Daniel Guerrero: I mean I guess I don't think that gives him a right. You know what I mean. So I just feel like he's looking down at me. It's just like a labor guy or something like that is how I feel, you know, but

375
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All of that might be true, but you you agreed.

376
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's the most uncomfortable part of it all is to say

377
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm, I'm the one that said, I will tolerate this

378
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:50.640
Daniel Guerrero: And

379
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Tolerate it because my options are limited, I have this felony stuff following me around.

380
00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:56.730
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, man.

381
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:57.600
Daniel Guerrero: I know

382
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's really uncomfortable.

383
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But you are, but you're not diminished by that Daniel, you're, you're just as low will, you're just as wonderful

384
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The tricky bit is to to hold on to that.

385
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.610
Daniel Guerrero: And really

386
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, you're worth when someone else.

387
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Is playing that word game with you right he he may be exploiting you but that might be exactly what's happening. The part where you get your power back is realizing you're saying a yes to it.

388
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this. I'm not saying go drop it. No way, I'm not giving advice. I'm just saying when you can own the fact that

389
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're feeling limited you're tolerating this kind of treatment because your options are a little limited right now. That's it. It's circumstantial, guess what circumstances are going to change. And he's probably always going to be a turkey.

390
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: He ain't changing but your circumstance is going to change.

391
00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I highly invite you to keep

392
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing what you're doing, which is getting education me tell you about education. Ain't nobody can take it from you.

393
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your that's yours forever. You know that you know that with your children, you get training you get education that's yours.

394
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That experience that's yours. No one can diminish you from that. I think this is just circumstantial, I think it's going to change.

395
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But just take take the power back in a sense, no I choose to be here. I'm deciding, I'm not. I'm this is I'm going to go work on the education part I'll be doing this $10 an hour thing.

396
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, but but whatever your boss's name is I'll call him, Joe. Hey Joe right in your mind, Joe, I know what you're up to. You're taking advantage of me because I'm freaking stuck.

397
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.920
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah and you know that's that's something that we've talked about my wife and I to it's like

398
00:44:53.970 --> 00:45:02.520
Daniel Guerrero: It's like, where do you honestly when a my mom. My mom. She was like, totally different in this guy to she's like Daniel Where are you going to go get a job as painting $10 an hour.

399
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:09.900
Daniel Guerrero: And she goes, Are you going to quit that job and go get another job they're going to pay you $9 an hour and you're not going to be able to, you know,

400
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:18.210
Daniel Guerrero: Make the money you make. And then on top of that, it's like a child support is garnish down in my check you know they're

401
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:28.110
Daniel Guerrero: Nice. So like if I quit this job, then my child support stops and I become late on my payment until I find another job and then it takes 30 days for them.

402
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:36.390
Daniel Guerrero: Or you know 45 days for them to get the child support transferred to this other job. And so then I lose a month and I get further behind.

403
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.050
Daniel Guerrero: Right, yeah. And they already took my

404
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:54.270
Daniel Guerrero: My tax return. That's a whole different story. But, uh, but anyway, so it's like yeah I'm stuck. I'm in a position where I'm stuck. And, you know, you're, you're exactly right. And that's where I'm at right now with it, you know, because

405
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That that's going to change. Daniel

406
00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:58.230
Yeah.

407
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Change. You keep I just that stuff you're talking about about showing up and still getting that education during these two years and you keep

408
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: open minded like you invite your daughter staying open stay in conversation. Yeah, looking for a job that brings a little higher income, little more opportunity you know anybody

409
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got this felony kind of following me around, you know, the employers kind of easy breezy give Second Chance kind of things you just keep keep that conversation open

410
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:28.680
I

411
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you hang in there for it. Don't give up on you. I think you're going to, I think you're going to find your way, but it's the sitting there thinking this is hopeless. That gets us into negative thinking, this will never change. That's the dangerous one right there.

412
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.290
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

413
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:53.820

414
00:46:54.540 --> 00:47:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: He's always going to be a turd. So that's his problem I'll tolerate him for a little while because my options. I've got only a few here, but so that's that changes. And that's exciting. This is only temporary.
