00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.390
Rosamaria Romero: You know, just really hurting inside this morning.

14
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.480

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is, this won't take us very long.

18
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have to do what's called a bio psychosocial on you and I just ask you a bunch of questions.

19
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.730
Rosamaria Romero: Okay.

20
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really pretty simple. Okay.

21
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.910
Hmm.

22
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, what has what brought you to Brian heart.

23
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:32.100
Rosamaria Romero: Okay, um, long story short, will have brought me back to break our health is a I ended up having a baby. I went through a lot of major

24
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.860
Rosamaria Romero: Have you say I'm it's already I can think of.

25
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

26
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.060
Rosamaria Romero: I went through a lot of major

27
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.290
Rosamaria Romero: Oh just describe it. So when I had my, my son.

28
00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:03.390
Rosamaria Romero: They, they were pulling the placenta out of it a birthing it and I didn't want to stop meeting. So I went through it. They took me to emergency to on an emergency.

29
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:21.150
Rosamaria Romero: Surgery did a DNC on me, which they put a balloon and said to me, and then after that, they had did a partial hysterectomy on me. So, and now I'm I'm dealing with two sisters inside of me and i mean i

30
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.630
Rosamaria Romero: I I'm getting pains inside all inside of and all inside of me.

31
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.690
Rosamaria Romero: It feels like labor pains, like it's so painful. So what brought me back to bright heart health is up.

32
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.480
Rosamaria Romero: The doctors offered me to to either

33
00:03:43.620 --> 00:04:04.710
Rosamaria Romero: Get back on on a program for open orphan being that that helped me for pain in the past or they wanted to start it back on the oxy cotton and like the purpose sense, etc. And I not want to go back to those because they just, they don't work for me. They don't last long. They're

34
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:23.040
Rosamaria Romero: I mean, they're just not worth it. They're just don't worry. Um, so that's what brought me back to you guys is because the whooping orphan helps with the pain so much more. And so much longer than that and oxycodone or or or Percocet.

35
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And your pain level right now. What is it between on a scale of one to 10

36
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.650
Rosamaria Romero: Oh right now I'm like out about oh

37
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:46.320
Rosamaria Romero: I just I just took my hand, my, my half of savvy tax so it's kind of work. You know, I'm like, like about like in between six and seven right now.

38
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.490
Okay.

39
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And any history of addiction.

40
00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:07.140
Rosamaria Romero: Addiction. Um, no I wouldn't say that that I have a history of addiction, but I can't lie, that, that, of course, I've had my my times of

41
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.660
Rosamaria Romero: Of, you know,

42
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.150
Rosamaria Romero: How could I say it like, like for instance, when I had first started oxycodone when I was

43
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.980
Rosamaria Romero: About 15 years old, the doctors got me started on them bad the really, really, really badly.

44
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:45.450
Rosamaria Romero: And that's, that's the, that's the one time, I can say that I was honestly addicted to them. So yes, I've have had problems with with addiction before but I've learned my lesson because I was 16 years old and they're prescribing me so many pain medicine due to me, having

45
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.150
Rosamaria Romero: A juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

46
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.080
Rosamaria Romero: While back

47
00:05:52.260 --> 00:06:01.890
Rosamaria Romero: And it was juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. So in the winter. I tend to suffer like a real law when it's cold.

48
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.790
Rosamaria Romero: Do you think so. Um, so, yes. At that time I yes I was suffering from addiction and

49
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:25.140
Rosamaria Romero: You know, it was really, really hard because my doctor that was prescribing me that started me on all this medication like above and beyond a little too much.

50
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.000
Rosamaria Romero: He was giving me about five different types of payment payment anyway. So long story short,

51
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:51.780
Rosamaria Romero: I ended up know the doctor ended up just leaving just out of nowhere. He just got up and just left with no word. So he just like, pretty much. I just got cut off. Cold turkey. I didn't know what to do. So at that point, I went to this three

52
00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:10.680
Rosamaria Romero: I got what I can get off the streets. Um, I have. I've, I would, you know, try to buy pills. If I could those things that were getting beyond and above expensive.

53
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:23.400
Rosamaria Romero: Nicholas, not, not even worth of that they said they don't even ask. So I'm only be 100% honest with you, of course. So of course I I tried heroin.

54
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.210
Rosamaria Romero: I tried it, I

55
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.220
Rosamaria Romero: I tried it.

56
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.720
Rosamaria Romero: I'm in a meeting. I mean, I'm in a meeting.

57
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:45.510
Rosamaria Romero: So I had have, um, I'd have tried heroin. I tried smoking it the first time.

58
00:07:46.950 --> 00:08:04.890
Rosamaria Romero: And then I tried it through the veins and it's not it's not something I really like I didn't like the way we fell the scariness of overdose seen seen other people overdose. It just scared the heck out of me.

59
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:17.340
Rosamaria Romero: So, um, for for a little bit there, you know, when I couldn't find pills. That's what I would turn to you, um, I you know I would.

60
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:45.750
Rosamaria Romero: try my best to just try to fight the addiction and just get off of it. But like these programs weren't around them and and and like, like if you want it to get into a Suboxone program there was waiting list. I mean, they're packed, you know, etc. On and on and so, so, um, so finally I I finally

61
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.540
Rosamaria Romero: Ended up getting pregnant.

62
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.420
Rosamaria Romero: At 19 years old with my, my daughter, she's 13 now and

63
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.420
Rosamaria Romero: I just said, you know what

64
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:09.030
Rosamaria Romero: I i think i think from what I remember. I think like about a week and a half before I had found out I was pregnant when I was 19

65
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:23.220
Rosamaria Romero: So for so for for three. Wait, the doctor left a year after. So he started me at 16 so at 17 when I got cut off. Full turkey. So for two years. I was dealing with this addiction.

66
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:36.270
Rosamaria Romero: And I'm for about a week and a half. I couldn't find nothing like at all and and I wasn't trying to to do heroin. I wasn't trying to

67
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:53.550
Rosamaria Romero: Find it like I just so I'm so afraid of that stuff. So, um, I believe, from what I remember. I remember, you know, fighting the withdraws like a week and a half. I just do myself in the bed, you know, just

68
00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:01.290
Rosamaria Romero: Went to it for about a week and a half, and then I started feeling different you know my body. I started

69
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:14.970
Rosamaria Romero: Throwing up, um, you know, just like different symptoms that would tell you, you were pregnant my period didn't start. I thought maybe it was because I was withdrawing

70
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:23.310
Rosamaria Romero: Because at the time I was on birth control. So I didn't pregnant. Anyways, to get to the point

71
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:44.910
Rosamaria Romero: So I was I was already kicking for about, like, a week, we can have from what I could remember and I took a pregnancy test. Sure enough, I was pregnant. So I said, You know what, it's already been almost two weeks that I've been fighting this. I might as well, you know, just keep going but

72
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:52.620
Rosamaria Romero: I'm going to see a doctor per Se thought and make sure that it's not going to be dangerous to the baby mate and see like

73
00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:08.640
Rosamaria Romero: They did like a cow scale on me to see how bad I was drawing it was bad enough to harm the baby, etc. So when I went to the doctor. They told me you know how long has it been, by the time I got into to the doctor. It was ready to happen.

74
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:17.490
Rosamaria Romero: Is when they did the cow scale on me. They told me, You know what, you could go ahead and continue from here on out.

75
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:25.950
Rosamaria Romero: Um, without having to do without having to get on the opener from program or starting back on your pillow or anything like that.

76
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:36.210
Rosamaria Romero: So I was like, You know what, that's great. But, but I still felt really really bad, you know, from from withdrawing they said you are still kind of withdrawing, but it will

77
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:47.370
Rosamaria Romero: Terminate won't terminate your pregnancy. Okay, right. You've water all that. So that was it. Okay, so I just said that. You know what, that's it.

78
00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:04.710
Rosamaria Romero: I'm done, I'm pregnant. I'm going to do this. So I did it. I had my daughter. Um, and when I had my daughter. Everything had went well with with with her with the birthing with her, um,

79
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:17.130
Rosamaria Romero: So then after I had had her a they started back again on on narcotics, and of course at that at that point.

80
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:32.310
Rosamaria Romero: I mean, I was young and naive, you know, stupid, so I I went back to them dumb, you know, knowing that I didn't clean for nine months now. Like why would I do this myself. So I ended up back

81
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.290
Rosamaria Romero: Ended up in the same position. Um, but

82
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:55.050
Rosamaria Romero: To me the whole time there has there had been a reason for for why I accepted the the pain, the pain killer back is because it was winter. My daughter was born in November. It was really, really cold.

83
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:08.520
Rosamaria Romero: And I couldn't. I could not deal with with the flaring up and the pain because I flight tend to flare up in my knees, my hands on.

84
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:24.090
Rosamaria Romero: My elbows, you know, just everywhere, we're, we're, we're, I have joined and I just cannot deal with the pain. So I accepted them. I went back to it. I started it over again. Um,

85
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.410
Rosamaria Romero: You know, for quite some time.

86
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.250
Rosamaria Romero: Maybe for about, like, three years or so.

87
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.650
Rosamaria Romero: And and

88
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.330
Rosamaria Romero: I don't let me think, um,

89
00:13:41.130 --> 00:14:04.650
Rosamaria Romero: So I thought I saw in between that time I ended up finding a doctor. A doctor to prescribe me my medication. Amanda, and she she ended up cutting me off because I had missed three appointments and that was just her role if you miss three three appointments there, you know, you have to

90
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:11.640
Rosamaria Romero: Find another doctor so so I ended up on the streets again to doing the same stuff.

91
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:20.670
Rosamaria Romero: And not not so much of the of the heroin. It was more of the narcotics.

92
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:43.680
Rosamaria Romero: Anything. It was a lot less on heroin from the first one. The first time because like I said, it scares me to death. Yeah. So there I was doing it again. I really, really wanted help and I got in touch with you guys. This is my second time with Bret Hart hell and I got in touch.

93
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:55.500
Rosamaria Romero: Oh, no, no. I apologize. Wait, okay, so I I ended up getting pregnant within these years. I ended up getting pregnant again with my six year old son.

94
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:08.250
Rosamaria Romero: So for about, like, five years. I was just with that that doctor before she let me goals with the for about two and a half of those years.

95
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:21.480
Rosamaria Romero: The other like two and a half years or so always on the streets. Just do me you know whatever I could find, you know, just to feel better from this pain. It's the pain that that that kept me addicted. The

96
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.070
Rosamaria Romero: Pain that

97
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:23.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yet, though.

98
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.370
Rosamaria Romero: I do it. So, so, um,

99
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:37.260
Rosamaria Romero: I ended up finding out that I was pregnant. So I had with to Albuquerque. And I found out about this program and it was called a girl.

100
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.560
Rosamaria Romero: Girl program.

101
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:57.870
Rosamaria Romero: At the UNAM hospital. So I went over there and I asked him for help, you know what, okay. So this went on, but I'm telling you, you know, I'm I was on the streets before you know I was doing opiates. I was doing pills. My doctor cut me off.

102
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:04.470
Rosamaria Romero: Because I had missed appointments, etc. I was doing, you know, on heroin.

103
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:15.480
Rosamaria Romero: So they said, No, okay, you're pregnant. We're going to help you immediately. So they got me started on Sunday tix and I was on subby text.

104
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:32.640
Rosamaria Romero: Through my whole pregnancy with my son. And when I was with my first time and when I had him in 2014 he the everything when good birthing when good. Um, he didn't even he didn't even have to be

105
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.480
Rosamaria Romero: dosed he didn't have to go through any of that.

106
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.980
Rosamaria Romero: They check the Callback hell skills on him and

107
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:58.740
Rosamaria Romero: He was fine. You know, because I was walking, you know, drinking a lot of water. I'll take my medication as prescribed there would be times where, where I would just try to just take one pill. Love you know sometimes here in there because I don't want to be withdrawn.

108
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And right. Come on, which

109
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:11.010
Rosamaria Romero: Came out fine. So then after that, when I after I had my son. I'm me la girl from Albuquerque state.

110
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.200
Rosamaria Romero: Prescribing me

111
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.650
Rosamaria Romero: I'm sorry, excuse me.

112
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:32.340
Rosamaria Romero: That's okay, dollar decrease really haven't stopped up in my throat. So, um, he's also kept on prescribing me there for a while for about a year for about a year, year and a half or so. And it got a got hard on me because

113
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:50.040
Rosamaria Romero: I didn't have the vehicle anymore to go back and forth to Albuquerque everyone to get my prescription. They wouldn't give me refills, I have to go into the doctor, you know, of course, because they wanted to check the baby, etc, which was very, very important. So

114
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:58.080
Rosamaria Romero: I couldn't go up there anymore. And I was like, you know, I don't know what I'm going to do now I know for sure. I don't want to go back

115
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:08.520
Rosamaria Romero: To the streets and do all that I have kids. Now I need to take this shit. Seriously, excuse my language this stuff. Seriously. Okay, so I went online.

116
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:22.890
Rosamaria Romero: I found you guys right heart health. I called I told you guys my situation you guys were kind enough to accept me and I was with you guys for about a year or so. But at that time.

117
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.050
Rosamaria Romero: I

118
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:36.000
Rosamaria Romero: I, I was a single mom with my daughter with my son. I wasn't on the Father has been around since day one. So, so he has been very, very supportive.

119
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:52.440
Rosamaria Romero: Of helping me a, you know, stay on this program and stay, stay, stay on the on the Suboxone and, you know, helped me get through, through the pain so much more like filling me up a bath and putting epson salt in it.

120
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.580
Rosamaria Romero: You know, like doing

121
00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:06.480
Rosamaria Romero: Trying to other remedies to help me, etc. So, um, you know, so I started with you guys. But the only problem I was having with devices that at that time.

122
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:20.010
Rosamaria Romero: I didn't. I wasn't making enough money to buy like like you know like a cricket phone or like an actual like actual good service. I had one of those assurance wireless phones.

123
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And government

124
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:21.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: First

125
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:36.750
Rosamaria Romero: And those are just like they don't work for nothing. So the reason why bright heart health. Let me go is because I was having a hard time I'm

126
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:46.260
Rosamaria Romero: Like hearing and they're having a hard time hearing me, I will. I would cut off law, the phone. Drop the calls

127
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:56.370
Rosamaria Romero: It would, it wasn't, it wasn't charging. I mean, I would just having all these problems so bright heart health told me, You know what, also, we're sorry.

128
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:02.580
Rosamaria Romero: You know, we really want to help you. We want to keep you on the program, we will want you to go back to the streets.

129
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:10.050

130
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:17.850
Rosamaria Romero: We really don't know what you're going to tell you what you're going to do from here, but we really hope that you know that you make the right choice.

131
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:31.890
Rosamaria Romero: So bright heart health said, you know, due to your phone and us not being able to contact you and your counters are not able to actually like here, you have a full session with you.

132
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.500
Rosamaria Romero: And all that

133
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:49.590
Rosamaria Romero: They had to let me go in the beginning it was going great, but the phone started acting up the older it got I've been I when I had those phones. I went through like about 20 of those

134
00:20:50.310 --> 00:21:03.330
Rosamaria Romero: Not, not exaggerating on the pamper baby is inside there were a, it's a, it's a, though. I'm sorry. It's the the up that pink and white and green backpack.

135
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.520
Rosamaria Romero: Okay, I'm under close the door. Okay, I'm sorry, just even first time for

136
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.390
Rosamaria Romero: Me. Okay, so, so, um,

137
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:25.530
Rosamaria Romero: Okay, so where was I so okay so I didn't, I didn't want to go back to that, um, I have support. Now, the father, my son was great. So at that point.

138
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:47.730
Rosamaria Romero: Um, I, I had to. They, like I said, they gave me one more prescription of of of the quantity that they're giving me I made those last me as long as possible. And then, and then I I kind of just with the help of

139
00:21:49.020 --> 00:22:06.720
Rosamaria Romero: My partner, he, he really really helped me kind of just a wean myself off little by little by little. So finally I ended up getting getting off the high dose of

140
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:22.890
Rosamaria Romero: My body. I was still going through not hard withdraws but I was still going through withdrawals to where I i was just feeling just like just an easy and sweaty and uncomfortable and

141
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:44.850
Rosamaria Romero: You know, just like no energy and you know just just feeling really, really, really bad. So then I turned to the streets for those for for the boop an orphan on and ever since then. I haven't went back to payment is in

142
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.950
Rosamaria Romero: A couple of times. I guess I could say I did.

143
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.980
Rosamaria Romero: But it was due to

144
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.660
Rosamaria Romero: Let me just kind of think about this. Did I hear I had more as

145
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.580
Rosamaria Romero: I turned to the streets, um,

146
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:10.290
Rosamaria Romero: I, I believe I ended up in the hospital like two or three times.

147
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:19.200
Rosamaria Romero: I can't remember what, for it was like urgent, though. I'm really, really urgent.

148
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.110
Rosamaria Romero: I believe I had

149
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.020
Rosamaria Romero: fractured my wrist.

150
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:36.390
Rosamaria Romero: Ya know, I can't remember. Anyway, so, and I ended up in the emergency room like about like three times and they gave me pain medicine in the hospital, but

151
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.490
Rosamaria Romero: And they and they would release me with

152
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.660
Rosamaria Romero: With the little bit of medicine. You know how the hospital is they give you like

153
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:46.260
Rosamaria Romero: Five.

154
00:23:46.680 --> 00:24:00.060
Rosamaria Romero: five milligrams of whatever. So I was like, You know what, whatever, like those, those aren't even worth it. I, I honestly just put them to the side. I, I probably even still have them until this day in my

155
00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:06.120
Rosamaria Romero: In my safe I save all my medicine.

156
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:15.030
Rosamaria Romero: So I tried asking the doctor for for the boop an orphan because I told him, you know, that was. That's what I was on before, and that's what helped me for

157
00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.050
Rosamaria Romero: Pain better

158
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:40.830
Rosamaria Romero: Than any pain medicine that you guys have given me. But no, he didn't want to do it. So anyway, so. Okay, so that that had happened. And so from from that time period from after having my son. Um, and, and being and been going to the streets for for the for the orphan.

159
00:24:42.150 --> 00:25:00.150
Rosamaria Romero: For about like two years I ended up finding out that I was pregnant again, but this time I found out that I was praying. When I found out I was pregnant. I was already three months, going, going, almost. Almost, almost four months, but I wasn't showing at all. I had no idea.

160
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:11.460
Rosamaria Romero: My all in. I was having a regular period. It was just a little lighter so I didn't know I was pregnant. I was having like periods.

161
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:25.050
Rosamaria Romero: But I was starting to get nauseated. And I know when I'm pregnant, you know with with just a sense of this it so i wouldn't i got checked out the hospital. Sure enough it told me yeah you know you're pregnant.

162
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.680
Rosamaria Romero: And I said okay so

163
00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.060
Rosamaria Romero: I've been taking buprenorphine this whole time.

164
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:44.490
Rosamaria Romero: You know, on, on my through through my pregnancy. So, you know, what am I supposed to do here. I pretty much told the doctor and

165
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:59.130
Rosamaria Romero: So the doctor said, Well, you're gonna have to try to to find a program or something that that's going to help you, you know, get get through the rest of the five months.

166
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:07.680
Rosamaria Romero: I had at that time I had I'm completely. I didn't even know Bret Hart houses. It's still going.

167
00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:08.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I need anything to

168
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:31.440
Rosamaria Romero: Book. Um, so, um, I believe that, at that time, I, I, when I tried to get on the program at the guided center there was like a long way in this like a year, all this stuff. So I just went back to the streets for the book an orphan through my pregnancy and

169
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.200
Rosamaria Romero: Final five months later I had the baby now April.

170
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.550
Rosamaria Romero: Which was last year and that caused all this, that's when I internal bled

171
00:26:47.190 --> 00:27:07.470
Rosamaria Romero: They didn't birth my placenta. I went through the two surgeries. Now I'm dealing with to CES. And they're the one to do radiation. I use fiber already got in. Um, I've already got. And let's see, call it. I've already got in, um, let me think of

172
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:20.940
Rosamaria Romero: Three or I've already gotten three opinions from two different doctors telling me not to go through the radiation for for the cyst in my ovaries, they said if the system would have been like

173
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:30.240
Rosamaria Romero: Like somewhere else, then there. Yeah, there's, there's a chance that it could it could shrink them when he said, Not I, not in your ovaries.

174
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:43.680
Rosamaria Romero: So that's where I stand now. So now I'm dealing with the ovaries in my mean the system. My ovaries. They said that that they're like the one on the, on the left hand side.

175
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:54.120
Rosamaria Romero: Excuse me. I was, I did last time I checked, told me they told me that that it's like about like a little smaller than than

176
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.160
Rosamaria Romero: The size of it is like about probably a little smaller than a plum.

177
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.580
Rosamaria Romero: Only about like that big.

178
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:08.820
Rosamaria Romero: I would say, yeah, on my left side of my right side if they said it's just a little bit, little bit smaller.

179
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.220
Rosamaria Romero: I'm sorry. Oh my gosh.

180
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a good

181
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:34.560
Rosamaria Romero: So I'm so I'm so okay so I am just, I'm just dealing with all this pain inside and then with the weather. It wasn't helping with with my rheumatoid arthritis and the fibromyalgia. My nerves are constantly hurting

182
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:41.370
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, you know, I always getting swollen. So then I thought of you guys and I said you know what

183
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:54.960
Rosamaria Romero: I'm going to cooperate her health and see if they're still if they're still working if they're if they're still helping people. So that's when I called you guys and I database my story that I just had a baby and they offered me

184
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:03.720
Rosamaria Romero: pain pills or to get on a program. And that's what made me think of you guys. I couldn't go back to me la girl because

185
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:18.630
Rosamaria Romero: I got another vehicle. Now, but at the time I couldn't go back and forth. So I called you guys. Anyways, except me back think thank God thanks to buy and here. Here I am.

186
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are they planning on taking your ovaries out, you know,

187
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.490
Rosamaria Romero: Um, I don't, I don't know.

188
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:37.140
Rosamaria Romero: They just keep on pushing radiation on me. I, I kind of feel that, like, if that's my only option.

189
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:51.720
Rosamaria Romero: Unless I do go through the the full hysterectomy, which I'm only 33 and I'm scared to go through that. I don't want to go through or the meta pause and start, start feeling like I'm an old lady at 33

190
00:29:52.230 --> 00:30:01.650
Rosamaria Romero: You know, so I don't want to do both. I don't want to do either or, I don't want to go through. Read the radiation, and I don't want to

191
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.100
Rosamaria Romero: Go through the full hysterectomy.

192
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:22.200
Rosamaria Romero: And then on top of it on top of it. The doctor that did the surgery, she told me with her own words in her own mouth. She told me. It also, it also I really need to tell you something. You deserve to know this.

193
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:34.890
Rosamaria Romero: And I told her you know like what what's going on. She said I sent your uterus to the lab because they're telling me that the reason why they needed to take it out is because I bled so much

194
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:47.340
Rosamaria Romero: That my uterus got full of blood and placenta was stuck to it all over. And they told me you are you're going to suffer from it. Even worse, if you

195
00:30:47.820 --> 00:31:09.720
Rosamaria Romero: Weren't to take it out, you know, you're gonna have way more pain if you keep it in there. So, I mean, I believe them. They were doctors anyways so so anyways. The doctor that that did the surgery ended up telling me that she sent my uterus to the lab to get tested for for what for what

196
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:25.050
Rosamaria Romero: For what the other doctors that had told her what was going on you know that there was blood in it and they needed to be taken out immediately and all that. So, so I guess I

197
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:33.540
Rosamaria Romero: OK, so this is what she told me she said. Also, I sent I sent your uterus to the lab and everything came out.

198
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:47.220
Rosamaria Romero: Negative. There was nothing wrong with with your uterus. It should have never been taken out. She told me I I should have really looked into this a lot more before I did surgery on you.

199
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.360
Rosamaria Romero: So i mean i i cried my eyes out because even though I don't want no more kids.

200
00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:01.380
Rosamaria Romero: I'm still young and it just always good to just, I mean it just feels good.

201
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:20.760
Rosamaria Romero: To to have an option to be able to say, hey, you know what, I'm 33 years old, you know what, maybe, maybe I do want one more, you know, but I I don't have that option anymore and and they they made it, they made the such a big mistake.

202
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:30.540
Rosamaria Romero: But it destroyed me physically and emotionally and mentally

203
00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.100
Rosamaria Romero: If

204
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.380
Rosamaria Romero: They really

205
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.530
Rosamaria Romero: I'm so sorry.

206
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:46.230
Rosamaria Romero: It's okay. It's all right, this is, this is the first time I've really late like talked about it like this.

207
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.530
Rosamaria Romero: So I just feel like

208
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:05.760
Rosamaria Romero: I just feel like I feel empty inside. You know what though my heater is um

209
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:15.210
Rosamaria Romero: And I've always been the type of person to take care of my body. I have been working out since I was 13 years old, even though I was, you know,

210
00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:34.200
Rosamaria Romero: Doing what I'll do. When I was young, I always always got time to go to the gym. So, like, my body is like, it's my everything you know like to myself. I'm not trying to sound selfish, but it just means so much to me like to have scars on it.

211
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:43.170
Rosamaria Romero: You know, to gain way to have cellulite stretch marks, anything like that. Like, I took care of myself and I was pregnant. I didn't stretch marks.

212
00:33:43.620 --> 00:34:02.460
Rosamaria Romero: You know, I went walking. I worked out like be when I was pregnant, all that. Um, so at this point i i don't i don't feel the same. I don't, I don't feel like, like, like a full woman without my uterus, you don't

213
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:03.630
Know,

214
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.790
Rosamaria Romero: It just

215
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:17.340
Rosamaria Romero: It's it has just been really, really hard. And then it's like, I think about it, and I'm like,

216
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.720
Rosamaria Romero: So so so my partner, my partner told me before I go, my uterus out

217
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:38.520
Rosamaria Romero: I'm sorry to get some tissue. Oh, he told me. Are you sure are you sure you just gonna wanna see if you heal, you know, see, see, like all this you know goes away from you.

218
00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.550
Rosamaria Romero: Before before you go through it.

219
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:56.370
Rosamaria Romero: And you know I told him you know what yeah that's that's a really good idea. So I had told the doctors and all this was an Albuquerque. I have my kids in Albuquerque. Because honestly, I don't trust.

220
00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:07.470
Rosamaria Romero: The hospitals tears on a faith. Um, I honestly I witness them later. The do malpractice right in front of me. Anyway, so

221
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.750
Rosamaria Romero: So once I told the doctors. You know what

222
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:19.110
Rosamaria Romero: You put all the surgery on hold. I'm just, I'm going to see my body just heals.

223
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:30.870
Rosamaria Romero: All come back for checkups and that etc. And at first, they said, Okay, you know that that's up to you if it that that's what you want to do, but

224
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:44.610
Rosamaria Romero: Like about you because I had to stay. I had to stay up up here. I mean, I had to stay up there and Albuquerque because they started dosing my son.

225
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:59.970
Rosamaria Romero: And three days later, which I don't understand, because I I was only taking like maybe like maybe I'm like what I'm taking out half of a subtext and nine and a half.

226
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:02.730
Rosamaria Romero: I mean in morning and night.

227
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.860
Rosamaria Romero: And some once in a while.

228
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:10.740
Rosamaria Romero: During the winter. I would probably like one or two extra just to have their

229
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:19.530
Rosamaria Romero: The way. Dr. Kendall gives me one extra just to have there just for in case I'm in a little too extreme of pain.

230
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.940
Rosamaria Romero: And I think a little more

231
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:39.090
Rosamaria Romero: So, so I if my first son didn't withdraw and I was taking three three a day with him. You know, I knew for sure that you always find right we thought to myself, my son shouldn't should not withdraw, so he wasn't he wasn't withdrawing

232
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:55.470
Rosamaria Romero: At all. Okay, so, but three days later, it's like okay so uh they we were in a room, we were ready closeted went on my fourth day in the hospital.

233
00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:02.970
Rosamaria Romero: The baby was doing fine. It's vital signs were fight everything until they put him in the car seat because

234
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:12.240
Rosamaria Romero: The nurse came in and said, Okay, we're going to get ready to release you guys. We just have to make sure that the baby consider in the car seat for at least three hours.

235
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:25.950
Rosamaria Romero: And we're going to check his vital signs not and make sure that you're breathing right and all, etc. So I said, Okay, that's, you know, that's fine that's it's protocol. So they put my son in that car seat and

236
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:39.840
Rosamaria Romero: Though they started seeing the vital signs going up and down not not dramatically. But like, you know, hearing their his vital signs will go low on my kids breathing and then it will go back up.

237
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.040
Rosamaria Romero: Mm hmm. I don't know what was going on to me. Honestly, it

238
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.830
Rosamaria Romero: Was I'll get to that part. So,

239
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:59.010
Rosamaria Romero: Okay, so then, so then they sold the three hours past and and and then I told the nurse. Okay, so you know what's what's going on. And she came in and she said you know what

240
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:09.300
Rosamaria Romero: We're going to have to start those seeing your son, because it seems as if he's withdrawing from the vital signs of him being the car seat.

241
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:24.090
Rosamaria Romero: And I was like, I don't understand, because I was sitting here. Those for three hours, and I only seen you come in twice to have to shut off that machine because his error went a little bit low. But then again, he was loud.

242
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.880
Rosamaria Romero: You know, you know how you

243
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.600
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, if you're

244
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.360
Rosamaria Romero: A UK, especially a baby.

245
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:42.690
Rosamaria Romero: cannot erase three yeah yeah your air your airway. So, and she's a while I did see it. She told me I didn't see and slow. So I said, because the father got up and picked him up. Right.

246
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:53.490
Rosamaria Romero: That's why when you came in. You didn't see and such, because the father picked him up. She's all why I never saw him slouched and every time the machine went on.

247
00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:01.620
Rosamaria Romero: His breathing wasn't good. So we don't think it's safe for him to go in a car seat right now. So we're going to start seeing him.

248
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:19.710
Rosamaria Romero: Almost four days later. Four days later they started they'll see my son for a month. He wasn't in the hospital. So of course my insurance rented me a hotel up there. I just wanted to search through two surgeries. I just went through all that trauma.

249
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:30.870
Rosamaria Romero: So it was, it was really, really hard for me to get to the hospital. And we'll see him, but I would make it every single day. I would get up, I will go go go go visit him and

250
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:40.950
Rosamaria Romero: They had me on all kinds of pain medicine, of course, you know, because I was in severe, severe, severe, severe pain from

251
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Surgery, especially

252
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:47.040
Rosamaria Romero: From that, so, um, after, after I had had

253
00:39:48.390 --> 00:40:03.600
Rosamaria Romero: I mean, once they had released me from the hospital after I went through surgery I had, I was just going back and forth to visit my son, and he was enough for a month they Dustin for a month and then they started weaning them off.

254
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:17.940
Rosamaria Romero: And that's, that's when they gave me the the ultimatum the ultimatum of staying on painkillers or finding a program. And that's when I found you guys, um,

255
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.560
But

256
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:35.820
Rosamaria Romero: Just the way all of this happened that went down, um, because the last time I was with bright heart health. Dominic was my

257
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:48.570
Rosamaria Romero: Dominique was my counselor there for a while. Dominique, and then it was, um, oh my gosh she she was so nice. The other woman. She was a bootleg blonde. I can't remember her name.

258
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:58.830
Rosamaria Romero: Anyways, but the, the, the second, the second counselor that I would see. I told her what was what was going on at the time because I'm

259
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.590
Rosamaria Romero: Before my, my second son was born.

260
00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:12.240
Rosamaria Romero: My first son here here where I live, this the same apartment that I'm in right now.

261
00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:32.640
Rosamaria Romero: The door lock broke the door locks broke. They jammed. Okay. And I was calling management for two weeks straight and I kept telling them, could you please come and fix these locks. My son was two and a half. I mean, you know, to a two and a half year olds. They're everywhere opening everything

262
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:33.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, no.

263
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:47.520
Rosamaria Romero: No two year olds. So I kept telling I kept telling the manager my son's going to end up getting out because I have, I have to keep my eye on him like a hawk. I couldn't take my eyes off him.

264
00:41:47.940 --> 00:42:00.570
Rosamaria Romero: For a second, not even to brush my teeth because of those door loss, um, you know, so I had to keep him by me and he would take off for me. And then he was able to open the door because of your legs were broken and

265
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:14.400
Rosamaria Romero: One more thing. They never came to fix it two weeks, two weeks at past that and that I called never, never came to fix it. And I kept I kept on the manager my son's going and getting out.

266
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:30.450
Rosamaria Romero: Because at this point he he's he's already getting out. But I am constantly following him because I don't want him to get on his own. I told her, it's going to end up happening though, could you please stick something ever came to fix them. Finally, it happened.

267
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:30.810
Out.

268
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:44.340
Rosamaria Romero: I was in here. I'm, you know, getting ready. Of course, in the bathroom. I had my son next to me we I just finished brushing or my or my teeth and

269
00:42:45.360 --> 00:43:00.060
Rosamaria Romero: My, my mother had just passed away from cancer. So like I was going through like so much you know in my head. So I saw him buying me and then within a split second.

270
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He was outside

271
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:11.610
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, so he was gone. And I was, I couldn't. I went outside and all that. Oh my gosh. Where is the house from everywhere month yesterday, his name.

272
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:26.940
Rosamaria Romero: I came back in the house me the Father we're, we're, you know what dramatically looking for him and somebody grabbed him the maintenance man once he saw my son went down the stairs from from from

273
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:39.150
Rosamaria Romero: A neighbor has told me his net of walking him back up no wings that that that I've been trying to put it in order to get my locks fixed

274
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:56.700
Rosamaria Romero: Instead, instead of walking in back upstairs and saying, You know what, I'm sorry I haven't been able to fix your loss. But he ended up getting out, you know, they knew he was my son. But no, he took him to the office and they ended up clients, the way of D and

275
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:06.360
Rosamaria Romero: Sarah canal had team. She was from from Q amp D. She told me they came in the house. My house was clean. Of course, I always came out clean.

276
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:17.490
Rosamaria Romero: Refrigerator full of food all my kids have their clothes, everything was good in the house. Perfect. That was great. So she told me, You know what, this was a simple mistake I'm

277
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:27.450
Rosamaria Romero: The manager did tell us that yes, you called in once or twice, she said. But notice for two weeks she lived because it made her look dumb that she didn't come up

278
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:34.770
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, she you know she didn't want to lose job, I guess. So she lied and said that I call like once or twice, whatever. So anyways,

279
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:43.050
Rosamaria Romero: Sir, come out from from see what it said. While this is what I'm going to do. I'm not going to take him. She said, I'm just going to give you a warning.

280
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:55.140
Rosamaria Romero: To never let this happen again. But it just makes I'm going to stay here to get these locks fix so immediately. Finally, the manager jump immediately. Oh, oh, oh, sorry.

281
00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.070
Rosamaria Romero: Um,

282
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:14.700
Rosamaria Romero: The manager jumped immediately and had the had the maintenance men come over here and an instinct. They I even have it on video still

283
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:29.220
Rosamaria Romero: Have the maintenance man fixing my my door locks he fix some in like two minutes. It was just a couple of June, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom screws that that's that's all it till

284
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:40.470
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, my son would have never got Saul's like okay the door locks are fix you know I had told Sarah. Thank you, you know, for understanding but you know

285
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:52.860
Rosamaria Romero: They, they took two weeks to get this done. This is what it took. And I can. I told her I kept time the manager at that this was going to happen and it happened. And, sure, sure enough.

286
00:45:53.790 --> 00:46:04.890
Rosamaria Romero: A police officer two police officers, of course, showed up and one of them went to school with the father of my son and his name of Julian Martinez and he

287
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:17.310
Rosamaria Romero: from from from what from what my partner tells me he told me that in school for some reason that he that Julian never liked him, and he didn't know why he has been there did to him.

288
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:30.840
Rosamaria Romero: Nothing so that off. Once he walked in and he saw he saw the Father and He recognized him. I mean, you who he was and he knew that that was his son.

289
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:43.800
Rosamaria Romero: He, he went outside and the rookie. He was getting trained at this point and the veteran. The, the cop that was trading them was a 25 year veteran.

290
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:54.390
Rosamaria Romero: Um, I mean not not veteran, but you know you're 2525 years and he was trading this rookie. So he took him to the corner.

291
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:08.400
Rosamaria Romero: Julian Martinez and I don't know what he told him, but he came back in the house. And he said, You know what, I'm going to send you your guys's fun over I'm sending you guys sent over to the UFC and I, we both, both of us were like, why

292
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:20.520
Rosamaria Romero: Like, you know, not, not even the lady frosty why of D wants wants to take him she sees that all of this was a simple mistake. This can happen to anybody, she said.

293
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.520
Rosamaria Romero: It yourself. You know, so

294
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:35.160
Rosamaria Romero: He said, You know what, I don't care what you say. I'm doing it. End of story. So of course I started crying. I started baking him, you know, please don't do this, don't do this.

295
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:51.990
Rosamaria Romero: He walked away he left he went and he signed my son over to see why Abdi, sure, sure enough, more, more of the UFC people came to pick up my son, um, that that was that was hard. So, um,

296
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.490
Rosamaria Romero: He ended up signing my son over and

297
00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:58.410
Rosamaria Romero: And then

298
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:10.530
Rosamaria Romero: We mean the father went to go talk to the to the 25 year veteran and tell and we told him like he's a rookie. Are you really going to allow him to do this.

299
00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:21.600
Rosamaria Romero: Like, is this something that you want to do as well and you know he's all this thing my decision said I'm not making this decision for him. I'm just trying to teach him.

300
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:33.420
Rosamaria Romero: If this is what he wants to do, I'm going to stand behind him. I'm his partner, I have to. And, and I was like, you know, please do something about it, etc. Just kept on pleading and begging.

301
00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:57.330
Rosamaria Romero: Nothing. He just didn't want to do anything about it and Julian Martinez WALKED UP WITH WITH MORE. Si y amp D workers and and with the paperwork, stating that he signed our son over. So, so they told us pack of eight for him, so I backed up a big and he was two and a half. At that time, um,

302
00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:01.410
Rosamaria Romero: So they took him and

303
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:26.910
Rosamaria Romero: I fought for him mean that that thought for him for two for almost three years. I just got him back. Recently, he's been home with us for going on two months now. So it's almost over. It's almost over everything. I just have, I think, like a month left of them just doing an unexpected visit

304
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:41.400
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, and that's and that's, that's it. They can only do it for up 90 days. It started in February 3 so February 3 march 3 of April 3 they have to me. Third,

Rosamaria Romero: You know, to, to come and do a just unexpected visit to just make sure my son's doing good. And he has closed and all that, which of course he does. Um, but yeah so so that's what I had happened to me.

306
00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:03.180
Rosamaria Romero: At the time, my mother had passed away from stage four cancer. So it was just like

307
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.530

310
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:46.920
Rosamaria Romero: You know, because I kept blaming myself. I kept blaming myself and she's like, You need to understand that you were, you were, you were trying to be responsible. You were calling and i and i have screenshots of all the times I called the office, like I had all the evidence.

311

396
01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:08.940
Rosamaria Romero: It was really cool.

397
01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:17.490
Rosamaria Romero: To see my, my mom, dad, going through that with nine kids. I mean, I was only like maybe eight, nine years old at the time.

Rosamaria Romero: So, so my older older brothers already ate like 1718 the older so you know they had girlfriends. Not that they would go stay with and stuff. So my parents were mainly taking care of us younger ones and

399
01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:46.110
Rosamaria Romero: Um, so yeah, so we were homeless way two years. They took care of us very, very well. Finally, my mother. My mother and father worked very, very hard.

400
01:00:48.150 --> 01:01:09.450

401
01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:23.370

411
01:02:51.270 --> 01:03:03.420

Rosamaria Romero: So, so, I mean, I had a really, really good childhood. Like I said, you know, my, my mother and my father were amazing parents they raised us

418
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:27.480
Rosamaria Romero: So, you know, to the to the full ask them to the best of their knowledge. My dad would play with us. And, you know, my mother would play with us.

419
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:38.760
Rosamaria Romero: My dad taught, he would, he tried to teach all of us how to draw because he was an artist, when he was younger. But I was the only one that caught on. So I'm

420
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:47.640
Rosamaria Romero: All know me me my brother Eddie actually is my oldest oldest brother. We both caught on to drawing and we're both lefties how weird how

421
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:58.200
Rosamaria Romero: Only the lefties caught on to drawing, but other than that. I'm the I had, I had a really good childhood. Of course, you know, there was some some dramatic.

422
01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:17.850
Rosamaria Romero: things that happen as I grew up, but you know, it's like, like for instance the homeless thing, but it was, it wasn't my parents fault, how we ended up homeless. It was ridiculous how how it had had had had had to happen over a misunderstanding, but

423
01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.570
Rosamaria Romero: When it comes to addiction.

424
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:41.760
Rosamaria Romero: My oldest oldest brother. He has addiction problems. Mm hmm. So it does. It does. It does run in my family with just one of my brothers, but the rest of my, my brothers and sisters, they all work, they'll have state jobs.

425

Rosamaria Romero: Yes.

430
01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:25.080
Rosamaria Romero: See so so my father doesn't believe in and like mental how or like

431
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:28.080
Rosamaria Romero: Or like

432
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:40.590
Rosamaria Romero: Like he feels like okay so to the way my dad had to have taught had gone through us and through us up us up. Is that like

433
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:53.850
Rosamaria Romero: There's no such thing of of mental health problems like it's it's all up to you to make decisions, the way you want to make them and deal with them the way you want to deal with them.

434
01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:04.140
Rosamaria Romero: And and deal with whatever's going on in your head. It's all a mind game. I mean the way my father would explain it, though it would make

435
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:07.830
Rosamaria Romero: Much more sense. You know, but this was back in the 90s.

436
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:16.410
Rosamaria Romero: Right when we're not rich people will be believed in medicine and all. And, you know, mental health problems, etc.

437
01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.260
Rosamaria Romero: So I need to close the store.

438
01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay.

439
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:32.640
Rosamaria Romero: But, uh, but yeah, actually, by now, now that that that my father had bought older and and now

440
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:39.360
Rosamaria Romero: He's starting to see. Okay. Well, this is what I wanted to say so.

441
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:55.110
Rosamaria Romero: When, when we're WHEN WE'RE YOUNGER. My dad never believed in any of that stuff. He would always tell us in his own way why he didn't believe in it. They were stolen my end game, etc. But as as times started going on and we hit the 2000s.

442
01:07:56.190 --> 01:08:10.410
Rosamaria Romero: He started seeing it. He started seeing, you know that people do have mental mental health problems, etc. So he started seeing it and south, you know, I'm like, I'm

443
01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:14.880
Rosamaria Romero: Like I would say my dad has ADHD.

444
01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:24.930
Rosamaria Romero: Because, because, like, like I've noticed and he now know that he's in his 60s, he realizes, I guess there's mental health problems.

445
01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:30.600
Rosamaria Romero: That are that are created.

446
01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:39.300
Rosamaria Romero: Like, like, like he tells me till this day, maybe in the 90s, there was there was, I wouldn't see stuff like I do today.

447
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:40.950
Rosamaria Romero: You know, yeah, and I wouldn't

448
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:46.770
Rosamaria Romero: See these kind of sicknesses and diseases and all that going around like there is today.

449
01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:56.040
Rosamaria Romero: In the 90s. It wasn't like that. So he's like, I see the world a lot different now. So now he sees the mental health. But to answer your question, um,

450
01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:18.210
Rosamaria Romero: I see that my father does have ADHD. I, I actually feel that that I even have it. I need to go and see it if I'm diagnosed with it or not, because I rapid I wrap it up. I can't like concentrate on

451
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.810
Rosamaria Romero: Like, I can't, like, I can't like stay still.

452
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:30.840
Rosamaria Romero: Like I can't like staving off you know for for a long period of time. Um,

453
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:47.310
Rosamaria Romero: You know I am. I tend to wake up and have just really vivid dreams of just like a lot of stuff that I've been through, you know I witnessed a really good friend of mine get shot right in front of me.

454
01:09:48.360 --> 01:10:04.200
Rosamaria Romero: You know, I have another friend shot himself in the head and me and his twin sister went to his house to go check you know like what happened. And we found him there and just feel that blood and just

455
01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:06.600
Rosamaria Romero: Just, um,

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:18.120
Rosamaria Romero: So I, I tend to wake up sometimes like in sweats and then and

459
01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:49.530
Rosamaria Romero: My dad goes through the same thing. So, um, he, he doesn't, he's not, he's not really, he's from the 50s and now he doesn't like I told you he doesn't believe in going to the doctors and getting

460
01:10:50.580 --> 01:11:06.060
Rosamaria Romero: That again put on many medicine and all that, but just seeing what what he's going through and then as well. My, my son that I just introduced it to he got diagnosed diagnosed with ADHD and the same exact

461
01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:18.180
Rosamaria Romero: Symptoms. I see him go through. I'm having low online I been telling myself for a long time now, like I need to go get checked and and and

462
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.430
Rosamaria Romero: You know, see if I do have ADHD or not.

463
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:37.530
Rosamaria Romero: And so yeah, so I get treatment for it, you know, because it's awful to to feel this way. My mile problem. The I've been on that for the past six years that that that has helped me with

465
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.540

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:39.570
Rosamaria Romero: I, I tend to get some some kind of somewhat of an enzyme it. Um, so, you know, all the in my doctors aware of this all all all take like a little tiny little, little, little square of our

473
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:40.290
Rosamaria Romero: Muslim

474
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.240
Rosamaria Romero: You know, under my own just

475
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.720
Do

476
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:57.150
Rosamaria Romero: X me from feeling that way because I don't want to start rapid thinking I start going into I which I i I'm thinking the eight the ADHD mode.

477
01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:06.480
Rosamaria Romero: You know when I wake up with it. I start feeling I saw rapid thinking and I start feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack and

478
01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:19.650
Rosamaria Romero: You know, I feel like I start feeling bad, like I need to get up and just start walking and and like I don't know what to do with myself. And so yeah, so sometimes I have to take a piece of that under my tongue to tell me

479
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How can you use, calm down.

480
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:23.220
Rosamaria Romero: And go back to that, you know,

481
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, um,

482
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:31.950
Rosamaria Romero: So to answer your question, I'm so sorry I go on these, all these stories, but I just want you to really, really understand me.

483
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:34.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Instead of just answering a question.

484
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:53.430
Rosamaria Romero: Um, so, so, yeah, I would say mental health problems do do run in the family, um, like I said, My son was diagnosed with that my father, I see it in him, but he just he doesn't want to go to the doctor, he just said when

485
01:13:54.570 --> 01:14:02.430
Rosamaria Romero: When God's ready for me. He's he'll come for me and I'm just gonna have to deal with this, you know, the way I can

486
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:18.990
Rosamaria Romero: Um, so he deals with that, I guess, in his own way, which is prayer that that's his way is with prayer and you know that's the way I i will i know why I'm strong. I know I'm

487
01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:43.590
Rosamaria Romero: Like really, really strong but I honestly I don't think I'm as strong as my father to to be able to deal with, with all this all this craziness going on with just prayer, not, not that I don't have faith in God and I and my, my love being as strong for him.

488
01:14:45.150 --> 01:15:04.890
Rosamaria Romero: Because it is you know and and i and i know i know if I were to just put this on prayer and just pray and pray and pray. I know God. God, God will heal me naturally without without needing all this medicine, but in this day and age, you know,

489
01:15:06.450 --> 01:15:14.400
Rosamaria Romero: Now you know it's like I said, My God, 250 so he's that's that's the way he was raised was in

490
01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:16.350
Prayer for everything.

491
01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:41.910
Rosamaria Romero: He will be healed and it works for him. It really does. It works for him, and it works for me. It works for me as well too. I pray a mob rule law and that's that's what really helped me. I'm really that's what really helped me stop with my first with my first

492
01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:50.970
Rosamaria Romero: Child with my daughter. That's where you know I prayed and I prayed and asked God please give me the strength to help me fight.

493
01:15:51.990 --> 01:16:00.510
Rosamaria Romero: You know, like these withdraws and that and, you know, I went to the doctor in that and you know it was all over with. Now, like, like I told you.

494
01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:12.450
Rosamaria Romero: But, you know, prayers do how yes they do. They helped a lot. They, they really, really help that hundred percent. But like I said, I just, I don't believe I am

495
01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:38.460
Rosamaria Romero: I just, just being that that I am because in the Bible. God, God considers all of this man made medicine to be pleasing to us, of course, it helps us, you know, as we're living but but in God's eyes. We're putting poison in our body. So it's like it's like

496
01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:58.380
Rosamaria Romero: as as as as we take her medication and it helps us and it makes us still Nirmal from from the way we usually with film, which would be awful IS LIKE IT KIND OF IT KIND OF disconnects me from him. Just, just a little bit.

497
01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:00.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to, to the point to

498
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:10.560
Rosamaria Romero: Where to whereas I like i said i'm not i'm not as strong as as my dad to just keep it to do. Just keep praying and praying and praying to to keep all this

499
01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:16.860
Rosamaria Romero: You know, away from me. So, so, yeah, that tied to your question. Yes.

500
01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You with my in my mother said.

501
01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:27.630
Rosamaria Romero: She didn't have no mental problems. And then you have, and she's from California. And I never met any of my mom.

502
01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, do you have a history of any kind of suicide attempts, or thoughts.

503
01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:37.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or self harm.

504
01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:38.100
Oh,

505
01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:48.330
Rosamaria Romero: Oh no no no i i believe in God. Way too much and I no way I would, it wouldn't ever even think of doing something like that.

506
01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I already know the answer.

507
01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:57.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just want to tell you, I already knew the answer, but I have to ask it.

508
01:17:57.690 --> 01:17:58.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

509
01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But just

510
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:10.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, listening to your story and where you come from, and how you were raised. I knew the answer very much

511
01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:20.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So okay at the, the last piece of this is wanting to know about school did you graduate high school

512
01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.840
Rosamaria Romero: I graduated. Okay. Yes.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any oh I

514
01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:48.840
Rosamaria Romero: I was a straight A student from from first grade, all the way to talk. I even gosh my GPA was so high. I was so smart that while I still am, but I would have to reteach myself all over again because it's been so long diving school but um

515
01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:58.410
Rosamaria Romero: I went from the sixth grade straight to the eighth grade my teacher wanted to put me them because when they in sixth grade.

516
01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:14.340
Rosamaria Romero: I was already at a, at a 10th grade level they tested me and I was really a 10th grade level, but they they told me they would, they would only allow me to skip one. Great. So I went from six to eighth grade. And then from there I graduated

517
01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, that's amazing.

518
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:18.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Um, yeah.

519
01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, any legal issues right now or in the past.

520
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:28.080
Rosamaria Romero: Um, well, just, just the legal issue. I was

521
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:29.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Telling you about with my

522
01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:40.020
Rosamaria Romero: Son, but I'm actually it wasn't even a legal issue because um how how I told you to officer Julian Mark Martinez that that sign my son.

523
01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:56.700
Rosamaria Romero: Over. Um, he will he he. We know he took it to court, me and my father got paper work to go to court. We went to court in a lot dropped it. I dropped in the interest of justice due to harassment.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So good.

525
01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:00.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

526
01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.820
Rosamaria Romero: Yeah, it ended up getting dropped

527
01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:15.060
Rosamaria Romero: So, so, so, so the SI y amp D held on to my son, even though there was no no no criminal

528
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:23.190
Rosamaria Romero: condone like no criminal side, you know they're there was no charges. We didn't get charged with the winning get arrested for nothing.

529
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:35.760
Rosamaria Romero: Or nothing. He just send my Son over BECAUSE HE HATED THE FATHER AND GUESS HE DID out of hatred. But anyways, um, other than that. No, I'm not dealing with no legal issues right now. No.

532
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:59.520
Rosamaria Romero: I can't even I believe I was with a friend and she was stealing in the store.

533
01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:09.960
Rosamaria Romero: And then they caught her and I didn't know and they got both of us, you know, and then you know when when you're young. I didn't, I didn't want to point fingers.

534
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:24.660
Rosamaria Romero: Or anything you know they caught, they found whatever they found on her. I got they charged me for conspiracy for just being with her and I was on a short time of juvenile probation, for I think like 90 days.

535
01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.380
Rosamaria Romero: It was she is getting like, like a year or so.
