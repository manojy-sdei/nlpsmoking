00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

4
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.960
It works.

5
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It's actually pretty good connection right now.

6
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you

7
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.990
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm trying to stand in the one spot that gives me all the bars.

8
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's experiment with going somewhere where you can have some privacy. Let's just watch the connection and see if it fades away.

9
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.910
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

10
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can find somewhere to to sit and we'll just keep a close eye on it.

11
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:34.020
Lyndsey Lorett: It's, um, we're pretty private they're they're doing the bathroom in the back room.

12
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.660
Lyndsey Lorett: So they can't hear. And then I've got always watching them wi

13
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.970
Lyndsey Lorett: Ou, so I'm just

14
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, this is great. Then, so I ended up. Um, I wasn't able to meet with

15
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Either you or with

16
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This other gentleman. So this works out. So

17
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.650
Lyndsey Lorett: Well, how did that happen.

18
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well I, I, I'm not able to share this person's story but it sounded like sometimes life happens

19
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.570
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, it does. It definitely does.

20
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So what ended up happening with the internet, um, something like a phone upgrade or a data payment thing or something.

21
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:24.540
Lyndsey Lorett: No idea. It wouldn't connect to Wi Fi and wouldn't connect to anything, and had a little circle with a line through it on my bars.

22
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.670
Lyndsey Lorett: And so when I call, they're like, Yeah, we got to reset your whole phone and all this stuff and then that took forever.

23
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

24
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a little bit about what kind of stressors. You've got kind of in your current life right now.

25
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.880
Lyndsey Lorett: Tell me what

26
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on in your life right now. I mean, I know a little bit from group, but we don't get to hear much from you guys in there.

27
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.580
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah I did just

28
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Not there's not a lot going on.

29
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have

30
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You were describing that there's actual skin tissue growing and that you were optimistic about that.

31
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:23.160
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah. Oh, yes. So, um, I was having these bumps and I'm like pain and stuff around the wound. Okay.

32
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:35.940
Lyndsey Lorett: And so when she when they looked at it, she said that it was from the tape, you know, because we peel off the tape every day. My skin is just getting

33
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:54.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Raw from it, but I have so much new skin tissue that she had asked me if I had a skin graft. And I said, no, it failed. And she said, well, it looks like you've grown a whole lot of skin. And so I was like, Okay, I'll take it.

34
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

35
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And what are your thoughts about that activity. We didn't group. You know, is there any sort of continued thinking about it. Did you maybe add more items to it or kind of put it away and and kind of put aside not not thought about again.

36
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.560
Lyndsey Lorett: Um, I did. I wrote it, it, it's in my journal. I don't have it. It's in my car.

37
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.470
Lyndsey Lorett: And I haven't really thought about it since then it's just been kind of hectic.

38
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so is it part of the reconstruction in the in your place that makes it hectic.

39
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.980
Lyndsey Lorett: Every yes

40
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:39.570
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

41
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.350
Lyndsey Lorett: The whole house is changing.

42
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure you don't want to find someplace, a little more private you sure not gonna be able to care too much.

43
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.430
Lyndsey Lorett: No, there's no wider.

44
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a worker just now.

45
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:10.020
Lyndsey Lorett: Now, that's my brother in law. Okay. I was standing by the cooler where the waters are

46
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.270
Lyndsey Lorett: I figured out back was the same. The most private place.

47
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:22.410
Lyndsey Lorett: Because I keep an eye on Ali and do this so I'm multitasking.

48
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can. I can feel the difference

49
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, well, we'll, we'll do with what we've got.

50
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, so it's coming in lines up pretty well for today. It's, it's time for this monthly review of how you assess you're doing on your goals.

51
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so I've got one here that says, I would like to be medication free, so it is now may 20

00:09:54.330 --> 00:10:02.670
Lyndsey Lorett: And so it's it's supposed to be 23 but Dr. Gabriel, AND I ORDERED ONE OF THOSE the way you're thinking

54
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

55
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:10.110
Lyndsey Lorett: I didn't come in yet so and I ordered. Um, there's a special like I'm it's like a

56
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: A breast breast and mortar thing the pedestal and

57
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.990
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, that you like 1 million yeah I ordered one of those. So

58
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.320
Lyndsey Lorett: We'll see. So as soon as he gets here. I like to do that.

59
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just be specific, you kind of told him what the plan is. But what is so client is at how many milligrams a day 2424 milligrams got it and run or feeling new for Fisher Fisher North

60
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Morphine okay

61
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And did

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Beautiful.

63
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, let me see, we have started a tight ration plan and I can see I wrote it all out.

64
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, you did.

65
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let's I'm going to write a little note. Actually it looks like my first entry was 526. So this is a little early, but on 526 you are going to be at 22 milligrams. So I'll just put we might be a little behind at this point.

66
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's okay, this is, this is what this is for us to say this is what you wanted. And this is where you're at. It's kind of what you want. And this is where yet. Sometimes that can help kind of keep keep you motivated

67
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Motivated

68
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, what are you noticing when you listen to other people because there's a real wide range of of the dose in group. What do you think about when you hear other people's toes.

69
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.530
Lyndsey Lorett: You know I'm

70
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.200
Lyndsey Lorett: Specifically, there's, there's two of them know Nicole and Jessica.

71
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.430
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay.

72
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:19.920
Lyndsey Lorett: They're just going down like their work in it. And so every week, it does if I haven't. It just makes me feel like it's possible. It's possible. And they don't they tell you. Yeah, I'm okay, or no, I'm not. Okay. And it's not a big deal.

73
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.820
Lyndsey Lorett: They're just really working on it and I needed I needed that so much.

74
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear people going through it personally and their ability to speak back to the clinicians. That's what you needed

75
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:36.690
Yes.

76
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. And so, boo boo. So the current plan with now we're just gonna just read it current plan has you at reaching one milligram next March.

77
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's just one milligram at a time or could be half a milligram at a time. So at this point you want to do it very carefully. So you're you're waiting for the the that bowl and that crushing post pedestal. Whatever the heck. It's called so you're waiting for that.

78
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.360
I can look that up.

79
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Here you're having a better connection.

80
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or her and pestilence, which she ordered M o r th ER and pestle. P. S. T. Le

81
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

82
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's check on audio. Let's check on video, make sure we're good, good, good.

83
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Check.

84
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: How we doing

85
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

86
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we are in the car and let's keep an eye. So we're trying this earlier hour just to see if the connections, a little better, so hopefully it will be so far so good. So far so good. Yeah. Yeah. All right, I've got a note already started.

87
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw you checked in.

88
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been a minute, I think. So we need to kind of take a peek at your goals, see how you're doing on it. Maybe, maybe.

89
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah. So we have one here. This one seems I think we probably created this one fairly recently, I would like to decrease overthinking and anxiety. Hmm. Alright, so

90
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see what was written back then.

91
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll make a picture of image of belly breathing and kids and posted in my room or ball. So did you end up following through with that.

92
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay, so no drawing no visual reminder yet.

93
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.680
Bianca Garcia: No, I totally forgot that I'm

94
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay with you. I know you have so much going on. It's insane. I'm

95
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.130
Bianca Garcia: Sorry, I have to open the window.

96
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's hot in there.

97
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:52.380
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I came into a car because everybody was sleeping and I didn't want to bother people.

98
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But

99
00:21:53.940 --> 00:22:04.350
Bianca Garcia: I forgot the keys and then right when you had came in I close the door. Sounds like everybody else, like me, but I was gonna run it for the keys. Okay.

100
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So I totally forgot. I'm so in the in the car right now. Do you happen to have paper and pen just thought I'd ask

101
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's fine, totally forgot to make a poster. Okay, so that's still something just just extend that target date. You know what I'm going to put this but I

102
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.970
Bianca Garcia: Have my phone on me. So I'm going to put it in here because this is where I like right

103
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah, go for it. So what you're going to draw as an image of belly breathing with with the kids, maybe doing it with them having something fun sort of an activity to do together.

104
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So that when you look at it, it gives you a warm fuzzy feeling so it's it's it's you more inclined to do it if it's something that makes you feel good when you look at it.

105
00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And post it in my room or WALL OR DOOR. So having it visually around maybe you even do an extra one and have it somewhere so that you can remember to do that.

106
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's that's if your eyes happened to land on that, um, there's also this idea of having it scheduled where you have also reminders in your phone to do it a few times a day. Yeah, right.

107
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, so just looking at this, this goal right here. Just take reflection back over the last week and see how much of it. That same old, same old behavior of overthinking was president just kind of reflect back and see how much of it was around

108
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.020
Okay, yeah, I think it can happen.

109
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.130
Bianca Garcia: Quite a bit. Well,

110
00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:02.790
Bianca Garcia: Well, yeah, yeah. I kept thinking about this one thing over and over

111
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you comfortable sharing what that one thing you over and over, trying to solve in your mind.

112
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.280
Yeah.

113
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.290
Bianca Garcia: I had had an issue with the prescriptions. I have got in.

114
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:32.430
Order to get this month, last month and it's close to this month. I was gonna she the pharmacist, like, Well, you could just get it this day.

115
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:40.140
Bianca Garcia: I go that day in in a try. Give it, give me the prescription and they say cat and then the fifth

116
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.970
And I was, it was just like a bill thing. And I was like, okay, as

117
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.730
Bianca Garcia: I felt like

118
00:24:51.930 --> 00:25:02.730
I don't know, like I saw like maybe maybe she thought something or something and I would have me, I guess, and like I wouldn't like you know

119
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:14.880
Bianca Garcia: Tell her I had told her if she could check the cameras because I had thought maybe she didn't give me the right amount

120
00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:22.230
Bianca Garcia: Sometimes, so I have noticed afterlife and maybe shoot this now, right, because I i

121
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:26.340
Bianca Garcia: And I put all my medications and my Lockbox I don't carry them with me.

122
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Every anything and and she's like, Okay, let me, let me check it and investigate on their site on the cameras and she was supposed to get back to me and let me know. But she get back to me and she just said.

123
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:46.440
She just said, oh, yeah, you could pick it up on the 14th. And I said, okay, that's fine. And I was already going to switch over to

124
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.740
Albertsons pharmacy, because the beat their prices. Sometimes my insurance doesn't cover him.

125
00:25:54.210 --> 00:26:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: If she told me she's like, well, I said. She said, Well, there's a transfer here. Do you want me chapter I said yeah because it'd be you guys prices and I would like to get better prices and

126
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if you go to Elvis's. She's like, You won't be able to pick him up on the 14th. So she told me to stay

127
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.470
Bianca Garcia: There for this month this month this month, last month.

128
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And then when it comes to this month they

129
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:28.530
Bianca Garcia: Gave me the runaround, and then they said, Oh, you can't pick them up and then you have to wait and usually the insurance will let you pick them up like a day ahead.

130
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:38.910
Bianca Garcia: And they, I don't know what they call the doctor and he said, oh, we didn't see anything on the ceiling and they didn't never tell concluded, what happened on their side. She just said you could

131
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:47.250
Bianca Garcia: So I felt like maybe in the doctor tells them. Oh, she can pick them up the day before she has to be come up on this day they

132
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Made me like

133
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.850
Bianca Garcia: They were assuming something of me.

134
00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I was I was, I was like, people of course want to get their prescription as soon as possible, especially with Colin going

135
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:12.330
Bianca Garcia: Get them when their shirts allows it or not. And I can't even get it, then I have to wait that seemed

136
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.550
Like it made me feel

137
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.740
I don't know, maybe, maybe a little patient profile.

138
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Which kind of profile.

139
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:32.610
Bianca Garcia: Like getting profiled. I don't know what it just ran through my head like everything, but I don't know what they thought, but I felt like maybe they thought

140
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:41.430
Bianca Garcia: The worst anything like oh maybe she just wants them right now available, blah. And I'm like, Well, yeah. Who wouldn't like you know like

141
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:53.100
Bianca Garcia: What the prescription it and I wasn't even trying. I wouldn't bring up a problem to them if it was on my side, but she didn't tell me if I would have known maybe

142
00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:06.990
Bianca Garcia: I miss counting maybe what is something happened. She didn't tell me, and she just made it seem like oh I don't know, like I just felt like so I can the wrong way. I don't know if that makes sense to you, but

143
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you you given me. I said, Well, what, what have you, kind of, what was that overthinking and you've given me this really

144
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Rich story. So it's really brought me in to what that experience is like for you. Thank you. So I kind of have an idea of what you're talking about the the part that I would invite just for now is to just

145
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep one piece of it really short and see if you can finish that sentence I felt and put in one emotion word when oh this stuff with pharmacist doctor and pharmacy and insurance, like all those moving parts, all those people that are involved in getting this done.

146
00:28:54.420 --> 00:29:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's that whole story. You just told that's down here, but up front because you haven't quite said it yet. See if you can land one emotion words. So I felt blank when all that story. You just told happened.

147
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.770
Well, I think I was worried

148
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:15.930
Bianca Garcia: I felt

149
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:23.700
Like a patient profile, but I don't know what the profile me as the for me. I felt maybe

150
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.920
I don't know that.

151
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:30.840
Even though.

152
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think I heard one part of it. I know the the emotion was worried. I heard that just now. But then I didn't hear they're thinking, what have you. That's the word. I didn't hear. I feel like maybe the patient PROFILED ME TO BE

153
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.100
I don't know.

154
00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:00.270
I don't know, maybe in my head. I was thinking

155
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.820
Me as an ID.

156
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:04.650
Okay.

157
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There Kotick. So that's everything. Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's that's that's inaccurate.

158
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a narcotic.

159
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.960
Bianca Garcia: Oh, okay. So anything could be. Oh.

160
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, so it's a matter. There's lots of pieces to this so I'm real quick. I didn't want you to keep holding on to that thought because that's not accurate. It is a controlled substance.

161
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so definitely you know that needs to be doctor prescribed and it because it is a potentially addictive substance which means you can develop a chemical dependence, which you have, which means

162
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You would go into withdrawal. If you just stopped after about three or four days you would experience, probably. It was stroll after the fifth or sixth day you would feel it quite a bit at 10 in

163
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The regular exciting.

164
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me back up. I'm so sorry. So the volume on this is a little low. I am doing my very best to hear everything you're saying, but there's sometimes the connections. Great, though I don't want you to change a thing.

165
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just that I can't, I can't hear everything sometimes. So, I'm so sorry, the medication that you were picking up was not the buprenorphine. Is that right, yeah. Okay.

166
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It was the flu oxetane. Let me see, I'm not sure what was me see. Oh yeah, there you are called

167
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, um,

168
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell a pram, yeah. Okay. So, all right. So you were not picking up the view for nothing. None. Now, you're right, it is not, that's not a narcotic. So we needed to check in on that glad we talked about it. So here's the thing.

169
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though. So I'm in this program, right, and I'm a therapist.

170
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't identify as having a chemical dependence on an opiate I don't identify that way. However, even when I go to the emergency department, even when I go to the pharmacy. I have in my mind, I'm wondering if there was thinking I'm an addict.

171
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

172
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.940
Bianca Garcia: In my head, too.

173
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's not just you. It's not big now. Now you take the fact that

174
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you

175
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been right so then you add that layer. Do you already identify as

176
00:32:45.570 --> 00:33:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Having engaged in maybe at some point in your life, maybe misled people diverted money a particular way, or maybe were dishonest in some way in order to get whether it was heroin or Percocet, or hydro

177
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's addictive behavior. So, so you add already if you're in the field, you know anything about it's already in your mind. Like, I wonder if they're gonna think I'm trying to score.

178
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But then you take on top of that, that you may identify as being that and then if you see anything in anybody's eyes or someone looks like they're pushing back or they're judging you, your response to it's going to be even bigger.

179
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be fully kind of aware and kind of sensitive to that kind of treatment.

180
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you're picking up on this word am I being profiled

181
00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, but you might be able to pick up on really subtle things from people, whereas someone who's

182
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, an eight year old lady that has never heard it. She doesn't know anything about like, I'm just guide goodies to picking up some Percocet and I'm going to use them for five days and

183
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Like she's not going to be thinking like that. But you and I. It's on our mind because it's in our life and we're talking about it every week and it's right. It's my job.

184
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going to be on my mind and I kind of wonder, you know, when you know I'm looking at anybody. I'm wondering if they're judging me. I wonder if they're kind of trying to assess whether I'm engaging in

185
00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: A drug seeking behavior. Well, that seems like nowadays because because of what happened with the whole epidemic. That's it seems like, especially for somebody who was once

186
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:33.720
Why

187
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Why like and then she's, she's supposed to have been my medication.

188
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:52.740
Bianca Garcia: WHAT IS IT management and then she make gives me knowing that this is what she gave it to me for it. She just like increased my anxiety by a million, but

189
00:34:53.730 --> 00:35:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just make sure I know which sheet because there's lots of different people involved in this story, which she at this point are we talking about increases this the doctor that increased the medicine. No.

190
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.110
Bianca Garcia: She died at the lady, the lady that gives me the medicine.

191
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: pharmacy technician.

192
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay medicine management. This is what she gave it to me for and she just like triggered it.

193
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're talking about the pharmacist. The one in the pharmacy. Correct.

194
00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:25.590
No.

195
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.390
Bianca Garcia: medication management.

196
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What's this person.

197
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That manages my medication. Okay.

198
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so you've got a psychiatrist to somehow

199
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And that part. I'm a little fuzzy on because I get how a pharmacist might be, you know, they can see maybe other medications that you've ordered. They can see it and they may form a judgment. I don't know what they can see

200
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.150
Bianca Garcia: The pharmacy and told them not to give it to me till that day. Because usually, I could get it a day ahead.

201
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.900
Bianca Garcia: And I said, What is going on, why

202
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so right there. Why so when you have a question, when a why question comes up for you.

203
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you, do you know that you have a right to find out that information, not in an angry way but that just like everybody else. You have a right to understand

204
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The doctor's orders and in fact you can talk with the pharmacist and say, I'm curious. So oftentimes of pharmacy check will say, do you have any questions for the pharmacist and this time, you might say, Yes, I do.

205
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you wait and the pharmacist comes up and says, what's your question. And you could say, you know what I don't understand why my pharmacist might say, I can only pick it up tomorrow because

206
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: My insurance is saying, it's fine. It'll be covered. And it's not a narcotic. It's not a substance abuse. I'm confused. It did she write a note. Do you happen to see what her reasoning is

207
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Or she tried. Do you think she's trying to protect my finances and have me make sure that it's covered by insurance. Like, I can't quite tell her motivation. You see what I'm going out with that.

208
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:38.130
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, that's what I've been thinking this whole time. Like how do I talk to them because I felt a little frustrated and I didn't want to, you know, be angry about it. I wanted to talk right

209
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. So did I sound angry.

210
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:44.310
Bianca Garcia: No.

211
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't. Okay. So one of the reasons why I'm glad I didn't, I'm kind of shouting, a little bit because I want to make sure you can hear me. And I so I'm a little loud, but I'm

212
00:37:54.570 --> 00:38:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The one of the reasons why I may not sound angry is because I have the same right to that clarification as I do. Hey, you know what I'm

213
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I would. Let's say I'm going to the pediatrician and I say to the physician, I say, you know what, um, how can you

214
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you checked his, his ears like that. Well, what you I know you've stuck this thing in his ear. Tell me a little bit about what you're looking for. Well, like what's, what are you doing in there. What are you checking for

215
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Another physician can explain to you. Oh, just checking this there's wax or if there's a ruptured eardrum. See if there's an object stuck in there or if it's red or inflamed.

216
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Now would you be in sort of

217
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Not confident, which would be insecure. Would you feel insecure asking the primary care physician to answer a question about one of your children's

218
00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, you wouldn't notice you kind of naturally intuitively know I have a right to ask. This is my child.

219
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So the differences, right, then you go flashforward over to your at the pharmacist or something. I think it has something to do with you're already judging yourself.

220
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You already might be saying to yourself, I because I have this history of, you know, being an addict, that kind of thing. And look at me, I'm still chemically dependent with this buprenorphine.

221
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe they're judging me and I'm judging me and I don't have a right to get information. Now all that goes on unconscious, mostly. You're probably just like

222
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. And it doesn't make any sense. But the psychological reasoning might be just that simple. Which is you have a right to get information.

223
00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if the worst thing. Do you know that you still have a right to information to ask, they have a right to say no and giving it to you. But hold on to your truth. You have a right to ask, even if you just did heroin 20 minutes ago.

224
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you know you still do. You're still a human being. You have a right to ask a question. Do you get that. I mean, at your core. You have a right to get information.

225
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.290
Yeah.

226
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the same as same as advocating for a child apply that same confidence to you. So now you're at the pharmacist if you know your intentions are to just gather data and information.

227
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember this conversation, remember the one where. Wait a minute. I was just doubting myself I was judging myself as an addict.

228
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, I don't have a right to ask. Yes, I do. Yes, you do.

229
00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that making you think about

230
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:07.770
Bianca Garcia: How to approach them. That's what I've been thinking about. It's been going on.

231
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was just, you know, I definitely didn't want to be angry and I just so glad I talked to you because

232
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You gave me a little bit more insight and how to commonly asked about information. Yeah, I don't

233
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:25.980
Know, I don't know.

234
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Quickly, they probably do myself before me. Yeah. So, yep. And so, that's beautiful. So you can see that. So now you got a little and it's just my version, there could be a lot of different versions of what's going on, psychologically, but that one works for you. Go for it.

235
00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so that's just the mindset. That's kind of having in your mind. Okay, I'm already showing up to the window already thinking I'm already nervous like

236
00:41:54.390 --> 00:42:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I hate that I have this history myself and I don't want to see anyone judging me but those are the facts. I still am chemically dependent. I'm going to be getting Suboxone and I'm also going to be getting medication to address anxiety, so I'm

237
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Accepting it and then you give yourself permission to smile. Hi, and not make it be a big deal. We could assume something positive, which is instead of thinking, Oh, there they might be thinking something negative about me and judging me. You could shift that thinking to

238
00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I'm not the center of their world maybe they're just like, lady. Let's go on to the next one. What is it, where is it, what is it, next one. Where is it, what is it, how much. Okay, next one. What's your address. What's your phone number. Next one, right, maybe

239
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that face that they're showing up with is the face. They give everybody maybe

240
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:57.270
Yeah.

241
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So since you kind of likes this idea of coming up with specific words.

242
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Who is it that you first want to talk to to get more information. What would be your first call or visit

243
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:32.250
Bianca Garcia: Well, I was thinking the main pharmacist. She spoke to last month. But the thing is, do I explain everything that happened like how we talked last month has she's like stay here because I was going to move. I stayed in a couldn't get it. I don't know what to say, like, yeah.

244
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's i'll give you, it's just my opinion. There's no one single way to do it. But here's what I noticed, having been in management for quite a few years.

245
00:43:42.630 --> 00:44:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, oftentimes what I will do is I will ask someone, a question and they'll come at me with this story first and I'll have to wait and wait and wait and wait and I might even like I get distracted, like what the heck was I even asking for

246
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting. And so they're giving me their explanation before they just say no, I didn't do it.

247
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're explaining explaining explaining. And so what I talk with people about is, I'll say, you know what my style. You don't have to defend your, your answer.

248
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We can just get you in and out of my office, very quickly, typically what I'm looking for is, is it done, is it not done. If I want information. Here comes your question your answer to your question, if I want the story.

249
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll ask for it. So, so let's say the story again over here and you have it, but really think about what you want to know more about from this pharmacist and see if you can just all be the pharmacist, what would you ask me no story, not much. She asks, or he

250
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to know.

251
00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.580
Why give me me

252
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.730
Know how to put it, but I guess just mainly why

253
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:16.470
Bianca Garcia: Why I had a little run around this whole month and hot why the doctor said that at the end.

254
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.030
No, no.

255
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so a couple of things kind of give you some feedback about that.

256
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So run around. I will probably piss them off.

257
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.040
Bianca Garcia: That's what I don't want to do

258
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Ya know, so, so the difference between what I do. So I'll do, I'll do what you just said in sort of my style and you can tweak it kind of make it work for you.

259
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So my style is I stick with facts run around is a judgment word and we I run the risk of they may have an experience with the phrase run around.

260
00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: As if they're the bad guy. And once somebody thinks they're the bad guy, they're going to get defensive and pissed.

261
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're not going to be open to hearing my story that I have ready in case they do want to know the story, so instead I just want information. So the difference between run around is, is your phrase. And what I would do, I would stick with facts would be pharmacist, Benny.

262
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Last Tuesday, you and I spoke and I left feeling confused because my psychiatrist wrote a note and spoke with you. I believe that I couldn't pick it up.

263
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: On that Tuesday, but I had to wait. The next day, do you see in your notes or do you happen to know or remember if it was because my insurance wouldn't pay for it that day. If it was a clinical recommendation from that psychiatry.

264
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Or something else, Benny. Okay, so what did you notice I did that was different than hey can you tell me why I got the runaround

265
00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me.

266
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you were more more clear about clear

267
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but what made what I said, clear.

268
00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:13.140
Nicer and it sounded to down to the

269
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: To the main question. Okay. But there's very specific things I did that made it clear, and I was hoping you'd pick up on him. I'm gonna tell you what they were. What made it clear was the date.

270
00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Tuesday.

271
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You spoke with psychiatry Smith. Hey, Benny. Do you remember talking with psychiatry says oh yeah I remember you. Oh, perfect. So yeah, last Tuesday when you spoke with psychiatry Smith.

272
00:47:51.120 --> 00:48:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Smith said I couldn't pick my script up on Tuesday. Do you know why. Dr. Smith said no I can't pick it up, Tuesday, but I had to wait till Wednesday. Do you know if it was because the insurance wouldn't pay for it or

273
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know the other reason because I was so confused when I left, I got so confused. Do you see a note, or do you happen to remember, Benny.

274
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is. So do you see that I'm clear because I talked about the date I talked about who I run around he this this guy. Do you know how many people he sees this pharmacist.

275
00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Not gonna remember, maybe we'll maybe won't, but that's a lot to ask from someone you just have that experience, you don't have four 500 right

276
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's really personal for you for them. It's like, oh, I just, it's another hassle.

277
00:48:54.030 --> 00:49:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That didn't go smoothly something personal about you, but it's like I just want to give these people, their medication to get them going just want to give a book, but people right that's their job is to go, go, go.

278
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.510
Bianca Garcia: That's kind of why I restrained from even asking, by the time I get it. I'm like, Okay, bye.

279
00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No, there's a difference. It's about remember I was telling you earlier about your right

280
00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, to ask a question. And that's the psychological one that's you have to borrow from how I would advocate for my child.

281
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I have the same right even if I'm an addict or whatever you're labeling yourself with the minute you still have it right here have a huge you have kidney rights. Now this pharmacists has a right to be a jerk.

282
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But hey, it's true. More promises has a super, super nice day. Having a super friendly attitude also has the right to be helpful.

283
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The risk is we don't know how it's going to go. But when you show up for yourself.

284
00:49:55.830 --> 00:50:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: BIANCA you have the confidence and you're in this sense of I want information. That's it. I'm not here trying to score some Danny's some extra a Percocet and sell them on the street. That's not why you're at the counter.

285
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not why you're there. So ask a question right now if you don't have that part, it's unlikely, you'll have that confidence to be able to remember

286
00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: To say these things were practicing now because it's emotional for you remember how you said I was anxious, right, then it's like I'm getting anxiety anti anxiety medication. I'm feeling anxious right now like this is like, this is insane.

287
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But when you have that sense of self confidence. It's going to bolster which means turn up.

288
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: The file of your confidence to be able to say, What's that stuff I practice with when Oh, be clear. Don't give story, unless they ask for it.

289
00:50:56.370 --> 00:51:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, so watch again. What, what are some of the pieces that made me sound clear, see if you can identify them again. Do you remember the date date. Got it. What else name of the person, the name of not only. So tell me which person.

290
00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be the pharmacist, I believe, her name is Maggie okay and psychiatrists

291
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.940
Bianca Garcia: Card.

292
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To car to car. Yes, that's it. Now, if you start there and you say, Hey, Maggie. Um, do you remember. And what's the date when was that

293
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:49.020
Bianca Garcia: It was well I spoke with her last month, but I spoke with her just a regular farm. She's the main one.

294
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a story. Notice that's a story that is that just now just me trying to figure out do I because I spoke with maybe last month, but I spoke with other pharmacist.

295
00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.290
Bianca Garcia: About it about my prescription, but I don't know their name. I don't know who do

296
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you've got you've got some choices, notice that even right now at how productive. Is it because you're going to be relying on an unknown person's memory. You don't even know who to get the information from

297
00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And hoping that Maggie remembers. I don't know how many customers are they go through a pharmacist, but a month ago. Oh my gosh, that's asking a lot, isn't it. Yeah, so

298
00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.120
Bianca Garcia: Remember the pharmacist one, the one I spoke to her face.

299
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. So when you see her, and you may wander in there, whatever maybe have another reason to shop around you when you get note the name and then you could go in and say, Sarah will call her Sarah. Sarah.

300
00:52:51.420 --> 00:53:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have the person we're going to, we're going to hope remembers. This is the main person. I think you're going to be asking, and you're going to start with what Sarah knows

301
00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: On what date Bianca. Are you talking about what date is Sarah going to have to remember, in order to give you clarification.

302
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:13.470
Oh, it was just

303
00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Monday. Monday is may 18. Yep. Okay. Cool. So hey, Sarah. Um, do you remember me, we kind of had had we were kind of talking, I picked up a script on the team. And she looks at you and she's like, No, I'm sorry. You go, okay, cool, cool, cool. Um,

304
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe there's a note inside the record. Can you take a second. I don't mean to be a bother.

305
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you could just look for me, Sarah I'm

306
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I left on Monday being really confused about why my Psychiatry's wouldn't let me pick up my script on Monday, I had to wait and you know how it is right now.

307
00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to schlep out here and it's so scary for me as it is to be out with a coven I'm trying to minimize my shopping as much as I can. So I left me really confused. Do you see any notes of why Dr. Deckard

308
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't give me that script on that day on Monday. Does it show a reason I'm making up a story in my head that it's because of insurance, but you know what other days there hasn't been an issue when I pick it up early. Some really confused you see any notes, Sarah.

309
00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did you notice I did.

310
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.690
Or you told her the date we spoken and

311
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:40.950
Bianca Garcia: Regarding

312
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the whole

313
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:50.970
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, it was a lot more clear. I just wish I could do that, but I'm gonna do my best.

314
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so just now, what just happened like are you feeling anxious and nervous now.

315
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:01.380
Just

316
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:06.360
Bianca Garcia: Trying to recycle the whole be

317
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So look when something's new for the same reason I kind of was thinking maybe make a poster when something's new we want cues. We want to have them around. If I'm learning a new language.

318
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to put little stickies everywhere. And I'm going to have all these things so that I can go oh yeah oh yeah

319
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm not flashcards, if I'm trying to memorize something for a science test or for history. I'm going to have flash card so that I can cue myself and quiz myself.

320
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would this be any different, why not write down what I want to say to Sarah's and made up name for the pharmacist. We don't know yet. There's nothing wrong with having it written out you know that the wrong with it.

321
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the facts are when we're stressed.

322
00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The emotional part of our brain, the amygdala hijack. Do you know that word hijack

323
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, holds captive right

324
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: hijacks our brain, which means we can't remember anything.

325
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever been nervous when you're taking a test or you're about to say something to someone, all the sudden you completely draw a blank. Yeah.

326
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there you go. You're not broken. It's, it's that the emotions.

327
00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Literally block a signal of wanting to retrieve information from the hippocampus it completely blocks it so you can't get the information. So the first thing you got to do.

328
00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is we got to feel calm. It's got to use that breathing, believe it or not, that's the time for mindfulness practices, whether it's grounding. The five senses, you learn something else that belly breathing you right before you walk up to the front.

329
00:56:48.630 --> 00:57:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I deserve to ask a question. So I have that in my mind. Right. That's my fundamental belief about the moment and I'm calm and I'm breathing. It's okay. I have a right to ask a question.

330
00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like everybody else does. And then you notice you're feeling calmer and then all of a sudden you remember you wrote down what you wanted to ask you look at it, you say, Sarah. I've got this in front of me. I want to make sure I didn't get too nervous and forget

331
00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Something wrong with that. If you decide to share that or you don't. You say, okay, so I wrote this date down, Sarah. On May 18. Is there any little note in my account about why my psychiatrist Deckard didn't give me my medicine on Monday, and then

332
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You should push and she looks

333
00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you go on with a story. Go ahead. Go ahead. I did.

334
00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.750
Bianca Garcia: I did write down but

335
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:56.280
Bianca Garcia: It was a big old thing so I wasn't clear. I wasn't sure to say that, but I did write down. Remember thoughts like thing that I remembered

336
00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a beautiful story.

337
00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.020
Bianca Garcia: So I'm gonna break it down.

338
00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So big old story and break it down if you just break down the story. Remember, if I'm a psychiatrist. Yeah, no.

339
00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:22.230
Bianca Garcia: You said the lady, I remember and stuff but me as I'm going to erase everything else that I put down bro, then I did. It was like a paragraph and

340
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

341
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:29.670
Bianca Garcia: It was just so I can remember you know details or whatever. But I guess they don't really need that story anyway.

342
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so here's the thing. Typically, and this is in our families in a typical family, our family will ask for the story the family, a parent will say you need to justify why you behave the way you did in our families of origin.

343
00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That happens, we have to explain and defend ourselves right

344
00:58:55.740 --> 00:59:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But in a in a setting like this yeah you knowing what you want is what you start with your customer, and you have a right to ask for what you want.

345
00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: If they want the story. Well, why do you ask, Well, it's kind of a long story. Sure. You want the right. It's a long story. I got it right here.

346
00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a long story, but the short but given the short version them well because

347
00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I went to pick up my prescription on Monday with every expectation, I can pick it up my insurance that it would be covered.

348
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And for some reason you I think a Sarah, you spoke with Dr. Dre card and for some reason it was specific and he said you cannot pick it up today.

349
00:59:45.720 --> 01:00:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was wondering what was it a clinical reason. Was it a financial reason is there a note in there a pharmacist. Is there a note. Do you remember even maybe. Remember, you see, all I'm doing is focusing on what I want

350
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want

351
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.230
Bianca Garcia: Sorry, my neighbors. She's a good day. Then I

352
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Should, are you good. Yeah. Oh, sorry.

353
01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So the difference. The difference between your approach and will kind of bring today to a close with this, the differences

354
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You in general, probably come from a place of I'm going to have to explain myself.

355
01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: A position of defense a position of almost like a one down like less than which that's not real. You're, you're not less than anybody. You are the same, same.

356
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the same rights to ask a question, same rights to refuse the same, same as everybody doesn't matter what happened at best.

357
01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.070
Bianca Garcia: So if she wants.

358
01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:56.340
Bianca Garcia: Story. I'm not gonna be the long version but um

359
01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.300
I don't know, like, how would I

360
01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, how about we do this, I can be you give me your worst. What's the, what's the worst thing this this woman can say it that way, just, oh, what's your worst scare

361
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:13.590
Bianca Garcia: Me. Well, I mean me

362
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Play it out your mind because your mind is going to come up with the worst scenario that's what's that's what's the overthinking so let me hear it.

363
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

364
01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.870
Bianca Garcia: Wow, I would just think that after I asked to be like well

365
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:33.540
Bianca Garcia: I don't know I maybe I'm

366
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: All for it. BIANCA over here. Anyway, that's what I'm forced to do these things. So go for it. What's the worst thing she could say that would make you feel really anxious

367
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:52.170
Bianca Garcia: Well, I hope she doesn't ask for the story because then that would definitely bring back the whole memory thing.

368
01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So really you don't want her to ask you why.

369
01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:57.180
Yeah.

370
01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's the second piece. Go back to the original

371
01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: belief about yourself.

372
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You do not have to defend yourself. You don't have to. Yeah, you're right, isn't going to be nothing flawed or wrong with the reason why you're asking the question.

373
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to come up with a fancy explanation. So let's play it out. I want you to do it. Don't doubt yourself, you're going to see me role play. I'm going to pretend to be you. So give me the, give me your horse. Come on, get into it, pretend you're on stage.

374
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not the best actress, you're my

375
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:47.490
Bianca Garcia: Well, I would think that she would be like well

376
01:02:49.440 --> 01:03:00.120
Bianca Garcia: I have no idea. I just, it comes up in my head, but when I say I don't even know how it would be the worst. I guess it's really not the worst if she would just ask, but

377
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet you still haven't done it. Say it out loud.

378
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:05.790
Say,

379
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:08.070
Bianca Garcia: Hey, what else

380
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know exactly the thing that you keep avoiding to think, Oh, I can't imagine she'll say it. Say it. Go for it. I'm right here. It's just me. I'm not the pharmacist. What's the worst thing. Come on your worst thing.

381
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So I asked my data and she says what back to me.

382
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:35.970
Bianca Garcia: Asking like why or why or who just

383
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, what happened and who so you got the why, the what the who now sudden likely she would phrase it quite like that, and probably be

384
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: A sentence. So, pick, pick one. Start with one. Do you want to ask, like a full sentence with the word why in it. You're almost there. Bianca, you're almost there. Go for it. I'm ready. Your worst

385
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:06.450
Bianca Garcia: Why

386
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:12.870
Bianca Garcia: Why this happened. I don't know why that the pharmacy.

387
01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.980
Bianca Garcia: Calling and he came to see

388
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You in this scenario, I'm you. So I just I just said, hey, on Tuesday doctrine bloody blah, is there a note in there. Why the pharmacist and give it to me on Monday, though.

389
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:53.670
Bianca Garcia: Was thinking about me. I'm thinking that bad, even though, whatever they say, I don't think it would be bad. Maybe it's just my thoughts because now that I'm thinking about me being the pharmacist, be like, Oh, well, the doctor said, For this reason it's not that bad.

390
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:59.100
Bianca Garcia: Maybe I just put it in my head like it would be, I don't know, I can't think of anything bad

391
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.900
Bianca Garcia: Well, I

392
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably you're editing a little bit because you've been thinking about it for days. It's been on your mind.

393
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's probably just really risky to even say it out loud, like maybe even I will minimize it. And I will judge it. I'm not going to. You're going to get to see me. Pretend I'm you at the worst. Why don't you be kind of nasty. Why don't you be rude to me.

394
01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:32.400
Bianca Garcia: Guess you would just be like, well, it just said there. This isn't it. Here you go, like, making it

395
01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on, hold on. Don't explain it.

396
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It just says what

397
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.320
Bianca Garcia: Oh, well, the doctor said, For this reason.

398
01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, for this reason, okay, simple and just be like, Okay, like on your way on your way. So she okay you think she would actually say go on your way though, do you think no.

399
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:55.980
Bianca Garcia: No, that's okay. Explain.

400
01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:56.940
That so

401
01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just go with what she might say, oh, OK, I see Dr. To card. I'm it yeah I just see the

402
01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The prescription was viable. On May 18 or I should say say something like that to me.

403
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be

404
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:24.960
Bianca Garcia: For this date, but the doctors said is ready for whatever reason.

405
01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm. Oh, thank you for looking in, in the record. So there was some notation. That's great.

406
01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I was confused about on Monday was if it said why I couldn't pick the prescription out to see any reasoning. Why I just, I don't want to have to waste a trip again because I tried to pick scripts up all at once. Um, does it say any reasoning as to why

407
01:06:58.050 --> 01:06:59.040
Do why

408
01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you oh and and Sarah promises, Sarah, do you remember kind of that conversation for Monday, or do you have a lot of customers and maybe you forgot. But you do kind of remember talking with that psychiatrist.

409
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:16.560
Bianca Garcia: Oh no. Somebody else spoke with her.

410
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, oh, okay. So would your recommendation be that I call the psychiatrist and find out. I mean, it doesn't say anything about my insurance wouldn't cover it that day.

411
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.440
No.

412
01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.690
Doctor

413
01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Reason, and it doesn't say why so, my best bet. Would you recommend I just call that Psychiatry's myself.

414
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. All right, so I'm all go do that. Let's just I want to make sure, since I'm already here that there's 24 blah blah blahs in that bottle.

415
01:07:49.890 --> 01:08:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just count it out or let me just check and make sure you know what. Thank you, Sarah and I really appreciate you're looking into it for me. I've had a couple of challenges and I want it. I want to see if there's something on my end that I can solve. Thank you so much.

416
01:08:08.970 --> 01:08:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll see you in a week.

417
01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What do I look like I don't deserve to ask my question.

418
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Not wrapped up. I'm not wrapped up in I'm an addict. Mm hmm. Not wrapped up. I'm not worried about that. I have a right

419
01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a nice good person. I just want information. And I know they're busy and I'm sweet. So all apologize. I say, oh, I appreciate your taking an extra minute for me right I raised my tone. I kind of make it high pitch and squeaky

420
01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And I use those skills to sort of say, I really appreciate taking this extra minute. I think it's going to help me be able, in the next two and three and four times I come here to to problem solve and make sure what happened like on Monday doesn't happen again.

421
01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So really it's helping them by getting clear now. Yeah.

422
01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what do you think of this process. What was this like for you to do this, this role play and communication stuff.

423
01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:17.220
It actually helped me

424
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:29.820
Bianca Garcia: Understand that it's not, I guess, not all about what I think, or what's going on because you're right, they do go through a lot so it gave me a lot, a lot of calming and understanding

425
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:46.860
Bianca Garcia: You know, I mean, it's obvious this maybe sometimes you just gotta remember they do work with a lot of people. And yeah, so it helped me actually calm down a lot about the overthinking or what to say. And so, yeah.

426
01:09:49.590 --> 01:10:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. So thinking about your schedule. Two weeks from now put us, if you can believe it in June. Oh, I know wild this if you could do this again where you're in the car. This was awesome was nice, good connection. This worked great.

427
01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, definitely. I liked it better too. So let's go to

428
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you be able to pull off.

429
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I gotta do that.

430
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I have somebody right now. June 3 at 10 have someone said at 10 there your group is on Fridays.

431
01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how about that.

Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do 11 O'clock June 3

433
01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a Wednesday, just kind of like it'll feel like this, but an hour later.

434
01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you think it could be, it could be if you wanted to. It could be eight or nine in the morning.

435
01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's good. Okay. All right. So we have June 3 11am Mountain Standard Time.

Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have to check with you guys, I just do it automatically. All right, enjoy your day and I'll see on Friday. Thank you.
