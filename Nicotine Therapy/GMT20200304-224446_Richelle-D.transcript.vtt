91
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.300
Richelle Direny: And I can imagine.

92
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.410

98
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:28.290

99
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:47.160
Brittany Mount: Told them like, Listen, I like this. Now, I happen to my soul, my pills that I didn't press charges or anything like to get the Wall Balls with it. I didn't want to be kicked out a program. And I just want to be honest with you. Tell you like what's going on and

100
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.110

Brittany Mount: Didn't know what to do about the situation like I didn't want to press charges and all that, but I mean either enough trouble as

156
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.760
Richelle Direny: You didn't want to get him in trouble is that

157
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.740
Richelle Direny: Correct me from wrong granted. He's your daughter's father

158
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.040
Richelle Direny: Getting calling the cops and letting him know.

159
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.840
Brittany Mount: Yes, the consequences for

160
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.040
Richelle Direny: Him taking pills.

161
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.880
Richelle Direny: lend him in jail, but then it also takes

162
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.460
Richelle Direny: Him away from your daughter, and then

163
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.290
Richelle Direny: For me,

164
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.310
Brittany Mount: I'm the bad guy.

165
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.400
Brittany Mount: And then I'm the bad guy or

166
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.570
Richelle Direny: Be deemed as the bad guy in in her eyes.

167
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:46.380
Right.

168
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:48.690
Okay.

169
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.370
Richelle Direny: So, um,

170
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.840
Richelle Direny: So when you discovered that the pills were taken.

171
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.030
Richelle Direny: Did you like go into panic mode.

172
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.050
Yeah.

173
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.100
Brittany Mount: Yeah so searching for now just

174
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:25.110
Brittany Mount: And I mean, I knew where I put them on the right in the bottle way neighbors and they just wasn't there, but I searched around and looked around and maybe they dropped one or maybe they don't have to come for the, you have to be in a hurry to do it.

175
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.020
Richelle Direny: Now let me ask you.

176
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.440
Richelle Direny: This

177
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:35.280
Richelle Direny: Do you think okay so based on your experience right now. Do you think that you are in control.

178
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:50.940
Richelle Direny: Of your, your, your life in terms of your thoughts, your emotions or your actions and babe or or with this experience. Do you think that the taking of this particular meds still have some degree of control over you.

179
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:51.930
Yeah.

180
00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.380
Brittany Mount: I mean, without it like

181
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.890
Brittany Mount: I don't know what I would, I don't know what I would do.

182
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.610
Richelle Direny: If you were not able to buy it off the streets, what would have been your next move.

183
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.370
Brittany Mount: I would probably resorted going back to something else to say. Top of the sector.

184
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.540
Brittany Mount: Like

185
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.130
Brittany Mount: I need a one night Hall and it sounds that

186
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:40.860
Richelle Direny: So this is the reason why I'm asking is because this is kind of your moment to really consider

187
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.280
Richelle Direny: What is it that

188
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.610
Brittany Mount: If your

189
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:47.940
Brittany Mount: Goal.

190
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.260
Richelle Direny: Is to not now, but to one day start tapering off.

191
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.010
The

192
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:54.900
Brittany Mount: Tester.

193
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.190
To say

194
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.030
Richelle Direny: Are you really willing to taper yourself off of it.

195
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.470
Brittany Mount: Because this

196
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:30.090
Richelle Direny: Does be on this medication or this taking taking these pills. Is it controlling me. Am I on this road to recovery. True. Am I truly on this road of recovery or am I still dependent upon something to stabilize me in comparison to really truly doing the work to address those.

197
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:41.340
Richelle Direny: situations and circumstances that caused me to depend on this medication to keep me calm or to deal with my stressors.

198
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.150
Richelle Direny: In a practical way. That's the question that you

199
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.890
Richelle Direny: Experienced experiencing this. It's just food for thought.

200
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.410
Richelle Direny: Because, are you is your goal is

201
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.720
Richelle Direny: What is your

202
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.300
Richelle Direny: Goal authentically speaking organically.

203
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:09.900
Speaking

204
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.310
Brittany Mount: Me.

205
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:11.820
Richelle Direny: When I say

206
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.800
Richelle Direny: Organic without anything

207
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.410
Brittany Mount: What are you hoping to accomplish.

208
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.950
Brittany Mount: Through right within the next

209
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.380
Brittany Mount: I'd say year year like around a year. I'd like to

210
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.630
Brittany Mount: Eat pretty much all of it.

211
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.600
Richelle Direny: But with what you just

212
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.740
Richelle Direny: Experienced now.

213
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.990
Richelle Direny: Do you think that you're at a place

214
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.250
Richelle Direny: To based on your experience. That's what I'm saying.

215
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.770
Richelle Direny: Based on your experience. It's kind of like

216
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:45.300
Richelle Direny: What you

217
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:57.570
Brittany Mount: Like me, I didn't like the filling them happened to be that. Not me. I'm depending on it and i don't i don't like that. Like, I don't want to always have to be dependent on something. Mm hmm.

218
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.830
Think about

219
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.300
Richelle Direny: I don't have my pills. I can't take my pills.

220
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.010
Richelle Direny: How did you respond to

221
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.560
Richelle Direny: The reality of you, not having this medical you're frozen. So, can you hear me.

222
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.950
Richelle Direny: Can you hear me cuz you're frozen.

223
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.290
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I can hear you. I'm gonna turn off the video.

224
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:33.540
Okay.

225
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.220
Richelle Direny: So the question was, with

226
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:50.250
Richelle Direny: Your reality in the last two weeks of not being on the pill or not having it not having free access to it like you did.

227
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.700
Richelle Direny: Your behavior, your response to your reality.

228
00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.850
Richelle Direny: Did any of that.

229
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:12.060
Richelle Direny: Was it a direct reflection of your life when you work on whatever drugs you were on prior and how you

230
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:19.170
Brittany Mount: Your behavior. I mean pretty much cuz I was out again. Once again, searching kind of mine.

231
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.610
Brittany Mount: Suboxone. I mean, when I, when I look at the heroin, but

232
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:25.920
Richelle Direny: Something else.

233
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:37.620
Richelle Direny: Yeah okay so your behavior, your actions, your thoughts in your behavior we're such up. And so in the question that I'm asking now is

234
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:41.850
Richelle Direny: With

235
00:19:44.010 --> 00:20:00.570
Richelle Direny: If you give him that you have the money you have the resources will add a mystery. Because you had the knowledge that I can go out on the streets and I can purchase this if it wasn't freely accessible to you and you couldn't find anybody, what would your next step.

236
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.050
Richelle Direny: And your responses that my next step we

237
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.540
Brittany Mount: I would have to find something, but

238
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:15.330
Richelle Direny: He'll places you somewhat in that old life that you're working so hard to come away from right

239
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.220
Brittany Mount: Yeah, dependent

240
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.670
Richelle Direny: On something to help me with.

241
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.000
Richelle Direny: When I feel overwhelmed by

242
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.240
Winning

243
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:25.590
Richelle Direny: Huh.

Richelle Direny: Now with all the work that you're doing with because we've talked a lot about you know all of what you've done to pretty much be where you are right now, for the most part, working to regain custody of your daughter, not wanting that to take

250
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.320
Brittany Mount: Taken away from you.

251
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:12.840
Richelle Direny: The relationship being rebuilt with your dad and just kind of everything that's around it that and not wanting to lose that necessarily

252
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:13.980
Brittany Mount: Everybody

253
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.020
Richelle Direny: Talks about your mom.

254
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:16.650
Richelle Direny: And

259
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.740
Richelle Direny: You're now in a stable mind and you're looking at everything around you, and you're like, man, I don't want to go.

260
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:35.400
there anymore.

261
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:49.350
Richelle Direny: If, if you were so if I could play a movie right now and I played that movie on you in the last two weeks, what would that have like what would have been different in that movie.

262
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.150
Richelle Direny: If you're speaking I don't hear anything. You're saying

263
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:17.970
Brittany Mount: I mean, I said, Be like almost like a total flip opposite because I went from not doing those behaviors to happen with finger and now I'm back to

264
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.350
Brittany Mount: On a tear jerking working out by

265
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:30.930

270
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.640
Richelle Direny: I want you to think about

271
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.840
Richelle Direny: The camera in front of you is reflecting yourself.

272
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:58.230
Richelle Direny: What is it that you really truly need to work on. Can you hear me.

273

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.340
Richelle Direny: It seems like you could hear everything I'm saying, but I'm

276
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.890
Richelle Direny: Your, your

277
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.500
Richelle Direny: Reception is really, really bad.

278
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:31.830
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

279
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.670
Brittany Mount: I just live in the country and

280
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:41.520
Brittany Mount: I live out like the country. There's no service hardly

281
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.160
Richelle Direny: Also, so when you're in your house. That's when you have the better service.

282
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:52.950
Brittany Mount: Not now. I mean, I used to. They used to be the best place and within like the last week.

283
00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:06.300
Brittany Mount: I haven't been able to get weekend. I don't know. Yeah, but a week. I haven't been able to get in touch with bright heart from my house for a week. I've had to go like in town or somewhere else, just to be able to do my groups or anything.

284
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.340
Brittany Mount: Hmm.

285
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.180
Richelle Direny: OK. So the question I was asking, you know, here it is. I'm shining

286
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:22.800
Richelle Direny: Their camera. I'm going to say I'm going to put a reflection of yourself. You're in the mirror. We're standing in the mirror together.

287
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:31.890
Richelle Direny: What is it that when you look at your, your reflect your reflection in the mirror is showing the story of your last two weeks.

288
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.550
Richelle Direny: I want you to think about what is it that you truly need to

289
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:45.690
Richelle Direny: Do to start this journey of

290
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.050
Richelle Direny: Independence.

291
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.250
Richelle Direny: From what you have been depending on

292
00:24:54.450 --> 00:25:04.110
Richelle Direny: For the last few years, your dependency has changed from heroin or whatever else that you've done. It's changed to

293
00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:19.230
Richelle Direny: The Suboxone and when you didn't have it. It kind of somewhat puts you right back to figuratively speaking someone, it puts you kind of back in that old frame of mind.

294
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.850
Brittany Mount: Right on.

295
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:30.270
Richelle Direny: This journey that you're on and we're not discrediting all of that you've done to be where you are because you've done what you needed to do to be where you are.

296
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:50.730
Richelle Direny: But on this journey. I want you to look at the mirror have the last two weeks Queda a back to you. What is it that you think really, you need to do to gain your independence of anything to live in our organic life have

297
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.350
Richelle Direny: Just been free event. What do you think that you

298
00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.870
Brittany Mount: Have to like start tapering myself.

299
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.310
Brittany Mount: Here but this tapering down

300
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:15.150
Richelle Direny: Think that it's too soon. I want you to it soon it's too soon to say I need to start tapering down

301
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.790
Richelle Direny: Because you have to slowly.

302
00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.810
Brittany Mount: Like with anything.

303
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.600
Richelle Direny: You have to slowly flush things out of your system.

304
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:31.500
Richelle Direny: You're taking baby steps, but before you can take that baby step, you have to be aware of what it is you have to kind of

305
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:37.290
Richelle Direny: Pull it to the forefront and say, Is it fear of what my life will be like

306
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.640
Brittany Mount: Without anything

307
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:41.820
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

308
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.650
Brittany Mount: Yeah.

309
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.100
Brittany Mount: Yeah, I'd say like one of it's always been something

310
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.580
Brittany Mount: So yeah, I'd say a lot of it would be like

311
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.870
Brittany Mount: Learning. I don't know.

312
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.060
Brittany Mount: Kind of where this

313
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:11.010
Brittany Mount: Just a warning about what my fears are like learning more about why fear of not having it. Mm hmm.

314
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:18.030
Richelle Direny: But what is so your fear. It's not that you fear not having it you fear something

315
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:27.030
Richelle Direny: And that's the reason why you're using this to kind of band aid those fears. So the reality is

316
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.430
Richelle Direny: You are a prisoner of fear, anxiety,

317
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.990
Worry what

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:47.610
Richelle Direny: What is that what it, what are those fears name that name your fears and anxiety. What is it about life. What is it about you. What is about your circumstances. What is it that you fear the most.

Richelle Direny: You're breaking up again.

322
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.570
Brittany Mount: One time I was playing for so long without

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.180
Brittany Mount: Without me

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.760
Brittany Mount: And it was just like

Brittany Mount: Lovers which one day I was like I had for us.

326
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:29.190
Brittany Mount: And I was working and I wasn't on my feet. A lot of like problems with my leg my feet. So, and just as time progressed, when I

327
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:40.740
Brittany Mount: Started my head like well you need something or you're not gonna be able to walk by the end of the night or your you mean so much pain, you know, I mean like

328
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.470
Brittany Mount: Like I was psyched myself in me.

329
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.750
Brittany Mount: And then I ended up using shortly after

330
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.080
Richelle Direny: So,

331
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.550
Richelle Direny: You said that you were. You said you were psyching yourself out.

332
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.600
Brittany Mount: Well I putting it in my head like

333
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.160
Brittany Mount: I was entertaining the thought too much and putting into my head.

337
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:38.610
Brittany Mount: I can't get prescription from a doctor for pain meds or nothing like that. And I don't know, I just, it was like I talked myself into it.

338
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:45.180
Richelle Direny: So you talk you talk yourself into basically using what you're saying.

339
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:54.300
Richelle Direny: Okay.

Brittany Mount: I don't know if I just felt like at a point where I was at a standstill.

346
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.050
Brittany Mount: And

347
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:24.930
Brittany Mount: I'm not really sure.

348
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:36.450
Richelle Direny: Is it that you're not really sure what clean authentic on or just living looks like because it's been so long since

361
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:23.520

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:35.280
Brittany Mount: That to be totally absent that clean. There was one time I went, I went to rehab and I got out and I was good for like 18 1718 months and then

363
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.850
Brittany Mount: I don't know, it's just like a flick of a switch one day.

364
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:47.190
Richelle Direny: You know,

365
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.100
Richelle Direny: So when

366
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.140
Brittany Mount: When we talked about, like, and I think

367
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.530
Brittany Mount: About like some things means more of the alerts.

368
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.520
Well,

369
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.890
Richelle Direny: Some things are somewhat alert.

370
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.960
Brittany Mount: Behaviors in terms

371
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:17.310
Richelle Direny: Of how we deal with life because the life within itself comes with its own bout of stressors that you know it is what it is. There's not a whole lot we can do about it. We just have to learn how to cope and deal with it.

372
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.690
Brittany Mount: Let's just call it

373
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:36.210
Richelle Direny: Um, whether it's being a mom, I'm being in a relationship, and parents me whether they're overbearing whether they're men, whatever the situation is oftentimes we take on the hurt and the pain of other people.

374
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.280
Richelle Direny: Um, hold on one second. Okay.

375
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.090
Okay.

376
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.250
Richelle Direny: Hello.

377
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:45.060
Richelle Direny: Hello. Sorry. So, um,

378
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:58.050
Richelle Direny: As I said, you know, there stressors that comes with just like we get overwhelmed and we become anxious and we become fearful when we see other people going through what they're going through.

379
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:06.330
Richelle Direny: Their life circumstances we tired somewhat taken on why do we take it on. I don't know. But we take it on. And then we kind of

380
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.070
Brittany Mount: Incorporated into our own

381
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:14.190
Richelle Direny: Lives and it brings on fear and anxiety brings on all kinds of things. And so we often go through life.

382
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:33.870
Richelle Direny: Not knowing why did I do this. Why am I acting this way. Why am I dependent on this because we take on just everything in life and we applied to ourselves. So then when I talk about. Is it fear is it anxiety. Like, what is it for you that holds you

383
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:40.800
Richelle Direny: In that place of dependency. What is it that holds you in that place of dependency.

384
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.020
Richelle Direny: You may wonder, well, am I really independence.

385
00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:51.210
Richelle Direny: What your what your situations that occurred in the last few weeks.

386
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.700
Richelle Direny: It confirms that

387
00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:55.950
Richelle Direny: Concept of dependency.

388
00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:00.570
Richelle Direny: And so you have to come to that place where you say,

389
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.800
Richelle Direny: Yes, I'm taking these pills.

390
00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.470
Richelle Direny: To help me to call on to help me to just get through.

391
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.850
Richelle Direny: And help me to stop the cravings helped me to do all of that.

392
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:26.580
Richelle Direny: What I need to really truly do the work. So that when I forget to take a pill or I'm not able to take a pill. I don't turn into

393
00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.220
Richelle Direny: A Johnny Green Monster.

394
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:38.370
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you understand. So now you're not snapping at your boyfriend. You're not snapping at your daughter.

395
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.350
Richelle Direny: And they're wondering like, what, what

396
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:46.110
Richelle Direny: Happened like I didn't do anything. And the reason why you're getting upset. It's because of

397
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:52.770
Richelle Direny: This and I'm overwhelmed because I didn't take my medication or I didn't do this and I didn't do that.

398
00:35:53.460 --> 00:36:03.660
Brittany Mount: Right. Yeah, it was a challenge with once my like my boyfriend. He was at work. I was at work and whenever he came home and I was like,

And I get up the next morning, whenever he came in and he seen me like looking around, he's like, why was he here when we weren't home and I told him I was like, like

447
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:14.850
Brittany Mount: But

448
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.610
Richelle Direny: So, but the whole bottom line is, I think,

449
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:23.700
Richelle Direny: Would you agree.

450
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:27.420
Richelle Direny: When I say it's it's more of you.

451
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:34.140
Richelle Direny: Just having faith in yourself and your abilities.

452
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.970
Brittany Mount: What do you hold on, wait what you mean.

453
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:43.920
Brittany Mount: I'm asking

454
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:51.660
Richelle Direny: Is it that you don't have a whole lot of faith in your own self in your abilities and everything that you have done, um,

455
00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.710
Brittany Mount: And how far you probably. Yeah. Like, I mean, I just

456
00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.790
Brittany Mount: There's a lot of faces. I never really done

457
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:14.460
Brittany Mount: 17 years. I'm so not exactly, you know, my own way so many different times. It's, yeah, I think.

458
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.600
Brittany Mount: I'd say a lot of it has to do with not having a lot of faith also

459
00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:42.840
Richelle Direny: I think, and I think maybe that's what we should work on its learning for you to build, you know, faith in just in yourself, believing in yourself and knowing that you have, you are capable of doing it and just having those daily reminders that

460
00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:53.310
Richelle Direny: Done it with or without edition of the Suboxone what you are capable of it and just trusting and believing in yourself.

461
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:10.020
Richelle Direny: Wow, okay. You know, I have this thing and I just read it and I wanted to read it to you. And I want you to tell me like what your thoughts surrounding it. Like, how can you apply it to your

462
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:19.620
Richelle Direny: Daily life and I want you to, and I'm going to find a way to try to send it to you. And I want you to kind of read it daily.

463
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:29.130
Richelle Direny: Process it meditate on it and kind of apply it and like just kind of explore it again in

464
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:30.540
Brittany Mount: The next time.

465
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.240

Richelle Direny: Everything you have gotten through all the times you have pushed on even when you felt you couldn't all the mornings you got out of bed.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.070
