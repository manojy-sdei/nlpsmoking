Joan Kandel: How are you

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.390
Trevor Burger: I'm actually doing really well.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.080
Joan Kandel: Oh that's good to hear.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.160
Tell me more.

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:47.850
Trevor Burger: So I was with Brian health, for I don't know how many months. It was it was for a while, and they had me at three eight milligram strips today and I tore my ACL about eight weeks ago nine weeks ago and whenever I did that I relapsed on fitness and so

10
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.130
Trevor Burger: I don't remember the exact day I got out on Saturday. But I went to ended three weeks at the Hacienda in Texas.

11
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:08.790
Trevor Burger: Because I relapsed on the fenton on and I was doing a lot of Xanax, so I went there and they got me all the way down to I've been taking four milligrams three times a day.

12
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.170
Joan Kandel: Suboxone

13
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.220
Trevor Burger: Yes, ma'am.

14
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.460
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

15
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.620
Joan Kandel: And and how are you doing on four milligrams three times today.

16
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:36.720
Trevor Burger: I'm actually doing really good right now. I mean, the three weeks was really hard, but because it went really fast. But I'm glad that they did it. I feel like it works a lot better where I'm at right now than it was at 24

17
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.770
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. What do you think is different.

18
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.560
Trevor Burger: I feel like I mean I was taking a at first I was at two, eight milligrams trips a day and then

19
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.460
Trevor Burger: I forget the doctor's name that it. I can't even remember his name that bright heart health, he will. I was started having real bad diarrhea.

20
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.630
Joan Kandel: I Dr element.

21
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:19.140
Trevor Burger: Yeah. And he decided to go up to 24 and it seemed like as soon as I went to 24. It was like nothing. It wasn't really working for anything. I mean like I wasn't having stomach problems, but my body started hurting, and I was having real bad anxiety all the time and

22
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:35.280
Trevor Burger: I mean, I also, I wasn't working like a program, either at the time. I finally am back into that with my sponsor and stuff and then go into meetings, but it seemed like once I got down to the for forum for it was

23
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:47.880
Trevor Burger: I just started feeling normal again. I, I wouldn't have not having any kind of body aches or sweats, or really, I'm not really having any withdraws at all, or any anxiety.

24
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.490
Trevor Burger: And awesome. The doctor that I was at La Hacienda he

25
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.360
Trevor Burger: He gave me. It's called Inderal

26
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.950
Trevor Burger: For anxiety. And so I had been taking that and he sent me home with the prescription of it.

27
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.030
Trevor Burger: And you sent me home with the prescription for like a sleeping.

28
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.930
Joan Kandel: They're all

29
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.120
Trevor Burger: Here, I'll show it to you.

30
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.190
Trevor Burger: It's called the real the generic is called per panel.

31
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.100
Joan Kandel: Oh propranolol oh

32
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.620
Joan Kandel: Yeah yeah yeah

33
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.810
Trevor Burger: And, uh, but whenever I let

34
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.400
Joan Kandel: Us on that.

35
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.980
Trevor Burger: 20 milligrams four times a day.

36
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.110
Joan Kandel: Oh,

37
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:46.530
Trevor Burger: And I whenever I left treatment. I was, I kind of stopped taking he sent me home with asleep in bed to called rim, Ron, but since I got out. I haven't been taken anything except the Suboxone and pro panel.

38
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.790
Trevor Burger: And I wasn't going to take the panel yesterday, but I woke up.

39
00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:04.590
Trevor Burger: Yesterday morning and I was like, kind of shaken really bad and my tongue was shaking. And so I called that doctor and he said that that was from like abruptly stopping it.

40
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.870
Trevor Burger: And so I wanted to talk

41
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.720
Trevor Burger: To him, I don't want to stay on it. I was so I wanted to talk to you about how to come off of that without

42
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.590
Trevor Burger: Okay. He said it wouldn't be a problem. It just needed to be done right.

43
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.850
Joan Kandel: Yeah, we can talk about that for sure.

44
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.540
Joan Kandel: How many do you still have left of that. How many pills.

45
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.110
Trevor Burger: Are just barely filled it yesterday. So I have

46
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.650
Trevor Burger: It came with 120 and I only took three yesterday and one this morning. So I have got under 16. It was all month

47
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.720
Joan Kandel: So you've got plenty. Okay. Okay, great. Yeah, yeah. We can do you want to talk about that right now how to do that.

48
00:04:46.650 --> 00:05:03.240
Trevor Burger: He had told me I talked to him and he had just suggested like to stay on it just for a week, till I kind of readjust back to where I'm at and then talk to. He knew that I was going to call you guys back and start doing this. And so he said to talk to you about it and so

49
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.880
Trevor Burger: That's fun to me. I just because it was kind of like a culture shock coming back home out of treatment again and

50
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.150
Trevor Burger: I just thought I would get right to

51
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.740
Joan Kandel: Your readjusting to everything.

52
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.340
Trevor Burger: But I definitely don't want to stay on it.

53
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.700
So,

54
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.910
Joan Kandel: Okay, I think that's fine. So what we should do is

55
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:34.860
Joan Kandel: Let's, let's have you stay on the propranolol four times a day, like you're taking it for a week and then after that, I would suggest that you go

56
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:46.530
Joan Kandel: Like you see since you have a lot of those, then you go three times a day for two weeks ago maybe get write it on your calendar, you know,

57
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.550
Joan Kandel: What a week at four times a day two weeks at three times a day two weeks at two times a day.

58
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.840
Joan Kandel: Okay, and then

59
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.030
Joan Kandel: Two weeks at once a day, so two weeks each time.

60
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:11.850
Joan Kandel: Okay, before switching down. And then when you're on when you're on after you've been on two weeks of once a day do two weeks of one pill every other day, and then

61
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.130
Joan Kandel: And that'll be a nice

62
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.210
Joan Kandel: easy transition. So it's going to be two weeks each time.

63
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:30.390
Joan Kandel: And it's just kind of stepping down, so two weeks at three pills a day then to tip pills a day than one pill a day and in two weeks at one pill every other day.

64
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.420
Trevor Burger: I got. Thank you.

65
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:44.460
Joan Kandel: Good. Okay. Yeah, you bet. That's a nice safe slow, easy way to to do that and you know that medicine is not associated with any withdrawal symptoms or you won't

66
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.980
Joan Kandel: Feel that way. It's just kind of easing your body down

67
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.000
Joan Kandel: So that you can adjust to to everything. And that's, that's perfect.

68
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.310
Joan Kandel: And I think you'll have enough with 120

69
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.790
Joan Kandel: Bills.

70
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.570
Joan Kandel: I think that'll be an hour to do that if you're killing it out and

71
00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.770
Joan Kandel: You're getting towards the end.

72
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.540
Joan Kandel: I'm sorry, we've got a delay in the audio.

73
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.090
Joan Kandel: If you've calculated. If you're getting if you're getting to the end of

74
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:22.320
Joan Kandel: Your of your bottle and you think you don't have enough we can revisit how to taper down or you can just kind of go instead of the full two weeks in go one week at a lower amount. If you think you're going to run out and have to stop suddenly

75
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.660
Joan Kandel: So, but I don't think they're gonna, I think you're going to have enough

76
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:39.270
Trevor Burger: And I was just telling the lady that was checking me in that I just did lab work in the urine tests at the treatment I was at. So I'm going to send her the results of that. I don't know if y'all need different way, or I would send what they did.

77
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:48.210
Joan Kandel: Oh, that'd be helpful. They probably got a pretty full set of labs. Do you know if they check you for Pepsi and HIV.

78
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.650
Trevor Burger: Yeah, they checked me for all of that my liver stuff everything

79
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.780
Joan Kandel: Oh, that's perfect. Yeah, that is a staff we check. And what was your

80
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.270
Joan Kandel: How are your lives.

81
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.510
Trevor Burger: Nothing came back, he said everything was normal.

82
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:13.950
Joan Kandel: Okay. Oh, that's great. Good. Yeah, so getting a copy of those labs will probably suffice that'll probably be good.

83
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:14.760
Trevor Burger: Or good

84
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.440
Trevor Burger: I'll make sure I get it done today.

85
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.270
Joan Kandel: Okay, perfect. And

86
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.480
Joan Kandel: How many Suboxone. Do you still have left.

87
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.360
Trevor Burger: I don't have any from you guys and my mom actually had she holds the bottle and

88
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:45.540
Trevor Burger: He sent me home with a 62 milligram ones. So a Saturday I took Saturday, and he took eight because we didn't fill it to like the middle of the afternoon, and then yesterday I took

89
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:57.030
Trevor Burger: Notes. I took four of them on Saturday I took six of them yesterday and then to this morning. Whenever I woke up.

90
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.080
Joan Kandel: Okay. All right.

91
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.870
Joan Kandel: Did a now i think that they make a strip. That's four milligrams

92
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.620
Trevor Burger: Yeah, they

93
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.470
Joan Kandel: Are you could get an eight milligram and cut it.

94
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.840
Trevor Burger: They make four milligram

95
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.100
Joan Kandel: That seems easier than

96
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.930
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. And what, why did he prescribed the two milligrams once

97
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.820
Joan Kandel: That's just what's a reason

98
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.420
Joan Kandel: Or it's

99
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.220
Trevor Burger: That's just what they were.

100
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:35.910
Trevor Burger: Okay, even whenever they were tapering me down and I was taking 12 milligrams in the morning and at night, they would give me six of those. I don't really know why that's just

101
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.200
Joan Kandel: What they do, okay.

102
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.420
Joan Kandel: That's just what they had. Okay, that's fine. It'll just be easier to not have

103
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.370
Trevor Burger: To do so many

104
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.830
Joan Kandel: So, so we can

105
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.970
Joan Kandel: We can do the overprescribe the four milligram. And then you can take

106
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.070
Joan Kandel: Three of those a day.

107
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:08.370
Joan Kandel: Alternatively we could do that eight milligram, and you can cut them and you can do one and a half a day do you care.

108
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.810
Trevor Burger: No either whatever, if you could do the four milligram strips. That's fine.

109
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:20.370
Joan Kandel: Okay, I, I just, it's, um, the problem with the formula grand strips. Is that a lot of our

110
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.810
Trevor Burger: Star my face off. Yeah, and I live in

111
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.990
Joan Kandel: The tools or the elites are you in

112
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.250
Trevor Burger: love us or we're yeah I'm in Clovis, so I would probably do the eight sexually

113
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.410
Trevor Burger: And all I think

114
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.620
Trevor Burger: Because, yeah.

115
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:44.970
Joan Kandel: I think so too. That's what I think it's rare for pharmacies to cover it, especially in a small town like Clovis

116
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:56.820
Joan Kandel: So that's so we'll do the will do the eight and then did you do you feel it works better for you or is there a reason that you're taking it three times a day instead of all at once.

117
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:06.540
Trevor Burger: Yeah, it seemed like whenever I took because they tried it at the treatment to for they made me do it for three days. Just to see if my body would kind of

118
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.890
Trevor Burger: Get used to it, but whenever I did it. It just seemed like I would take it at six in the morning and then it seemed by

119
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:28.860
Trevor Burger: 536 sometimes even a little earlier it I would start going back into withdrawal and whenever I take, I take it at 772 in the afternoon and 9pm seven hours apart. That's how I do it.

120
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.230
Trevor Burger: And it and it gets me all the way through the night I sleep. Good. I don't have any problems at all.

121
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.450
Joan Kandel: Got it.

122
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.660
Joan Kandel: Well, we're not going to mess with success.

123
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.120
Trevor Burger: So we'll keep you at the same

124
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.980
Trevor Burger: I'm pretty sure

125
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:54.390
Trevor Burger: I'm happy to hear that you're doing well. Yes, ma'am. I appreciate it. And do you know when my next group or whatever is

126
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.020
Joan Kandel: Yes, yeah. We'll talk we'll talk about all that stuff.

127
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.410
Joan Kandel: Alright.

128
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:11.790
Joan Kandel: So,

129
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:22.830
Joan Kandel: Yeah, let's, let's talk about that right now before I ask you a question. Um, so, um,

130
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:35.070
Joan Kandel: Do you have a, do you, I know that you've. There are actually three docks in in New Mexico. And so you've already met all three of us.

131
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:42.600
Joan Kandel: Dr element. Dr. Gabriel and me Dr candle. Do you have a preference of who you'd like to see

132
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:51.390
Trevor Burger: I mean, honestly, if you are Dr element is fine. I didn't really enjoy being with Gwen and her mom like that. It was kind of

133
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.160
Trevor Burger: It just seemed like it was a bunch of him talking and nothing really getting done.

134
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.370
Trevor Burger: I'm fine with you. Honestly, that's perfectly fine. Okay.

135
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.400
Joan Kandel: That sounds good. So, um, so my groups are

136
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.480
Joan Kandel: Well, let me ask you first, are you working

137
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.110
Trevor Burger: Yeah, the last time we were doing.

138
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:33.360
Trevor Burger: That I was doing the group on Friday at noon and then I was doing the next week, I was meeting with going and then going back to group, but I know I'll have to do it for twice a week at first, so I can make whatever work right now. I worked for my family, so I

139
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.250
Joan Kandel: Really can't. What's your work schedule.

Joan Kandel: Oh, good. All right.

150
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.860
Joan Kandel: I'm off work so

151
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.430
Joan Kandel: Oh, perfect. Then you won't even have to shift anything around

152
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.410
Joan Kandel: That's good. There's some good folks in that group. I think you'll like them.

153
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:15.750
Joan Kandel: So,

154
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.400
Joan Kandel: That group is I'm the doctor in that group and Dominique Is the therapist. I don't think you've met Dominique

155
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.700
Or

156
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.250
Joan Kandel: Yeah, she's really wonderful. So, um,

157
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.690
Joan Kandel: So she will get in touch with you to set up an individual appointment with her.

158
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:37.950
Joan Kandel: And she

159
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.130
Joan Kandel: Social email you this email work for you. Do you check your email, yes.

160
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.450
Trevor Burger: Yeah, I do all the time.

161
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:54.450
Joan Kandel: Okay Okay perfect, so she'll email you to try to get together a time and she is

162
00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:05.640
Joan Kandel: She's, she's, she's busy and she really values her time. So it really upsets her, when people say they're going to show up and they don't. So make sure that you show up to that appointment.

163
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.600
Joan Kandel: I mean, she's super nice. And she's wonderful, but she she just really bothers her a lot to not tell people not show up.

164
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.190
Joan Kandel: And so

165
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.030
Trevor Burger: Don't do that to her.

166
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:16.920
Trevor Burger: Rightfully so

167
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:28.020
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Right. Right. I totally get that. So, um, so she'll get in touch with you and make sure that it's a time that you can do, and she can do and then yes for the

168
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:39.150
Joan Kandel: For a while you'll be doing. I mean, for a long time, you'll be doing the weekly groups and then you'll be meeting with her, at least at the beginning, once a week to kind of get

169
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:44.580
Joan Kandel: Get settled again and make sure that you're that you're nice and stable, especially because you're just coming out of

170
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:54.450
Joan Kandel: You know, being in an inpatient setting and back home and readjusting that's just a real tricky time. So getting as much support as you

171
00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.830
Trevor Burger: As you need is going to be good.

172
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.330
Trevor Burger: For sure.

173
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:05.310
Joan Kandel: Yeah so. So your first group will be tomorrow, actually.

174
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:19.290
Joan Kandel: At six. So as you know, you know, Bret Hart very well. So check in about a half an hour beforehand to the virtual clinic and then they'll give you the number to enter into the group and then you you'll meet

175
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.520
Trevor Burger: To Monique and you'll meet the

176
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:36.540
Joan Kandel: Folks at the group. So it sounds like. And usually, as you know, we usually do the the refills at the group. So it sounds like you have enough to get you from today for today and tomorrow. Don't you eat it. Okay.

177
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.710
Joan Kandel: Awesome. So, tomorrow is when I'll prescribe it for you. Do you know

178

Trevor Burger: When you'll run out. Um, so I have. So I took or six

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.960
Joan Kandel: And you're taking 12 a day.

181
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:02.760
Joan Kandel: It's only

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.740
Trevor Burger: It's only six today.

183
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.040
Joan Kandel: We're taking six a day. That's right. You're taking six a day.

184
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.260
Trevor Burger: Okay, so. Okay, so you have a

185
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:11.880
Trevor Burger: Day seven more days.

186
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.720
Trevor Burger: Or did I. Yeah. That's awesome.

187
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.870
Trevor Burger: Yeah, it's a

188
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.260
Trevor Burger: Habit.

189
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.100
You have

190
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.710
Joan Kandel: Okay, awesome. Good.

191
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.370
Joan Kandel: Excellent.

192
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:46.380
Joan Kandel: Good. So tell me a little bit about that, about what your experience was like when you went to

193
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.910
Joan Kandel: The

194
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.560
Rehab

195
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.120
Trevor Burger: I mean, I don't really remember the first week, the first week was really hard and then

196
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.280
Trevor Burger: But I really enjoyed it. I've been to a few treatment centers and

197
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:14.400
Trevor Burger: It just seemed like place was one that had kind of cut off all the bullshit that most places, you know, use the first couple weeks teaching you and just kind of got right to that what you needed to

198
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:34.860
Trevor Burger: I did my fourth while I was in there. I'm meeting with my sponsor tonight to do start doing more and it just kind of got me fired up for it all again i i hadn't been doing it since I started the Suboxone and it was just kind of like a breath of fresh air. It really helped me I

199
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.850
Joan Kandel: That's great.

200
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:44.010
Joan Kandel: That's wonderful. That's really good. And the other have any rehabs had you been in before that.

201
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:53.070
Trevor Burger: That was my 10th one the first the first eight World court order. The one I went to last time was the first one I chose to go to. And then this one.

202
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.950
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

203
00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:06.960
Trevor Burger: And the last one I stayed clean for seven and a half months and then I relapsed again. And that's whenever I got put on the Suboxone with a different place.

204
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:21.870
Trevor Burger: And Midland Texas and then after that I had found out about this place and it was just a little more easy to do it all and I liked it because that place wasn't making you do therapy or anything like that. It was just come get it and leave.

205
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.100
Joan Kandel: Haha, yeah.

206
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.110
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it helps to have the other stuff. The whole

207
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.460
Joan Kandel: The whole shebang.

208
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.800
Trevor Burger: DJ

209
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:35.490
Trevor Burger: On the

210
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.170
Joan Kandel: Good.

211
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:49.230
Trevor Burger: That and like there's no club meetings in Clovis so with everything being online right now. It's really easy to I did like three or four yesterday, so it's been, I didn't know how that

212
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.840
Trevor Burger: actually enjoy it.

213
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.870
Joan Kandel: Oh, that's wonderful. So you're getting used to the online thing again.

214
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.010
Trevor Burger: Yeah yeah

215
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.020
Joan Kandel: Yeah, they're all that's amazing. There are so many recovery meetings.

216
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:13.680
Joan Kandel: Online, it's, it's super. That's good. Um, and do did the other the other inpatient rehab that you did, did they

217
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.910
Joan Kandel: Did they prescribe Suboxone as part of the program or

218
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.600
Joan Kandel: Right.

219
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.130
Trevor Burger: Yeah, they did missions.

220
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.690
Trevor Burger: But it was just, it was just like the seven day taper to get off the opiates.

221
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.800
Joan Kandel: Oh, yeah.

222
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.570
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right, right, right.

223
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:33.120
Trevor Burger: And actually how I not on maintenance. I had the seven and a half months.

224
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:41.880
Trevor Burger: And I'd actually went to a detox to get off of it. And the guy in the detox the got Dr. That came to see me. He did Suboxone maintenance outside of there.

225
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.100
Trevor Burger: So he was like hey dude like you need to leave and come see me or you're going to die. And he explained it all to me.

226
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:59.190
Trevor Burger: Like about how in your head, the Raptor. It only fills up the pain side and not the pleasure. And so after I heard that it just seemed it was the only thing that allowed me to, you know, live a normal life for a year and a half.

227
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.180
Joan Kandel: Yes, being on the Suboxone

228
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:03.930
Yeah.

229
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:15.630
Joan Kandel: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, they they've done study after study that shows that this seven day taper really doesn't help that much in the long run.

230
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:16.980
Joan Kandel: Is when you will draw

231
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.670
Trevor Burger: People who are

232
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.660
Joan Kandel: Really high risk.

233
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.970
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Yep.

234
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:32.400
Joan Kandel: Exactly. So, you know, I'm really glad that you're on the maintenance and I think that it's going to help you a lot. And I'm also glad that

235
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:41.280
Joan Kandel: That you're feeling that four milligrams three times a day is is a is a good dose for you because that's, that's good.

236
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:49.440
Trevor Burger: I honestly feel like anytime I ever took more than two strips a day, it, it almost went backwards.

237
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.410
Joan Kandel: It made you feel worse.

238
00:21:52.680 --> 00:22:00.900
Trevor Burger: Yeah, I don't really know how to explain it just almost think it was like my body was so used to it that it just was not working anymore.

239
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:08.400
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Yeah. Well, good. It sounds like you found a good, a good spot. Yes.

240
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:08.970
Joan Kandel: That's great.

241
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.470
Joan Kandel: Um, so tell me about you and

242
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.110
Joan Kandel: Nicotine

243
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:32.250
Trevor Burger: Oh, so I i really don't smoke cigarettes or anything I dip a little bit, but whenever I was every time I go to treatment I smoke just it's just a stressful time. I don't know. And then whenever I leave, I always quit, but

244
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:42.300
Trevor Burger: That's I'm just dipping right now. And I have this little thing, but it doesn't even have nicotine is just like a placebo effect, kind of just smoking something

245
00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.670
Trevor Burger: That's how I'm trying

246
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:50.250
Trevor Burger: To. Yeah, but I did, though, but I haven't smoked a cigarette in a few days.

247
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.540
Joan Kandel: Good for you. That's really good.

248
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.700
Joan Kandel: So what's in that they that you're doing.

249
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.520
Trevor Burger: It's just like flavored water vapor

250
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.140
Joan Kandel: Haha

251
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.510
Trevor Burger: It's yeah just kind of like a

252
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.450
Trevor Burger: Because I feel like I'm more addicted to actually the motion of smoking and I was the nicotine.

253
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.310
Joan Kandel: Haha

254
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.350
Trevor Burger: So it just

255
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:17.850
Trevor Burger: Takes my mind off.

256
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.350
Trevor Burger: wanting a cigarette.

257
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.250
Joan Kandel: Yeah okay and

258
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.430
Joan Kandel: I was looking a little bit in your chart and I saw that you had a pretty bad. I'm

259
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.920
Joan Kandel: Episode from facing

260
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.170
Trevor Burger: Oh, it was actually those like black market THC carts.

261
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:38.790
Trevor Burger: That's what

262
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.690
Trevor Burger: They were cut with vitamin E acetate and I was buying them off the street.

263
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.320
Joan Kandel: And that's what it will I see. Yeah, that sounds pretty gnarly.

264
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.600
Trevor Burger: Yeah, and that's why I'm

265
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.800
Joan Kandel: Glad you survived that.

266
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:57.090
Trevor Burger: really shouldn't have been smoking cigarettes and that's why I'm yeah I mean by tomorrow. I won't even be doing this thing, it's just

267
00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.720
Trevor Burger: It's like a little process. I go through every time.

268
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.070
Joan Kandel: Okay. Okay, good. So your plan is to not do any of

269
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.250
Trevor Burger: You

270
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.290
Joan Kandel: For sure, not a week.

271
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:14.550
Trevor Burger: Well, yeah, like only put a dip in at night right now and buy in a week, maybe even less than a week. I won't be doing that.

272
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.290
Joan Kandel: Good for you.

273
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:23.490
Joan Kandel: That's great. Well, I, I applaud that. That's really that's important because you're trying to be as healthy as you can be.

274
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.360
Yeah.

275
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.990
Trevor Burger: Yeah, I'm actually I have one more question for you.

276
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:36.120
Trevor Burger: I have to the doctor that was in there. He was because I have a torn ACL right now. Yeah.

277
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.990
Trevor Burger: The Suboxone really honestly takes almost all of the pain away, but the

278
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:57.990
Trevor Burger: Only way I'm gonna set my phone down real quick. The only way I know how to explain it is like, like a neuron. How has all those things shooting in and out of it. It feels like there's, it's like that on my knee, but like what needles and he

279
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:06.570
Trevor Burger: He was giving me a gabapentin in there. It wasn't a high dose, but it took it all the way I think I was only taking like 300

280
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:17.910
Trevor Burger: In the morning and at night, but he had just told me to ask you all about that. And if I needed to see my orthopedic surgeon on Thursday for that's fine too. I just figured out

281
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.370
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

282
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:30.480
Joan Kandel: So I'm a little cautious with gabapentin just because it does help with it with the shooting pain, but it's, um,

283
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:46.500
Joan Kandel: It's a, it's a tricky medication because some people can become addicted to it and we found that more and more people are using it as a drug abuse. So I'm really kind of careful with that. And you're right. That wasn't a very high dose 300 milligrams twice a day.

284
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.560
Joan Kandel: But, uh, but I try not to prescribe that

285
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.380
Joan Kandel: Tomorrow, that's just like I don't prescribe Ben's those two folks.

286
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.360
Trevor Burger: If I'm prescribing the Suboxone

287
00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.190
Joan Kandel: I didn't ya know that

288
00:25:59.400 --> 00:25:59.880
People

289
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:01.920
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

290
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.520
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, we used to not think that, and then

291
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:14.010
Joan Kandel: People were starting to really enjoy the feeling of it because it kind of gives you that little kind of spacing, the feeling I didn't know if it does it.

292
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.090
Trevor Burger: Know I

293
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:15.600
Joan Kandel: Was

294
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.930
Kind of

295
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:17.460
Joan Kandel: Feeling

296
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.780
Trevor Burger: But like I said, I was

297
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:25.560
Trevor Burger: A boy, I doubt from that I would have felt anything. Yes, that's just some kind of crazy to me. I don't know.

298
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:32.190
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Yeah, I know. I was really surprised the first time that I learned that too. But, but, yeah.

299
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.360
Trevor Burger: No, I definitely don't want it in that case.

300
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.770
Trevor Burger: Yeah, drug addicts will find a way, somehow. So definitely no gabapentin

301
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:41.640
Trevor Burger: I didn't even know that.

302
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:50.070
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's, it's kind of a newish thing maybe the last year or so that we've been noticing that that's happening.

303
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.400
Joan Kandel: Do you have an appointment with him with your orthopedist

304
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.910
Trevor Burger: Yeah, I've met with him a few times and got my MRI and stuff, but he said you know that

305
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:00.570
I could get

306
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:14.070
Trevor Burger: I could get it done right now or in a year and it won't be different in a year. So my plan was just, just wait a while, at least a year till I'm stronger and my recovery. Sure. And at a lower dose.

307
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.590
Trevor Burger: Of subaltern. That's it, it sounds good.

308
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.450
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

309
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.960
Joan Kandel: DO YOU ARE YOU I sing your knee.

310
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:30.060
Trevor Burger: Yeah, I have one of those machines that hooks up to like a ice cooler thing and it pumps it through. I'm really not in any pain at all other

311
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:44.550
Trevor Burger: Than weird like sensation. It really doesn't hurt the first month I couldn't walk on it, but that whole treatment. It was I walked on it pretty much the whole time and it doesn't really hurt. Unless I'm going upstairs or something.

312
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.930
Joan Kandel: Okay, yeah. Good. Are you using that fancy sounding ice machine.

313
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.870
Trevor Burger: Yeah, yeah. I use it twice a day.

314
00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.130
Joan Kandel: Good. It sounds pretty cool. Yeah.

315
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:03.120
Joan Kandel: There's ice therapy is amazing. It's really powerful. It really helps the body.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:10.290

Trevor Burger: I just some like little exercises to keep my like quad strong

Joan Kandel: Okay, and the only medical medications you're taking as the Suboxone and propranolol

334
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.670
Trevor Burger: Yeah, he, he sent me home with a

335
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.640
Trevor Burger: Thing. It's called a

336
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:18.690
Trevor Burger: Man.

337
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:26.820
Trevor Burger: He was given me baclofen while I was in there for the withdrawals by I'm not either. I just felt like it wasn't even working and then

338
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:36.540
Trevor Burger: Yeah, that and then Clonidine that he was given me a point to it for the sweats, but I haven't been taking that either in a few days.

339
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.520
Joan Kandel: Okay, perfect. Yeah, sounds like you're kind of through that you don't need.

340
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:42.180
Joan Kandel: This really

341
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:42.870
Really. Sure.

342
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:50.490
Joan Kandel: That's good. Yeah. So now that you're back at you got back to Clovis on Saturday.

343
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.260
Trevor Burger: Saturday. All right.

344
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.280
Joan Kandel: So what's it like for you to be back in Clovis, and do you have

345
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.290
Joan Kandel: People that used to use with around. And how's that going

346
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:11.010
Trevor Burger: But no, I live my family really supports me and they're all sober. I live with my grandma and

347
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:27.750
Trevor Burger: I mean there's I even like the whole last year and a half, you know i i had kind of made a new life of sober people because I was on the Suboxone and whenever I relapse. It was just like a little two week period of me using by myself in my house.

348
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:29.730
Trevor Burger: And

349
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:31.680
Trevor Burger: Another thing like

350
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:48.870
Trevor Burger: I was having my medical marijuana card. And so I was doing that way too much and I cut it up and threw it away. I haven't done that and almost four weeks. And I think that made a big difference in how well the Suboxone work too because I got so dependent on it, just to eat.

351
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:57.720
Trevor Burger: A high if I didn't have it in the morning I wake up and throw up until I got some and then a. So I think getting off of that.

352
00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.330
Trevor Burger: Right, it's the box and work 10 times better.

353
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.230
Joan Kandel: I think you're totally right.

354
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:04.800
Trevor Burger: Yeah.

355
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.450
Joan Kandel: I'll bet your belly is happier.

356
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:12.090
Trevor Burger: Yeah for sure that it just feels nice to wake up and be hungry. Whenever you wake up instead of throwing up

357
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.940
Joan Kandel: Oh, that's great. Yeah. Some people have that reaction with marijuana

358
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:24.720
Joan Kandel: They just really have a lot of throwing out so that's good. So that's, that's, that's a good thing to know about yourself.

359
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.240
Joan Kandel: Is that that doesn't that doesn't work so great for

360
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.180
Joan Kandel: You because not everybody gets that. But some people

361
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:36.420
Trevor Burger: First, you know, it wasn't like that. It just got to where I was doing it so much that

362
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.610
Trevor Burger: I could not eat without it.

363
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.690
Joan Kandel: It was nice.

364
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:48.750
Trevor Burger: It was ridiculous. I went to the hospital. A few times for and they put me in a hot shower and they said that there's like actual disease. Now, or or

365
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:57.690
Trevor Burger: Ira IRS, I don't know. Remember what it stands for. Or I don't think that's right. It's some kind of thing that they found out. We've been doing to

366
00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.790
Joan Kandel: People yeah it's hyper emphasis

367
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:00.510
Joan Kandel: Oh, yeah.

368
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:07.230
Joan Kandel: Paralysis. Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah. Some people get that and it's a it's devastating.

369
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.690
Joan Kandel: So as usual, shit.

370
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:17.550
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Right, right. All right. Well, the goal is to stay away from evil shit.

371
00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:18.390
