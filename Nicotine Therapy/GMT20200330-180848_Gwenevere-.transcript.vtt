00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:01.979
Gwenevere Abriel: Bethany should eat.

2
00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.849
Gwenevere Abriel: So much going on. I'm your side. Yeah. Goodness gracious.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you coping today.

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.240
Bethany Shadid: Um, well, I was very much looking forward to talking to you.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.830
Bethany Shadid: Because, today's the day that I have to tell my boss that I can't come back to work. Okay.

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.660
Bethany Shadid: You know i i told you a little bit about it last week strategically I planned this out.

8
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.020
But since

9
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.320
My coworker passed away.

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.590
Bethany Shadid: That's throw a wrench in it.

11
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.570
Bethany Shadid: And I all those feelings of obligation and

12
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.650
Bethany Shadid: That they need me, and I have to, you know, all of that start coming up.

13
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.200
Bethany Shadid: Um,

14
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.070
Bethany Shadid: But I really can't go back to work. I'm my nursing license hasn't gone through yet.

15
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.820
Bethany Shadid: There's just no way around it, but

16
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.350
Bethany Shadid: I still have those guilty or shameful feelings that come up. Yeah. And so I was like okay maybe

17
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.600
Bethany Shadid: This will be good. I'll talk to one. Get in the right frame of mind to talk to him.

18
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.090
Bethany Shadid: Before I talked

19
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what we'll do today.

20
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.790
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

21
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well get ready, we'll get we'll get real strong and confident and then you'll do what you want to do.

22
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:59.430
Bethany Shadid: Sounds good. And I think I should tell you a few things you know the situation a little bit better. Okay. Um,

23
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.430
Bethany Shadid: The doctor that passed away died in a house fire.

24
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.990
Bethany Shadid: We don't know exactly what happened. But he was injured.

25
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.660
Bethany Shadid: Six months ago.

26
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.420
Bethany Shadid: Where his lung collapsed.

27
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.180
Bethany Shadid: During a some outdoor activity. He got his lungs his ribs crushed.

28
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:40.140
Bethany Shadid: And he's been in and out of work ever since then. And I know that he'd been, I've been keeping an eye on him because

29
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.350
Bethany Shadid: Like at one point I had to get

30
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.730
Bethany Shadid: Another doctor involved because he was so pale.

31
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:59.190
Bethany Shadid: What had happened to his lung, the space between his lungs and his rib cage it filled up with blood. Oh, he was basically bleeding internally.

32
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.510
Bethany Shadid: And was back at work and I know that the pressure for them is just as hard as it is for me.

33
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.450
Bethany Shadid: Which plays into the whole pressure for management, despite you know people's well being.

34
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.190
Bethany Shadid: So I had been I had gotten much closer to him over the past few months, and

35
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.260
Bethany Shadid: He, he doesn't

36
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:40.290
Bethany Shadid: How should I say his specialty is working. Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine and he was an older gentleman in his mid 60s and

37
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.350
Bethany Shadid: He had made it very clear that he only wanted to work in clinic.

38
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:59.550
Bethany Shadid: And with the coronavirus my boss and his boss Tony had been forcing him to work in the ICU.

39
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.570
Bethany Shadid: Because of that,

40
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.000
Bethany Shadid: I I had had a conversation with him before he passed away.

41
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.610
Bethany Shadid: He single he lives alone, and he was talking about how

42
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.230
Bethany Shadid: How much he doesn't like working ICU and stuff.

43
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.460
Bethany Shadid: His to his two kids and they're both in college, both in medical school and

44
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.750
Bethany Shadid: My thoughts are a little scattered, so I apologize, but

45
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.680
Bethany Shadid: He had been calling out of work and

46
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.800
Bethany Shadid: The bosses had been coming down pretty hard on him and

47
00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:02.640
Bethany Shadid: So I know this this idea for him to work in the intensive care unit because of the coronavirus was not his idea, but he was sucking it up right

48
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:13.740
Bethany Shadid: Nobody could understand how he could die in a house fire with smoke alarms and everything else and

49
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.250
Bethany Shadid: I just really

50
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.510
Bethany Shadid: Got the impression. And I don't know for sure. Don't get me wrong, but it would not surprise me if

51
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.860
Bethany Shadid: He was self medicating to deal with his injury and the pressure at work.

52
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.200
Bethany Shadid: And I won't know. But all of that I felt like

53
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:51.420
Bethany Shadid: You know with me. Learning that i have i inappropriately gave trust in my boss and management to take care of me.

54
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.150
Bethany Shadid: Or look out for me.

55
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.490
Bethany Shadid: That that's not there that they don't care. And this just really resonated

56
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.880
Bethany Shadid: How much they are willing to push

57
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.320
Bethany Shadid: At the expense of everybody else so

58
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.750
Bethany Shadid: All that being said,

59
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.190
Bethany Shadid: I'm that hit really hard.

60
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.790
Bethany Shadid: When I found out about it in passing away.

61
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.860
Bethany Shadid: Um,

62
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.530
Bethany Shadid: Since then,

63
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.150
Bethany Shadid: We found out about this Friday afternoon.

64
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.580
Bethany Shadid: around lunchtime.

65
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:44.520
Bethany Shadid: And work in no time to deal with it before we were told that we needed to pack up the West Side clinic.

66
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.500
Bethany Shadid: And

67
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.780
Bethany Shadid: Combine the clinics into the to the downtown location.

68
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.330
Bethany Shadid: So,

69
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:03.060
Bethany Shadid: Apparently, the, the doctor that passed away was the only one that was still holding out to not

70
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.880
Bethany Shadid: Leave the West Side location where I'm usually station.

71
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.710
Bethany Shadid: And since he passed away, they had, they could go ahead with their plan.

72
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:30.090
Bethany Shadid: Um, so I found out at four o'clock that we were moving and I wasn't even told I was told by another co worker who said

73
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:52.320
Bethany Shadid: Hey this is exciting. We're all going to be working together in the same clinic next week and I was like oh really, okay. And as my boss was leaving the clinic. I said, Hey, I'm so Vanessa told me that we're, you know, leaving that we're moving over

74
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:59.010
Bethany Shadid: I was like, Is this temporary and definite what you know. He said, well, the governor said that if

75
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.430
Bethany Shadid: Well, I guess, during the crisis.

76
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:15.030
Bethany Shadid: That we don't have to pay rent if we vacate the stakes, I guess, across the board, so he wanted to quickly exit before the next month.

77
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.490
Bethany Shadid: Rent was due.

78
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:35.370
Bethany Shadid: So I was like, should I go over there. I have a whole pharmacy that I manage over there and I'm like meds and was like, Oh, yeah, yeah, maybe you should come over that might be good. So I rushed over to the west side.

79
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.440
Bethany Shadid: And when I got there it was chaos. I'm

80
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:55.080
Bethany Shadid: Everybody packing and it wasn't just packing like what you personally need to do your job at a different location. It was supplies equipment everything

81
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:05.520
Bethany Shadid: I was asked to get a list together of all the medications and in the pharmacy that needed to be transferred and

82
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.360
Bethany Shadid: I started getting really distressed.

83
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.670
Bethany Shadid: And realized I needed to put my foot down.

84
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:25.710
Bethany Shadid: And because, you know, initially that. Okay, I've got it, I've got to suck it up. I've got to do this. I've got a, you know,

85
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.140
Bethany Shadid: kicked in and I started having pain.

86
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.900
Bethany Shadid: Kidney stone pain.

87
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:43.260
Bethany Shadid: And was like, I can't do this to myself so I only gathered what I needed.

88
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.260
Bethany Shadid: I actually took all of my personal effects out of the office.

89
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.170
Bethany Shadid: And

90
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:59.070
Bethany Shadid: Got, got things together so that they couldn't have them if they wanted to.

91
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.920
Bethany Shadid: Because I'm not going to do this. He was like,

92
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:16.770
Bethany Shadid: Everybody over time has been approved, you know, and it was like, this isn't the way to do this is not the way to do this in my head, I'm like this is wrong.

93
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, stay there. Stay there.

94
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel that, feel that repeated.

95
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This is yeah, this is not the way to do this.

96
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.330
Bethany Shadid: No.

97
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This is wrong. Feel it. Feel your truth. I didn't land in there.

98
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.850
Bethany Shadid: Oh, so much so.

99
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.730
Bethany Shadid: So wrong. I was like, we just found out about this co worker.

100
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.280
Bethany Shadid: And you want us to pack up this office and move the very same day.

101
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:49.530
Bethany Shadid: And

102
00:10:50.190 --> 00:11:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But that to me this grief. This isn't the way to do grief, either. No one's doing it right, this, this whole should know the omission, the lack of Let's all have a moment of silence, no matter the chaos unless cry.

103
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.240
Bethany Shadid: Right, nothing.

104
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so there's many things happening around what you just said. So let's feel them all. Let's fill the truth in it and you don't need one of your

105
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: To believe you. You knew it you know it it was wrong. There was just go into all the different ways out this one Melanie just the whole deal just this isn't. This is not the way I would do it.

106
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.200
Bethany Shadid: Sitting on it.

107
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not, it just go back to back. There's a lot of them layered on top of each other just be there with them and you

108
00:11:52.530 --> 00:12:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You turn to each one of those events. Perhaps they're behind each one adore perhaps they're all mingle together. Perhaps they're competing for attention. I don't know how they are in your mind but subtle them down and let's acknowledge each one you acknowledge each one with grace.

109
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do they need to be acknowledged. Just take a peek at just pick one.

110
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And the right way to do it.

111
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a nice little short something just maybe it's a hug. Maybe it's a moment, it might be something some gesture that although not comprehensive. Because time is limited, but it is the right way. It does match.

112
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's a lot coming at you at once.

113
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just pick one, we, we have to pick one.

114
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: To focus on just for a moment, and then we'll do it well.

115
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't be perfect. We won't be able to give it all the time it deserves, but it will be consistent with the right way. Yeah, so pick one, what would it be

116
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:27.060
Bethany Shadid: And I don't know if this is what you were thinking, but to me.

117
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.560
Bethany Shadid: The inappropriateness

118
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.670
Bethany Shadid: Of

119
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.360
Bethany Shadid: Putting

120
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.470
Bethany Shadid: A financial

121
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.470
Bethany Shadid: Game Over the well being.

122
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.900
Bethany Shadid: Of the staff.

123
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so stay there.

124
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to question that that is true for you. You put people over right you know how to see that harmony that health

125
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Comes First that care comes first. And there's always time for care, right, this is it. We're getting close. Yeah, okay.

126
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So, as if that moment, as if, let's do some imagery. Why don't you just maybe it's a door and the y door keeps coming up for me.

127
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Inside that room just just take the handle and open the door and we can close it right behind just pick your little head in there and you see behind that door. People are not prioritizing appropriately.

128
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you say to the people on the other side of that door. What do you do to get them realigned

129
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To focus on care instead of

130
00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Profit, just a quick, you're going to open the door and you're going to say something or do something, it won't last long. And then you're going to close it right back up.

131
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.860
Bethany Shadid: This moment deserves respect.

132
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you do to respect it. What do you, what can you do

133
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.240
Bethany Shadid: give people the time

134
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.670
Bethany Shadid: To process. This

135
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.210
Bethany Shadid: Before

136
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.420
Bethany Shadid: Up routing everything

137
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you could close the door when she said that

138
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.530
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

139
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That was needed. Okay, so let's see if we can find another door.

140
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.240
Um,

141
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.560
Bethany Shadid: medical establishment professional medical establishment.

142
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.360
Bethany Shadid: Moving at the last minute not communicating with your staff.

143
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.120
Bethany Shadid: Is beyond interpreter

144
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's that door unprofessionalism right there. She don't turn the handle crack it open.

145
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do

146
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.320
Bethany Shadid: This is not the time or place.

147
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.380
Bethany Shadid: To be forcing a move.

148
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:54.600
Bethany Shadid: This means there's there's more tough planning involves that and you're in. We're in ourselves liable because of this.

149
00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this needs professional planning to mitigate liability.

150
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

151
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. And can you close the door after that.

152
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's the next door.

153
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.030
Bethany Shadid: Next door is something I don't think I told you about completely

154
00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So, see what happens if you don't tell me, because then we we risk one of yours validation, but instead you do the door you do we do it in real time. Because remember, we have a half hour. And remember, we haven't touched on obligation.

155
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:48.990
Bethany Shadid: Right.

156
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting ready. So that's why we're doing these doors. So let's just see what happens. Okay ready

157
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.030
Bethany Shadid: So,

158
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.900
Bethany Shadid: This, this is

159
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.770
Bethany Shadid: I am a licensed medical professional

160
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:20.790
Bethany Shadid: And there are not enough hours in the day for me to explain to you every decision that I make in order to do my job appropriately.

161
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:35.250
Bethany Shadid: OK, I will not be micromanaged okay which takes up way too much time if you want me to work efficient. Okay.

162
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can close the door.

163
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the truth.

164
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.690
Yes.

165
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a licensed medical professional

166
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: To do a job efficiently, I cannot explain spend the time explaining myself. When actual clinical work needs to be done. This micromanaged I will not be micromanaged. Can you close the door.

167
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.690
Yeah.

168
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What's left

169
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.050
Bethany Shadid: I think that's it.

170
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.280
Bethany Shadid: Those are the real big, big things.

171
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.570
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

172
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have not said anything about this is what surprises me. So I'm curious to know if you've done other other other pieces with

173
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The grief part

174
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.190
Okay.

175
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:30.630
Bethany Shadid: But

176
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how that didn't show up.

177
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it because you've already addressed it in your way in a respectful way.

178
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Or do you want to say something right we've cracked the door open and you get it said and done, does it. Is that a door did I make that up.

179
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.880
Bethany Shadid: No, I think.

180
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.560
Bethany Shadid: I'm if I'm being honest.

181
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.380
Bethany Shadid: Because of the way things were handled I

182
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.670
Bethany Shadid: I put it aside.

183
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.780
Bethany Shadid: I think I put grieving aside.

184
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:11.340
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I walked

185
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.360
To

186
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.650
Bethany Shadid: I got over to the west side office.

187
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.290
Bethany Shadid: And the first thing that I did was walk into his office.

188
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.000
Bethany Shadid: And the tears started coming

189
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.760
Bethany Shadid: Just looking at

190
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.000
Bethany Shadid: photos of him.

191
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.800
Bethany Shadid: Kid.

192
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't

193
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't because remember this is you, you put care. You put care out there and that's why I'm saying it surprised me that that wasn't one of the doors.

194
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

195
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Give us permission.

196
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.430
What

197
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.290
Bethany Shadid: I was told very quickly after

198
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.860
Bethany Shadid: After I walked into his office because after we found out, all I kept saying,

199
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:16.560
Bethany Shadid: Was I didn't want to be at the downtown clinic. It wasn't my home. It wasn't the people that I wanted to be around while we were processing it

200
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:31.710
Bethany Shadid: And so when I finally got to be there going in that office and getting that time you know that's what my intention was and very quickly.

201
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:40.920
Bethany Shadid: was confronted by management, who told us that everything had to be packed up and I said, Well, what about his stuff.

202
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.660
Bethany Shadid: Okay, so

203
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.940
Bethany Shadid: That's the door.

204
00:21:45.630 --> 00:22:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So it was not handled appropriately. Notice there's another one. So I want you to see the door label it right you go in here you go in and you say, remember this is consolidating I want to create time for future stuff that we're getting ready for so

205
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Do all you're going to do because you get to decide how much you let in. So you crack. Give yourself a label for the door.

206
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Something you just said, what about right. What about him. What about his stuff so picture that that behind that door is this concept of pictures and his stuff you caring about his stuff. When you're ready, you open it and don't be so careful.

207
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: shouted out, if you have to

208
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What do you say into that room.

209
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.020
Bethany Shadid: This is so this is so disgusting.

210
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

211
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.460
Bethany Shadid: This man that's given so much

212
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:52.950
Bethany Shadid: We're going to pack up his things and put them in a box for his kids to get when his whole house burned down

213
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.520
Bethany Shadid: There may not be

214
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.460
Bethany Shadid: These pictures and

215
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.770
Bethany Shadid: It's so disgusting. The things in this office.

216
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.930
Bethany Shadid: Are probably priceless to his children.

217
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're going to just quickly toss them in a box and and move on.

218
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. It was a little bit more open this door and you let them have it. What do you say,

219
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, the face. I saw it. I saw discussed face. I saw. Yep.

220
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:39.720
Bethany Shadid: This is beyond disgusting I it makes me wanna puke just thinking about the fact that we, you're such in such a rush.

221
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.960
Bethany Shadid: To move on from this person.

222
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:49.740
Bethany Shadid: What is this saying what is the same to everybody around you.

223
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.190
Bethany Shadid: Know, I don't care.

224
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to, I want you to tell our what you think of him.

225
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:10.320
Bethany Shadid: THINK YOU'RE BEING. A PUSSY and letting your boss push you around because of money.

226
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.700
Bethany Shadid: When you I know you know

227
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.490
Bethany Shadid: Your heart. This is wrong.

228
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.070
Bethany Shadid: This is disgusting.

229
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right you are being a hypocrite. No. Okay, can we close the door. Yeah, yeah. Guess what, guess what, Bethany, you know what, on the other side of the door is

230
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not workplace.

231
00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you got the last word.

232
00:24:45.240 --> 00:25:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's your opinion you have every right to it. And the truth, the painful truth is they have a right to theirs and gets to be a hypocrite. Maybe someday. He's going to come face to face with a look how hard it is to let go right of

233
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Pleasing others and money and things, and instead turning inward. It is taking all of your effort to do it, it is no small thing.

234
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It is not an easy thing to do. If you close that door and you turn towards the open door you have somewhere else and get curious about what's on the other side of that door.

235
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you get into that visualization you pop your head in. He let him have it. I got the last word. I thought the last word. I got the last word. And I don't even want to hear what you have to say slam

236
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, maybe with with what happened with this gentleman.

237
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you get to kind of take those pictures and really sort of with general tissue paper and everything and you get to maybe go to the hall and you get to in your imagery get to treat it with the gentle

238
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The precious nature that that is that can be part of that. But right now, what today is to talk about that open door.

239
00:25:59.610 --> 00:25:59.880
Yeah.

240
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you tell me

241
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What's

242
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What's left in obligation for you at this point.

243
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.660
Bethany Shadid: Um,

244
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:19.590
Bethany Shadid: I really, I really didn't feel a sense of obligation and still finding out about

245
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:31.110
Bethany Shadid: Dr Bradley's passing and and when I found that out. It was more of a sense of wanting to make things

246
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.380
Bethany Shadid: Okay, for my coworkers.

247
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:55.950
Bethany Shadid: Hmm, because I know that without me. They're going to have it the week's gonna be refer now saying that I know how silly it is as it comes out of my mouth, but that is honestly where it comes from.

248
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you know, one of your goals is right. Do you know last week for two weeks, two weeks straight. I want you to hear your own voice. I really hope I typed it in here.

249
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So your goal is to decrease the automatic ignition. What can I do to fix it.

250
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: On the 23rd. Notice I think about what I'm eating. I'm feeling better. I can't save everyone you said it.

251
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you are in your hubris right now.

252
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're controlling what you can

253
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's to protect these other staff members. Can't do it. No.

254
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then on top of that, will you not be able to do it.

255
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be weird resentment.

256
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming out of nowhere. Now you're leaving the place with this weird

257
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Stuff. When you go off.

258
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To where you want to go.

259
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:14.940
Mm hmm.

260
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:22.590
Bethany Shadid: Which is ultimately why I am not going back. Right, but that that definitely

261
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.400
Bethany Shadid: Comes up like, wait a minute.

262
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Bethany. Is it your belief that there is something meaningful, you could do.

263
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: To make their worship life sustainably better in the few days, hours that you have left.

264
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How about to reach out to them.

265
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: As a friend check in. How's it going, and you'd be a place for them to vent.

266
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.190
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

267
00:28:53.610 --> 00:29:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And be in a solid confident place where you left and you role model self care you represented your value system.

268
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:03.150
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

269
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And you give them hope.

270
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:07.500
Good idea.

271
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

272
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it about the call, you're going to make in the next hour. What are we, what's, what are the logistics here.

273
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:26.760
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, the call the call. I want to make sure that I don't write give any extra content for him to attack.

274
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.240
Bethany Shadid: Okay.

275
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.450
Say,

276
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to say I'm gonna write it down.

277
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:43.560
Bethany Shadid: So what I've what I've rehearsed, a little bit is

278
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:58.080
Bethany Shadid: texting them and saying, Hey, I know you're busy, but I need to talk to you. You know, so he can call me when he has a moment I'm me when he calls. I'm going to say so, unfortunately.

279
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.680
Bethany Shadid: I won't be able to work this week.

280
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.380
Bethany Shadid: I

281
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:22.890
Bethany Shadid: Was not able to, or actually sorry I'm my North Carolina continuing education and some of the education that I've done here. I'm was not counted

282
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:34.410
Bethany Shadid: And because of that, I don't have a nursing license to work on this week. And so I'm going to me to

283
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:45.030
Bethany Shadid: Finish another 30 hours of continuing education and submit it to the New Mexico Board of Nursing.

284
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.460
Bethany Shadid: And have them.

285
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:49.680
Okay, yeah.

286
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Really long

287
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.050
Yeah.

288
00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I care about you.

289
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how you started this, and you said, I don't want to give them content. You did.

290
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because guess what, guess what I'm going to say to you. Oh, perfect. I'm going to have you do those 30 hours on the west side site and I have you there. That's perfect. You can do you see us there. Perfect. You just gave room for him to come up with something

291
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:21.300
Bethany Shadid: So,

292
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I tell you,

293
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.670
It's just

294
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how you don't want to tell them

295
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.690
Bethany Shadid: This is. Yeah.

296
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it a good fit. And I, I wish you all the best. It happens to line up with

297
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: My see us in North Carolina and now my license has lapsed. I'm going to kind of take seize this moment and let you know.

298
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for all the things I've learned from you so grateful to this opportunity. I was out of work for a little while back in my group.

299
00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The fit. Notice, notice as you might agree we never did quite just this fit just never seen just subtle. I want you to know. I'm so grateful to the experience. I'm not going to be coming in.

300
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I got some ideas about what to do with that next about that, about allocating up and we put things back on his shoulders. So there's no room for him to come up with questions. But you notice what I did. I said the truth.

301
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Quitting

302
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I did dance around it. I said, the real truth. Yeah. Okay, now let's try it again. But deep breath deep breath, nice and concise.

303
00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:47.760
Bethany Shadid: So our, um, unfortunately, I have to let you know that I won't

304
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.580
Bethany Shadid: I won't be able to continue on.

305
00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:55.920
Bethany Shadid: In this role,

306
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:09.210
Bethany Shadid: Because I don't have a nursing license. I can't continue to work up until the point that I can't give you two weeks.

307
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:10.980
Okay.

308
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:14.130
But

309
00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.070
Bethany Shadid: I think

310
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:20.310
Bethany Shadid: In all honesty.

311
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.700
Bethany Shadid: We gave it a good shots.

312
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.840
Bethany Shadid: But it's not working out.

313
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:37.050
Bethany Shadid: It hasn't been healthy for me and I hope and wish you all the best of luck.

314
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha. How did that feel saying it like that.

315
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.220
Bethany Shadid: Much easier.

316
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple of little things.

317
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You barely

318
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Know this concept of burying the lead.

319
00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: don't bury it. It got buried right here.

320
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: My role, two weeks and you didn't say two week notice you just said two weeks. I wanted to jump in and I want to Bethany. What are you talking about, I literally didn't know what you were talking about because you're burying the lead.

321
00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so beautifully done. You do it exactly like that you're on point. I'm just

322
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:23.520
Bethany Shadid: Know it's

323
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:30.360
Bethany Shadid: Very good point because I know he would come out that way, like what are you talking about, and it would throw me. Oh.

324
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, good, good.

325
00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, so

326
00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: If you send patient if right because right he does that, I think, so it's oh oh hey al Hey listen, I know. In you go to playful, you can do the high pitch. Hey, listen, I know the timings really really off here, but

327
00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I could give you my two week. Notice, but unfortunately al al I can't come in. I am resigning

328
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I really interesting and you just keep now you do explanation. You didn't bury the lead and interestingly timing on this. I can't even give you the two weeks because of

329
00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: These missing 30 hours of for my licenses last. I'm going to take these weeks I'm going to do this and you know you might agree. I'll just never did quite

330
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that, that we didn't click Like there was something off about client care and this piece and I and I'm so grateful to what you have taught me and I you should probably write down I kid you not, three things you want to thank them for written

331
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're going to get nervous. I always have those written

332
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And so here's an interesting thing that I did when I said, Alan, you might agree, and I do the thing that I know he's gonna agree on, you're going to get out to say this, you're right.

333
00:35:50.430 --> 00:36:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Leave a little time after that. What were you saying you know what out. You might you might agree that we we kind of never just settled on a really compatible sort of work group. Right. Quiet, quiet, let him say, yeah, you're right.

334
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I am say it. He says, yeah, you're right. And then you could go on, but that's a beautiful thing. It's a very, very elegant way for them to basically say, yeah, makes sense that you go

335
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.180
Yeah.

336
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you go into. And you know what else. Hell, I learned this. I looked at myself in this way. I'm really grateful to this and they need to be honest, don't lie. But what are they

337
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be exaggerating a really small thing that you learned, but

338
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Nice way because, frankly, he's going to be your letter of reference.

339
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:58.290
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, well, and I gotta be honest, I wasn't really gonna quit today I was more. So letting him know that I can't work.

340
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.060
Bethany Shadid: But yes, that is in

341
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:09.540
Bethany Shadid: In the plan. The weird thing is because of the coronavirus

342
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:19.320
Bethany Shadid: They're not moving forward with hiring the new hire my my job, my new job.

343
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh that's not good.

344
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:28.530
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, so, so, yes. The quitting quitting. I think is going to be a little bit further down the road.

345
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.570
Bethany Shadid: Oh, I know. So sorry.

346
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.810
Bethany Shadid: It's okay, it's okay because ultimately, that's the plan.

347
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.660
Bethany Shadid: So you're at

348
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Home and get these 30 hours.

349
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:46.410
Bethany Shadid: Yes, I'm going to stay home, get these 30 hours. That's just the way that it is

350
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me let me let me do worst case scenario. Oh my gosh, Bethany, of all the time for you to do that. What the heck were you thinking this is right when we need you. What do you say, take a deep breath. First brief, brief.

351
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:06.900
Bethany Shadid: Well, I, I've been on my own, the past three weeks without any support. Now you have Melanie back this week. You guys will be far

352
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm going to take some time to get this done right. I've been prioritizing work over getting my see us while she was out something like that habit right have it ready for the worst thing you can accuse you of the

353
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:21.090
Bethany Shadid: True.

354
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You ready, what's wrong with being ready. You're at all. You can be looking at your notes.

355
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.790
Bethany Shadid: Right, right.

356
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:33.930
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. Well, unfortunately, this month has been so chaotic that I didn't

357
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.160
Bethany Shadid: Check on it till I had time this weekend.

358
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:47.730
Bethany Shadid: And there's just no other way around it. I have to get those 30 hours done before I can resubmit

359
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:58.830
Bethany Shadid: And then I have to wait on the board of nursing, but I will keep you posted and you guys have Melanie back. So, you're in good hands.

360
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.400
Bethany Shadid: Sorry, I left singing

361
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So this part about between you and I. Is it true, the following

362
00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All my energy was on such and such office while Melanie was out I neglected to to be mindful of these hours now that she's back I now have the time, I'll be it you know it doesn't line up with some more convenient timing. I'm going to be home working on that.

363
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll check in with you.

364
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Such and Such day time. I think I should be done with it. Now I don't know if you want to say, is there anything you want me to do remotely like I have no idea how you want. Okay, nevermind. That part then

365
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.650
Bethany Shadid: Right. No, I'm basically

366
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just get this one.

367
00:39:52.380 --> 00:40:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got nine minutes. You want to do this part, which is you want to get him to answer the question you want him to answer. So think about this.

368
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You want it light. You want it fluffy. You want it off the critical topic. So I'm going to give you examples, but only you know what to do with the content.

369
00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm so out. Are you noticing that I just wanted to redirect when I left off. I do them with a file. Do you need me to do anything around that. So I'm redirecting to a topic that he can answer.

370
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can say something like, is there anything you need me to do around this and he'll basically say no. Okay. You want him to write done and then you'll say, well, you know what, okay then.

371
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need me to touch base before Thursday when I return to work. No. Okay. All right, will stay safe and I'll let you know if I learned some kind of interesting cutting edge, blah, blah, blah, blah. Nursing CEO, blah, blah. And I can bring it to the training. All right, be safe.

372
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.690
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

373
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.460
Bethany Shadid: See it, yeah.

374
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.210
Bethany Shadid: So,

375
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to get those ready

376
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.910
Bethany Shadid: I'm gonna write those down after we get it yeah yet.

377
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You direct the conversation to something where you basically says, No, I don't need you. I'm Melanie and you direct it to something light and fluffy, which is hope to get some of you may know better content.

378
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: light and fluffy training looking forward to doing that bringing something hopefully useful back to the organization. I'll see on Thursday. Do you need me to touch base with you before my expected return, blah, blah. And he says, no, you say well alright well be safe, and I'll see you then.

379
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.300
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I have. I have kind of a

380
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.420
Bethany Shadid: Really good.

381
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.860
Bethany Shadid: Thing to put back on him.

382
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:56.730
Bethany Shadid: Because Wednesday, I was on the call with him with human resources.

383
00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:08.760
Bethany Shadid: I just happened to be in his office and he put them on speaker, and it was the day that Melanie got cleared to come back to work. It was like Wednesday at noon.

384
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:20.880
Bethany Shadid: And I found out shortly thereafter, that he wasn't going to have Melanie come in until Monday, which is today.

385
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:31.650
Bethany Shadid: So I had been working on my own for weeks now, two weeks at that point because she went on vacation.

386
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:45.420
Bethany Shadid: And then went into quarantine for two weeks. So I've been on my own this entire time. And when I asked him very directly Wednesday that Wednesday, I was like,

387
00:42:46.320 --> 00:43:01.590
Bethany Shadid: Why, why is she not coming on until Monday. There's two more days in the week like she's already been out, you know, and he was like, well, it's pointless for her to come in for one day.

388
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:13.890
Bethany Shadid: And I was like, yeah, and I said one day I said there's Thursday and Friday that she could be here. And he said, well, we're not changing the schedule.

389
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.440
Bethany Shadid: So it's like

390
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:38.820
Bethany Shadid: All right then. So really, in this conversation. He has no room to speak. I've gotten him through this entire time on my own and that will be has another in if he can do it with just me and not give me any support than Melanie can do it without me.

391
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:44.370
Bethany Shadid: And that's why I'm gonna I'm gonna be light and fluffy.

392
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:45.060
Bethany Shadid: Ideal

393
00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:49.800
Bethany Shadid: You know, and Melanie's back, you're in good hands.

394
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, you already know you can do it with one Rn. I was there all week. In fact, that's kind of what drew all my attention. I kind of dropped the ball with my license.

395
00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got Melanie. Now you had me before you'll be just fine. And what about such and such case and you just you just keep going and going.

396
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Can use that as a reference. Well, it was just me. Yes, yes, it's a challenge. And it was a bit distracting wasn't able to bubble up, up, up, up. But now you have Melanie okay can do this man, you got

397
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:22.320
Bethany Shadid: I feel so much better about it.

398
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.510
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

399
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:29.490
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, as much as like the craziness has been

400
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:40.500
Bethany Shadid: Um I stuck to my plan I stuck to my plan of taking care of myself this week and

401
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.380
Bethany Shadid: How do you say

402
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:59.070
Bethany Shadid: That's what got me through last week you know it been so difficult was knowing that I'm just going to continue with the plan. I'm going to, I'm going to do take care of myself.

403
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.980
Bethany Shadid: And that's it, and

404
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:06.990
Yeah.

405
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:17.340
Bethany Shadid: I tell you, though, that conversation when I found out that he was gonna let her have another two days off before coming back to work.

406
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:24.390
Bethany Shadid: I was so distressed. I did the thing you told me, which was I just sat there.

407
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.540
Bethany Shadid: at my desk and I was like okay I met like 95 right now. Yeah.

408
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.800
Bethany Shadid: Yep, all the way back down all the way back down.

409
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Just watching the number. Isn't it amazing like you think that it does work.

410
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:52.260
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, no. It really does. And I gotta be honest, I have some some positive things that happened that really

411
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.790
Bethany Shadid: really made a difference. Vanessa, the girl that

412
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:10.920
Bethany Shadid: Is very difficult to work with. Without Melanie here are these past like two and a half weeks, um, she she came to me. What was it

413
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.770
Bethany Shadid: Like Thursday last week.

414
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.670
Bethany Shadid: And she she pops her head in the door and goes

415
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.140
Bethany Shadid: We kind of make a good team. Don't we

416
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.130
Bethany Shadid: And I said, yeah. Yeah, we do.

417
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:33.750
Bethany Shadid: And she says, I guess. All it took was for Melanie to be gone for us to learn that we can work well together.

418
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: No truer thing has been said.

419
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:40.230
Bethany Shadid: I was like, oh,

420
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:57.360
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, cuz I was literally just killing her with kindness. This whole whole time, just everything just professional just nice and so to hear that was like

421
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:08.460
Bethany Shadid: And then I had the nurse practitioner al made a big BOO BOO HE'S BEEN REALLY micromanaging me

422
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:10.200
Bethany Shadid: And

423
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:29.460
Bethany Shadid: We had I forget what be but because it's just been me. He ended up forwarding an email exchange back and forth between me and him were I had been asking for clarification on stuff. Um,

424
00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:40.110
Bethany Shadid: He emailed it he forwarded it to all the providers because of one little sentence in it where he told me that

425
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:50.280
Bethany Shadid: I may have to because of the increased workload, I may have to forward some of the patient issues directly to the provider.

426
00:47:51.090 --> 00:48:08.880
Bethany Shadid: So just because of that one little sentence all the providers got this whole email exchange between me and him and the nurse practitioner that I'm really close with she came into my office and she said, Bethany.

427
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:18.570
Bethany Shadid: She's like, I've been watching the past two weeks. And she's like, You know what she was like, I've been watching them bully you

428
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:29.040
Bethany Shadid: She was like, don't let them do it. She was like, you're the one with the professional license. You're smarter than all of them put together.

429
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:45.600
Bethany Shadid: She said she has to share an office with one of the supervisors when she works at the west side. And she's like, I sit in there doing my notes and I have to listen to them talk. She goes, they're a bunch of fucking idiots Bethany.

430
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: He'll see

431
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.470
Bethany Shadid: Do not let them push you around like that.

Gwenevere Abriel: You know what to do.

441
00:49:53.400 --> 00:50:04.980
