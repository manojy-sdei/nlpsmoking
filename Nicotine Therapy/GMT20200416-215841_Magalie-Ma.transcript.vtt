00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.800
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. All right, well we gotta get through it. So I'm spell your last name for me.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.870
Kaley Montgomery: Montgomery mo in

20
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.770
Kaley Montgomery: TG o m, er, why

21
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.160
Magalie Marcellus: And how old are you,

22
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.870
Kaley Montgomery: 24

23
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.270
Magalie Marcellus: And what butcher to our program.

24
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:26.550
Kaley Montgomery: Um, well, I've been in and out about treatment. I believe that's what it's called an outreach program for almost three years and I quit them. I just didn't feel like they were giving me everything that I needed and the people that I went

25
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.620
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, I lost you for a minute.

26
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.510
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

27
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.210
Magalie Marcellus: So we're talking about. You mentioned that you are an outpatient program about three years.

28
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.540
Magalie Marcellus: Yes, that's great. And you felt that you're getting some your needs met. So

29
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.200
Kaley Montgomery: That's correct.

30
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.910
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

31
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.790
Magalie Marcellus: So how are you referred to this program.

32
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:35.880
Kaley Montgomery: Um, my friend. She. I don't know how she found out about you guys, but she found out about you guys and had told me I should, you know, kick that last place and come here. So that's what I did.

33
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.810
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. What was the name of the program you last attended

34
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.670
Kaley Montgomery: Humid up humid up. It's like you, Ma da op or something.

35
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.740
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

36
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.460
Magalie Marcellus: So a little bit with the substance abuse history. So what was your drug of choice.

37
00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:08.760
Kaley Montgomery: Um, well, I did Percocet, for a short period of time. I wasn't any more unique than anybody else. But I didn't, you know, hit rock bottom or anything. I just couldn't deal with the withdrawal symptoms. So I

38
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:20.160
Kaley Montgomery: Chose to take care of it and take care of it as quick as I could. So therefore, I found a an outpatient program that that prescribed because I had started buying them on the street.

39
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:39.150
Kaley Montgomery: Just to feel okay and I and I had to buy Suboxone and it would give me very, very bad headaches and like, blurred vision, so when I got into the doctors I requested study Jackie. That's what I've been on ever since. So three years going now on 32nd clean

40
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.880
Kaley Montgomery: On behind your fan. Yes.

41
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.260
Magalie Marcellus: It was okay, and where you prescribe or what made what

42
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.540
Magalie Marcellus: Mindset.

43
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.330
Kaley Montgomery: My boyfriend just kind of introduce them to me.

44
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.410
Yeah, okay.

45
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.340
Magalie Marcellus: And how old were you when this started

46
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.890
Kaley Montgomery: About 1920 it's been about four years or so now

47
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.690
Magalie Marcellus: And you use it for about how long

48
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.230
Kaley Montgomery: It was a short period of time, I'd say maybe six to 12 months to okay

49
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.050
Magalie Marcellus: And was there any other drugs and in between.

50
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:23.610
Kaley Montgomery: Um, yeah. So I was taking Adderall in between. I felt that I needed a prescription for those honestly

51
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.950
Kaley Montgomery: I just took them on the street illicitly but I felt like I needed a prescription for those. I still haven't got diagnosed for ADHD or my

52
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.600
Kaley Montgomery: Child either, but

53
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.220
Kaley Montgomery: They really made me focus and alert and attendance and

54
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:49.530
Kaley Montgomery: It helped me a lot. As far as getting through, like the withdrawals of the opiates and, you know, being able to focus on finishing up GED classes so

55
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.040
Kaley Montgomery: That was also another issue. Another issue was

56
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.260
Kaley Montgomery: Cocaine. So I did have some issues with cocaine also

57
00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.980
Okay.

58
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.420
Magalie Marcellus: And we're

59
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.130
Magalie Marcellus: All on the same time.

60
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:15.900
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah, all around the same time. Yes, but obviously the coke. It wasn't really an addictive thing so much visually more mentally. So I was able to kick that way easier than I was, you know, the physical withdrawal drugs.

61
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.020
Magalie Marcellus: So was there any heroin or any other type of substance.

62
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.270
Kaley Montgomery: No, no, I've never tried one before. No.

63
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.180
Magalie Marcellus: So what made you

64
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.200
Magalie Marcellus: What made you decided to finally. Okay, I need to seek

65
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.370
Magalie Marcellus: Treatment what happened.

66
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.490
Kaley Montgomery: Um, the physical withdrawal that I was in during

67
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.540
Kaley Montgomery: Phone is that

68
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.570
Magalie Marcellus: While I was on the sentence through

69
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.680
Kaley Montgomery: Experience.

70
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:57.930
Kaley Montgomery: I was very clammy irritable just restless. I couldn't sleep. I, I just shaky body store. Yeah, pretty much all the symptoms, I guess you'd get with heroin just not as an as it as it as extreme so

71
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.980
Magalie Marcellus: That's okay. Now, did you try to quit on your own.

72
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.730
Yes.

73
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.110
Magalie Marcellus: How long were you successful with it.

74
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.610
Kaley Montgomery: I'm not very successful at all because

75
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.530
Magalie Marcellus: I knew after

76
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:23.820
Kaley Montgomery: A Yeah. Not very long. I'd say maybe a day or two at a time because I don't have to, like, separate the the intervals, as far as staying

77
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:33.210
Kaley Montgomery: I don't know how to explain it simply because when you're trying to do it on your own. You have to go find some way to be able to manage life. So I thought to be able to get up every day.

78
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.690
Kaley Montgomery: Out of that.

79
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.130
Kaley Montgomery: So I will find you know so be tech or Suboxone on the street, just to

80
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.990
Kaley Montgomery: Start to add to show cares it all my

81
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.510
Magalie Marcellus: So you can function. Okay, great, great.

82
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.120
Magalie Marcellus: So the heaviness, or the most severe

83
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.640
Magalie Marcellus: How much were you using

84
00:08:51.480 --> 00:09:07.620
Kaley Montgomery: Um, I, I never did more than than a 15 and I only did those a couple times. So really, I was just doing fives and 10s and I did them as frequently as I don't know every other day. At first, it started out just maybe once a week and then it got

85
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.530
Kaley Montgomery: pretty extreme as as the months went on.

86
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.910
Kaley Montgomery: So I'd say I'd say probably every day after about six months time

87
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.270
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. And it was like up to

88
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.840
Kaley Montgomery: 10 milligram. Yeah.

89
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.280
Magalie Marcellus: How was your life like when you were using that frequently

90
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:45.330
Kaley Montgomery: Well, it was, it was okay. I felt like I was in control. I don't know why I just had a lot of energy and I didn't mind it until obviously I didn't have the drones.

91
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.560
Magalie Marcellus: And I couldn't get up.

92
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:54.120
Kaley Montgomery: OUT OF BED AND NEXT DAY. So if I didn't have it. Then I was on functional, but of course you know any addict, things are in control of their habits.

93
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:54.960
Magalie Marcellus: And they're

94
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.310
Kaley Montgomery: Wrong, so

95
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.380
Magalie Marcellus: Because you needed something to make you feel okay

96
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.250
Right.

97
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.560
Magalie Marcellus: And did your the substance use, how did that affect your

98
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.320
Magalie Marcellus: Work ambition shape.

99
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:24.720
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah, so I couldn't, I couldn't go to work every day, like I used to without having the medication on it. Obviously, I didn't, you know, I was more functional on it. Then I felt like I was

100
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:32.850
Kaley Montgomery: Prior to even getting addicted to it. It didn't take a toll on me like that, of course, like I said, I didn't get to hit rock bottom. So

101
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:48.840
Kaley Montgomery: I you know I quickly found out, obviously I was addicted. I needed help, and I hurried up and got into treatment. So I didn't really get to experience a lot of downfalls and spiral out and rituals and and all that, like, unfortunately, a lot of other people had to do.

102
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.010
Magalie Marcellus: Was there any

103
00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:03.450
Magalie Marcellus: I'll come back then, but any like issues with the family in a relationship difficulty because of the substance use.

104
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:13.740
Kaley Montgomery: Um, no. I took care of my daughter still maintained. I lived with my grandparents. I was in a relationship. It was a little bit toxic obviously because we both using drugs.

105
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.810
Kaley Montgomery: We neither one

106
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:26.370
Kaley Montgomery: We just kind of both got into it at the same time. So we neither one expected that. But I, I come from a family of of addicts. So I guess it's kind of just hereditary

107
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.310
Magalie Marcellus: And

108
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.180
Magalie Marcellus: You never experienced any seizures or any overdose, anything like that.

109
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.490
Magalie Marcellus: No. No. Okay.

110
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.380
Magalie Marcellus: And you only did one treatment and that was

111
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.580
Kaley Montgomery: That place. Yeah. So I've been with humid up for three and a half years, but

112
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.980
Kaley Montgomery: I when I left that program I had gotten to an emergency doctor

113
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:10.470
Kaley Montgomery: It's like a walk in clinic where they describe pregnant people, you know, the medicine until further notice. And then once I got in with you guys. I

114
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:18.600
Kaley Montgomery: Have been here ever since I've been here a little over a month now, but I was with someone for like a month just as far as like emergent in

115
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.760
Magalie Marcellus: Between. Gotcha. Okay, you say for pregnancy, where you Magneto

116
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.440
Kaley Montgomery: I am right now yeah 30

117
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:25.890
Magalie Marcellus: Oh,

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.970
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, wow. Congrats. Do you know what you haven't

119
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.300
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah, it's a boy, I got a daughter, she's eight I get the ball.

120
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:40.020
Magalie Marcellus: Yes you should. The whole wow you like towards the end there.

121
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.010
Kaley Montgomery: Yes, I am. I'm ready. My backstory here and

122
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:45.960
Magalie Marcellus: I came around

123
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.840
Magalie Marcellus: And you haven't added expense an issue with the pregnancy and being under

124
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.340
Kaley Montgomery: No, no.

125
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:53.790
Magalie Marcellus: On the

126
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.790
Kaley Montgomery: safest thing for me so

127
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.060
Kaley Montgomery: Um, I didn't intend on getting pregnant while being addicted to study time I did start to type very

128
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:16.680
Kaley Montgomery: Good. And as far as I know 30% of babies go through withdrawal or even experience which are also understand that my son isn't one of them. But even if he goes, I still have all the measurements, ready to go.

129
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.150
Magalie Marcellus: And so forth. Yeah.

130
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.710
Kaley Montgomery: I took a class.

131
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.970
Kaley Montgomery: On it. So I know

132
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.230
Kaley Montgomery: Exactly what to look for.

133
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:28.410
Magalie Marcellus: Us. Good. Sounds like you're getting itself. Everything in line to make sure you

134
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:36.870
Kaley Montgomery: We have right but my daughter is eight, so I didn't do drugs while I was. I didn't do drugs with this baby either. It's just the subject is a drug in itself.

135
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.340
Magalie Marcellus: So there why

136
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.170
Kaley Montgomery: You got to be cautious about that so

137
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.360
Kaley Montgomery: It's totally different this time around.

138
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.220
Magalie Marcellus: And who's your support person.

139
00:13:48.060 --> 00:14:05.610
Kaley Montgomery: My grandma is my biggest support person, but I'm also a big support person on myself. I, I just, I'm very happy and content with myself. I live on my own, with my daughter. I've lived on my own since I've been 19 years old and I work hard for everything that I have. So I'm also

140
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.930
Kaley Montgomery: A border of myself.

141
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.410
Magalie Marcellus: And and this the child's progress is

142
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.210
Magalie Marcellus: A ball.

143
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.080
Yes.

144
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.300
Magalie Marcellus: You mentioned your grandmother, so you don't live with your grandmother anymore.

194
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.310

195
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.980
Kaley Montgomery: I mean, for the most part. Now, I think that drugs made her mentally ill.

Kaley Montgomery: Good, because I lived with my grandparents and they

249
00:23:49.140 --> 00:24:05.940
Kaley Montgomery: They had a decent money growing up. So I got a lot of everything that I wanted, including so I got materialistic love and I got, you know, physical love to. So I haven't pretty made. That's why I'm just kind of disappointed in myself as far as

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:24.990
Kaley Montgomery: doing stupid stuff and getting addicted to drugs, my girlfriend's really don't.

Magalie Marcellus: When it takes time to get fully our bodies thing.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:43.260
Kaley Montgomery: And it does. And I wish that she had more of an open mind about going to, you know, maybe a meeting or something to understand more about how how it works. And in that you're not getting high off of this. It's just helping

254
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.630
Magalie Marcellus: To maintain. Yeah.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:15.390

263
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.190
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, it is. And just to take whatever question you need so

264

Magalie Marcellus: You, they love because they don't get to touch them. So everybody can get

294
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.310
Magalie Marcellus: Some time I'd another individually, enjoy.

295
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:52.200
Kaley Montgomery: A relationship with them mostly more than the kids or grandkids, you know,

296
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.770
Magalie Marcellus: When I present. Right, right.

297
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.900
Magalie Marcellus: Hopefully once everything is set or you back, you know, baby.

298
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.480
Magalie Marcellus: Ready, go back to

299
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.300
Magalie Marcellus: Something experience now.

300
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.890
Kaley Montgomery: Yes, I didn't know that it was just a little too far. But I was kind of desperate.

301
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.410
Magalie Marcellus: Desperate times call just wanted something to do

302
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.400
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, okay.

303
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.640
Magalie Marcellus: So friends. So tell me about your friends.

304
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:31.560
Kaley Montgomery: Um, I have just actually probably two or three total they've had for years and years and years. And I just really don't like to

305
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:40.920
Kaley Montgomery: Call a lot of people friends because they're just really not so someone I consider to be my friend is is Morgan, she

306
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:51.060
Kaley Montgomery: Has been my friend since we've been like 12 years old and she's like a sister and my friend, Brittany, that's actually here right now she's, she's been friends since we were 12 years old. She was a

307
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.510
Neighbor.

308
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:57.120
Kaley Montgomery: Living like like three houses down from each other. So we, we took

309
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.110
Magalie Marcellus: A long time

310
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.140
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah okay longtime friend.

311
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.810
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, and any issues with substance with any of those friends that you

312
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.630
Kaley Montgomery: Spend time, my friend, Morgan is completely sober. She used to smoke marijuana. The other

313
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:14.910
Kaley Montgomery: Do that anymore.

314
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:22.740
Kaley Montgomery: My friend Britney. She used to smoke marijuana before she got on probation. So she don't do anything either. So

315
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.570
Kaley Montgomery: Everybody go clean up here.

316
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.430
Magalie Marcellus: porcine yeah yeah

317
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.320
Magalie Marcellus: And as a child. Was there any history of abuse or neglect.

318
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.350
Kaley Montgomery: Know, I felt like I had a really good childhood, hopefully.

319
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.740
Magalie Marcellus: Any sexual abuse or sexual assault.

320
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:44.790
No.

321
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.700
Kaley Montgomery: No no no no call

322
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:53.250
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. And right now, you say you for

323
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:59.970
Magalie Marcellus: Employment use stopped because of the distance and now the pregnancy.

324
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:09.840
Kaley Montgomery: Yes, yes. I also received my section eight so i don't i'm not required, but if I work, I will not have assistants, helping to pay the bills.

325
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:11.730
Kaley Montgomery: Apartment here.

326
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.450
Kaley Montgomery: That's all covered pretty much the utilities.

327
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.310
Kaley Montgomery: Included and everything so

328
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:26.700
Kaley Montgomery: I don't think that's an issue. The only thing I really have issues with incoming money because, of course, I just got my axes. And then we got the government stimulus money.

329
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.980
Magalie Marcellus: So I'm a bit

330
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:30.060
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

331
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.570
Kaley Montgomery: Just long enough to have a seven weeks to have a baby and then hopefully

332
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:40.920
Kaley Montgomery: I can get right back here. The only issue. I don't have a license so little bit difficult starting to back and forth to

333
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.560
Kaley Montgomery: A base of job.

334
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.170
Magalie Marcellus: So I happened to license.

335
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:51.030
Kaley Montgomery: I got into a car accident. I didn't have insurance so they suspended them and

336
00:30:52.320 --> 00:31:00.690
Kaley Montgomery: Toxic now Carrie and I are going to, I have to pay a reinstatement $350 I have to go to this program thing that pops in any on

337
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:06.120
Kaley Montgomery: The name my license plates my ID and everything, so I gotta pay for those

338
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.950
Magalie Marcellus: Cheese.

339
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.300
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah, it just a lot

340
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:09.810
Magalie Marcellus: Of and

341
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:15.330
Kaley Montgomery: I didn't have a baby. So how to start completely over from scratch and buy everything

342
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.320
Kaley Montgomery: My tax money music all of that.

343
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.950
Magalie Marcellus: And yeah, but what's your daughter's name.

344
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.010
Magalie Marcellus: For me,

345
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:38.310
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah.

346
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:42.510
Magalie Marcellus: And she's a

347
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.600
Kaley Montgomery: She'll be in August.

348
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.360
Magalie Marcellus: Which is still seven

349
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.160
Kaley Montgomery: Themselves to

350
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.060
Kaley Montgomery: The tablet.

351
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.570
And

352
00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:57.960
Magalie Marcellus: Out.

353
00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:58.650
Kaley Montgomery: Of the house.

354
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.260
Magalie Marcellus: I know, sir. How you doing with them.

355
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.460
Magalie Marcellus: On schooling with

356
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:12.480
Kaley Montgomery: Oh, she she just got her great parties got to see all A's and what have you. So the theater and math, which I I'm

357
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.490
Kaley Montgomery: I'm not very good with

358
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.210
Kaley Montgomery: With maybe because I struggle with it.

359
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.820
Kaley Montgomery: Obviously it's first grade math, it's not as hard as whatever I have to deal with.

360
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:31.290
Kaley Montgomery: But it's still something that I struggle with him. I guess maybe that's partaking in her activities for

361
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:40.560
Kaley Montgomery: Sure. But other than that, we got her see up the language arts. It was just a few missing assignments that also caused it to be such a low grade.

362
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.660
Magalie Marcellus: Have a wood seeing everything

363
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:46.770
Yes.

364
00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:48.300
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

365
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.280
Kaley Montgomery: I love her team structure and I like to, you know, organize my house very organized

366
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.920
Kaley Montgomery: Have routine show certain organization agenda like to read

367
00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.450
Magalie Marcellus: That, for sure. Yeah, and helps the kids so to know what to expect.

368
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.100
Kaley Montgomery: Mother for so long. And since I was so young, too. So I know what I'm getting myself into a

369
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:17.460
Kaley Montgomery: Lot of starting all the way over completely is just a little bit just hone in on top of having to be

370
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.050
Kaley Montgomery: Something

371
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:29.550
Kaley Montgomery: Like I wake up some mornings, like I used to be like when I didn't have to depend on these pills and that really took a toll on your life.

372
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:38.790
Magalie Marcellus: Again, you know, it's for good reason because you know that all the alternative is that better.

373
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.690
Kaley Montgomery: Right. Right. And not being on the street doing

374
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:56.430
Kaley Montgomery: I'm so thankful for the programs that they have now because when I was speaking to my counselor and I was out for a long time, they would put in bestow and I bring that you know they didn't get the kind of things and amenity that we get now.

375
00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.340
Kaley Montgomery: People and then how to just get off the drugs hard for and how to leave them alone.

376
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:21.300
Kaley Montgomery: They didn't get the option to do or doing them. So I'm really grateful that the same time, I don't believe that this House is for, like, it's your it's your call. Because you get a better view on the whole drug abuse idea versus what they had. So I don't know.

377
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:23.580
Kaley Montgomery: We had a lot of artists standpoint.

378
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.570
Magalie Marcellus: And is different.

379
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.700
Kaley Montgomery: They were better because they they have to go without any medication.

380
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.400
Kaley Montgomery: Cold turkey, just to get off drugs.

381
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.220
Magalie Marcellus: When that everybody can manage

382
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.840
Magalie Marcellus: That way, so that's why there's

383
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.840
Kaley Montgomery: Other options. Right. That was one of my big issues with

384
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:56.400
Kaley Montgomery: The doctor. The doctor was a foreign so he didn't really have a lot to say. And whenever he did say stuff like, I really didn't understand him but

385
00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:09.570
Kaley Montgomery: The counselors, they were just rude and and they would just sometimes the grade, you can almost assume that they were helping you by, like, I don't know, jumping down your

386
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:19.770
Kaley Montgomery: Skin and hard on your back, but I didn't look at it like I just feel like sometimes you gotta give a little bit, but mostly support and and kindness gets the long

387
00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:24.360
Magalie Marcellus: Day. Mm hmm. Absolutely. Because it's not enough.

388
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.380
Magalie Marcellus: It's not to judge a person, you have to provide support.

389
00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:35.040
Kaley Montgomery: Right. Right. And I didn't feel like as if I were being judged so much because they always had a story behind them as to

390
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:50.370
Kaley Montgomery: How they ended up where they were mostly that they would, they were drug addicts at some point. That's how their counselor down, but the same time they will always make yourself seem better because the counselors who will face addiction and overcame it

391
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.240
Kaley Montgomery: Made it

392
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:57.390
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah. Yes, so they can make you feel like a little and I really like that.

393
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.120
Magalie Marcellus: I'm sorry.

394
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.400
Magalie Marcellus: That didn't work out.

395
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.740
Kaley Montgomery: Again here.

396
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:09.240
Magalie Marcellus: But you still stuck to it. So that's important because, you know,

397
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.630
Kaley Montgomery: You know,

398
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.100
Magalie Marcellus: You needed to do it.

399
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.720
Magalie Marcellus: For yourself. Yeah.

400
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:20.850
Kaley Montgomery: When you're when you're addicted to a medication you find any way to figure out what you gotta do to get it done.

401
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.610
Kaley Montgomery: And they were very proud of you all the time I was here.

402
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.800
Kaley Montgomery: You know your people were paid

403
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:31.110
Kaley Montgomery: On time that's that's very appreciative. But at the same time.

404
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:39.660
Kaley Montgomery: They just got paid for us being there and I just felt like they would be honest you already have the about us not showing up to a to a meeting.

405
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:52.470
Kaley Montgomery: More or less, because if we wasn't there, they wasn't getting our insurance money and they weren't getting paid. I didn't really feel like there's so much out of the heart that they care that we wasn't there. So that was a big issue for me also that I had a quick

406
00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:07.080
Kaley Montgomery: And, you know, people have lives even though they were drug addicts, whatever you have kids lives and jobs. Some people would have to, like, I don't know, just go through hell of that trying to make making their job in China.

407
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:27.840
Magalie Marcellus: Well yeah thing is everybody have to have your personal account accountability to make sure that you know you're doing your part, sometimes you know programs do work with you, but they don't want you to feel that you're not taking it serious

408
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.430
Magalie Marcellus: So as long as you know you doing what you need to do for yourself and you'll get

409
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.700
Kaley Montgomery: Too high. And then they will just try to like

410
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.370
Kaley Montgomery: You know, build something down because you've already set

411
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.360
Your expectations.

412
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.630
Magalie Marcellus: Which is unrealistic for the person

413
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:49.380
Kaley Montgomery: So sometimes, you know, I would have to miss something and they will just lose it, and I'm like,

414
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.860
Kaley Montgomery: Crazy. I can't keep doing it anymore.

415
00:37:54.660 --> 00:38:07.740
Kaley Montgomery: So I just had to find somebody that was understandable as far as I have life and I have to work a job and I have my daughter has to go to school in the morning, so I can do one in groups. And then in the afternoon, how to be at work. So

416
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:12.720
Kaley Montgomery: I wasn't able to make another one. After I started working sitting on my feet. They were more

417
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:26.310
Kaley Montgomery: For being sober and clean and getting mentioned together than they were happy for me, I think, more or less, because the insurance, you know, they're not getting paid for us not being there and they look at it like we didn't care about our personal variety. But if we were so

418
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.990
Magalie Marcellus: Even though you are maintaining

419
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.040
Kaley Montgomery: It.

420
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.350
Kaley Montgomery: You know, drug testing sober.

421
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:38.040
Kaley Montgomery: All the groups. Like I almost got kicked out because I missed so many groups in a month. And I'm like,

422
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:46.680
Kaley Montgomery: I can't keep feeling like I'm walking on eggshells, and I can't keep my, on my end anytime news this prescription and I have to

423
00:38:47.130 --> 00:39:00.840
Kaley Montgomery: Walk on eggshells just to keep my research and just put me in my life. So I need somewhere that is going to help me, you know, help them so much, appreciate you being a part of their, you know, their service. I appreciate them to be.

424
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:16.920
Kaley Montgomery: That's what made me whenever we had to get out of there and a lot of people realize before I did, but I just so young and I didn't really care. One thing I care about is making sure that I got my my medicine. I was sober and obviously you're doing whatever they

425
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.830
Kaley Montgomery: Want on my feet and

426
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:26.550
Kaley Montgomery: They did not like the whole they wanted you to just be down and out and need them for everything. And I didn't wanna

427
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.530
Magalie Marcellus: That's unfortunate.

428
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:35.130
Magalie Marcellus: Sounds like you know what you want a new making sure that you take care of yourself and

429
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.930
Magalie Marcellus: That's commendable.

430
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.680
Magalie Marcellus: So what can I have is the have can

431
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.600
Kaley Montgomery: Have

432
00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:45.450
Kaley Montgomery: A social

433
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:47.160
Kaley Montgomery: Networking.

434
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.070
Kaley Montgomery: Always on social network always

435
00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:51.960
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

436
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.000
Kaley Montgomery: Are you posting stuff.

437
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.450
Kaley Montgomery: I like to post my belly like

438
00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.470
Kaley Montgomery: Okay.

439
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:12.390
Kaley Montgomery: I used to be really bad about her. I kind of slowed down a lot now though, as I got older than normal. And I said, I don't post her as much anymore as I used to. But when she was my one and only God. People were like, I'm so sick and tired of seeing your child.

440
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:27.630
Kaley Montgomery: I am so I was just very proud of her. And I had a young and I just the only thing I regret in life is is trying drugs that I had to go through physically addicted to

441
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:45.420
Kaley Montgomery: Like the cocaine. I don't really regret, which sounds horrible. I understand. But I just never. It was just more like the party substance growing up as a young child, I had that you know are you drinking and do whatever it was never something that held on to my life where I have

442
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.750
Kaley Montgomery: A mixtape and cried and cried and cried because I was in pain.

443
00:40:48.810 --> 00:41:01.350
Kaley Montgomery: from not having it once I got with my boyfriend we was together about four years and he never actually okay either. And what was crazy because you don't hear very often you know someone's boyfriend.

444
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:06.750
Kaley Montgomery: Get you addicted to drugs have never been addicted to judge yourself either we just kind of women.

445
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:16.230
Kaley Montgomery: full fledged together on it and he came out with no scars no scratches. He didn't get physical with with all that I did shake

446
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:19.020
Kaley Montgomery: He didn't have to understand where

447
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:27.870
Kaley Montgomery: That separated us because you know how to build it, how he kind of looked at me like you're a junkie, or you're

448
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.730
Kaley Montgomery: A wink ya.

449
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:42.210
Magalie Marcellus: Know, and that's the thing, because everybody's body is different, your reactions are different. So you may be using the same drugs, but things are different when it comes to the withdrawals so

450
00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.890
Kaley Montgomery: mad at him because he wasn't

451
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:49.170
Kaley Montgomery: Withdrawing like I might. His, His wasn't clear meaning that you didn't have like restless nights and

452
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.800
Magalie Marcellus: And

453
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:59.460
Kaley Montgomery: You know, he just was normal. And I'm like, How can you be so normal and not to like, share, so we just started to fall apart because you'd be okay without the medicine, but you

454
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.490
Kaley Montgomery: Wanted to and I had to do because I needed to

455
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:07.170
Kaley Montgomery: I couldn't even worse bobbing we're working out one acre myself.

456
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:15.210
Kaley Montgomery: And I came so far. And you know he he calls me still, to this day, like I'm so proud of you.

457
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.160
Magalie Marcellus: Well, good.

458
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.210
Magalie Marcellus: So easy or any of the, the oldest

459
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:22.650
Magalie Marcellus: Father.

460
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:24.570
Kaley Montgomery: Father.

461
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.540
Kaley Montgomery: Either step father figure to her that we were

462
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.900
Magalie Marcellus: Together for a year. So she was about four years old and she knew

463
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.090
Kaley Montgomery: Her Daddy, daddy, so she does.

464
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.770
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, and any legal issues for you.

465
00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.410
Kaley Montgomery: Know, thank God. I don't have any

466
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.760
Kaley Montgomery: Trouble. I have absolutely no background I got caught with a blind. A couple times so

467
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:53.370
Kaley Montgomery: And they'll have some minor misdemeanors.

468
00:42:54.420 --> 00:43:03.630
Kaley Montgomery: License nobody driving without a license on that though I i I'm very thankful I didn't let you know the worst, the better of me so

469
00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.430
Kaley Montgomery: I'm just happy about that.

470
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:15.240
Magalie Marcellus: And what would be your, your primary goals. Right now, things you want to accomplish short term goals.

471
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:25.110
Kaley Montgomery: I'll get my license back is definitely one of the biggest short term goal that I have, especially now with the large amount of money that I have, you know, just sitting in the bay.

472
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:36.240
Kaley Montgomery: That's something that really has to be done. Getting tires on the car and making sure that it's jammed up or whatever. So that back and forth to the big doctors my demo don't have to have so much stress, but on her.

473
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.700
Kaley Montgomery: And then just

474
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:53.550
Kaley Montgomery: Nesting cleaning the house keeping it clean, trying to maintain my daughter schooling and focus on being healthy pregnancy and come home with a healthy, happy baby. I just for the fact that

475
00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:02.910
Kaley Montgomery: I know what it feels like to withdraw can imagine what it might be like for a newborn baby to go through withdrawal for a little while, it just

476
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:03.660
Magalie Marcellus: puts me in a

477
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.910
Kaley Montgomery: Horrible state of mind like

478
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.440
Kaley Montgomery: I feel so horrible, like I really did something wrong, but never be charged me like

479
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.640
Magalie Marcellus: You're not doing anything. You don't know what's going to happen any right and

480
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.740
Magalie Marcellus: You don't know why he's gonna respond

481
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:17.520
Magalie Marcellus: Right.

482
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:22.200
Magalie Marcellus: And again, you know, this is it's better than alternative

483
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.970
Kaley Montgomery: Yeah. Right. Right.

484
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.090
Kaley Montgomery: You know, people here when that's how

485
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:33.030
Kaley Montgomery: That actually based on this praying of mine is the one that's

486
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.030
Kaley Montgomery: All that I prayed for done

487
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.010
Kaley Montgomery: You know the right way, the right way.

488
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.180
Magalie Marcellus: Right. And again, you mentioned that you've been

489
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.720
Magalie Marcellus: Reading on it and get information. So that's the

490
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.010
Magalie Marcellus: Best thing you can do to educate yourself so you know what to expect when the baby does come

491
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:52.860
Kaley Montgomery: Exactly right. Talk to my

492
00:44:52.860 --> 00:45:01.260
Kaley Montgomery: Doctor my doctor that was actually about while before I finally got to that accommodates for

493
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.200
Magalie Marcellus: Sure, good.

494
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.940
Kaley Montgomery: My friend babies over here and he's just starting everything

495
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.840
Everything.

496
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:21.540
Magalie Marcellus: Again to everything.

497
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:27.780
Kaley Montgomery: Yes, they do. So everything that i i i didn't know i needed to be. I don't know what I need to be

498
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.150
Magalie Marcellus: Oh yeah, for sure.

499
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.700
Magalie Marcellus: I'll find them right

500
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.320
Kaley Montgomery: Right.

501
00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.860
Magalie Marcellus: Any other thing that you

502
00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:47.970
Magalie Marcellus: Needs or eventually that lead down the line, you know, with them climate and stuff, but for nice many do think you mentioned correct

503
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.570
Kaley Montgomery: I'm sorry I didn't catch what you thought was

504
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.680
Magalie Marcellus: I was saying in terms of the goals. Eventually, once the baby's there.

505
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.110
Magalie Marcellus: And ready the new go back to work.

506
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:09.330
Kaley Montgomery: Yes, I plan to be back at work. I'm going to sign backup Metallica from my, my children, one feet, you know, maybe one or two months old or so. So

507
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.700
Magalie Marcellus: I just don't want to. Depending on what's going

508
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.830
Magalie Marcellus: On with this whole thing right now two

509
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.340
Magalie Marcellus: Things going to take people just

510
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.100
Kaley Montgomery: Kind of tend to be in a baby face just because it's a baby. And that's just how they are. You never know.

511
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:23.520
People

512
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.810
Kaley Montgomery: Like to ride in mouths and

513
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:31.140
Magalie Marcellus: Just hand or right now everything is social distance

514
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:36.750
Kaley Montgomery: I'm kind of grateful in a way for the pandemic, it's

515
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:42.360
Kaley Montgomery: It's acknowledged me a lot. As far as educational, you know, I've learned to

516
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.450
Kaley Montgomery: Do things that I've never learned to do before.

517
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.160
Magalie Marcellus: And everything I was like why it's

518
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:53.580
Kaley Montgomery: worth keeping my kids in home and and learning how to homeschooling big thing is

519
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.460
Magalie Marcellus: Teaching them how to. Yes, yes.

520
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:58.290
Magalie Marcellus: Well side.

521
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:00.270
Magalie Marcellus: By our ties things

522
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:00.840
Right.

523
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.360
Magalie Marcellus: So there's

524
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.450
Magalie Marcellus: Another prospectus. For sure. So, yeah.

525
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.440
Kaley Montgomery: I think I was too friendly father. So now that I'm just

526
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.090
Magalie Marcellus: Me myself.

527
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.030
Magalie Marcellus: You're learning to do that.

528
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.720
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, when the social person.

529
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:19.830
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, but

530
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.140
Magalie Marcellus: Again, this is

531
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.260
Magalie Marcellus: Saying, We don't know.

532
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.030
Kaley Montgomery: What we can do. And so we're faced with it.

533
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.450
So,

534
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:31.050
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, and which

535
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:37.890
Kaley Montgomery: I think an online group meeting. It's called the room or something.

536
00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:38.760
Magalie Marcellus: I'm not sure.

537
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:44.370
Kaley Montgomery: I do started once I got into this emergency doctor. They had given me a list of all mine.

538
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:58.620
Kaley Montgomery: Works in chat rooms and stuff like that. Get into as far as know transportation. I told you, transportation was an issue, a little bit for me working around my schedule is a little difficult. So they have just given me the option to be pregnant.

539
00:47:59.010 --> 00:47:59.850
Magalie Marcellus: Down the line.

540
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:00.480
We want

541
00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:11.040
Kaley Montgomery: So I got into that a little bit. I read a lot of like, I don't know, little prayers and in my little thing that just make me happy and satisfied.

542
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:20.640
Kaley Montgomery: It's little things like that that I cling on to and then sometimes you really don't know what you might get from somebody else. It really could be meaningful, and it could just

543
00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.680
Magalie Marcellus: Mean absolutely not sharing

544
00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.120
Kaley Montgomery: Your other people

545
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:25.950
Magalie Marcellus: Right, yeah.

546
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:31.410
Magalie Marcellus: This is why it is important because everybody's learning from each other. Yeah.

547
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:32.790
Magalie Marcellus: Right, and that's my

548
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.490
Kaley Montgomery: Lesson right

549
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:45.150
Magalie Marcellus: So right now, for us, the group you're assigned to which one is that is that Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday.

550
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.180
Kaley Montgomery: Wednesday at one o'clock.

551
00:48:50.790 --> 00:49:01.230
Kaley Montgomery: And I just did my first one and I enjoyed it. I just like to say that I can get a feel of but then I realized that nobody in the group is going to be the same people.

552
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:13.650
Kaley Montgomery: Every time so I kind of just started then opening my mouth a little bit because whatever I say might mean something to them and I might never be in a group with the same people again. So that's my email or feedback.

553
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:18.120
Kaley Montgomery: I'm not at all.

554
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:22.440
Magalie Marcellus: You know doesn't sound to me like you are

555
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:23.550
Yeah.

556
00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.270
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, I think so.

557
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.340
Magalie Marcellus: Because you determine

558
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:33.450
Yes.

559
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:48.990
Kaley Montgomery: Young and determined. So once you've dealt with a lot of trials and tribulations during the other person. It doesn't really matter what age it just kind of like this, those on. Those are like you don't even seem 24, you're probably about 34 and head.

560
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.220
Magalie Marcellus: And yeah.

561
00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:56.760
Magalie Marcellus: Because you grew up quick. Yeah, we're

562
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:12.330
Kaley Montgomery: Fortunate but i i i have no issue with that on. I'm not really grateful that I had to live the life you know the mother Ronaldo grandparents. But I don't complain about it because I am who I am from it and

563
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.400
Magalie Marcellus: Again, I'm glad you're able to find this program.

564
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:28.230
Magalie Marcellus: To have Petunia and hopefully you know you continue in your journey which are recovery and

565
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:28.890
Kaley Montgomery: Thank you.

566
00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.270
Magalie Marcellus: So for now.

567
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:49.230
Magalie Marcellus: I'm telling everybody because we get in quite a few patients. So if there's anything you need to meet with me just call virtual clinic and they'll get in contact with me. Then I schedule you so if if everything is okay, I'll just check in with you in a few weeks, and we can schedule something

568
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:59.010
Kaley Montgomery: Sure, yeah. So I was told that it was only required for this one time. But I asked you if she recommended me to little bit more frequently.

569
00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.100
Kaley Montgomery: Coming from a place where you have to go

570
00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:18.870
Kaley Montgomery: So often to see a doctor once a week and then you have to see a counselor three times a week and then you have to do individual sessions I just used to having them like content and you know I feel so I have no problem. Maybe at least once a month or something.

571
00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.210
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, yeah, I can do that.

572
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:25.230
Magalie Marcellus: So what are my. Oh yeah, um,

573
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.130
Magalie Marcellus: So how

574
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:40.320
Magalie Marcellus: Does a good book. So what time. Was this your appointment six o'clock. Alright, so without I can do, I can lock you into they wouldn't schedule somebody else and that

575
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.020
Magalie Marcellus: What are you doing anyway.

576
00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:48.570
Kaley Montgomery: And do June 3 so I might have around the time of June with talking

577
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:49.890
Magalie Marcellus: To

578
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:51.510
Kaley Montgomery: Me.

579
00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:52.830
