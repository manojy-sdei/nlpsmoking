89
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.850
Gillian Ovall: I don't know, I started thinking a lot about math and it just all was bad. It was just

Gillian Ovall: Really

91
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:48.450

Gillian Ovall: Don't be know that

112
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.150
Katrina Groves: We should be using condoms or something.

121
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:38.130
Gillian Ovall: I haven't. I mean, I would use condoms. I really wouldn't like to go on the pill. I don't know.

122
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.270
Gillian Ovall: Are you smoking cigarettes. Yes. Okay. Yeah.

130
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:15.720
Katrina Groves: Don't be afraid, or ask for the morning after pill. If the condom breaks or if you don't use it or something you know what's going on.

131
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.400
Katrina Groves: But yeah, you could be fertile up till you're in your 50s, so

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:04.980
Gillian Ovall: Known

388
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.500
Katrina Groves: So it all, nothing.

389
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.140
Katrina Groves: It all started after the domestic violence.

390
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.500
Thing.

391
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:29.580
Gillian Ovall: No. It actually started after I got my wisdom teeth taken out. Oh, that's when it really I yeah I have my wisdom teeth are amazing and I noticed that I got a little bit addicted to the medicine, they've given me. Mm hmm.

392
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:38.040
Gillian Ovall: That only it only lasted a couple of months because then I got pregnant with my son, my other son.

393
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.730
Gillian Ovall: But the actual

394
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:52.680
Gillian Ovall: And then it didn't start up again. I didn't get anything until after I got beaten up in 2009 I was on methadone.

395
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.860
Gillian Ovall: And they gave me the script.

Katrina Groves: Together. Those were the days.

399
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.130
Katrina Groves: Back and we think, why did we do that to people.

400
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.980
Gillian Ovall: Yeah, she had me on 140 milligrams of methadone, the day

401
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:15.540
Gillian Ovall: And

402
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.470
Gillian Ovall: Choose Xanax bars.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:42.000
Gillian Ovall: Twice a day. I think it was. Anyway, I, I am didn't abuse, any of those until I met Nick and then I I he started taking them from me. And so then we were having to buy more. So I could have my prescribed

405
00:26:43.860 --> 00:27:05.850
Gillian Ovall: By but 2017 is when we moved to Crescent City and I stopped getting my prescription, because I can travel back and forth to Vancouver Washington to get it right. I didn't know we were moving here. That was a shock to me. So when I got here. I tried for two months to come off of it.

406
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:06.510
Gillian Ovall: Wow.

407
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:20.130
Gillian Ovall: And I was still hurting as bad on day at is, I wasn't a one. I mean, it was ridiculous. I started doing heroin and meth to come to keep me awake, you know,

408
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.560
Gillian Ovall: And that's, that's really only had honestly

Gillian Ovall: I mean, you know,

412
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.350

Gillian Ovall: Barely drink as a teenager, you know, I grew up in Scotland, and I had a great life I was a flight attendant, you know, I

414
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.420

428
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:15.030
Gillian Ovall: I didn't know any better at the time. So, you know,

434
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:09.420
Gillian Ovall: And get my son to a point where you know he's able to do things and be happy. But I want to really

Gillian Ovall: Wow. Don't wanna I didn't go back. I never went that they couldn't come here.

451
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:29.940
Gillian Ovall: You know, I was in trouble. I was hurting. I did it. This is not what I wanted. This was not what I wanted. And I love her and I

452
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.230
Gillian Ovall: So she's working through all that my son. He does not talk to me.

453
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:35.760
Gillian Ovall: But

454
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.400
Gillian Ovall: He just turned 17

455
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.700

Katrina Groves: Good show and we see it happen all the time when people stay on the path of recovery, we see that happen families. We can help.

461
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.080
Gillian Ovall: Kids we connect. So I think that's good.

462
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.150
Gillian Ovall: And do you

463
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:24.060
Katrina Groves: Feel like you're taking the Suboxone is helping as far as keeping cravings away and making you feel more normal

464
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.550
Gillian Ovall: Is this absolutely yeah

465
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.250
Gillian Ovall: I

466
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.180
Gillian Ovall: I know because I

467
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:42.060
Gillian Ovall: I just got on it. Not too long ago and I remember still those cravings and they were

468
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.200
Gillian Ovall: On undeniable. I mean, they were horrifying.

469
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.890
Katrina Groves: And now the occasional cravings, because

470
00:32:51.810 --> 00:33:00.180
Gillian Ovall: I get occasional cravings, because I'm in pain, and it's not necessarily for heroin. It's for anything to take away the pain.

471
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:23.670
Gillian Ovall: And I had a huge tablet. So, you know, it scares me that ever if I ever, Dr. Watson, those will come back. I mean, I showed up of my neck every three hours like almost a gram of heroin that time. I mean, I was doing insane amounts. Right.

472
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.410

Katrina Groves: Acupuncture and chiropractic and you know those things do work. Do you have a pain management doctor, then that you're working with, or

477
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.830
Katrina Groves: That's the one that they're going to refer you to a neurosurgeon.

625
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.800
Katrina Groves: And now your mom passed, gosh, how long ago did your mom pass

626
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.660

627

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:10.440
Katrina Groves: And at that point.

629
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.950
Katrina Groves: Where the kids, then went to your brother.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.020
Christina Badura: Correct, yeah.

633
00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:28.650
Katrina Groves: And then he's been amazing kind of guide to watch for your kids, except he didn't want to let you see them either.

634
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:29.250
Yeah.

635
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.670
Katrina Groves: Until when then

636
00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.630
Christina Badura: I got pregnant.

637
00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.570
Katrina Groves: Oh, that's right. And that was last year.

638
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.710
Katrina Groves: Last year, or two years ago.

639
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.260
Christina Badura: Two years ago. Wow.

640
00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:44.730
Christina Badura: Yeah.

641
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:50.070
Katrina Groves: And so then he started saying it's okay to come around and see your kids.

642
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:56.460
Christina Badura: Yeah, he'd make like every three months. He'd say, the kids want to see you. I'd wait for him to call you know

643
00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.620
Christina Badura: And then my daughter. Sorry, I have like anxiety. I don't know if it's because I've never done.

644
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.850
Christina Badura: I feel like you're damn keep taking deep breaths.

645
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.520
Katrina Groves: It's just you and me, nobody else's here.

646
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.870
Katrina Groves: In my house.

647
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.790
Katrina Groves: I'm in my PJs underneath this

648
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:20.250
Katrina Groves: It's anxiety provoking to talk about it but it kind of helps go through the past and realize how far you come

649
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.220
Christina Badura: Yeah and now my daughter lives with me.

650
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.620
Katrina Groves: That's pretty amazing. And she's how old now.

651
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:28.530
Christina Badura: She's 17 it's not very amazing anymore.

652
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:30.720
Katrina Groves: Yeah 17 is a hard a

653
00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:31.980
Christina Badura: Hard, hard

654
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.010
Katrina Groves: Are they right around there where you feel like you can't talk.

655
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:45.840
Christina Badura: Yeah, I can't talk to her. Nothing ever matters, you know, show it says it doesn't matter, nothing matters. And then I annoy her so I don't even talk to her.

656
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:52.800
Christina Badura: It's been getting really bad. I feel like I don't even want to hear. I mean, it's really bad. She's really disrespectful.

657
00:49:54.990 --> 00:50:03.150
Christina Badura: She's at work right now. She just went to work. So she's got a job that's a good thing. Yeah, that's a good thing. I mean, of course, I want to hear, you know, but I just wanted

658
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:10.470
Christina Badura: To be happy. She's never happy. I could tell she doesn't want to be here. She's just here because she doesn't want to be there.

659
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:15.330
Katrina Groves: Right. She's having a hard time is she getting any counseling, you know, and

660
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:18.810
Christina Badura: You know she's it

661
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:23.100
Katrina Groves: It may be helpful to try to have somebody else.

662
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.210
Katrina Groves: I know I'm freezing on your screen. But can you still hear me.

663
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:29.520
Christina Badura: Oh, you can tell. Yeah, yeah, I just still hear you.

664
00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:34.560
Katrina Groves: I don't know. It's our connection but it's good. Maybe to have her come in and talk

665
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:42.150
Katrina Groves: identify with that age, and she may be starting to get into drugs, God forbid, so

666
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:44.580
Christina Badura: I know I worried about her smoking weed.

667
00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:46.230
Christina Badura: We can

668
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:54.570
Christina Badura: Be found him yeah some marijuana paraphernalia in the garbage. We didn't tell anybody right Jenna found it.

669
00:50:54.930 --> 00:51:01.200
Katrina Groves: I think it might be a good time to really, you know, set up a plan where you can sit down and just talk with her. Hey, you know,

670
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:10.560
Katrina Groves: She doesn't have to go to work. Soon, or are you guys don't have anything to do just a family day like on a Sunday or something and say hey you know just concerned about you and

671
00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:20.220
Katrina Groves: And I'm sure she has a lot of anger and grief and feelings like you abandoned her, but still. You're here now and you're her mom and you love her.

672
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:31.800
Katrina Groves: Yeah. Want to make sure that she doesn't go on that same path. So getting help for her to talk to somebody and for you to learn to help to talk to her. This

673
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:32.550
Is hard

674
00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:36.780
Katrina Groves: you dreamed about though, you're like, I want to see my kids.

675
00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:41.850
Christina Badura: For so long. Like it's crazy that it's came to this. Yeah.

676
00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.720
Katrina Groves: And now you're pregnant again.

677
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:47.880
Christina Badura: Yes, and

678
00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.110

679
00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.150
Katrina Groves: August

680
00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:59.940
Christina Badura: August 11. I can't believe you remember that I think it must be my internet connection because I'm way across the House.

681
00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.090
Christina Badura: In the Wi Fi is on the other side of the house.

682
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.110
Katrina Groves: Is there any way you can go over there. Is that going to be not private

683
00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.320
Christina Badura: There's a whole bunch of people that can babysit.

684
00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.300
Christina Badura: I try to go closer to the door, sit on the ground,

685
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.290
Katrina Groves: It's pretty good. As long as if you can hear me. And we just can't see each other as well.

686
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:31.020
Katrina Groves: Alright, so are you. Do you feel comfortable on your current Suboxone those. What are you taking

687
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:32.220
Christina Badura: You. I've been

688
00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:35.790
Christina Badura: Running right yeah I haven't taken two and a half.

689
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:45.510
Katrina Groves: So 1617 to 20 milligrams. Okay. And how do you feel with that. No cramping know badge, you know, bleeding. No.

690
00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:47.130
Christina Badura: No, not the

691
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.910
Christina Badura: Withdrawals know I feel fine. Okay.

692
00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.130
Katrina Groves: And how long you been doing the 20th

693
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.020
Probably

694
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:57.930
Christina Badura: almost a month. Okay.

695
00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:04.680
Katrina Groves: And so, yeah, it's only January so we can kind of go slower as fast as you want to.

696
00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:10.110
Katrina Groves: Do you feel like you're you want to stay on that a little while longer, or try to go down to

697
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:15.030
Katrina Groves: 16 or where do you feel like you want to be.

698
00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:17.670
Christina Badura: I think maybe a couple weeks. I don't know.

699
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:20.400
Christina Badura: I know by

700
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:25.440
Christina Badura: Three months, a couple days will be a full three months.

701
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.600
Christina Badura: Mm hmm. So

702
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:38.220
Christina Badura: I think maybe in a few weeks, cut down to maybe two. I want to at least be down to one, three months before I have to baby. Okay.

703
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:42.060
Katrina Groves: And that's a good role and I know last time you went down to four milligrams and

704
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:42.330
Katrina Groves: That was

705
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.480
Christina Badura: It.

706
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:43.980
Katrina Groves: For you. Right. It was really

707
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:44.850
Christina Badura: Really our

708
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:57.600
Katrina Groves: Baby came out perfect. Like, no problems. So, you know, maybe eight maybe six. We don't have to push you to four or maybe four would be easier this time because you've been through it and you know what to expect. So

709
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:01.410
Christina Badura: Yeah, I think clean longer this time last time I wasn't clean, very long.

710
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.070
Katrina Groves: Exactly. And you did amazing you had a lot of support.

711
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.000
Christina Badura: Yeah.

712
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.260
Katrina Groves: And so how is your

713
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:08.460
Husband.

714
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.290
Katrina Groves: How's your husband, Jake. Is he supportive still is he working

715
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.540
Christina Badura: Yeah, he's working. He works all the time.

716
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.940
Katrina Groves: Wow, so you don't see him a lot.

717
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.370
Christina Badura: Just in the afternoons and on the weekend.

718
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:25.050
Katrina Groves: Okay. And do you know he's staying clean and sober.

719
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:26.880
Christina Badura: Oh yeah, okay.

720
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:38.970
Katrina Groves: All right. Hang on. Here I got my list of stuff. We got to go through. Okay, so back to some nuts and bolts. Do you have any other medical issues.

721
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:47.640
Katrina Groves: Other diagnoses like high blood pressure, thyroid diabetes any other medical stuff that you have

722
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:54.750
Katrina Groves: No. Okay. And your medication you take, are you still are you taking Prozac still

723
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:06.360
Christina Badura: You just froze. I'm trying to stop taking that too. I'm down to 10 milligrams and I've been taking it like every other day. And yesterday, I finally skip two days.

724
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:16.200
Christina Badura: I don't know if I can go down to five milligrams, because I feel like I really need it. Like, I tried to stop taking it, but I'm really emotional everything that's going on, you know, I know it's not good for the baby.

725
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:22.890
Katrina Groves: Actually Prozac is one of the ones that the safest for pregnancy, the safest and you do not have to go off of it.

726
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:25.530
Christina Badura: Really, it won't mess the baby up at all.

727
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.910
Katrina Groves: Talk to the OB GYN yet. Or when is your OB appointment.

728
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:35.190
Christina Badura: It's on the fourth I already went, but they didn't say anything about the medicine. They didn't say anything about the Suboxone this time.

729
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:37.050
Katrina Groves: That's good. They're getting used to it.

730
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:37.410
Katrina Groves: We've had

731
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:38.880
Better pregnant.

732
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:51.690
Katrina Groves: But when you see your OB doctor, you say, Hey, I'm telling me how you're feeling because what we don't want your baby feels those emotions, too. So if you go really down on the Prozac and you're feeling anxious and depressed and

733
00:55:51.960 --> 00:56:02.490
Katrina Groves: Maybe even suicidal or maybe craving drugs that's going to be way worse for the baby, it's better to stay on it you know there are you could not be on a seizure medics and those would cause birth defects.

734
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:05.460
Christina Badura: You know, there's certain older, you can't be on

735
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:06.330
Christina Badura: But with

736
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:13.170
Katrina Groves: Prozac. We've had enough experience with pregnancy stay on the 10 milligrams every day. You know, it's fine.

737
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.460
Christina Badura: Early okay

738
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:18.870
Katrina Groves: Because it's it keeps you in a better state of mind and you're the

739
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:19.590
Best yeah

740
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:22.260
Christina Badura: It's been hard without it.

741
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:37.500
Katrina Groves: Okay, don't try to do that to yourself, I would work on the Suboxone more because that can give them more you know withdrawals that we don't want at birth, and the baby won't go with Charles on Prozac, because it just kind of eases out of your system. It's really long lasting.

742
00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:39.030
Christina Badura: At that

743
00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.640
Katrina Groves: Okay, so other meds, you don't have any

744
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:53.940
Katrina Groves: Any illnesses that you had in the past like gosh chicken pox or measles or you mean all that stuff.

745
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.680
Christina Badura: I don't know if I'm immune. I'm not sure if I ever had it. I don't think I have

746
00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:03.870
Katrina Groves: To do you still have reflex like heartburn.

747
00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:10.860
Christina Badura: No, not really tiny bit once in a while, not really, though. Okay, and

748
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:17.730
Christina Badura: You used to take. Oh, you have headaches. Do you still have headaches. Yeah, okay.

749
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.630
Katrina Groves: And how about insomnia still a problem.

750
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.380
Yeah.

751
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:25.050
Katrina Groves: And anxiety.

752
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:32.790
Katrina Groves: And back pain. That was an old thing is that better.

753
00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.970
Christina Badura: It's better. I think that was from using, you know, in the beginning.

754
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:41.970
Christina Badura: It hurts. Once a while but it's normal. I think for everybody to have little back pain.

755
00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.140
Exactly.

756
00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:45.840
Christina Badura: The same deal with it then.

757
00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:53.940
Katrina Groves: There you go. And in post traumatic stress. I know you've had trauma in the past where you were abused or had domestic violence issues.

758
00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.100
Christina Badura: I do find with that.

759
00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:58.020
Katrina Groves: You're doing okay now that you've got a

760
00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:59.610
Katrina Groves: Stable partner now.

761
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:06.090
Katrina Groves: What I said now that you're having a stable partner and the

762
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:06.510
Christina Badura: Yeah.

763
00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.340
Katrina Groves: PTSD isn't so bad.

764
00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:15.840
Katrina Groves: Any injuries. You've had Christina where you cut your wrist or hands or

765
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:21.420
Katrina Groves: Know any suicidal thoughts or risks in the past.

766
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:23.820
Or currently

767
00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:31.710
Christina Badura: I don't think so. The one time I was on Chantix I remember I was getting weird thoughts member I told about it.

768
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:35.340
Katrina Groves: Right, okay, we may want to put that on one of your allergy.

769
00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:38.130
Christina Badura: I've been wanting to take it again though.

770
00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:45.930
Christina Badura: You do, yeah. Because I've been thinking about it, you know, that was the time that I had been using. And I just came back to group. I was

771
00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:58.380
Christina Badura: Trying not to use. I was taking anxiety medicine. I was all messed up. That's when I ended up going to the mental behavioral health place that's some thinking that was probably a big part of what I was going through

772
00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:08.370
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I may not have been the Chantix at all. And that's what people are finding out that it's not so much the medication. It's the fact that when you stop smoking. Everything gets worse your anxiety here.

773
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:15.000
Katrina Groves: You know, it's like away. That's my it's an addiction. Yeah, yeah. So maybe you're still smoking.

774
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:17.370
Katrina Groves: Yes. Oh dear.

775
00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:18.300
Christina Badura: I know

776
00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.530
Katrina Groves: How much do you think

777
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:21.960
Christina Badura: Like five cigarettes a day.

778
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:35.220
Katrina Groves: Okay, try to smoke one puff and put them out or, you know, however, you can't cold turkey is fine, but that's really hard on the be I'd say that's worse than the Prozac or

779
00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.630
Christina Badura: Really, yeah.

780
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:46.110
Katrina Groves: Yeah, because it definitely can cause fetal brain changes and the nicotine is just not good for them so

781
00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.860
Christina Badura: If there's anyone

782
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:53.910
Katrina Groves: I know just stop. You know, I'd rather you go back up on the Prozac and quit the cigarettes. It'd be better for you.

783
00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.150
Katrina Groves: Really yeah and you can talk to your OB doctor maybe about patches.

784
01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:07.740
Katrina Groves: It's better to have the nicotine in your system rather than smoking all the chemicals and raping isn't better

785
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:09.420
Christina Badura: Okay.

786
01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.710
Katrina Groves: So she might want to put you on patches or GM or something.

787
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:18.990
Katrina Groves: Alcohol any cravings any alcohol use it all.

788
01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:19.440
Know,

789
01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:23.940
Katrina Groves: And are you you're not working right now. Right.

790
01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.080
Christina Badura: No, but

791
01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.340
Katrina Groves: You were working as a CNA you got your tongue.

792
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.250
Katrina Groves: Out a bit how you did that, when you were in recovery.

793
01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:35.760
Christina Badura: I love that. And I want to do it again.

794
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.960
Katrina Groves: You love working with old people, or just anybody

795
01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.680
Christina Badura: I like working with old people. I like this, helping people.

796
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:46.410
Christina Badura: And it was a lot of fun.

797
01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.000
Katrina Groves: I saw a picture of you and you're

798
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.000
Christina Badura: Still have that picture you gave

799
01:00:52.920 --> 01:01:01.350
Katrina Groves: That's a good one. So do you have any goals. I mean, long term goals after the baby. What, what kind of thoughts do you have yourself, did they go

800
01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:02.130
Christina Badura: On

801
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:11.640
Christina Badura: I don't know if I have to do college but Penny was saying that probably good to take couple college classes because I want to go work at the prison in like the office stuff that's what she did.

802
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.980
Katrina Groves: Uh huh. And who's penny.

803
01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:15.480
Christina Badura: That's Jake's mom.

804
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:16.500
Katrina Groves: Oh, okay.

805
01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:19.020
Katrina Groves: That would be a good goal.

806
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:19.890
Maybe, yeah.

807
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.950
Christina Badura: Yeah, and benefits. Yeah.

808
01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.700
Katrina Groves: And I know you've had a lot of self esteem issues in the past, not thinking that you could do it just not thinking, you can do it and

809
01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:41.640
Katrina Groves: I feel like the more you do the hopefully the better you're going to realize, no, I can do this. You know how much stuff you've done getting yourself clean twice over, you know,

810
01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.830
Katrina Groves: Yeah, having babies.

811
01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:44.670
Getting

812
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.590
Christina Badura: Done.

813
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.410
Christina Badura: I. You do, yeah.

814
01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:55.830
Christina Badura: I'm done. JAKE DOESN'T WANT ME TO GET FIXED. But I'm really thinking hard about it. I don't want to watch it. Okay.

815
01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.370
Katrina Groves: And any hospitalizations besides on the Jeff C sections for your births or

816
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:13.890
Christina Badura: No, because they were all natural. I was hospitalized once for I got Murcia, or something done on my butt cheek. They had to do a surgery. Okay.

817
01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.220
Katrina Groves: And yeah, you had the IUD before

818
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.670
Christina Badura: You have yeah I had it for years. I think a few years.

819
01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:28.950
Katrina Groves: So it might be good. Just put that back in again. That way it's not permanent. And, you know, in case you decide you want to have another one. You're only what

820
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.300
3035

821
01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:32.910
Katrina Groves: I wouldn't keep a copy

822
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:33.750
Katrina Groves: Of it.

823
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:34.740
Yeah.

824
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:49.590
Katrina Groves: And let's see surgeries. You didn't have any oh you had an abnormal Pap that time. Don't forget dysplasia. Are you have you told when you see your OB have to make sure to tell them that you have that abnormal Pap

825
01:02:50.520 --> 01:03:03.960
Christina Badura: I put that on my paperwork and I think he knows that because it's on the paperwork from last time, you know, they did one of the, what do they call it. What do you that surgery you do colposcopy and it was fine like it always is.

826
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:16.200
Christina Badura: Good. And so this doctor said that I don't. I didn't even have to have a pap this time for the OB. He said, I don't have to have a Colposcopy or a pap until after this baby's born sounds good, which is surprising.

827
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:26.190
Katrina Groves: It's just that. Yeah, they're not going to do anything about treating it unless until after the baby's born, so also the cigarettes. Remember one cigarette you

828
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.380
Katrina Groves: Know, you know, where does that go

829
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:29.370
Christina Badura: Down there.

830
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:31.050
Christina Badura: God

831
01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.870
Katrina Groves: Will never expose that yeah

832
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:35.430
Christina Badura: And oh my gosh

833
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:41.220
Katrina Groves: So that's your main focus. I think right now would be like after we're done. You're going to go have a cigarette. I just know it.

834
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:52.650
Katrina Groves: But it will really help your, your cervix fight that HPV. That's why that virus is coming back and you know I can turn to cancer. We don't want that.

835
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:53.400
No.

836
01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.110

924
01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:08.760
Katrina Groves: Somebody can look at that. Yeah, it may bring to me out.

925
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:18.360
Katrina Groves: I mean, your, your, your, your lymph nodes are trying really hard to keep your teeth under control. So they're probably going to be big and sore, at times, that's

926
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.230
Christina Badura: Probably

927
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:27.990
Katrina Groves: Trying to fight off infection. So moving down to your lungs. Do you have any trouble with all that smoking, you're doing with shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing.

928
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:36.810
Christina Badura: No I cough a tiny bit. A little bit. Not so much in works. I'm not smoking as much good. Yeah.

929
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.020
Katrina Groves: Do you have a puffer that you need. Do you ever feel like

930
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:43.020
Christina Badura: You know you can't capture, bro. Okay.

931
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:47.910
Katrina Groves: And heart any chest pain or pressure

932
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:50.130
Christina Badura: For a pillow.

933
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:54.870
Katrina Groves: And when you get anxiety. Do you get heart palpitations with anxiety.

934
01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:05.400
Christina Badura: I have something going on with my heart. I think maybe I'll have it checked when after have the baby what's going on and doing like a weird thumping for months now, it scares me.

935
01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:07.260
Katrina Groves: Is it just when you've been pregnant.

936
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.900
Christina Badura: No, it was before. Okay.

937
01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:14.640
Katrina Groves: And what is the thumping like is it just fast or slow or just big

938
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:23.190
Christina Badura: It's just big and it's like off. You know, it's not like the normal thump, thump, thump. I can really feel it almost like it's

939
01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:28.380
Christina Badura: Old down like Don't, don't, like, I don't know, it's weird it trips me out.

940
01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.370
Katrina Groves: Okay scares me. How long does it last Christina when that happens.

941
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.720
Christina Badura: Just a few seconds.

942
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:35.550
Katrina Groves: And how often does it happen.

943
01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:37.080
Christina Badura: pretty often.

944
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.250
Katrina Groves: Like every day.

945
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:40.740
Christina Badura: Not every day.

946
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:54.300
Christina Badura: Like I could go maybe a week without it happening. I forget about it and then it'll start happening. It'll happen a few different times throughout a few days and then it'll stop for a while. Watch your caffeine.

947
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.460
Katrina Groves: Intake Do you drink coffee lattes.

948
01:12:56.490 --> 01:12:58.290
Katrina Groves: mochas anything tea.

949
01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:02.100
Christina Badura: I drink one coffee in the morning. Okay, and

950
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:17.010
Katrina Groves: So, see if thats related. It may not be. But sometimes those palpitations happen more often, when you're doing anything that's like caffeinated or chocolate or things like that soda with cap with like Mountain Dew on my gosh, don't

951
01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:18.840
Christina Badura: drink soda at all.

952
01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:37.470
Katrina Groves: Okay, and what you can it. A lot of these are very benign. They're just little skipping beats like a spark plug in your car. So you could try to like massage your neck and see if you can get it to go down. Some people take a deep breath and

953
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.390
Katrina Groves: Push like that to try to stop the heartbeat from going real fast.

954
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:45.570
Christina Badura: Oh really. Okay, those are a couple things you can do.

955
01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:50.070
Katrina Groves: But again, that's another thing to put on your list for the OB Dr. Hope you're taking notes.

956
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:53.130
Christina Badura: I got off the bed.

957
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:54.750
Christina Badura: Well, I had a paper up there.

958
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:58.020
Katrina Groves: Go grab your paper I'm taking notes. I'll tell you at the end.

959
01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:05.190
Katrina Groves: But you don't have any swelling of your legs, though, right.

960
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.690
Christina Badura: No, no, swelling,

961
01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:11.640
Katrina Groves: Good, and you don't wake up in the middle of the night, short of breath or anything. No.

962
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:15.420
Katrina Groves: Good. So, so far for your OB. We have

963
01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:23.130
Katrina Groves: Check about the Prozac. Tell them you know you want to try and stay on it if you can. Because you feel better.

964
01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:24.690
Christina Badura: Boca

965
01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:30.960
Katrina Groves: Working on your tobacco trying to cut that down. If there's anything they can give you patches or gum.

966
01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:34.890
Katrina Groves: Making sure they know about your dental stuff.

967
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:41.010
Katrina Groves: And oh, then the nausea to unison. I don't know if I don't like that. I don't like that.

968
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:44.610
Katrina Groves: I know Andrew palpitations, that you're having

969
01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:51.690
Christina Badura: I don't like it either. But he said it was safe. Okay, I believe he might have lifted up. So it sounds

970
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.800
Katrina Groves: It looks like a Walmart kind of over the counter generic thing.

971
01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:57.000
Yeah.

972
01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:08.910
Katrina Groves: But you just want to check with your OB. All right. Where was I neck respiratory heart dermatology any change in your hair, like is it dry or or falling out or

973
01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:10.950
Christina Badura: No.

974
01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:15.450
Katrina Groves: Changes in your nails or their dinner or

975
01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:25.740
Katrina Groves: Is your skin dry or itchy know any new models that you've got worrisome models that have changed.

976
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:32.610
Katrina Groves: Big Black. Oh, okay. And your stomach. You already said you have nausea. Have you been vomiting to or just

977
01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:33.780
Christina Badura: You know,

978
01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.340
Katrina Groves: Have you tried ginger tea.

979
01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.930
Christina Badura: Yeah, I tried the tea.

980
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.950
Doesn't work for

981
01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.170
Tea and crackers.

982
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:43.320
Christina Badura: So no plans.

983
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.000
Katrina Groves: constipation or diarrhea.

984
01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:49.740
Christina Badura: Yeah, I've been constipated. I've noticed a difference now that I'm pregnant. Okay.

985
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:52.500
Katrina Groves: So the Suboxone to you.

986
01:15:52.530 --> 01:16:00.150
Katrina Groves: Can take a stool softener. All it does is put water in your gut, but it would be better to try to do vegetables and more fiber in your diet.

987
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.440
Katrina Groves: But I assume you haven't had any blood like when you threw up, you're not throwing up any blood

988
01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:08.220
Katrina Groves: And

989
01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:19.980
Katrina Groves: When you go to the bathroom. There's no black or red blood in your stool, you know, good and your belly is the abdominal pain like really bad pains in your belly.

990
01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:22.980
Christina Badura: You know, okay, I don't have any pains.

991
01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.660
Katrina Groves: And bladder. I assume you're paying a lot more now that you're

992
01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.190
Christina Badura: Pregnant, yes.

993
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:34.950
Katrina Groves: But any blood in there or burning when you pee like a bladder infection would be

994
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:36.570
Christina Badura: No. Okay.

995
01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:46.800
Katrina Groves: Keep hydrating. Maybe even a little cranberry juice every day. I always keeps the infections away. Okay, and then anything with your muscles.

996
01:16:48.720 --> 01:17:01.950
Katrina Groves: throughout your body. Any you said back pain, a little bit, but you don't have any trouble with your, your joints shoulders ankles. Elbows wrist tips beat nothing's bothering us pain. You're lucky.

997
01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:02.340
Know,

998
01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.380
Christina Badura: So far,

999
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:18.690
Katrina Groves: So no history of seizures. No vertigo dizziness numbness fainting no tremor. How about the headaches. You did you have headaches.

1000
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:19.800
Christina Badura: Yeah, I have headaches.

1001
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:22.770
Katrina Groves: And how are they pretty often or

1002
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:29.520
Christina Badura: Yeah, they're getting more now that I think I'm getting into my second trimester. Get them almost every day. Wow.

1003
01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:32.190
Katrina Groves: Talk to your OB about that right it on the list.

1004
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.910
Christina Badura: Okay.

1005
01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.850
Christina Badura: Did you can take Tylenol. Yeah.

1006
01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:36.480
Christina Badura: I think

1007
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:37.440
It was

1008
01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.410
Christina Badura: Yeah, I don't like to dig it every day.

1009
01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.320
Katrina Groves: You shouldn't. If you can find anything else to try not to take it too much.

1010
01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:53.850
Katrina Groves: And then are you having any the stress with so much. Poor baby all

1011
01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:10.020
Katrina Groves: The with your life and the stress of your daughter and everything, how much it's changed. Do you feel like you're depressed and sad to the point where you just don't want to function. You just want to land like stay in bed and close the doors and not go out

1012
01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:13.590
Christina Badura: I feel like that lately. Okay.

1013
01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.570
Katrina Groves: Is that when you started to drop your Prozac.

1014
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.290
Christina Badura: Yeah, I think that's a big part of it.

1015
01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:23.760
Katrina Groves: And your sleep is doing what

1016
01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:30.510
Christina Badura: I have a hard time sick when I wake up like every hour. Okay, that's what. Yeah.

1017
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:35.340

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.780
Christina Badura: No good.

1019
01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:42.810
Katrina Groves: Hopelessness worthlessness, that kind of stuff again that low self esteem coming back on yet.

1020
01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.390
Christina Badura: No, not since I've been with Jacob. It's different than being this letter.

1021
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:55.350
Christina Badura: You just put me down so much. It was horrible. Yeah, that was very domestic violence. Have you been in touch with Leonard

1022
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.740
Katrina Groves: At all.

1023
01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.570

1041
01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:32.190
Katrina Groves: Because you haven't been taking as many

1042

Katrina Groves: She's good. And so, Christina be and then I'll try to make it you know every four weeks if we can

1061
01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:49.350
Christina Badura: Okay.

1062
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:56.880
Katrina Groves: Just because you're pregnant and we're going to want to be taped bring you down a little and you also go to Tony's group, how often

1063
01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:04.140
Christina Badura: I still try to go as often as I can. I go to the three times a month. Okay.

1064
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.880
Good.

1065
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:18.480
Katrina Groves: You need your own especially right now with everybody wants you you know your daughter's got issues. And even though he's pushing away, which is normal teenage stuff she's still really wants to talk to her mom. She just doesn't want it.

1066
01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:21.630
Katrina Groves: Want to know that you know

1067
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:24.090
Christina Badura: She doesn't want we didn't know

1068
01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:30.360
Katrina Groves: Like having a cat. You know, it's like I'm independent I'm doing my own thing. I don't need you.

1069
01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:35.130
Katrina Groves: Yeah, really. She does. But I forget my point.

1070
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:45.390
Katrina Groves: You have to have your own time in the middle of the baby wanting stuff and Jacob wanting stuff and his mom wanting stuff and your daughter wanting stuff and everybody wants wants wants

1071
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:59.760
Katrina Groves: So for me, group time for you make it a priority, just to sit, you know, have a group once a month here with people, you know, and you know, Tony's group. So, don't, don't forget about that part that's going to be important.

1072
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.600
Christina Badura: Okay, yeah. Last week I told Tony in the group. I said, I don't want to leave.

1073
01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:20.730
Katrina Groves: You don't have to leave. This is just this is to make sure that your medication stay because if I, you know, when I get let go from open door. This is all you're going to have for meds and because I can't find another doctor there.

1074
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:21.150
Christina Badura: Yeah.

1075
01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:27.720
Katrina Groves: So this will help you know you can do this, but you also should still be Tony's I think it's great that you have the option to do both.

1076
01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:37.110
Katrina Groves: Okay. Okay, so you will just let me know when you need your meds and we will go from there. Let me see if there's anything else I'm missing.

1077
01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.310
Katrina Groves: Oh my goodness. Okay.

1078
01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.990
Katrina Groves: Pharmacy. We know what pharmacy, you're going to

1079
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:48.240
Christina Badura: Walgreens.

1080
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:49.860
Christina Badura: A Walgreens times Walmart.

1081
01:23:50.490 --> 01:23:51.660
Katrina Groves: Are there so

1082
01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.460
Christina Badura: Well great, please.

1083
01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:57.150
Katrina Groves: Try to pick one that way it's less confusing if you need a refill.

1084
01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.700
Christina Badura: Well, Walgreens had didn't have the medicine for like

1085
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.370
Christina Badura: A few weeks or month or something. So we all had to go over to Walmart. Okay, but

1086
01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.520
Katrina Groves: Your usual one if you get it you prefer Walgreens.

1087
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:10.110
Katrina Groves: Yeah, there may be times when you

1088
01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:10.980
Katrina Groves: Go back.

1089
01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:15.630
Katrina Groves: All right. And did they send you a urine screen yet from bright heart. Nope.

1090
01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.940
Christina Badura: I think about how they're doing that.

1091
01:24:19.230 --> 01:24:19.440
Katrina Groves: But

1092
01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:22.200
Katrina Groves: I'm sorry, I missed that you froze.

1093
01:24:23.610 --> 01:24:25.410
Christina Badura: I haven't got it so

1094
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:37.170
Katrina Groves: what they should be doing is mailing you out a urine cup and you hang on to it, it'll be in a sealed package so mail it to your house. I don't think it's like obvious like urine cup on the box.

1095
01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:37.740
Yeah.

1096
01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:46.170
Katrina Groves: But when you get that the new call the bright heart number and tell them that you've got it and they'll tell you. Okay, well,

1097
01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:58.620
Katrina Groves: They'll walk you through how to do it basically going in the bathroom coming out, showing them the urine you guys end up reading it together. So you can actually learn something for your CNA class it you can tell

1098
01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.120
Christina Badura: Like what lines mean

1099
01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:03.330
Katrina Groves: What else right there. Uh huh. It's on the top.

1100
01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:14.580
Katrina Groves: Yeah, everything that the so they read it with you and you know if you have a slip up or something. It's like, just be honest and I mean I can't imagine you're going to be doing that. Do you still know what

1101
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.630
Katrina Groves: Are you using now. Okay, good. I'm like, good.

1102
01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:25.080
Katrina Groves: All right, so I think you are sad I

1103
01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.520
Katrina Groves: Can't think of anything else. What about

1104
01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:35.160
Katrina Groves: You do you have any questions or concerns or worries and how this is all going to work.

1105
01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:43.530
Christina Badura: Worry about it. I think everybody does everybody is worried about totally losing your job.

1106
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:51.780
Katrina Groves: I don't think she's gonna lose her job because the clinic wants to keep MIT going and that's why

1107
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:58.710
Katrina Groves: I'm grand fathering in you guys. But then there'll be new patients starting and I know, I know.

1108
01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:00.900
Katrina Groves: It's had a couple new people come in.

1109
01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:06.030
Christina Badura: But it seems somebody new a week ago or something. Mm hmm.

1110
01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:12.450
Katrina Groves: Yeah, we don't want to lose the program that is too important to this community and it can't all be on bright heart.

1111
01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:13.680
Christina Badura: Yeah.

1112
01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:18.000
Katrina Groves: It's got to be both. And I just love the fact that right now we're kind of doing it together.

1113
01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:28.830
Katrina Groves: So yeah problem and you're not, you know, figuring out bright heart. You can always call tell me who always have my number. So we're still we're still a team. I just missed you guys really bad.

01:26:58.950 --> 01:27:03.390
Katrina Groves: Walking around the house. It makes people Disney when you move around, you're like, oh yeah.

1122
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.380
Christina Badura: I need to get set up at a table or something.

1123
01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:16.140
Katrina Groves: Some people do it in their car. I mean they can't even talk in front of their partner because of whatever domestic violence issues so they can go in their car.

1124
01:27:18.210 --> 01:27:19.740
Katrina Groves: Any player to be

Katrina Groves: All right, let me continue with her.

1141
01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:15.870
Katrina Groves: Let's see, so she again as an established Mr patient with me at the ACM and the expert were reviewed prior I reviewed the cures report, and it was appropriate.

1142
01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:17.790
Katrina Groves: Um,

1143
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:25.080
Katrina Groves: I think you got all the history of how she started using that was all the API.

1144
01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:39.690
Katrina Groves: So psychological impressions or mini mental status suicide risk is none.

1145
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:42.420

1146
01:28:43.710 --> 01:28:44.430

1149
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:07.080
Katrina Groves: Was

1150

1152
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:19.050
Katrina Groves: Her mood somewhat anxious

1153
01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:29.040

Um, let's see if I forgot anything

1161
01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:31.170
Katrina Groves: No implantable devices, that's weird that pops up on the HP

1162
01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:40.590
Katrina Groves: That looks like her goals were to get back into some type of

1163
01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.540

Katrina Groves: Normal exam. I don't know if you guys have templates, you can do that, but

1175
01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:32.880
I would like to be able to just say that's a normal exam and then add anything that might be different for future clients.

1176
01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:38.010
If that's possible.

01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.080
And

1207
01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:32.190
Katrina Groves: So where are you in the process of right heart. Now, have you had your intake. Is this the last piece or where are you at

1208
01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:36.510
Bryan Collard: Doing all the paperwork and everything.

1209
01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:37.920
Bryan Collard: Well,

1210
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:44.490
Katrina Groves: You're kind of fading in and out here.

1211
01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:45.330
Yesterday,

1212
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:56.280
Bryan Collard: Or Thursday. So I'm the intake. Yeah, I got all the intake and stuff. So I think I just need to meet at the lab. I guess I gotta take labs.

1213
01:35:57.330 --> 01:36:00.660
Katrina Groves: Okay, and where did they tell you to go from labs.

1214
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:03.720
Bryan Collard: It'd be open door.

1215
01:36:04.230 --> 01:36:08.670
Katrina Groves: Good. They're getting that right so you have a primary care provider at Open door.

1216
01:36:09.450 --> 01:36:10.170
Bryan Collard: Dr. Peter

1217
01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.130
Good.

1218
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:18.450
Katrina Groves: Okay, because, first they were telling people to go to Senator and we're like, no, no, no, don't gotta set or just go to Denmark, so that's good.

1219
01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.730
Katrina Groves: And the lab work Brian is something that you want to do to check your liver periodically your kidneys, you know, with

1220
01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:35.790
Katrina Groves: All the damage people do to their bodies. It's good to have it done. I should have probably been doing it once a year, but at least you do it now and get a baseline where you're at.

1221
01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:43.350
Katrina Groves: Okay. Okay. Tell me about your prescription for Suboxone. Where are you at with that.

1222
01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.120
Bryan Collard: I have just over a week left on my script.

1223
01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:54.630
Katrina Groves: Do you have it with you. Do you have the date that it was filled, or is it close by. Okay.

1224
01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:00.180
Bryan Collard: It was

1225
01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:06.450
Bryan Collard: 110

1226
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:11.610
Katrina Groves: Okay, so you'll be out, like you said, in another week.

1227
01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:23.430
Katrina Groves: For the groups. This is like a history intake, you would have had to do this with another doctor and then see me. So this kind of saves you another step.

1228
01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:31.800
Katrina Groves: What we're doing today, but the next step will be group, which I'm doing Mondays at 530 till

1229
01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.490
Katrina Groves: 645, something like that.

1230
01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.400
Bryan Collard: Oh, they said 545 yeah

1231
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:51.150
Katrina Groves: 545 but you want to check in at 530 because they're going to do a brief addiction assessment every time. And they've got people to come in. So if you can make it earlier 530 years. That's fine. If not I 45

1232
01:37:52.530 --> 01:37:54.540
Katrina Groves: How does that work with your work schedule, Brian.

1233
01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:07.440
Bryan Collard: The way that the hours are right now with the time, it's fine. In the summertime or spring rather times can change so that could affect my my meeting schedule.

1234
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:11.550
Katrina Groves: Got it. Well, we will take care of that as we need to.

1235
01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:18.600
Katrina Groves: And so you're Suboxone dose you're taking eight milligrams three a day still

1236
01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.810
Katrina Groves: Yes. And how's that working for you.

1237
01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:23.220
Exploring

1238
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:26.340
Katrina Groves: Do you have cravings on it. Do you have

1239
01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:30.000
Katrina Groves: Constipation on it.

1240
01:38:32.010 --> 01:38:34.230
Bryan Collard: No, no, constipation,

1241
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:39.780
Bryan Collard: From urinating, though I told Dr. Cooper that

1242
01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.000
Bryan Collard: She said,

1243
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:44.310
Bryan Collard: I don't know if she

1244
01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:49.860
Bryan Collard: She gave me a paper to fill out and come back and meet with her, but

1245
01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:56.250
Bryan Collard: I don't know if she's just too busy or she just doesn't care what I told her about it.

1246
01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:03.480
Katrina Groves: And you're how old 40 now. So is it that your stream is your urine stream just dribbling.

1247
01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:04.350
Or

1248
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:06.540
Bryan Collard: Week.

1249
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.700
Katrina Groves: Very we did that, does that start, all of a sudden, or just progressively worse.

1250
01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.440
Bryan Collard: Aggressively

1251
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.910
Bryan Collard: Okay.

1252
01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:25.620
Katrina Groves: Yeah, that may be partly the medication, but it's possibly also that your prostates getting enlarged. So definitely make an appointment to

1253
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:29.610
Katrina Groves: get that checked out because that happens in men.

1254
01:39:32.370 --> 01:39:33.960
Katrina Groves: I'm just making some notes here.

1255
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:40.200
Katrina Groves: But as far as the Suboxone you feel like it's keeping you off the street drugs.

1256
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:42.480
Bryan Collard: Absolutely. Okay.

1257
01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:50.520
Katrina Groves: And just because you know the bright heart doesn't know about your history, I'm supposed to get a history I nice and might be good to help remind me to

1258
01:39:51.600 --> 01:40:01.020
Katrina Groves: How did your problems with substance abuse start. How old were you what you used, you know, kind of the whole whole summary here of

1259
01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:04.140
Katrina Groves: When did this all start with you.

1260
01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:09.210
Bryan Collard: I took my first bike it in at 20

1261
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:14.040
Katrina Groves: So you weren't a kid doing pot and less than 10 years older.

1262
01:40:14.610 --> 01:40:16.410
Bryan Collard: Yeah, you're not starting

1263
01:40:16.530 --> 01:40:17.070
Katrina Groves: On their

1264
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.480
Bryan Collard: Their young doing

1265
01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:24.570
Bryan Collard: My dad left and my mom started letting us smoke weed. I was 13

1266
01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:29.070
Bryan Collard: Wow 14 she started smoking meth with us.

1267
01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:33.030
Bryan Collard: And it progressed from there.

1268
01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:40.500
Bryan Collard: I've, you know, I've had periods of of sobriety from then until now.

1269
01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.680
Katrina Groves: How long will your periods of sobriety.

1270
01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.080
Bryan Collard: The first one was

1271
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:55.020
Bryan Collard: Want to say two and a half years. Second one was four and a half years. Great.

1272
01:40:59.010 --> 01:41:01.080
Bryan Collard: Is the third one here and I'm going on.

1273
01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.510
Bryan Collard: She didn't know

1274
01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:05.580
Bryan Collard: It three years.

1275
01:41:06.570 --> 01:41:17.490
Katrina Groves: Yeah, let's see, I think you started with us and well you started with us in December of 2017 but you said you were clean in July. Before you even came to the program.

1276
01:41:17.970 --> 01:41:18.780
Yep, July 3

1277
01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:24.300
Katrina Groves: July 3 so you're coming up on three years.

1278
01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:28.710
Katrina Groves: With each of those relapses can you

1279
01:41:30.690 --> 01:41:42.180
Katrina Groves: Do you know what started them. I mean, you were going along really good two and a half years, three and a half years and then something happened, what each of those times what happened that triggered you to get back into using

1280
01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.720
Bryan Collard: The first one I just

1281
01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.540
Bryan Collard: I was going through some pain and I went back to what was familiar

1282
01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:56.610
Katrina Groves: Physical pain or mental pain.

1283
01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:59.460
Bryan Collard: Mental. Okay, and what

1284
01:41:59.490 --> 01:42:00.600
Katrina Groves: What was that caused by

1285
01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.570
Bryan Collard: Lost my pastor

1286
01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:06.960
Bryan Collard: Like died. Yeah, he died.

1287
01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.290
Bryan Collard: Suddenly, and he was like a dad to me.

1288
01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:16.920
Bryan Collard: And then I moved my brother and with me, who had just gotten out of a group home.

1289
01:42:18.810 --> 01:42:22.980
Bryan Collard: Which was a big mistake my brother's always been toxic for me.

1290
01:42:24.090 --> 01:42:25.140
Bryan Collard: He's always been a trigger.

1291
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:29.790
Bryan Collard: In fact, he caused my second relapse.

1292
01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.140
Bryan Collard: Not him just being around him.

1293
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:37.200
Bryan Collard: He was a he was instrumental in it.

1294
01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:44.070
Katrina Groves: I like how you switch that around instead of blaming him you actually said, Oh, no, it was because I was around him. I liked how you

1295
01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:46.770
Katrina Groves: Kind of did that just now.

1296
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:50.340
Katrina Groves: So where is he now.

1297
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:54.420
Katrina Groves: He's in Bakersfield, and you don't have contact

1298
01:42:55.230 --> 01:42:56.370
Bryan Collard: No I don't talk to him.

1299
01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.290
Katrina Groves: Might be a good thing.

1300
01:42:59.670 --> 01:43:02.580
Katrina Groves: And the third relapse what what precipitated that

1301
01:43:06.150 --> 01:43:06.570
Bryan Collard: Pain.

1302
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:10.170
Bryan Collard: My wife was using

1303
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:14.820
Bryan Collard: And I just I Mr wanted to be around her.

1304
01:43:17.010 --> 01:43:24.300
Bryan Collard: was a bad idea at the time. I should have just distance myself from her, but who knows where I'd be today, but yeah.

1305
01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:24.900
True.

1306
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:31.380
Katrina Groves: So now she has stopped using. Yeah. As far as, you know,

1307
01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:34.770
Katrina Groves: Yes. Okay. And

1308
01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:44.520
Katrina Groves: So your drug of choice, though throughout all this with the math and the Norco and whatever. What was your, what do you think your drug of choice was

1309
01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:50.880
Bryan Collard: A mixture of mapping and opiates.

1310
01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:54.690
Katrina Groves: And what about the benzo is, where did that come into play.

1311
01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:03.840
Katrina Groves: And alcohol, actually, was that in between, like,

1312
01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:13.890
Katrina Groves: Trying to stay trying to stay off the harder stuff, thinking that the bends those and alcohol are kinda okay or. Yep.

1313
01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:15.930
Yep.

1314
01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:23.850
Bryan Collard: You guys got they came down pretty hard on me with the bends those and kind of gave me an ultimatum. And so I

1315
01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.520
Bryan Collard: I guess I I traded one for the other.

1316
01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:34.980
Bryan Collard: Which is what happened. Mm hmm.

1317
01:44:35.250 --> 01:44:38.430
Katrina Groves: Yeah. And so how much alcohol. Do you drink now.

1318
01:44:40.170 --> 01:44:41.340
Bryan Collard: A couple shots tonight.

1319
01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:47.190
Katrina Groves: It's about about what I remember you telling me before, is it more or less about the same.

1320
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:48.870
Bryan Collard: Sometimes more

1321
01:44:52.710 --> 01:44:53.700
Bryan Collard: I'm struggling with it.

1322
01:44:56.730 --> 01:45:09.690
Katrina Groves: So I remember it was partly because the grand. Okay, let me get this straight. Your son's wife. So your daughter in law was at the house with the grandkids and that was a bad situation.

1323
01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:23.910
Katrina Groves: So you used to drink, you told me because you get off work and you're like, so stressed out. You don't want to go home to that situation. So is the, is she gone now are the grandkids gone. What's the status. Yeah.

1324
01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.830
Bryan Collard: She moved out a couple of months ago.

1325
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.020
Bryan Collard: Though

1326
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:33.840
Bryan Collard: I was stuck between a rock and a hard place in that situation because I love my grandkids.

1327
01:45:34.290 --> 01:45:36.450
Bryan Collard: Yeah, and not having a mirrors.

1328
01:45:40.650 --> 01:45:44.820
Bryan Collard: less stressful but more painful. He's not having them around me like your

1329
01:45:44.850 --> 01:45:47.280
Bryan Collard: Heart, yeah, big time.

1330
01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:49.140
Bryan Collard: And

1331
01:45:49.230 --> 01:45:52.410
Katrina Groves: She let you see them. Can you go there and see them.

1332
01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:54.300
Bryan Collard: To share with her and see them.

1333
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:56.700
Katrina Groves: She won't let you bring them to your house.

1334
01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.480
Bryan Collard: Last night was the first night she let them come here and they're here now.

1335
01:46:01.110 --> 01:46:01.920
Katrina Groves: Wow.

1336
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:10.980
Katrina Groves: My son. Wow. So have you brought things together with your son because there's a while he wasn't talking to you. He was out of the house. He was mad right

1337
01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:11.910
Yeah.

1338
01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.750
Katrina Groves: So how is that relationship going

1339
01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:17.100
Bryan Collard: Or better

1340
01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:19.140
Good to hear

1341
01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:23.760
Katrina Groves: So, um, times when you feeling like

1342
01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:39.030
Katrina Groves: A little happier like this. Do you feel like maybe I don't need the shots tonight or I just want one, or do you think about maybe cutting down on your alcohol when you're when you're happier, or is it just a habit. Now that you've got to do it to not get sick.

1343
01:46:40.110 --> 01:46:41.040
Bryan Collard: No, it's

1344
01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:44.670
Bryan Collard: It's got to become a habit.

1345
01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:48.000
Bryan Collard: And I don't get sick. I mean, like, but

1346
01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:59.850
Bryan Collard: Yeah, I want to cut down whenever it's happier like this. I don't feel the need to want to don't like pain or anything like that, but I do a problem sleeping at night so

1347
01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:06.450
Katrina Groves: Right, so we should work on your sleep a little bit. Tell me about your sleep problem.

1348
01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.810
Bryan Collard: I just wake up a lot. I

1349
01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:11.460
Bryan Collard: Go to sleep, but

1350
01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:17.310
Bryan Collard: I gotta, I have a script for Bezos from my doctor

1351
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.810
Bryan Collard: Dr.

1352
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:24.690
Bryan Collard: Evil, which helps me to not drink like I don't really, I'm afraid to drink. Whenever I take those so

1353
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:29.190
Katrina Groves: Yeah, because they go right to the same receptor and you can stop breathing. So, yeah.

1354
01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:38.400
Katrina Groves: Did she try any other things for sleep. I'm sure over the Times melatonin Benadryl Tylenol PM.

1355
01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:51.990
Bryan Collard: One of those will work for a short while, I took melatonin for a couple months, but then they just stopped working it take a higher dose and then it works for a week and then it works for a couple of days and then right then just doesn't work.

1356
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:57.990
Katrina Groves: And so it looks like she's given you Klonopin, is that right clinic.

1357
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:00.690
Bryan Collard: No, it's

1358
01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:02.910
Bryan Collard: Not him.

1359
01:48:03.630 --> 01:48:04.950
Katrina Groves: Yeah, clonazepam

1360
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:13.710
Katrina Groves: Okay, and that's the two milligram dose and you're just taking it at night to sleep. Yeah, okay.

1361
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:17.370
Katrina Groves: Yeah, so there's

1362
01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:31.500
Katrina Groves: If you have a prescription for that. Then using alcohol, actually, people think it knocks them out but it puts you into this weird REM sleep, where you're not really getting deep down

1363
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:39.990
Katrina Groves: The alcohol actually makes sleep worse. So if you've got Klonopin to sleep, then maybe you can stop the alcohol.

1364
01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:55.110
Katrina Groves: Have you tried that where you are right now. Are you still taking your two shots plus your Klonopin

1365
01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:57.330
Bryan Collard: Yeah, let's take

1366
01:48:59.970 --> 01:49:00.480
Bryan Collard: Possession.

1367
01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:07.500
Katrina Groves: That's what I worry about is you're taking a benzo that's already like alcohol and then you're adding alcohol to it so

1368
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:14.520
Katrina Groves: We, you know, we got time to work on this, but I think it's something that

1369
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:22.320
Katrina Groves: You might want to examine is there alcoholism in your family fathers, brothers.

1370
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:26.640
Katrina Groves: Yeah, anybody die from alcohol.

1371
01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:28.500
Bryan Collard: No.

1372
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:41.400
Katrina Groves: So speaking of family history. I've got some things I have to get through. So, your mom is she living or I can't remember. Yeah.

1373
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:43.980
Katrina Groves: And does she have any medical problems.

1374
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:45.090
Bryan Collard: Oh, yeah.

1375
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:46.320
Katrina Groves: Oh boy, like

1376
01:49:47.490 --> 01:49:49.050
Katrina Groves: diabetes, high blood pressure,

1377
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:51.810
Bryan Collard: My mom was a hypochondriac.

1378
01:49:53.640 --> 01:50:03.030
Bryan Collard: So anytime I call her. She has an ailment. And as far as what her actual elements are can say okay

1379
01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:11.640
Bryan Collard: I really don't want to contact with the doctors. But, you know, just put someone think something's wrong with them doesn't mean that there is, you know,

1380
01:50:12.090 --> 01:50:13.170
Katrina Groves: Pro. So she's

1381
01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:20.160
Bryan Collard: Broken her arms, she's she had both her arms broken one time she was an abusive relationship.

1382
01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:28.050
Bryan Collard: She got rescued by some people took her in. She's clean sober now far as I know.

1383
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.830
Good.

1384
01:50:31.050 --> 01:50:32.580
Bryan Collard: First time in, like, ever.

1385
01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.770
Katrina Groves: Do you have contact with her.

1386
01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:37.530
Bryan Collard: I talked to her every now and then.

1387
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:39.690
Bryan Collard: She's a little bitter at me.

1388
01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:41.700
Katrina Groves: Was that

1389
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:53.460
Bryan Collard: Because I took my younger brothers, she left him with me for like a month one time and just went off on a party thing.

1390
01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:54.330
Katrina Groves: Yeah.

1391
01:50:54.780 --> 01:51:08.520
Bryan Collard: When she was gone. I went to the court to to guardianship of them. I didn't want to see that her smoking meth of them, they were they were the same age as we were when she started smoking meth with us. So it scared me.

1392
01:51:10.050 --> 01:51:10.620
Bryan Collard: on that road.

1393
01:51:11.070 --> 01:51:13.830
Katrina Groves: You did the right thing you were. How old were you at that point.

1394
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:16.410
Bryan Collard: 45

1395
01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:24.180
Katrina Groves: Yeah, it's pretty young, and yet you stood stood up to the plate and you're like being their father figure and took care of him and got him out of there so

1396
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:35.610
Katrina Groves: You know that for her to be bitter about that, that, that shows me that she doesn't have a lot of insight into her own behavior at the time when she was putting her kids at risk, you know,

1397
01:51:36.570 --> 01:51:41.790
Katrina Groves: So just know that you did the right thing whether or not, she'll be able to say hey Brian, I realized you

1398
01:51:42.810 --> 01:51:49.170
Katrina Groves: You were helping you're trying to help that may not come from her lips. But you know, that's the truth.

1399
01:51:54.450 --> 01:51:55.260
Katrina Groves: So any

1400
01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:58.200
Katrina Groves: Your father is he still living.

1401
01:51:59.970 --> 01:52:02.790
Bryan Collard: Yeah, yeah. My biological father

1402
01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:04.110
Katrina Groves: Uh huh. Yeah.

1403
01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:10.530
Katrina Groves: And what were his medical problems, substance use, as well, or any diabetes.

1404
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:13.500
Bryan Collard: Yeah, high blood pressure,

1405
01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:17.040
Bryan Collard: For sure, he just had a stroke. A few years ago.

1406
01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:18.780
What age.

1407
01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:20.730
Bryan Collard: Right.

1408
01:52:23.190 --> 01:52:24.120
Bryan Collard: Maybe 58

1409
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:26.790
Katrina Groves: Let's see the drinker.

1410
01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:33.570
Bryan Collard: Yeah, my dad was a drinker and a US speed. He's a truck driver so

1411
01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:35.880
Katrina Groves: Wow, they still working.

1412
01:52:36.570 --> 01:52:40.050
Bryan Collard: No, no, he's been retired for years. Okay.

1413
01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.500
Katrina Groves: And how's the relationship between you guys

1414
01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.180
Bryan Collard: We don't talk

1415
01:52:46.290 --> 01:52:46.890
Bryan Collard: Was he

1416
01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:49.500
Katrina Groves: abusive to you and the boys and your

1417
01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:53.460
Bryan Collard: He was abusive to my mother. Yeah.

1418
01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:02.100
Katrina Groves: And then siblings two brothers and you have a sister.

1419
01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.440
Bryan Collard: I have four sisters

1420
01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:13.770
Katrina Groves: For sisters. How can I forget that. Wow. And where are they all alive and well, or what they have substance abuse issues.

1421
01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:16.290
Bryan Collard: No, actually.

1422
01:53:18.630 --> 01:53:18.900
Bryan Collard: No.

1423
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:21.210
Bryan Collard: So,

1424
01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:27.870
Katrina Groves: It sounds like it went to the mail, like the the Y chromosome kind of gravitated to the males in your family.

1425
01:53:30.690 --> 01:53:31.830
Bryan Collard: YEAH. SORTA Yeah.

1426
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.080
Bryan Collard: never really thought about it.

1427
01:53:39.150 --> 01:53:40.800
Katrina Groves: Do you have contact with your sisters

1428
01:53:41.670 --> 01:53:42.090
I do

1429
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:48.480
Katrina Groves: And do they visit or do you guys get together.

1430
01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:51.180
Bryan Collard: No other don't don't a bigger school

1431
01:53:54.810 --> 01:53:59.190
Katrina Groves: And then are you still smoking cigarettes to Brian or no.

1432
01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:06.570
Bryan Collard: Yeah, I've been. I've cut down quite a bit. I've been actually babying instead of smoking. I don't know if it's any better, but

1433
01:54:07.170 --> 01:54:13.860
Katrina Groves: Yeah. We used to think it was. But now we realize no it really isn't. And then people blow up. And that's not a good thing.

1434
01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:16.770
Katrina Groves: But anything you can do to

1435
01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:32.280
Katrina Groves: You know you can't quit all substances at once. So you kind of have to make your choice you you've done really well on Suboxone i don't think i don't remember when the last time you had a relapse, or even if you did relapse. Yeah. In

1436
01:54:33.690 --> 01:54:47.460
Katrina Groves: Two and a half, almost three years now. So now it's time in your brain. Okay, what, what's the next thing I can deal with and maybe the alcohol and the benzo is is next. Maybe the smoking is next, you know, you got to kind of figure that out, where you feel your heart tells you

1437
01:54:48.630 --> 01:54:50.010
Bryan Collard: I just want to

1438
01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.400
Bryan Collard: I just quit smoking pot.

1439
01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:54.450
Katrina Groves: Oh, you did.

1440
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:55.230
Bryan Collard: Yeah.

1441
01:54:55.620 --> 01:55:02.100
Katrina Groves: Wow, that's huge, because that's an addiction, whether people know it or not that that's in your brain. Did you go through any withdrawals.

1442
01:55:03.210 --> 01:55:03.570
Bryan Collard: No.

1443
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:05.400
Bryan Collard: I didn't

1444
01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.220
Katrina Groves: So when were you using the pot.

1445
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:10.590
Bryan Collard: Daily

1446
01:55:11.010 --> 01:55:11.490
Wow.

1447
01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:13.320
Katrina Groves: During or

1448
01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:18.510
Bryan Collard: After we're not so much during work no gotta be sharp when I'm working

1449
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:23.820
Katrina Groves: Yeah, now you're working still at the at a construction site. What are you doing these days.

1450
01:55:24.570 --> 01:55:26.220
Bryan Collard: Oh, great. Okay.

1451
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:27.330
Katrina Groves: You like your job.

1452
01:55:28.410 --> 01:55:29.700
Bryan Collard: I do when I'm working

1453
01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.510
Bryan Collard: But then later. So I haven't worked all this week.

1454
01:55:34.590 --> 01:55:36.030
Katrina Groves: So it's not a very

1455
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:41.610
Katrina Groves: A job that's you don't always have confidence, you're going to work.

1456
01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:45.780
Bryan Collard: Well, and up until recently it's been very steady

1457
01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:50.370
Bryan Collard: Just in the last month or so it's it's been often

1458
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.660
Katrina Groves: Do you have a backup plan of what you might want to do

1459
01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.170
Bryan Collard: As far as I checked into the mill.

1460
01:55:58.770 --> 01:55:59.640
Bryan Collard: And Brookings but

1461
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:10.800
Bryan Collard: No, not, not so much. If, if I stayed a lid off too much longer. I gotta find something else. I can't keep drawing this unemployment doesn't doesn't help enough so

1462
01:56:11.250 --> 01:56:11.580
Right.

1463
01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:16.680
Katrina Groves: You've been pretty resourceful finding jobs. What other thoughts. Have you had

1464
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:20.130
Bryan Collard: Like I said,

1465
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.310
Bryan Collard: The mills definitely an option for me.

1466
01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:25.590
Bryan Collard: I like what I mostly

1467
01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:26.370
To

1468
01:56:27.630 --> 01:56:34.230
Bryan Collard: I need to go about getting hired there and not smoking the pot. Now I'm clean up the pot. So it's none of my system.

1469
01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:35.130
Good.

1470
01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:39.450
Bryan Collard: I just don't know. Phil, because the windows in my system.

1471
01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:41.010
Bryan Collard: I don't have to

1472
01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:43.440
Bryan Collard: Allow me, I mean I have a script.

1473
01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:45.120
Katrina Groves: Right.

1474
01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:51.150
Bryan Collard: So I don't know if they can tell me I can't remember system or where they would borrow me from being heard.

1475
01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:55.230
Katrina Groves: It might, but you've just got to be honest, because if they drug test you.

1476
01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:05.970
Katrina Groves: I guess it depends on how it affects you. And if you're taking it only in the nighttime that might be okay. You have to check with them.

1477
01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:14.430
Katrina Groves: Alright, so, tobacco, alcohol, you're living with Jana still your wife. Yeah.

1478
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:20.370
Katrina Groves: And that's going better, worse, aim, I know you guys have been in and out of it a lot.

1479
01:57:21.870 --> 01:57:26.910
Bryan Collard: Yeah, we, we still are you, but not that bad. Okay.

1480
01:57:27.930 --> 01:57:30.480
Katrina Groves: And she's clean and sober, as well as far as, you know,

1481
01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.340
Bryan Collard: Well Jen is drinking too, I think.

1482
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:44.220
Katrina Groves: So you guys are hiding something. I mean, alcohol is it's trying to escape. Just like a drug.

1483
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:48.930
Katrina Groves: So it'd be helpful to figure out why.

1484
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:51.810
Katrina Groves: And work on other ways of

1485
01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:55.920
Katrina Groves: Escaping rather than using other substances.

1486
01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:05.610
Katrina Groves: Like switching addictions. Were you ever in counseling, any way with Vinnie for a while and then it just kind of get out what happened with that.

1487
01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:07.290
Bryan Collard: To

1488
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:15.390
Bryan Collard: Be honest with you, I went in there one day and my insurance had lapsed temporarily

1489
01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:16.770
Bryan Collard: I remember the last

1490
01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:19.500
Bryan Collard: Two days before my appointment with him. Yeah, I told you about this.

1491
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:22.860
Bryan Collard: And I don't care to see if any anymore. Yeah.

1492
01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.240
Katrina Groves: Because he was all about the money.

1493
01:58:25.290 --> 01:58:33.090
Bryan Collard: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He didn't. And he made up some weak excuse of why that was all better and right and we go over anymore.

1494
01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:36.300
Bryan Collard: So Mike, okay, that's fine.

1495
01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:47.730
Katrina Groves: So, so, you know, you're going to be meeting a new counselor here on Mondays. Her name is Rebecca. Rebecca and she's on telemedicine to. She's really good.

1496
01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:50.250
Katrina Groves: She's been doing this for years.

1497
01:58:51.870 --> 01:59:00.480
Katrina Groves: She's one resource to do some one on one therapy if you want. Also, Glenn and not Glenn Greg and George, I think they're new

1498
01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:14.910

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:23.070
Bryan Collard: I was getting a lot of opiates given to me for my doctor

1514
02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:28.680
Bryan Collard: Was getting 115 articles, a month at first. So when it first happened, I was getting

1517
02:00:42.330 --> 02:00:46.530
Bryan Collard: they'd let me go to the pharmacy and pick up more pills, as I needed them. It was like

1518
02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:50.010
Bryan Collard: It was almost like I had pills on tap.

1519
02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:52.350
Katrina Groves: At the time, wow.

1520
02:00:52.740 --> 02:01:01.110

1524
02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:20.640
Katrina Groves: So then you had no choice but to get on the street. Did you go to heroin right away or

Bryan Collard: Not right away.

1526
02:01:24.690 --> 02:01:27.780

02:04:07.050 --> 02:04:08.700
Katrina Groves: Yep, better for your kidneys.

1567
02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:14.760

Katrina Groves: Like a panic attack.

1648
02:10:46.530 --> 02:10:48.870
Katrina Groves: Yeah, how often do those happen.

1649
02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:54.240
Bryan Collard: Not too often, knowing that they do happen sometimes. But

1650
02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:56.940
Katrina Groves: Like once a month or

1651
02:10:57.420 --> 02:10:58.440
Bryan Collard: Maybe something like that.

1652
02:10:59.970 --> 02:11:01.350
Katrina Groves: And then what do you do for those

1653
02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:04.530
Bryan Collard: Honestly,

1654
02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:06.660
Bryan Collard: Yeah medicate.

1655
02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:09.030
Katrina Groves: Yeah, with what alcohol.

1656
02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:17.820
Katrina Groves: So there's other medicines that Dr. Peter can give you to try to stop panic attacks. Have you ever tried any of them.

1657
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.900
Bryan Collard: Oh, no.

1658
02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:36.840
Katrina Groves: So there's like beta blockers, kind of like what you're already on for your blood pressure, you could take an extra one of those vitamin half and they can actually calm your heart rate down and take you out of an anxiety attack without having to drink.

1659
02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:40.650
Katrina Groves: Just an option to think about

1660
02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:49.170
Katrina Groves: Okay, where was I am any swelling in your legs or varicose veins know

1661
02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:57.450
Katrina Groves: Any trouble with your skin change in your nails dry skin itchy skin moles

1662
02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:01.590
Bryan Collard: Oh,

1663
02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:02.910
Bryan Collard: No.

1664
02:12:04.020 --> 02:12:06.240
Katrina Groves: Any loss of hair or

1665
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:12.690
Katrina Groves: Sometimes people get thyroid problems, they lose their hair and big patches.

1666
02:12:14.610 --> 02:12:17.880
Bryan Collard: Oh, nothing, nothing out of the ordinary. Okay, just that.

1667
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:19.200
Katrina Groves: Aging hairline. Right.

1668
02:12:19.650 --> 02:12:21.870
Bryan Collard: Yeah, unfortunately.

1669
02:12:23.130 --> 02:12:27.450
Katrina Groves: And how about stomach abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea,

1670
02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:30.930
Katrina Groves: No, nausea, vomiting,

1671
02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:32.250
No.

1672
02:12:33.930 --> 02:12:35.490
Katrina Groves: Ever have blood in your stool.

1673
02:12:36.330 --> 02:12:36.630
Bryan Collard: No.

1674
02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:37.590
Or black

1675
02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:48.060
Katrina Groves: Okay, watch for that because if you drink, and do you take the IV, you said you take some kind of anti inflammatory. Oh, you're back on Tylenol.

1676
02:12:48.090 --> 02:12:48.840
Bryan Collard: Just a minute.

1677
02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:50.820
Bryan Collard: Yeah.

1678
02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:54.390
Katrina Groves: That's probably better on your liver, but

1679
02:12:55.590 --> 02:12:56.010
Katrina Groves: Also

1680
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.630
Katrina Groves: Huh.

1681
02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:02.610
Bryan Collard: Oh no, I don't take that every day, either. Good.

1682
02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:15.750
Katrina Groves: So then back to your urine problem. You said you were having trouble with the urine stream and is it like you can't get it started, or it starts fine it just dribbles and takes forever.

1683
02:13:17.250 --> 02:13:17.610
Bryan Collard: Yeah.

1684
02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:19.410
Okay.

1685
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:25.560
Katrina Groves: And do you know anything about your family history of prostate like was a prostate cancer in the family.

1686
02:13:26.850 --> 02:13:28.170
Bryan Collard: No. Okay.

1687
02:13:28.650 --> 02:13:33.750
Katrina Groves: I mean you most likely just have enlarged prostate at your 40 so

1688
02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:36.240
Katrina Groves: Bit young

1689
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:46.950
Katrina Groves: Also medications can do that too. Like Suboxone might be keeping your urine stream down. What's your sexual function on this box on have you noticed problems with it.

1690
02:13:48.450 --> 02:13:51.630
Katrina Groves: Not being able to have sex, not been able to get a reaction.

1691
02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:58.500
Bryan Collard: It's kind of a personal way. My wife, my wife doesn't even have sex with me.

1692
02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:01.140
Bryan Collard: I will

1693
02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:04.560
Bryan Collard: Get her you

1694
02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:08.910
Bryan Collard: So I wish you would with and I don't think I have a problem.

1695
02:14:10.290 --> 02:14:14.250
Katrina Groves: So you're going outside the marriage. I mean, this is confidential. Nobody's known about this.

1696
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:16.140
Bryan Collard: Wow, that's

1697
02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:19.620
Katrina Groves: Good for you.

1698
02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:20.520
Bryan Collard: I'm not

1699
02:14:23.550 --> 02:14:27.000
Bryan Collard: Yeah, it's frustrating but no I have not been doing that.

1700
02:14:29.190 --> 02:14:35.850
Katrina Groves: Do you think that the relationship. I mean, it used to be good, right, you guys used to have a good, healthy sex drive sex relationship.

1701
02:14:40.170 --> 02:14:42.840
Katrina Groves: Something you're trying to work on maybe with her just

1702
02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:48.000
Katrina Groves: I wonder what her motivation is for not wanting to be close to you.

1703
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:51.630
Bryan Collard: I don't know. I wish I do

1704
02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:56.310
Katrina Groves: She hasn't talked about it. You haven't sat down, talk about it.

1705
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:59.760
Bryan Collard: She, she pushes me away so much

1706
02:15:01.650 --> 02:15:09.690
Bryan Collard: She just changes the subject or raises or the the tone of her voice will start to go high, and I can feel an argument coming

1707
02:15:10.050 --> 02:15:10.500
Katrina Groves: Right.

1708
02:15:10.590 --> 02:15:18.000
Bryan Collard: The next thing I know, we're arguing and she's, she's turned a corner, you know, we're arguing about something else. And I'm like,

1709
02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:19.800
Bryan Collard: Ever

1710
02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:21.570
Yeah.

1711
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:26.340
Bryan Collard: It's like impossible to try to talk to her about something is bothering me.

1712
02:15:28.230 --> 02:15:30.390
Bryan Collard: Unless it's bothering her to directly

1713
02:15:31.650 --> 02:15:32.730
Bryan Collard: She doesn't want to deal with it.

1714
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:38.250
Yeah, that's hard.

1715
02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:45.690
Katrina Groves: marital counseling does help. I just don't know if you both would be able to to do that.

1716
02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.320
Katrina Groves: Alright so Matt back to musculoskeletal. Do you have any

1717
02:15:56.550 --> 02:16:00.840
Katrina Groves: tender spots, muscle pain, weakness, any place in your body.

1718
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:02.400
Bryan Collard: No.

1719
02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:06.270
Katrina Groves: You just work construction all day and you're Superman and nothing bothers you.

1720
02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:10.920
Bryan Collard: Or bothers me sometimes. Okay.

1721
02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:15.570
Katrina Groves: But you're getting through it and that's good because pain is a trigger for using

1722
02:16:17.190 --> 02:16:24.750
Katrina Groves: neurologically you don't have any seizures vertigo numbness tremors of anything.

1723
02:16:26.130 --> 02:16:26.610
Katrina Groves: Headache

1724
02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:33.300
Katrina Groves: No, headaches, no easy bruising or anemia.

1725
02:16:34.170 --> 02:16:34.500
No.

1726
02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:37.680
Katrina Groves: And then mood mood changes.

1727
02:16:39.450 --> 02:16:43.860
Katrina Groves: Have you had any, you know, ups and downs with your moods like bipolar.

1728
02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:49.470
Bryan Collard: Actually like yesterday I woke up feeling really really blue

1729
02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:51.990
Bryan Collard: Bar just never out of it.

1730
02:16:53.370 --> 02:16:53.580
Katrina Groves: Hmm.

1731
02:16:55.350 --> 02:16:58.200
Katrina Groves: So do you think thats related to not working.

1732
02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:06.210
Bryan Collard: I think maybe part of it, but as very small part of it.

1733
02:17:07.290 --> 02:17:08.460
Bryan Collard: Were related to my faith.

1734
02:17:11.250 --> 02:17:12.000
Katrina Groves: About what

1735
02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:13.590
Is

1736
02:17:17.430 --> 02:17:19.410
Bryan Collard: I know I feel like I need to get closer to God.

1737
02:17:22.830 --> 02:17:23.880
Bryan Collard: I know he can heal me

1738
02:17:25.650 --> 02:17:30.120
Katrina Groves: How about, have you thought about doing that. What would be a step that you can take to get closer.

1739
02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:34.440
Bryan Collard: Go to church.

1740
02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:37.290
Katrina Groves: Do you have one that you like.

1741
02:17:38.430 --> 02:17:42.330
Bryan Collard: Yeah, but it's hard to go. I don't know why it's so hard for me to go

1742
02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:47.520
Katrina Groves: Different feel like you're embarrassed or ashamed. Like, I shouldn't be there.

1743
02:17:48.210 --> 02:17:48.660
Yeah.

1744
02:17:51.600 --> 02:18:04.200
Katrina Groves: Even though you know that God is like non judging and wants to heal and has taken all kinds of people that have drug problems and all the sins and everything. I mean,

1745
02:18:07.590 --> 02:18:08.820
Katrina Groves: It sounds like it might help you

1746
02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:16.590
Katrina Groves: Losing that priest, I think as your father figure was huge, right.

1747
02:18:17.940 --> 02:18:18.240
Bryan Collard: Yeah.

1748
02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:21.270
Katrina Groves: So I'm wondering if part of this is because

1749
02:18:23.130 --> 02:18:30.720
Katrina Groves: You get afraid of my and if I get connected to another priest, are they going to leave me, are they going to die or they're not going to. So it's probably more than just

1750
02:18:31.140 --> 02:18:39.720
Katrina Groves: The fear of the shame and stuff. It sounds more like maybe fear of connecting with something that you might lose as that sound.

1751
02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:44.460
Bryan Collard: I don't know, just like

1752
02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:49.050
Bryan Collard: I've been

1753
02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:55.260
Bryan Collard: I was going to that church and I was clean and I wasn't even smoking cigarettes. I was

1754
02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:59.010
Bryan Collard: I was actually like serving God, you know,

1755
02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:04.020
Bryan Collard: And then I go back in there. And now I smell like smoke.

1756
02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:09.090
Bryan Collard: And I drink at night and I just feel like a

1757
02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:11.130
Bryan Collard: Small town.

1758
02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:15.210
Bryan Collard: I just feel like all bunch of eyes are on me.

1759
02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.650
Bryan Collard: I don't know.

1760
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:26.190
Katrina Groves: Do you think eyes are really on you or you just feel like you're, you know, you're not being as pure as you could be maybe eyes are on yourself.

1761
02:19:27.390 --> 02:19:27.750
Bryan Collard: Yeah.

1762
02:19:31.350 --> 02:19:31.710
Bryan Collard: Yeah.

1763
02:19:35.550 --> 02:19:50.370
Katrina Groves: Would a different church help or do you want to, you know, I think that would be really important for you because I hear I hear the depression I hear the anxiety. I mean, you, you got you got some stable clean time under your belt.

1764
02:19:51.660 --> 02:20:03.330
Katrina Groves: But also I know that between two and four years is when you've had relapses in the past and maybe the stuff that's coming up in your heart. If you and your soul and your faith.

1765
02:20:04.530 --> 02:20:08.610
Katrina Groves: To connect with that might help you avoid that for your relapse, you know,

1766
02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:19.320
Katrina Groves: Do you think a different church would be better to try, or like Papa John's. I heard his is really good, or

1767
02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:29.790
Katrina Groves: Like where you're nobody knows you, or what do you what kind of steps, could you take because tomorrow Sunday. I'd like to give you homework.

1768
02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:34.290
Katrina Groves: You're not work, and he got no excuses.

1769
02:20:35.730 --> 02:20:40.320
Katrina Groves: Go in and you know God on your side can really help.

1770
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.930
Bryan Collard: Hello.

02:20:46.470 --> 02:20:47.190

1772
02:20:48.810 --> 02:21:02.910
Katrina Groves: You bet. So, so what do you think about tomorrow, what, what could you do tomorrow to just go and lay bare your soul and say, hey, I've been. I've been missing you, I need to come back, please help me. That's all you gotta do.

1773
02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:11.190
Yeah.

Katrina Groves: And I

1799
02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:37.500
Katrina Groves: Think that's about it.

1800
02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:47.190
Katrina Groves: Have you did. I asked you about suicidal thoughts with your depression. Are you feeling like you want it. Okay, good.

1801
02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:51.180
Katrina Groves: Good. Have you gotten any

1802
02:23:52.530 --> 02:23:55.290
Katrina Groves: Urine P cup from bright heart yet mailed to you.

1803
02:23:55.890 --> 02:24:04.020
Katrina Groves: Know, so they eventually will do that. You might even have to ask for him, but they'll mail it to your house and it's in a closed package.

1804
02:24:04.290 --> 02:24:10.980
Katrina Groves: When you get it, you just call him up when it's convenient for you and say, Hey, I gotta pee test and they will help you

1805
02:24:11.430 --> 02:24:25.440
Katrina Groves: Go through it. You basically go to the bathroom without your phone, you come back you show them the P and you kind of read it together and and they say, Hey, it looks like you're using some marijuana. Yeah, you know, just, it's not a punitive thing. It's more like

1806
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:35.880
Katrina Groves: An accountability thing and to help you stay clean and sober. I don't think they check for alcohol. I don't know. But that's important to talk about

1807
02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:45.090
Katrina Groves: So the labs are going to get it done or the urine. They're going to want you to get probably before group.

1808
02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:51.420
Katrina Groves: You're going to talk to Dr Keeter about your prostate, a little bit more

1809
02:24:56.580 --> 02:25:03.060
Katrina Groves: Are you still working on your cars. I remember you're good at fixing cars like as a hobby or was that just something you do

1810
02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:06.060
Bryan Collard: Yeah, I just don't mind if I have to.

1811
02:25:07.170 --> 02:25:13.020
Katrina Groves: So what are your goals like what, what do you see yourself in this next year. What kind of goals do you have for yourself.

1812
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:24.510
Bryan Collard: Evan said Jim and he goes, I want, I want to save some money and buy my wife a car.

1813
02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:31.020
Bryan Collard: She wrecked the car that we just bought. Yeah.

1814
02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:33.540
Katrina Groves: So why do you think she is another one.

1815
02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:37.740
Bryan Collard: Yeah, he's got to get to work.

1816
02:25:38.850 --> 02:25:41.820
Bryan Collard: Where she working. He's working at the Dollar Tree.

1817
02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:45.000
Katrina Groves: How far is that from where you live.

1818
02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:48.150
Bryan Collard: So few miles.

1819
02:25:48.690 --> 02:25:49.350
Katrina Groves: Okay.

1820
02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:56.520
Bryan Collard: We're live at the end of Pebble Beach and that's in town. So yeah, we do it for miles.

1821
02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:58.740
Katrina Groves: Nothing she can walk them.

1822
02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:00.870
Bryan Collard: No, no, no.

1823
02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:01.980
Katrina Groves: No bus.

1824
02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:04.800
Bryan Collard: There was no bus, it comes out here.

1825
02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:09.210
Katrina Groves: You're on the river on the ocean and close to the ocean.

1826
02:26:09.780 --> 02:26:12.180
Bryan Collard: Yeah, we're one block in the ocean.

1827
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:18.540
Katrina Groves: Do you use that as a way of coping skill, like when you're stressed out, David, go and stand and look at the ocean.

1828
02:26:19.410 --> 02:26:19.800
Yeah.

1829
02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:27.060
Bryan Collard: Yeah, we sometimes when we argue I I'll leave and I'll go to the beach.

1830
02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:28.950
That's great.

1831
02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:38.940
Katrina Groves: And I hope you're, you're going to buy like a just a used car not going for these giant $20,000 hybrid things

1832
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:41.310
Though good

1833
02:26:43.410 --> 02:26:44.010
Katrina Groves: All right.

1834
02:26:48.450 --> 02:26:54.390
Katrina Groves: Yeah, so, and I don't hear goals for yourself, though, you said you want to buy your wife a car.

1835
02:26:55.590 --> 02:27:00.570
Katrina Groves: Maybe I hear one goal, maybe trying to get back into your faith. Would that be reasonable or

1836
02:27:01.530 --> 02:27:02.850
Bryan Collard: Yeah. OK.

1837
02:27:04.530 --> 02:27:06.450
Katrina Groves: And keep on staying clean

1838
02:27:08.730 --> 02:27:09.630
Bryan Collard: Yeah, definitely.

1839
02:27:11.820 --> 02:27:18.030
Katrina Groves: So do you have any questions for me that have come up while we've been talking because our time is about up

1840
02:27:19.050 --> 02:27:19.440
Bryan Collard: Know,

1841
02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:24.000
Bryan Collard: Have you been

1842
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:33.270
Katrina Groves: Kind of stressed, you know, my dad is actually with my sister right now. So that's helpful.

1843
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:44.070
Katrina Groves: We're kind of doing six months with him. Six months with her in six months with me so that allows me time to get this other job up and running and

1844
02:27:44.970 --> 02:27:54.870
Katrina Groves: Bright heart has all different systems. So going back and forth, California, Oregon, don't see my husband, but every other week kind of nuts, but

1845
02:27:56.010 --> 02:27:58.860
Katrina Groves: You know, let's choose what we're choosing to do so.

1846
02:28:00.210 --> 02:28:04.920
Katrina Groves: I'm just happy that I am connecting with you guys again and having you

1847
02:28:06.030 --> 02:28:17.880
Katrina Groves: Transition over here. I know it's stressful anxiety provoking to change, but I'm this way it helps you guys keep your medication. I feel good about that.

1848
02:28:19.470 --> 02:28:20.610
Bryan Collard: I'm glad you're here too.

1849
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:25.950
Bryan Collard: Good a wonder I'm glad you chose this is

1850
02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:31.380
Bryan Collard: I can't see. I don't want, I don't want, I didn't want another doctor

1851
02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:35.490
Katrina Groves: That's nice. Yeah, I don't want other patients.

1852
02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:36.540
Bryan Collard: And I love you.

1853
02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:44.790
Bryan Collard: Know like you're an awesome. Doctor, thank you actually care and that's a rarity these days.

1854
02:28:45.900 --> 02:28:46.230
Yeah.

1855
02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:57.510
Katrina Groves: Well, I love what I do. So this will be my retirement thing I can do this anywhere if I'm all crippled up I could still do this when I'm 90. You know, I don't have to be in the office.

1856
02:28:59.310 --> 02:28:59.640
Bryan Collard: Yeah.

1857
02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.350
Katrina Groves: Well, that's kind of my goal.

1858
02:29:02.730 --> 02:29:13.380
Katrina Groves: But yeah, you guys are you guys are my heroes, because I've never done anything as hard as what you guys are doing which is recovery and I want you to remember that every day because you have

1859
02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:25.050
Katrina Groves: You have a genetic disorder in your brain, it's a disease that's constantly on you, and most people can't make it this far. So you

1860
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:32.160
Katrina Groves: You've got that drive. And I think that you should be really proud of yourself the way you've been

1861
02:29:33.690 --> 02:29:37.530
Katrina Groves: Been doing with all your stressors, so keep it going.

1862
02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:40.410
Bryan Collard: Thanks, welcome.

1863
02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:46.470
Katrina Groves: And I will see you on Monday at 545 or 530 ish

02:29:47.490 --> 02:29:48.570
Katrina Groves: And we'll go from there.

1865
02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:50.100
Bryan Collard: Okay.

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:55.710
Katrina Groves: You have a good weekend. And hey, go, I want to ask you homework, go to church. Tell me about it.

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:04.470
Katrina Groves: You can go ahead and hang up and I'll see you then.

1871
02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:05.850

Katrina Groves: naproxen just upset stomach.

1878
02:30:58.170 --> 02:31:07.800

1891
02:32:55.890 --> 02:32:56.910
Katrina Groves: Or should I say

1892
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:01.440

Katrina Groves: Did not show full expression of feelings.

1895

Katrina Groves: And he did appear well groomed and stated is a start.

1896
02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:17.340
Katrina Groves: Appeared

1897
02:33:18.810 --> 02:33:35.670
Katrina Groves: As his state of age normal body habitus perhaps a bit of weight gain, since I'm seeing him last his speech was because of the zoom recording it was hard to tell but rate volume and coherence seemed normal thought processes seemed linear and logical

Katrina Groves: No auditory visual hallucinations or delusions were noted during the visit.

1900
02:33:47.970 --> 02:33:57.030
Katrina Groves: Insight judgment and self reflection intact but difficult to tell what he's feeling as he does not have a lot of trust and

1901
02:33:58.140 --> 02:34:00.120
Katrina Groves: does not like to talk about

1902
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:04.830
Katrina Groves: himself or his personal issues.

1903
02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:12.840
Katrina Groves: Other diagnosis, as you've got with hypertension.

1904
02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:28.560
Katrina Groves: implantable devices, none. We did his family social history, you get a full review systems at least 10 points 12345678 yeah I did way more than I needed.

1905
02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:37.860
Katrina Groves: So diagnosis is F 11.21 opioid dependence in remission.

1906
02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:44.670
Katrina Groves: And number two is anxiety and occasional panic attacks.

1907
02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:47.340
Katrina Groves: I have the numbers.

1908
02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:53.460
Katrina Groves: The ICD 10 codes for those

1909
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:58.170
Katrina Groves: Anxiety is F 41.9

1910
02:35:03.570 --> 02:35:04.110
Katrina Groves: Also

1911
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:08.430
Katrina Groves: Dysfunctional alcohol uses F 10.10

1912
02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:20.520
Katrina Groves: Some Post Traumatic Stress Disorder 43.10 from past abandonment and family issues.

1913
02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:24.720
Katrina Groves: History of methamphetamine abuse in remission.

1914
02:35:34.290 --> 02:35:35.790
Katrina Groves: So under the plan.

1915
02:35:38.730 --> 02:35:42.360
Katrina Groves: Recommended he follow up with this premier care doctor, Dr. Peter

1916
02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:45.750
Katrina Groves: To talk about his

1917
02:35:46.980 --> 02:35:50.250
Katrina Groves: Process possible BPH prostate disorder.

1918
02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:59.220
Katrina Groves: Discussed going back to his faith.

1919
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:01.950
Katrina Groves: As one of his

1920
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.680
Katrina Groves: Goals.

1921
02:36:07.170 --> 02:36:08.940
Katrina Groves: Oh, insomnia is another

1922
02:36:10.350 --> 02:36:13.080
Katrina Groves: Problem to put under his problem list. He

1923
02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:22.920
Katrina Groves: Is advised to cut down the alcohol, especially with benzodiazepines. This is very high risk for respiratory depression.

1924
02:36:26.430 --> 02:36:29.010
Katrina Groves: He will follow up with me on Monday, the

1925
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:38.010
Katrina Groves: Third of February for group at 545 with Rebecca Evans, as the therapist.

1926
02:36:39.330 --> 02:36:40.020
Katrina Groves: And

1927
02:36:44.730 --> 02:36:47.100
Katrina Groves: Sounds like he might need his refill.

1928
02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:50.130
That week

1929
02:36:54.750 --> 02:37:02.490
Katrina Groves: Again risks of alcohol and benzodiazepines, as well as Suboxone are quite high and would encourage him to taper down

1930
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.950
Katrina Groves: Slowly

1931
02:37:08.340 --> 02:37:12.660
Katrina Groves: And probably on the alcohol. First, consider

1932
02:37:21.900 --> 02:37:22.980
Katrina Groves: Or an abuse.

1933
02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:25.560
Or a future session.

1934
02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:34.920
Katrina Groves: Depression, as part of his diagnosis to be their

1935
02:37:36.690 --> 02:37:38.340
Katrina Groves: Depression, anxiety and panic.

1936
02:37:42.690 --> 02:37:50.670
Katrina Groves: Alright. So that seems like it. I've done my three dictation. Thank you for all your attention and

1937
02:37:52.650 --> 02:38:02.850
Katrina Groves: Hoping I'm making these HMP a little easier to transcribe and I appreciate any feedback. Again, thanks, bye bye you guys all have a good day.
