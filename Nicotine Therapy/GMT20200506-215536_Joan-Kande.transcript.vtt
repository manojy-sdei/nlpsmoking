Joan Kandel: I'm going to set to recording. Okay, well that Trevor in

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.570
Joan Kandel: Well, let me just tell you a little bit about Trevor, so he was in the program.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.450
Joan Kandel: For a while I think he saw yes he saw the embryos.

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.619
Joan Kandel: Gabriel girls.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.270
Joan Kandel: And

6
00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:30.720
Joan Kandel: And then he, I don't know how long he was in the program he relapsed and he just was recently in an inpatient place in Texas found it very helpful. And now he's back again.

7
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.200
Joan Kandel: And then Gary is the one from Arizona.

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.080
Joan Kandel: He's really nice guy.

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:55.350
Joan Kandel: And Ella. I just did her intake yesterday she is 12 weeks pregnant and she's young and struggling and hopefully she'll do very well in the program.

11
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To Angelina, she can get me scheduled to do Trevor and Ellis is

12
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.570
Joan Kandel: Awesome. So you can look and see Trevor may have been a bio psychosocial from not too long ago, but I don't know.

13
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.230
Okay.

14
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so

15
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.050
Joan Kandel: I don't know to those

16
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.240
Joan Kandel: Like if they've had one of those, then they don't need another one.

17
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They leave and they come back, we do like a refresher.

18
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, perfect. You can update the previous shoe.

19
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.120
Joan Kandel: Perfect.

20
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.030
Joan Kandel: All right, I'm gonna let Trevor in

21
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.690
Okay.

22
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.430
Joan Kandel: Hey, Trevor.

23
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.500
Hey there.

24
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.160
Joan Kandel: You made it. Good to see you.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.170
Trevor Burger: Yes, ma'am. How are you all

26
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.580
Joan Kandel: Good, Trevor. This is Jessica. She's the therapist.

27
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.960
Trevor Burger: I Jessica.

28
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.780
This man.

30
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you were in a program previously.

31
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.050
Trevor Burger: Yeah, for

32
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.950
Trevor Burger: Close to a year and then I tore my ACL about two and a half months ago and I relapsed and

33
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.160
Trevor Burger: I went back to a treatment called the Hacienda

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.580
Trevor Burger: And did 30 days and

35
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.600
Trevor Burger: Call back here.

36
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Thanks for getting back on.

37
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The wagon and choosing us again how did you, how did you tear your ACL.

38
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.260
Trevor Burger: dirt bike.

39
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.750
Trevor Burger: I grew up racing dirt bikes.

40
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How are you, recovering. Ouch.

41
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.750
Trevor Burger: I actually might well my ACL. The doctor said that it

42
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.220
Trevor Burger: exploded in my knee and the end of it looks like mops, like a mop.

43
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.250
Trevor Burger: A doctor's appointment in the morning to find out. I know I have to have surgery but I think I was telling the doctor you

44
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.670
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

45
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:12.210
Trevor Burger: I was gonna wait but the appointment I have tomorrow. They think that if I wait any longer that it'll mess up my leg forever because it's just grinding bone on bone, so hopefully I can figure something out in the morning, but I'll let you guys know as soon as I know

46
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.160
Joan Kandel: Good, yeah. So that's tomorrow you're having that appointment.

47
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.000
Joan Kandel: Yes. Good. And you already had your MRI. That's how

48
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.200
It looks like a mom.

49
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.840
Joan Kandel: It's a horrible description.

50
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

51
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.430
Trevor Burger: Yeah, it really doesn't hurt right now. I heard the first couple weeks. But as long as I'm walking on flat ground, it really doesn't hurt.

52
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.390
Haha

53
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some other group members to join us.

54
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.100
Joan Kandel: So, Trevor. We should have

55
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:58.590
Joan Kandel: Two other people in the group so far, like I was telling you it's. This is a new group. So we're. This is the first time that we're meeting. So we're all getting to know each other at the same time. So we should have two more. And then the group will grow as as time goes on.

56
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.090
Joan Kandel: Hopefully they will come. So I'll just ask you, Trevor. How, how are you doing on your on your dose.

57
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:22.860
Trevor Burger: I'm good. The past like three or four days I've been waking up at like two, three in the morning with stomach problems. But, and as soon as I take my Suboxone at seven. Oh, I'm fine. It's just

58
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.730
Trevor Burger: Starts kind of cramping real bad. And then I have a little bit of diarrhea. But other than that, I've been fine.

59
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.730
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. And I'm Remind me again how you take it. Do you take it you take it a half, three times a day.

60
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.910
Trevor Burger: Yeah, I take it at seven and nine.

61
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.470
Joan Kandel: Seven to nine. So I'm wondering if um

62
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.010
Joan Kandel: If there's a way that you could you could even it out like every eight hours.

63
00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:02.040
Joan Kandel: Yeah, because, because you're taking it kind of bunched up during the day you're there's a longer period of time overnight, which is probably why you're waking up.

64
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:10.500
Joan Kandel: In the early hours and it's just starting to wear off. So maybe you could do, you know, seven three and 10

65
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.850
Trevor Burger: Yeah. Cuz that's

66
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.720
Trevor Burger: Good or bad or right on a ride around town.

67
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.210
Joan Kandel: Right around 10 so maybe you can take it right

68
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.750
Joan Kandel: Before try stretching out the the middle one, and then take the other one right before bed that might help you with that.

69
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.090
Joan Kandel: Yeah, I'm just wearing off a little bit earlier.

70
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.360
Yeah.

71
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.170
Trevor Burger: Y'all doing I'm doing good. I'm

72
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.610
Trevor Burger: Good man.

73
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.510
Joan Kandel: How about craving.

74
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.130
Trevor Burger: No, nothing.

75
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.340
Joan Kandel: Day. That's kind of feel good.

76
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.880
Trevor Burger: I've been doing good.

77
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.180
Joan Kandel: That's great. Good for you. Okay, good. So you need a refill. Yes.

78
00:05:48.660 --> 00:06:06.570
Trevor Burger: Yes, and I think I'll have time to get it. My pharmacy closes at six. But I think as long as I go right after this. I could get it. I thought it closed at five and email you but right there. They are not supposed to close till nine but they do it because of this Corona thing.

79
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.600
Joan Kandel: Right. So now, but it's six not five

80
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.860
Trevor Burger: Yes, six.

81
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.020
Joan Kandel: Okay, so did you get the second yeah prescription that I put in. Okay.

82
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.320
Trevor Burger: I have enough to get me through today, and then I'll have another half left

83
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.830
Joan Kandel: Got it. So if worst case scenario if they weren't open after our

84
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.700
Joan Kandel: Fun. You could still get it in the morning and you wouldn't have to be without doses.

85
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.800
Joan Kandel: Yeah, good. I like it. Okay. So right after our group.

86
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.970
Joan Kandel: I'll put it in, and hopefully you can get over there tonight.

87
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.590
Trevor Burger: Or first. If not, it's ok though.

88
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.310
Trevor Burger: Thank you.

89
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.270
Joan Kandel: Okay, yeah.

90
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.120
Joan Kandel: You bet. What, what time is your ortho appointment tomorrow.

91
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.000
Trevor Burger: It's it too. So it's two o'clock, Texas. It's one o'clock, New Mexico time

92
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.640
Joan Kandel: Okay. Is it in Texas.

93
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.900
Trevor Burger: Yeah, it's in love it.

94
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.550
Joan Kandel: Oh, you have to go over there.

95
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.540
Trevor Burger: Yeah, there's just not really there's not even one orthopedic surgeon here.

96
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.740
Oh, wow.

97
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:11.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm from Florida and I hear a lot of patients that like travel the Texas. I'm wondering how far is Texas from New Mexico.

98
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.740
Trevor Burger: Now it's right next to it where I live in Clovis it's eight miles from the border.

99
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.550
Trevor Burger: Of Texas.

100
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.270
Okay.

101
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.150
Trevor Burger: I only have an hour trip.

102
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, being born and raised in Florida. When I hear some people say, I work in Texas. I'm thinking

103
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it seems to me.

104
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

105
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.560
Joan Kandel: It depends what part of New Mexico, like I'm way up in northern New

106
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.540
Joan Kandel: Mexico and Texas is really far.

107
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:40.950
Joan Kandel: Yeah, the

108
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.210
Joan Kandel: Other end of the state.

109
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.720
Joan Kandel: For Trevor, so it kind of depends where you are.

110
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:55.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I am I message in Slack, to see if anyone else was coming in because the minimum of three.

111
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.210
Joan Kandel: And they did group right

112
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so

113
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.440
Joan Kandel: So yeah, I see that you wrote that I don't

114
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.660
Joan Kandel: I don't know it's it's unusual because I talked to both of them who said they were coming

115
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and I even checked the surveys and I'm always show Trevor, I'll see

116
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.330
Trevor Burger: I know that I was in the in the waiting room for like 28 minutes

117
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I've been hearing that

118
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the virtual

119
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.290
Trevor Burger: A lot. And then like whenever they first see you then they send you to another round so away on somebody else.

120
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:39.000
Joan Kandel: Right, so that actually is. It is an attempt to make it quicker. It seems like it's not quicker but I think

121
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.530
Joan Kandel: They've gotten so

122
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.850
Joan Kandel: overwhelmed with the number of people who are interested in services that they have

123
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.490
Joan Kandel: No, especially now that's

124
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.210
Joan Kandel: Exactly right.

125
00:08:48.630 --> 00:09:01.680
Joan Kandel: They have a new system where you first call in and you get to like the first one who figures out which group you're going to them, they send you to another one. And so that they're trying to distribute it because it used to be that just to get into that first one it would back, way up.

126
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.100
Joan Kandel: So now they're trying to get it faster. So even though it took a long time. It's probably actually faster.

127
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.850
Trevor Burger: Yeah, it

128
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.980
Trevor Burger: Would have been no it was faster.

129
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.260
Trevor Burger: As soon as they saw me. I was done, but

130
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:19.440
Trevor Burger: Oh, nice. You don't have to wait. After they send you to the next one. There's somebody right there already. It's just seeing the first person.

131
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.460
Joan Kandel: Got it.

132
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.930
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

133
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.620
Joan Kandel: So, so we'll say, and

134
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.910
Joan Kandel: You know, Jessica, if others don't show then

135
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.900
Joan Kandel: I can just do this as an individual.

136
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.000
Joan Kandel: And then we can

137
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.540
Joan Kandel: Do it next week. Actually, why don't we do that.

138
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.950
Joan Kandel: Yeah, because, because it's not going to be worth it to have just

139
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Exactly.

140
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I was thinking whether I could do his bio psychosocial now or just oh

141
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sure.

142
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Gather the BIOS, I sure whatever you prefer.

143
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.280
Joan Kandel: Whatever I prefer

144
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, yes.

145
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:00.840
Joan Kandel: So,

146
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You want to meet with him about

147
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:09.870
Joan Kandel: No. So we just talked. Not long ago, and I just did his, his check in. So I'm good. So if you

148
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.620
Joan Kandel: And if the other to come in. I'll just do individuals with them.

149
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.200
Joan Kandel: Okay, for their medical check in.

150
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.030
Joan Kandel: Okay, and then you can schedule with those two for their locker visit

151
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.720
Yes.

152
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.370
Joan Kandel: And

153

166
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:25.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To do with the bio psychosocial probably have a call when you first joined the program have an individual session with the therapist, where they asked you about past

167

177
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So tell me what I'm reading here is that

178
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your addiction. When did your addiction start

179
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.000
Trevor Burger: I was 16

180
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:30.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mm hmm.

181
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what were you using

182
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.160
Trevor Burger: The first thing

183
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.290
Trevor Burger: I ever did was

184
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.770
Trevor Burger: Pain medication i like i said i grew up racing dirt bikes and I got hurt and it got given to me.

185
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.850
Trevor Burger: The first, you know, few times I got hurt. It really didn't. I think I was more worried about when I could get back to writing. Then I was the pain pills and then

186
00:12:54.690 --> 00:13:02.820
Trevor Burger: Whenever I was, well, I started selling drugs when I was 16 I was selling weed and ecstasy, but I never got high and never touched it.

187
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:15.360
Trevor Burger: The only thing I've ever done was prescribed pain medication. And then whenever I was in August of 2014 I broke my spleen and half with the motorcycle wreck and that's

188
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:27.270
Trevor Burger: I was on bed rest for six months because I lost so much blood and that's when I really got addicted to it. And whenever the script or and now I mean I was already been selling drugs for a couple years. So I just kept buying them.

189
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.800
Trevor Burger: And then right whenever I got released after that six months, I went to the hospital thought I had the flu.

190
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:43.650
Trevor Burger: And they came in and they told me they were like the helicopters about to be here because my scar tissue attached right underneath my stomach and like twisted it

191
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:55.830
Trevor Burger: So I was throwing up everything I ate so they had to cut it open again. And that was another four months. So after that year. It was, I was pretty much addicted to them. And I never quit after that.

192
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, yeah.

193
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.760
Trevor Burger: I started smoking weed somewhere in the middle of their like 1617 somewhere.

194
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.560
Trevor Burger: But that was it.

195
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:19.710
Trevor Burger: And then after that second surgery. I was doing a lot of pain medication and the same doctor that was giving me the pain medication and put me on Xanax, because I was

196
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.510
Trevor Burger: I felt like I was going crazy. I lost like my whole life. Pretty much all that racing. I couldn't do anymore and

197
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.020
Trevor Burger: I was just

198
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.760
Trevor Burger: At home alone, and I was

199
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:37.920
Trevor Burger: I mean, I'm sure I was having anxiety, but he put me on a really high amount. And then after I found that that was another thing I never stopped doing. Yeah.

200
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, um, during this course of the addiction.

201
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:52.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was the first treatment that you sought out, you can try just detox in Turkey. What programs do you participate

202
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:53.910
Trevor Burger: I actually

203
00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:04.290
Trevor Burger: I got arrested for my I got to do you eyes and like a month and a half. And I had court ordered me to my first treatment and I wasn't, I wasn't trying to get clean but

204
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:17.400
Trevor Burger: It was either, you know, having to which are in the jail cold turkey or good to go there. So that's what I did. And I got high. The day I got home from that rehab is a 60 day rehab in love it.

205
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:25.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, is there any family members that happens through of addiction.

206
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:33.840
Trevor Burger: My dad was an alcoholic and my little brother's an alcoholic and pretty much my entire side of my dad's family.

207
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some, some addiction alcohol whatever about John's

208
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:41.220
Trevor Burger: Much

209
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:49.740
Trevor Burger: All my cousins on the dad side of my family, but that's pretty my little brother doesn't do any drugs he just drinks. Neither did my dad. He just drank.

210
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when did you first join our program was about a year ago, right.

211
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.530
Trevor Burger: Now close to a year ago.

212
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.700
Trevor Burger: Or maybe not. I was with a different program from

213
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.100
Trevor Burger: That was doing Suboxone from

214
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.420
Trevor Burger: Or January of 2019 to

215
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.660
Trevor Burger: I want to say it was like in August or

216
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.600
Trevor Burger: September or something. I joined

217
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it's you.

218
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Let's, feel free to join and learn when you first joined

219
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.990
Trevor Burger: This program or a

220
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:37.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any program. What were some of the skills that you know felt we felt like it's tough. What were some of the treatments that you felt like you know resonated with you.

221
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:44.340
Trevor Burger: I mean, I've tried everything. Like every kind of combination possible rehab I op

222
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.920
Trevor Burger: Rehab IP sober living and

223
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.510
Trevor Burger: None of it ever worked until I actually worked up 12 steps.

224
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.170
And

225
00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:00.570
Trevor Burger: The one thing I found was like the book. It even says that we have a daily reprieve based on our spiritual maintenance so

226
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.080
Trevor Burger: The only time I stayed clean

227
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.790
Trevor Burger: Was the last

228
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:19.440
Trevor Burger: This treatment that I went to, in January of 2018 I stayed clean for eight months. And that's because I was going to meetings I was doing the steps I was waking up every morning and praying and

229
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:27.030
Trevor Burger: Doing everything I'm supposed to be doing. And then once that obsession got removed from me. I thought it was gone forever. So

230
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:38.940
Trevor Burger: I slowly stopped going to meetings slowly stopped praying every day and then that thought came into my head that I should just I could just smoke weed one night and then eight hours later I overdosed on heroin so

231
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.560
Trevor Burger: That's the only thing that's ever worked for me it was doing the program.

232
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I mean,

233
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:49.410
Trevor Burger: Even though whenever I'm on Suboxone if I'm not doing that all go back out.

234
00:17:51.240 --> 00:18:04.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I'm one of the things I'll elaborate on and didn't set is and individual meetings is there are red flags thought that kind of just follow our thought process with addiction is to relax. So

235
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.880
Joan Kandel: I'm back.

236
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.200
