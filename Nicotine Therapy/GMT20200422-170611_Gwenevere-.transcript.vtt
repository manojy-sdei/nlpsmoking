Michelle Lucero: Um, I woke up bad seven around seven

8
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.120
Michelle Lucero: I've been on the phone with the school.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Is my son's

10
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.530
Michelle Lucero: IEP was done back in like

11
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.950
Michelle Lucero: November, and they're barely getting to his assessment now and it's doom. A second

12
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:25.290
Michelle Lucero: And they wanted to meet with me while I met with them this morning at nine and then it just ended like at 48

13
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.800
Michelle Lucero: I've been on the phone with them this long.

14
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.030
Michelle Lucero: But

15
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.370
Michelle Lucero: I told him I have a meeting at 11

16
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:49.440
Michelle Lucero: Though like your lack of planning doesn't. I'm not going to stop what I'm doing. I can't believe that they're barely getting to this now. Like it blows my mind. But yeah, if I were to like be slow on something, it's like

17
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:59.160
Michelle Lucero: Yet on it, but I've been telling them since November wasn't supposed to have an assessment done and there

18
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.440
Michelle Lucero: It's just irritating.

19
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So their lack of planning is not sure emergency

20
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.080
Michelle Lucero: Yeah. And I just, I learned that. Whoa, and I love it.

21
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Where else does it show up in your life. Are you love it.

22
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.150
Michelle Lucero: Oh my god, it's everywhere.

23
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple more minutes here now to grow something no problem last meeting looks like was 42

24
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.170
Michelle Lucero: A personality test today at two.

25
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You were able to meet today. I think what we'll do is we'll do it in reverse and will schedule something

26
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: For next week.

27
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: At the front end of this session.

28
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: To do you need to get a calendar anything to get a sense of what your next week is

29
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Any

30
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.420
Michelle Lucero: I don't have a calendar, except for my phone.

31
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well let's see if you get logged off or if you i think i bet the video just freeze. I think that'll be the worst thing that will happen first case, you can always log back in

32
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.330
Michelle Lucero: Can you still hear me and see me.

33
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear you. So let's go with that.

34
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.430
Michelle Lucero: Okay, yeah, I'm on my calendars, so

35
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.080
Michelle Lucero: The 22nd next week. I have nothing one

36
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, but that so just slow down a little bit.

37
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have

38
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Something with a bill you may have some sort of somebody's home, you may have something with

39
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: One of your kids schools. So just kind of think it's the end of April.

40
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Just kind of run it through and see if you think you might have something, it didn't make it onto the calendar yet.

41
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Your work. I thought you told me started on the 30th.

42
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.170
Michelle Lucero: On the second I just got

43
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.840
Michelle Lucero: An email from my box.

44
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The second is a Saturday.

45
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so starts. Okay. So Michelle starts

46
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Check this out. That's why I like pencil.

47
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

48
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This might be different. Let's see how it goes. You've been getting up a little early for next week.

49
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm booked except I'm seeing eight o'clock on April 28 so you'd have to kind of jump up through some cold water on your face. It's a Wednesday, April. Sorry, I misspoke April 29 at eight.

50
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.410
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

51
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have only been up for like half hour hour so it'll be kind of an early morning appointment and then

52
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then over the weekend. If you could maybe make a note to contact me with the following week schedule. I don't need your schedule. I just need to know what your limitations are

53
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.730
Michelle Lucero: Okay, I, good to have you now.

54
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.480
Because every

55
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.830
Michelle Lucero: Back. I have a set schedule. So it's 723 Tuesday through Saturday.

56
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so probably what we'll do is

57
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Alternate

58
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Group individual group individual on a Monday. It sounds like

59
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably what so let's move forward a little bit into

60
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: May 4 would be Monday.

61
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.010
Michelle Lucero: Hey, that week, I have to do well with my deal

62
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, this would be Monday. Would you think you're going to see your appeal on Monday.

63
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.250
Michelle Lucero: No, no, it's on the six

64
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.840
Michelle Lucero: So on Monday, I am free.

65
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So your job knows obviously their friends so that you go into see your PO you pull away from work, you go to do and then go back to work out what those days look like

66
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.700
Yeah.

67
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So are you going to be all the way, often May six, or you'll go back to work.

68
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.410
Michelle Lucero: No, I will. It's just a duo call with him because their offices aren't open so

69
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.770
Michelle Lucero: Just a glass. Yeah, last month was

70
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.970
Michelle Lucero: I mean this month was a dual call so

71
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:56.520
Michelle Lucero: He told me to just meet with him on Google on me six until unless I hear otherwise unless their office opens

72
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.690
Michelle Lucero: I still have invited anyone. I'm still planning on doing the dual

73
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how about

74
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: 10am may 4

75
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:16.740
Sure.

76
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I will

77
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll message you the night before, just

78
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure this gets into your calendar with reminders and if you can respond to my text and let me know if you can attend. I've got people on waiting lists. So

79
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You are today.

80
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.820
Michelle Lucero: Will I still have group that Monday.

81
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So earlier I said, You'll be alternating group and individual. Remember that

82
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.860
Michelle Lucero: Oh, yeah.

83
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:56.550
Yeah.

84
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what that means that means you won't be attending group that week.

85
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.270
Okay.

86
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I just lost the green cap.

87
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you like to know where it is, that's not gonna be

88
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Here soon anyway. So yeah, on Monday, May 4

89
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Will not be a group

90
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: On that

91
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That week

92
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.300
Michelle Lucero: So then the following week I will have group.

93
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.320
Yeah.

94
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: May 11 so this is

95
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you're writing this all out what you'd see is

96
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What do we have what's our first thing we just noted

97
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.060
Michelle Lucero: APRIL THE 29th at eight.

98
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go, and

99
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you would be attending

100
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Your next service, of course, actually would be Monday for group.

101
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.720
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

102
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that makes sense. Yeah, we started the new work process. So when you're writing things down and you putting in your phone. It'll be April 29 and you're you've been assigned to 1pm

103
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.800
Yeah yeah

104
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Then April 29 8am.

105
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

106
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

107
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

108
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: General licious touch base on a couple of things. How is your sleep been over the last, let's say week

109
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:22.290
Michelle Lucero: Um, I got a good night's sleep last night the night before was pretty crappy I was at my dad's

110
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right well housing houses health right now.

111
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:38.010
Michelle Lucero: He's feeling better. I came in yesterday to get his prescription because the doctors like he's not going to the doctors or anything we've just been doing it like over the phone.

112
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:48.150
Michelle Lucero: So they prescribed medication. So I came into town to get it yesterday. And in a while, had his debit card, so I had to go get it from her.

113
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:58.770
Michelle Lucero: And anyways. He's doing his medications working and I called him this morning when I woke up he's feeling better. He's sad that I left.

114
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:13.500
Michelle Lucero: I feel bad, but Noel thought it was going to be like slumber time what I'm like, you know, I have to do school with my son. I came because Dad needed me because you weren't here, but now that you're home. I need to go home.

115
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.380
Michelle Lucero: She wanted me to stay and he wanted me to stay but it's just too chaotic there.

116
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.890
Michelle Lucero: And my nephew, my nephew's there and he's doing really good, he just past 30 days sobriety.

117
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:37.650
Michelle Lucero: And so probably him. Um, but it's just the the tension there is so high. I can't

118
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's the tension.

119
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.250
Michelle Lucero: At my dad's house like

120
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I get

121
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.660
Michelle Lucero: Oh, you mean between go

122
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.300
Michelle Lucero: Now while everybody

123
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

124
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:59.130
Michelle Lucero: She just puts everybody. Oh my god, it's it's horrible. The way the the environment at my dad's when my sister wasn't there.

125
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:11.880
Michelle Lucero: Was so laid back and chill and we laughed, and even my dad laughed and he wasn't feeling good, but he was in a good mood, but the minute she walks in everybody's attitude changes.

126
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:23.430
Michelle Lucero: And it's I hated to see it, but like, that's just the reality. And I called my dad this morning and I told him like, did you notice the way

127
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:34.470
Michelle Lucero: Everyone went to their rooms. When the wild got home, like we were all in the living room. But then once in a while, Jove up. I'm not even kidding. It was like

128
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.870
Michelle Lucero: Everyone ran to the rooms.

129
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:56.250
Michelle Lucero: And he's like, I know I feel sorry for her. I'm like, Why do you feel sorry for that. That's why she does it. Because she knows you feel sorry for she could get her own plays. She's working. She's going to school, she can do it, but you're enabling her because you feel sorry for her.

130
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:19.290
Michelle Lucero: But then I also think he likes her being there because she helps him with like his bills not not paying them but she'll remind him when bills are due or does stuff for him like that she's been paying his bills online instead of happiness and in the chat.

131
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:21.840
Michelle Lucero: But

132
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's not skip over

133
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: How again. Did you tell her I'm not staying. Let me hear it again.

134
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:42.000
Michelle Lucero: Um, yeah, I just told her, it's too much for me to be here during the week, Wednesday, one has school

135
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:56.820
Michelle Lucero: Because we don't have our own room there. So like he would have to do school outside or in the middle of the living room. Everyone's walking back and forth.

136
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

137
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:13.770
Michelle Lucero: So I, you know, she was like, you can just stay one night and I was like, No, I just didn't feel like being there with her there because like I said, the tension was just so high.

138
00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, what you said and your reasoning. They're different.

139
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's, that's, but still, let's just wait here I'm writing a little note about one of your goals is continue working on implementing boundaries with older sister, it's specific to know well

140
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:39.990
Michelle Lucero: Yeah yeah i i would have not been able to tell her. Hey, you make me so uncomfortable. I'm leaving.

141
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But just noticed that. That's the truth.

142
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm not saying you're a bad sister.

143
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying you're a bad friend and sister, because you have that fun

144
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.300
Michelle Lucero: I feel bad that I

145
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:13.530
Michelle Lucero: Can't tell her about it because I don't want to start a fight between her and the other house members.

146
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.350
Michelle Lucero: Do you know what I mean.

147
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:26.040
Michelle Lucero: I will tell her. Okay, so I want to tell her, like for instance yesterday when she drove up and her

148
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:34.020
Michelle Lucero: Just driving up everyone went to their rooms, I would have liked to tell her like

149
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:45.330
Michelle Lucero: Did you go say hi to everybody. Because like she just walked in and went straight to her room, she didn't go see my dad. She didn't. I mean, she said hi to me because I was in the living room.

150
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.810
Michelle Lucero: But like she didn't go to my brother's room.

151
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.340
Michelle Lucero: Or like say I'm home or anything. You know, like

152
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.350
Michelle Lucero: And then she complains, the minute she walked in the door.

153
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.400
Michelle Lucero: Because the house was hot, while my dad six. So we're not going to open windows.

154
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.080
Michelle Lucero: Like

155
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:26.070
Michelle Lucero: Oh, I don't know, I just, I couldn't got out of there quicker but I wanted to tell her, because I don't like that feeling that I can't talk to her, and that I can't tell her the way I really feel. And then I kind of feel bad because I'm like

156
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:41.790
Michelle Lucero: She has to know that my brother counts down her. She has to know that my dad's uncomfortable with or not there. I mean, with her there. Well, I don't think she does know that and I don't want to hurt her feelings telling her that

157
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's just stay here. Stay with the

158
00:17:47.910 --> 00:18:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to communicate and a lot of my encouraged is you paying attention to what you want what you need, what you prefer, and you are aware right now to do want her to know something, let's take a minute and just see

159
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be different if she knew your opinion. Just, just don't go too far from it. Just the next thing. So what would be different if she knew because it's just your opinion.

160
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And he said,

161
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever it is, you know, What would be different about the tension that would exist at the house.

162
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.410
Michelle Lucero: If I did mention something

163
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:31.440
Michelle Lucero: I

164
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.930
Michelle Lucero: It would probably be worse.

165
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: How awesome

166
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.470
Michelle Lucero: She was

167
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.430
Michelle Lucero: I don't think she would try to address anyone's feelings or try to

168
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.100
Michelle Lucero: Like

169
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.630
Michelle Lucero: Solve the problem. Do you know what I mean. I think she

170
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.860
Michelle Lucero: Get upset over it and start a bigger fight over it.

171
00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What would that look like right and played all the way through, you stop at a certain point, we're going to go even further.

172
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't tell me what won't be. Tell me what will be because your imagination goes to what is there. So you're going to see something. So in your imagination. I tell her I tell her, and then she she would know how does she started fighting. How does the fights happen.

173
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:33.210
Michelle Lucero: She'll probably either go to my Dad's room to tell him like, why did you come to your room when I came home, why don't you ever come out when I'm not here. I mean, when I'm here. And he'd probably say I don't know I'm just tired or probably make up some excuse like we always do.

174
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there. I'm just tired. That would be your dad.

175
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.060
Yeah.

176
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that okay, did he just say

177
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just tired.

178
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.560
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, because he he

179
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.580
Michelle Lucero: He doesn't engage in her fighting because she's

180
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then she'll go find someone else to get more of a react.

181
00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.300
Michelle Lucero: And then she'll go to my brother's room and he he won't wider her. He told tells her

182
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.500
Let me hear what

183
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: She is going to talk

184
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:07.080
Michelle Lucero: Yes, she

185
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:20.370
Michelle Lucero: She'd probably go in and tell him why do you turn up the thermostat so high as she was going what is room to tell him that. And I told her, I'm the one that turned it up. So she wouldn't go fight with him.

186
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:37.350
Michelle Lucero: Anyways, what she would probably go to his room and tell him what's your problem with me. Why are you upset when I get home. Why do you get upset when I get home and my brother will tell her. Is your bitch. And I can't stand to be around you, you're up. Right.

187
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.580
Okay.

188
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

189
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And then what will happen.

190
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:54.420
Michelle Lucero: And then they'll fight about the other one movie now and then they both tell each other to go get screwed.

191
00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll end up with a standoff and they'll just tell each other off. And that's it, or does it anything happened after that.

192
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:14.100
Michelle Lucero: No, I mean like that if my brother in the wild fight they they will hold a grudge for weeks.

193
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When. What does it look like over there at that house with your brother and no well

194
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:39.990
Michelle Lucero: I usually leave before any of that happens. But I like my brother will come into the kitchen, or he'll be doing dishes in a while, will come in and she'll slammed the refrigerator closed and slam the dresser. I mean, the cabinet drawer.

195
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.110
Michelle Lucero: She's. That's the way she isn't.

196
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.150
Michelle Lucero: Just a scene and puffing and puffy and all over

197
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.920
Michelle Lucero: Thing little remarks under her breath.

198
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.730
Michelle Lucero: Like, that's the way it is with him in her, but then he's the same way to

199
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Both of them are doing

200
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.310
Yeah.

201
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:13.020
Michelle Lucero: Or and then like finally after two weeks they'll just both get so sick of being so angry all the time.

202
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:27.000
Michelle Lucero: That one of them will crack and apologize after like two weeks of putting my dad through how listening to them bickering and fighting like children.

203
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.300
Michelle Lucero: They finally apologized.

204
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: How was he going through hell.

205
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:46.560
Michelle Lucero: Because he has to sit there and listen to them, Victor dream and complaining and hear them slamming doors and cabinets and

206
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.920
Michelle Lucero: I mean they don't take it out on him, but he can hear it. Like he lives in the house, you know,

207
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know it's helped for him.

208
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.400
Michelle Lucero: Because he tells me he's out

209
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Here, how he how he describes it.

210
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.430
Michelle Lucero: He says, Oh, I can't stand when those two are fighting

211
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:21.840
Michelle Lucero: And they tell them will do. Do they get mad at you. And he said, no, but I have to hear it from both of them. They'll both go and complain to my dad about the other one, like they're freaking six years old.

212
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your dad done because he says he can't stand it. What has he done to address the issue. It's his house. What does he do

213
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:35.880
Michelle Lucero: He tells both of them. If you don't might get them move out. He tells them both that all the time.

214
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:43.620
Michelle Lucero: I don't know if you don't like living here. You're not happy. They move out. He tells them that constantly

215
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.510
Michelle Lucero: And then while we'll get into a huge fight because she doesn't

216
00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay there.

217
00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Please hit. Well, right. He says it constantly.

218
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying frequently probably

219
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.150
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I mean not constantly

220
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

221
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's go with me.

222
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot

223
00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's the solution. I will tell them. If you don't like it here, then you can move out that has been a consistent frequent solution. Your dad has used. Has he tried any other solutions.

224
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.400
Michelle Lucero: He's, he's tried many

225
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.820
Michelle Lucero: What like kill try to mediate for them.

226
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: just yet.

227
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.590
Michelle Lucero: Haha

228
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the skills to mediate

229
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:46.080
Michelle Lucero: Well, not like clinically, but I mean he tries to, like, help them hash out their differences or fix whatever problem.

230
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.370
Does that work.

231
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:58.020
Michelle Lucero: Sometimes it does, but I think most of the time, they just stop fighting because they were they realize how upset. They've made him.

232
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:10.500
Michelle Lucero: So, then they're like, shit. We're acting like idiots and then they'll just make up because they're like why are we making our 87 year old Dad has shell our problems.

233
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you guessing right now.

234
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.310
Michelle Lucero: I'm guessing, because I've seen him try to

235
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.270
Michelle Lucero: Like problem solve for both of them.

236
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:34.350
Michelle Lucero: Like oh my god in a while, has a stupid cat. I mean, she's not stupid. I love the cat. But she's, she's the like the problem in the house.

237
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:45.870
Michelle Lucero: My brother loves her cat. The cat loves my brother no while gets jealous of the cat wants to be in my brother's room. My dad hates the cat doesn't want it anywhere.

238
00:25:46.440 --> 00:26:08.460
Michelle Lucero: Oh, man. No. Well, like it's a long haired cat. So there's cat hair everywhere in that house and my dad complains, and complains and complain so that cat is like the main problem in that house. I feel so sorry for it What Noel's usually bitching at my brother because he'll overfeed the cat.

239
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:10.620
Like

240
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:19.740
Michelle Lucero: She's not on big fat cat. So it's not like she can't eat a little more, you know, he doesn't give her that much more

241
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:31.020
Michelle Lucero: Or he'll give her treats more than a while does. I think that's why the cat likes my brother so much because he always feed her. No, no, I'll get so jealous and they'll fight over that.

242
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:47.190
Michelle Lucero: So then my dad will tell him a while. Okay, well then leave your door locked. When you leave. So Davey can't go in your room to let the cat out because obviously the cat can open the door itself so Davies, letting the cat out. So why don't you leave your door locked

243
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:59.910
Michelle Lucero: And or hilltown my brother will just leave the cattle room don't take the cat into your room if Noel's going to complain to you about feeding the cat just don't let that get in your room.

244
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.750
Michelle Lucero: So my dad's trying to like

245
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:24.570
Michelle Lucero: Prevent them from having fights or more fight over stupid things or like Davey, he's set the water temperature, higher because we have lowered it because it was getting like super burning hot like you could really bring yourself a month hot water. So my brother.

246
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:38.580
Michelle Lucero: low or no we lowered it so then he hired it. So we've got hot again and wow bitched about that. Like, it's just never ending. They always find something to complain about

247
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: If your dad was not bothered by their bickering and they're fighting, they're arguing

248
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Would it be this a yes or no and then we'll go on to the next one, would it be easier for you to be over at that house.

249
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.940
Michelle Lucero: If my dad wasn't bothered by it.

250
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:07.710
Michelle Lucero: You know,

251
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So are you bothered by your siblings arguing. Yes. Okay, so let's leave that out of it for a second. When you see arguing what does it remind you of how old is that being bothered by people arguing. How old is that that feeling.

252
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.340
Michelle Lucero: Very old

253
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.540
Michelle Lucero: It was four years old. Yeah.

254
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it turns out it's not your job to get them to stop arguing, but the job is for you to be able to hold on to yourself and see that they have some growing up to do and for you to sort of be around that and still function.

255
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Functioning might mean leaving, but that it isn't your job to change that behavior.

256
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, learning this sort of this desensitisation to being around that arguing

257
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it did sound familiar to me too. It sounds a lot like, Mom, Dad, arguing and you having to leave.

258
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

259
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.020
Your siblings.

260
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Are likely to continue to act like you call them six years old, six year olds. Yeah.

261
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Until they're treated like adults.

262
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That is between them and their father.

263
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Your dad.

264
00:29:50.850 --> 00:30:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: May have his own unconscious reasons for leaving it just the way it is. He'll do only this much, because he it is within his power to say please leave

265
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: He can do that.

266
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what is it like for you to imagine that you might end up maturing

267
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And your siblings remain

268
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Like six years old, like six year olds still bickering, what would it be like for you to grow up.

269
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And they don't

270
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.840
Michelle Lucero: I mean, it bothers me because I don't want to be around them.

271
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Well, the more you actually, the more you grow up, probably the less you're going to want to be around it.

272
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:39.150
Right.

273
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.530
Michelle Lucero: I mean i i literally miss them. It just

274
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I

275
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:54.270
Michelle Lucero: Don't want to be around them. It's always something, especially with no well

276
00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So do you see how that say I miss them. So let's rewind to all this big imagination. You have about how these awful things that are going to happen.

277
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: If you speak your truth. Look what your truth is your truth is I miss my sister.

278
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I miss you.

279
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't have to be telling her, she's doing something wrong.

280
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It could just be

281
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It breaks my heart to hear you guys talking like the way you do showing your anger instead of expressing and working through with communication.

282
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It reminds me of my childhood.

283
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And it makes me sad. Makes me

284
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to be home and away from the arguing. I've got arguing in my own home. And here it is, and

285
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And while I miss you.

286
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You see the difference between how you thought you might say it to her and how if you get to your own heartfelt underlying emotions.

287
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe she could hear you.

288
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or at least maybe you could work up the courage to speak your truth without getting yourself all into this imagination and the truth of the matter is, no matter how ridiculous this gets right and you played it pretty far.

289
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: In your worst case scenario, your dad basically knows he can keep them out, they end up apologizing to each other and everybody's ultimately okay even in the worst case scenario.

290
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Even in the presence of arguing and I know it's uncomfortable, but you're okay. You made it through.

291
00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.380
Michelle Lucero: I've been very emotional.

292
00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:03.390
Michelle Lucero: By the way,

293
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:10.890
Michelle Lucero: I don't know. I don't know what it is. It might be like my time of the month, I don't know, but I'm very

294
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:15.210
Michelle Lucero: Like stupid commercial made me cry. There's money.

295
00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.980
Michelle Lucero: That's normal, though, for like around my menstrual cycle.

296
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you imagine someone coming to you and saying, I miss you.

297
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But the tension between you and Anthony, it's a reminds me of my own childhood and it I get anxious and that's all I just preoccupies my mind.

298
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:02.850
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, that just happened to me. My niece, the Diva just called me, Mike.

299
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you are you mad at her, did you take it out on your children because she said that

300
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on. If you have a lived experience from the consumer of direct communication.

301
00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Flip it around. What if we treated in a while like a capable woman.

302
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And you spoke to her your truth.

303
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Your dad will take care of himself brother will take clearly your brother will take care of themselves.

304
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And she'll be treated like an adult where you see that she's capable of hearing your truth.

305
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You could hear you're about to tell me a story about your nice I interrupted you. I know I did that. But I didn't want to miss the parallel didn't want to skip over that go into story because you really

306
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:58.260
Michelle Lucero: That would, that would be great if I could tell Noel, the way my niece told me, like she didn't even have a problem, telling me.

307
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:10.740
Michelle Lucero: I don't, I don't know if know Wildwood, I'm pretty sure she would have reacted this they might the same way I did and apologize to her for feeling that way.

308
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

309
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm lost. Why would somebody apologize for your feeling. I don't get it.

310
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:31.500
Michelle Lucero: So my niece was like, oh, I miss you so much and I told her I know. Well, you're not working, you don't go anywhere. Why don't you come by, like, you don't go anywhere. She they've been home for like literally three months. I mean, three weeks.

311
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:40.050
Michelle Lucero: And she was like, No, I don't go over there, especially when Anthony's there because you all you guys just by okay

312
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What was your emotion when you heard that well was

313
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.450
Michelle Lucero: I felt sad.

314
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:52.500
Michelle Lucero: Okay, I felt bad for that being the reason why she didn't come over

315
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so still move stay there.

316
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you throw a shoe at your nice

317
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.010
Know,

318
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What you do

319
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:23.280
Michelle Lucero: I literally apologize. I told her, I'm so sorry, I don't mean to fight with him in for new when you when you guys are here. Like, I thought I did pretty good at not fighting with him but like with me, they could feel the tension, just like I could at my desktop.

320
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We can tell right

321
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.210
Yeah.

322
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you let's rewind. Let's say you're nice says this, again, give me her name. She's got a cool name. What's her name again.

323
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.240
Michelle Lucero: That diva.

324
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The team. Okay.

325
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: All these needs. I can't keep them on my head. So what if you didn't apologize. This time practice the skill of I feel

326
00:36:49.470 --> 00:37:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A city that says, yeah, I would accept you guys are fighting and I really want to be around it. What if you didn't go to. I'm sorry, but instead you went to how it felt to hear that if someone else notices it

327
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what could you have said a little differently. Instead of apologizing. What might you say

328
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:19.860
Michelle Lucero: That makes me feel sad to hear you say that, or to hear you feel that way when you come over

329
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.370
Michelle Lucero: To hear that you feel that way when you come over

330
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel sad.

331
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are aware of us in our discord.

332
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it just stayed there. What if it just stayed there.

333
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: What would happen right just goes, nice and slow.

334
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.060
Michelle Lucero: I mean,

335
00:37:54.030 --> 00:38:05.220
Michelle Lucero: I don't know. I mean, it would probably make her feel a little bit better feeling carrying that I feel sad about. I mean, not good. But you know what I mean. But I don't think it would

336
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.930
Michelle Lucero: Make her start coming around. It's not gonna change.

337
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

338
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is, this is, this is your downfall right there you are, every time I do any of these pieces. So I'm not kidding.

339
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Every single time you go to outcome.

340
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:26.400
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, thank you.

341
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like I can almost like I wish I could catch it fast enough. And I do a lot of interrupting of you to try and try to intervene before you go, but nothing's going to change.

342
00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Fast

343
00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter.

344
00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are keep trying to control the outcome.

345
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You are going to miss out on your entire life. It's going to pass right baya

346
00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to say your truth.

347
00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: cannot control your dad's response can control your sister's response. How many years have you been trying to prevent people from getting hurt feelings and fighting so that you don't feel I'm comfortable

348
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: How many years.

349
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.590
Michelle Lucero: All my life, my whole life.

350
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that there are people on this planet that don't make that decision and they're okay.

351
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Here. Okay, you know,

352
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Your way is automatic. And you got here early, early, early age 456 really young stuff.

353
00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But that isn't the only way

354
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: To perceive what's going on around you can

355
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Interact with it differently.

356
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you might benefit from intervening is let go of trying to control the outcome.

357
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been doing it for years. So, so I want you to just write, think about you know how you heard you know your poor playing or lack of planning is not my emergency. How about how about this one.

358
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't the definition of insanity continuing to do the same thing you've always done getting the same results. So it's that same right that comes from the recovery community, actually. So, aren't you doing that.

359
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.770
Yeah.

360
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We if I'm your sister, your brother. I'm your dad. I'm cities.

361
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to control me

362
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to hear your truth I respect you. I care about you and I believe you don't try and control me

363
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: By not being full tilt. Michelle, do you get that

364
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you all do me. I can handle myself. I don't need you managing me over here, see it.

365
00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You are off the hook. Don't have to take care of me. Don't have to take care of her, and him and them and them and them. It has been a reason for you to not look inward.

366
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It has spared you growth potential. And I believe in your show. I think you've got the stuff I think you can do it. I think you can do you just just great.

367
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There have been times when you have not been around. No. Well, because she was in a little bitch fest and so were you or whatever it was, however, it can be out and you're okay.

368
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You went to another friend, or maybe you you know did a little bit more sleeping or maybe you have a little boredom, or whatever. But you did get through it and not all of them were you using drugs, some of them. You did just fine. Just do when you is that right

369
00:41:59.460 --> 00:41:59.820
Yeah.

370
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So you do have evidence that you can be okay. Even when there's distance from her.

371
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Five years from now 10 years from now if you continue doing what you're doing. Are you going to like this vision of yourself to keep sacrificing who you are, for her.

372
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture who you're going to be five and 10 years from now.

373
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Still not speaking your truth to this person.

374
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:31.740
Michelle Lucero: You know,

375
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What she looked like what you want is this future version of you look like if you don't do you authentically

376
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.410
Michelle Lucero: Just the same way I am now just

377
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.930
Michelle Lucero: Um, I don't know how to say it like

378
00:42:53.580 --> 00:43:05.460
Michelle Lucero: Hi, prevent myself from living because I keep like I want to go to my dad's and spend time with him, but I don't. So like, I'm going to keep

379
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.360
Michelle Lucero: Just staying home not going out or doing things because I'm afraid of

380
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.160
Michelle Lucero: Arguments happening or fights happening.

381
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that woman you picture. Is she happy.

382
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.480
No.

383
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:32.160
Michelle Lucero: I think all day about ways to talk to not only know while but my brother.

384
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:44.520
Michelle Lucero: Or my dad and it's, it sounds great. And I think about it. But when it comes down to it, I don't, I don't know, like I don't have the guts to do it.

385
00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: The risk is they'll never talk to you again. It's not the worst fear.

386
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:52.620
Michelle Lucero: Um,

387
00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.640
Michelle Lucero: I guess that could be it.

388
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.870
Michelle Lucero: I don't know, or her just turn it around on me.

389
00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you done that 100 times

390
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.180
Yeah.

391
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All you're controlling is for nothing.

392
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not working. I mean, I don't know how many more hundreds. I mean, you want to do it like you have like 15 years. Give it a shot.

393
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:39.450
Michelle Lucero: I would love to tell her, like in the spare the moment not even having to think about it. Just write them in there. The way I'm feeling just I don't

394
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:42.540
Michelle Lucero: I don't know how to do that.

395
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.880
Michelle Lucero: So you i do i do know how to do that.

396
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.900
Michelle Lucero: I just, I'm afraid of the outcome.

397
00:44:54.360 --> 00:45:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Send us your burden you have been reinforcing her behavior and so has dad.

398
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's something that parts on you.

399
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We do play a part. When we dance around we let people get when we don't say that organic result of being treated like shit, we're reinforcing it and I'm sorry. Nobody likes to hear that part.

400
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the truth.

401
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: The hard part is to do with the TV did, which is

402
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Toxic

403
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.210
Yeah.

404
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's gonna love you dad is going to love you for others gonna love you. That is not going anywhere.

405
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe if you saw your sister as capable

406
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of right that she's a six year old maybe she would step into those big girl pants and where

407
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you want to be continued to be viewed as incapable and be treated like incapable of handling things and just tiptoed around and treated like a baby.

408
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Are you sure

409
00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.190
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I hate when a while. Does it to me.

410
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.150
Hmm.

411
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:12.540
Michelle Lucero: So like I see myself doing what she's done in the past.

412
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:33.990
Michelle Lucero: She's hasn't done it lately, though, like trying to control me or tell me how she thinks I should be she hasn't done that, like, I think the last fight we had was about that. So she's been pretty good at not doing that. But now I see myself doing to her.

413
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Your truth is

414
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I miss you.

415
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Attention in this House.

416
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: passive aggressive behavior when we can. You guys are slamming doors instead of sharing how you feel when you're showing how you feel is unsettling for me because of my early trauma.

417
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you both, and I miss you so much. I miss dead, too, but the tensions too much, much. Have a good afternoon. I'll call you later baby, I'm out.

418
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What the heck is so wrong with that.

419
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't stick around and continue to defend your position. There's nothing to defend, but you're going to want to do that. Well, yeah, but you do this and you know that's not what it is. It's this would be a baby step for you, sharing how you feel and what you see

420
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And not have it be invalidated by someone else, and just

421
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm issue, and you might even cheer up and there might be, you know, I can't be here. It's too. It's just too emotionally intense and I'm missing out and

422
00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I missed down to I am

423
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish I sure wish you guys knew how to communicate how you feel, versus showing each other, you know,

424
00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What's, what's so wrong with how I'm saying it.

425
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.360
Michelle Lucero: Nothing you say a perfect

426
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you told me you know what to do. But look at what I'm doing. I'm not paying attention to outcome that's where you get tripped up. I'm done. I say,

427
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you. I'm going to call you later. I gotta go.

428
00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: She is going to be stuck with having to deal with someone's actual feedback, instead of walking on eggshells around her.

429
00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You have every right to your feelings. She has every right to hers. Michelle, she can be indignant, she can be insulted. She can be whatever she wants to

430
00:48:50.610 --> 00:49:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to hold on to yourself. You get tripped up with. I can't have anyone arguing, I will lose love I will lose what the little morsel that I have

431
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So these are your choices.

432
00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Risk that and now you have yourself. You have your integrity, you have your honesty. Maybe the relationship will change. Maybe at well

433
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what does that woman look like five years from now, you

434
00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.440
Michelle Lucero: The one that

435
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:23.520
Michelle Lucero: Speaks hurts.

436
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.810
Yes.

437
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:27.840
Michelle Lucero: She'd be happy and

438
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:35.700
Michelle Lucero: Smiling all the time, not fighting with anyone hanging out with all the family.

439
00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I isn't that possible. Also, why can't that be possible.

440
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice, you're already thinking of outcome. It happens fast that will work. She'll end up. Yeah, you probably went there, didn't you

441
00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.470
Michelle Lucero: Totally that

442
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Your happiness, your mental health probably your physical health. Having watched what this does to the body. When we hold things in for years and years and years is at stake.

443
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: How much resentment, you're going to have towards Noel because you didn't speak after 10 years 15 more years of this

444
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.540
Michelle Lucero: So much

445
00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were on the receiving end of it. Would you rather hear some truth telling, even if it hurts, something you don't like about yourself because you're not perfect. I'm not perfect. When I have to hear about things that I don't like about myself. I hate it.

446
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Will tell

447
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Me I'm patient, tell me. I mean, I'm going to be like

448
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: See myself right

449
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.590
Yeah.

450
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:52.920
Michelle Lucero: I would rather like I loved that. My niece could tell me the way she felt

451
00:50:53.790 --> 00:51:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that a compliment to you to your strength that someone could truth tell and not tiptoe around you is not something once you give that to Noel that woman is

452
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Bigger than life she can handle it.

453
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to hold on to yourself, Well, she has a little freak out. But that's not about her love for you say that out loud, say that back.

454
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.550
Michelle Lucero: That's not about her love for me.

455
00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: When she freaks out with your honesty. What is that about

456
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.820
Michelle Lucero: Her that's her honesty. That's curse out

457
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Why is she being defensive

458
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:42.300
Michelle Lucero: Because she didn't see herself that way or she didn't notice she was acting that way. No that's not it.

459
00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't like that. What you're saying is true.

460
00:51:48.810 --> 00:52:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why the sooner we can get ahold of our own vulnerability or own failures, right, then we're not as defensive. That's why you didn't get defensive, you already know you got this fucker going on with your husband, so right.

461
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she needs to own it, but that's her business you're walking out the room, you're going to go take care of yourself getting the current though she's got a face for own demons your face in years. How fun was it for you to call yourself an addict for a second. Like that sucked.

462
00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how many of you were you're no different than the rest of us. You didn't like that energy yourself well she don't like to be thought of is not being the most you know communicative and mature. She won't like it. That's not your problem, you know, she gonna have to work it out.

463
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to maintain yourself in the presence of someone fighting it is not to parents

464
00:52:44.700 --> 00:53:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's going to take bracing everything you got holding the dog while you're there holding your son a transitional object, you know, hold on to yourself, brace yourself, but you are not four years old, who are strong, capable, intelligent charming wonderful woman, you're not for

465
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.870
But it can feel like that.

466
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Clinics clients here.

467
00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: We have a plan ALREADY, STICK WITH THEM plug those things in your phone with lots of good half hour of times to make sure you check in, because things are taking a long time in there.

468
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:25.980
Michelle Lucero: Okay, thank you.

469
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.000
I'll see on Monday.

470
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:28.500
Michelle Lucero: Bye bye.
