Daniel Guerrero: For

10
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: For individual therapy probably won't need that as much except for writing down appointments

11
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.870
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, okay.

12
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Today will probably be more about some experiential exercises. Some mindfulness or it might be around some emotional regulation skills. So because we've been kind of addressing things that have to do with people, places and things and sort of want to shift gears a little bit today. Okay.

13
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.100
Daniel Guerrero: Yes. No.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, right it

15
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Open up a note, if you could put me down somewhere so that I'm not jumping around and and you want you to little hands free. So sometimes people prop up little book in front of it behind it somehow kind of

16
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.050
Daniel Guerrero: Work.

17
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see if you can make that work.

18
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.920
Daniel Guerrero: Here.

19
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.700
Daniel Guerrero: I want you to slide down

20
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I follow my head all the time.

21
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: All day just can cause after can cuss i do i get brain damage.

22
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Dropped on my head.

23
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.030
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, there we go.

24
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready. And so let me just check in on on sort of the big

25
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Primary relationships. Has anything happened in big categories of job marriage childcare health of the people we love any big changes there and I've got a move coming up anything going on. Maybe let me

26
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.450
Daniel Guerrero: Oh yeah. Whoa.

27
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.700
Daniel Guerrero: All right now. Everything is just fine. I think God for that, you know,

28
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.680
Daniel Guerrero: You know, there, there was a death in my family, but I did not know my cousin, you know, she. He was like,

29
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.420
Daniel Guerrero: You know, third or fourth cousins or something like that, you know, I did not know her. I do not know.

30
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.920
Daniel Guerrero: I guess it's like my dad's brothers.

31
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.380
Daniel Guerrero: Sons.

32
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.020
Daniel Guerrero: Daughters

33
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.470
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, it went. It went it went far

34
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.210
Daniel Guerrero: Like my mom called me. She was just like oh my god so and so, died. And I'm like,

35
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.460
Daniel Guerrero: Who, who is that

36
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.880
Yeah.

37
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.860
Daniel Guerrero: She's just like, oh, this is your dad's brothers, sons, daughters, a daughter. And I'm like,

38
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.370
Daniel Guerrero: Whoa, that's, that's kind of far mom, she goes on. Just letting you know what's going on. I was like, okay.

39
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.320
Daniel Guerrero: So, but

40
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.800
Daniel Guerrero: Other than that, you know,

41
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:25.380
Daniel Guerrero: Nothing really has been going on, you know, we finally got, you know, moved to situated. And so that was, that was a plus for us because it was it was hectic, you know, having to work and then move at work.

42
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.070
Daniel Guerrero: So it was, it's kind of hectic.

43
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So you, um, you've already moved, is no. Oh, wow. You already got everything all hung up on the walls and everything.

44
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:52.530
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, we, we try to move fast. You know, it's, it's awesome. I'm exhausted but it was it was worth the movie it was worth the time and energy that we put into it because we got to a nicer place, you know, and something that my kids, you know, actually.

45
00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:03.060
Daniel Guerrero: You know they need it you know they they they deserve it, you know, and so that's something that we try to focus on is, is their needs and less of our wants you know

46
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you. It feels good to give back in that way.

47
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.340
Daniel Guerrero: There's no

48
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure does. I got you. I'm just looking through

49
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A note a little bit to see if I gave you any chicken with a self and reflect on readiness to eliminate risk factors around sobriety.

50
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Exploring next section box breathing technique. Yeah. So that's kind of what I want to do. And then also talk a little bit about not only teach you this very useful.

51
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: exercise that you can do. Anytime, but also see if you want to create any goals around anger didn't know if that was something you might want to do we

52
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Touched on lightly last time.

53
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.700
You know,

54
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.720
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I have been having some issues, you know, with I got two older older sons in the house, you know,

55
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.200
Daniel Guerrero: And I swear they they they act like they have life figured out, you know,

56
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.300
Daniel Guerrero: Once

57
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.350
Daniel Guerrero: once worked out to be 15 and once 20

58
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.280
Daniel Guerrero: And they both they know the world they know how it works. They know

59
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.570
Daniel Guerrero: They know all the do's and don'ts and so it creates a lot of, you know, hostility, because

60
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:29.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know, at times, you know, I'm like, I've already been through that done that, you know, that's not the right route to take. And so

61
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.110
Daniel Guerrero: A lot of times, it creates you know conflict.

62
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:44.340
Daniel Guerrero: But one thing I have been trying to do you know is I, you know, I tried it instead of, you know, automatically, you know, pissed off.

63
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:57.570
Daniel Guerrero: I try to relax a little bit and you know because you know my step dad did a lot of this you know his immediate reaction to being off was just slapping me around. Well, and

64
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:08.790
Daniel Guerrero: That's something you know I'm trying not to do you know and I'm not gonna sit here and say that I'm an angel, and I don't get pissed off and I don't yell and I don't talk, you know, but

65
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know, that's the last, you know, week I have really been tested patients.

66
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Then, it sounds like we're picking up on a good topic, one that's really relevant for you and that there's a lot of cool things that you can learn about the self and how to interact with teens and and let's make that a real goal. Let's do that.

67
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just first label it let's let's get a real clear sense

68
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it to come from my clients. So I'd like it to come from you, not me what my goal is that it's less interesting about what I want, but I'd like you to really see as clearly as you can, if you are working towards something around where you are angry, like a goal.

69
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your goal. Like, how do you word it

70
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.490
Daniel Guerrero: Gonna say

71
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.130
Daniel Guerrero: self control maybe

72
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I want self control.

73
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.490
Daniel Guerrero: Right, okay.

74
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I want more self control.

75
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.760
Daniel Guerrero: Meteors every now.

76
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I can see you have some

77
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.190
Daniel Guerrero: I tried. We tried to have no

78
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you do because you need in here and I bring up some pretty difficult topics I bring them up and you, how are they have show the ability to listen you you try on some of the things that I say you think about them. You run them through your own stories in history that takes patience.

79
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Self Confidence and ego strength to do those things. And that's going to be really useful when you're interacting with a teenager.

80
00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know, I know. So we're going to get into that I want. So I've got it written here. I want more self control. I'm going to get into how to accomplish that, or at least one task that we can do I put a little pin in it for now because I don't want to miss this opportunity.

81
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To teach something I wanted to that I mentioned last time, which has to do with up by box breathing.

82
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So it goes by a lot of different names. Let me just hit save, so that I don't have to focus on that. Alright. So you talk a little bit about it first.

83
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Of all of the things all the little tricks and you know techniques and

84
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Ways to cope with oneself in distress.

85
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Diet for matic breathing has been the most effective and so I can't wait to teach it to you.

86
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

87
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The science behind it. So first I'll tell you the science.

88
00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And you see my stomach.

89
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So the reason I call it box breathing, you'll see why because it's four seconds. Inhale hold for four seconds. Exhale for four seconds hold for four seconds. So it's this box, if you will, like this little visual aid.

90
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But really what it is, is it's diaphragm breathing. So when you're sitting here like this. Right. You kind of leaning over

91
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically when we're going throughout the day as adults we have forgotten to breathe into our belly when we're babies don't know if you remember looking at a baby. You see it's cute little belly go, Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's so adorable. He's not a little belly going up now.

92
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And

93
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We stopped doing that we breathe up here.

94
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you know, because these little shoulders go up and down, and especially we do it when we're about to punch someone in the nose. We're about to defend our, our opinion.

95
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I'm right. You're wrong, you're good, you're bad or someone coming at us with a criticism. Bottom line is when we're having a threat response.

96
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to have a short shallow breaths real up high on right in the long, it won't be down low, with the full lung.

97
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you know you're having a full breath in. When the belly pooches out when it kind of comes out and it's really hard to do because most of us stop doing that a long time ago.

98
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let me tell you about the science behind it. Like, why bother I air I breathe. I know I breathe. I'm fine. Like, what's the point right you like I read just fine.

99
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me tell you some some cool things about it. Have you ever heard of. It's okay if you haven't met everybody has that we're wired for

100
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, what do you call it biofeedback. I think that's the word I'm looking for. The bottom line is we have a sympathetic nervous system.

101
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The one

102
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That puts you into fight or flight you know it because it's immediately. Someone says something you're you get hot. Right.

103
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your sympathetic nervous system responding to a perception of danger or threat. You don't have to think about it. Oh, this guy is a threat know it happens unconsciously instantaneously.

104
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The interesting thing is, I mean it happens before you can even get it doesn't go all the way to the language part of the brain.

105
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel it actually in the body first and then the limbic system kicks in. So you're going to have that sympathetic response instantaneously. And it's kept you alive and I'm so glad it's there and we don't want it to go anywhere. We need it.

106
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to jump back right we're going to self, protect, we don't have to think, should I jump back from that knife from that dog that snarling, right, we're just going to do it instinctively. That's what I'm talking about. That's your, your sympathetic nervous system.

107
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's another system inside of you, the parasympathetic nervous system, which is naturally

108
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: There to down regulate because you can't think about. Can you imagine being that heart counting 24 seven always like that you, you wouldn't survive at that rate. Right. So the bonding. Yeah, the body knows it has to turn it down.

109
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.030
Great.

110
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So the body knows

111
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That it has to have this neutral.

112
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: State this relaxed state and artists five. We can't stay activated like that all the time. So we have this meat system and the one I'm going to talk to you about right now is the Vegas nerve.

113
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a nerve that goes from all of our organs, all those guts and spleens and kidneys and stomach.

114
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Can lungs and heart it's connected this Vegas nerve starts at a brand called the wandering nerve and it goes for, you know, goes all over the place.

115
00:14:52.350 --> 00:15:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And the neat thing is it's wrapped around our organs down here below our diaphragm. We have this slack that's in here.

116
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That distinguishes the top stuff from the bottom stuff. And when you breathe in and you breathe out into that belly.

117
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It pushes the diaphragm down right when all that air gets filled into the lung lay down at the bottom, it pushes the diaphragm down and it smashes the organs down below.

118
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what's wrapped around those organs at the bottom, the Vegas nerve that Vegas nerve is all wrapped around here. And remember, it has this connection that goes all the way up to my brain.

119
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And what it says is, hey, what's in complete contradiction to what's going up, up here around the stress response like we're in danger.

120
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't be India, how can how can we be breathing a big breath like that if we were in danger is in complete contradiction to the stress response.

121
00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So it says. It says to the brain. We're fine.

122
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: If this body can be breathing like that this man this human is okay, there's no actual lion tiger or bear or right someone threatening our life. We're. Oh, OK.

123
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And the feedback system that balancing that neurofeedback system that balancing occurs where we down regulate. So watch what happens. We do our I'll teach it to you in a minute for some giving you the science. So you're going to have this belly breath, it sends a signal up. We're okay.

124
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: sends it up and then heart rate goes down.

125
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It literally lowers the heart rate, the demand for blood rather for oxygen into into the heart is reduced and the amount of oxygen. This needed decreases.

126
00:16:53.100 --> 00:17:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All of the blood that was in our large muscle groups because we're when we're about to throw blows and we're all we're about to run. Where do we be all our blood, we need in our eyes in our large muscle group and in our biceps.

127
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in our fingertips and certainly not in the most evolved part of our brain, which is the prefrontal cortex. So you don't need to be thinking about all of the complex things when you're about to

128
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Get into a fight. You just need to keep your eyes called My opera, you're just looking right in front of you, everything around you disappears. You're just right here right you're right here.

129
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This breath will send a signal and again I'll review sends a signal. We're okay heart rate goes down, breathing then becomes nice and easy.

130
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The blood then goes to our fingertips. They can warm up again. They were kind of cold before blood then goes to a higher order of the brain. And we can use logic and reasoning, it would say, oh, there's really no threat here. We're okay.

131
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It is amazing how fast it can happen how and and this is this is the thing. It isn't just about

132
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone coming at you at a restaurant just drunk or just looking like a madman. Right. It's not only there but also when someone like a teenager.

133
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Gives you live.

134
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: AND YOU I CAN TELL YOU WANT TO STAY POISED AND centered. It means a lot to you. You really been hurt your story is so painful and you want to change your generation. You want to be a different parent want to set in motion. I think right this a different way to discipline.

135
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to give you time and that's what you need. I'm talking about Fractions, fractions of a second. But that's all you really need. You need that time for the blood to get

136
00:18:50.100 --> 00:19:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to the prefrontal cortex so that you can use isn't and logic and you can be like, Oh, man. What was that thing that I learned about what to say to my son. And guess what, now you're gonna

137
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can't remember when you're hot when you're so angry and show. Ah.

138
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to

139
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it by the neck.

140
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to use this breath to have a relaxed body so that our brains work better, faster, stronger, and we can remember the cool skills that you're learning. Okay.

141
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you with me so far.

142
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.740
Daniel Guerrero: Yes, ma'am. Okay.

143
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:30.780
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

144
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.480
Daniel Guerrero: I can hear you. Oh no, that's not okay.

145
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.950
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm happy to go over time, but

146
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.490
Daniel Guerrero: Right now.

147
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.840
Daniel Guerrero: I'd like to actually fight.

148
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

149
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna want to have

150
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Room.

151
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:51.600
To go

152
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want to me.

153
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.020
Daniel Guerrero: I've got some in here so I keep hearing my own voice coming back to me.

154
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, here we go.

155
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So first I'm going to teach it to you and then you can do it along with me. Okay.

156
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.780
Daniel Guerrero: You don't start whenever you want to. But

157
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: First, just know that I'm just teaching. So if it seems fast, it's because I'm just instructing so the basic premise between for this diet for matic breathing or box breathing is this you will be inhaling through the nose right for four seconds. So see me going in.

158
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm holding my breath for four seconds.

159
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding it and then I'm exhaling.

160
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.050
Holding

161
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding

162
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:55.200
Holding

163
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding. Oops, I forgot to do

164
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale at the top. So let me go over it again, a couple of things. This

165
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This does take a little bit of practice because a lot of practice, it's an unnatural breath. Nobody breaks, like this. Right.

166
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:18.750
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

167
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We all just breathe in and out right now. And now, nobody's holding their breath.

168
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple of things to talk about. Number one, breathing in through the nose. And not only are we breathing in through the nose.

169
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We're also using this mindfulness practice you'll hear a lot about a lot about that. It's a very popular word, and especially in a program like this mindfulness has to do with I've decided to focus on how that airfields going into my nose.

170
00:21:45.690 --> 00:22:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I can feel it going in and I can feel it kind of entering and now I can feel it as it comes in. I can have my hands here and I can feel it expanding in the bottom along and it pushes my hands out and then as I blow out. I can feel it coming out of my mouth pushing out

171
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: My hands collapse in so

172
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE that's going to be

173
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Something, I'll have to review again. I don't know how how comfortable, you're going to be doing this, but we'll find out. But I like to add that part because it isn't just breathing in.

174
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It also helps to be actually feeling on a tactile way the sensation. Okay.

175
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So as inhaling through the nose feeling all of the air going into the nose and

176
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What I call this sort of belly breath right you're breathing in pushing the bottom part of that long. All the ears and down there, then you're holding your breath for four seconds. So it's an inhale for four seconds.

177
00:22:46.290 --> 00:23:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You hold it for four seconds and then you're exhaling, all of it out with a flat belly, push, push, push, push, push, push in the hold it out. Sometimes it's not four seconds. That's okay. And sometimes it's only two. That's okay. That last part. So right then you inhale again.

178
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.400
For for

179
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And right and exhale it out. We should all out all of it out and hold nowhere hold nowhere. Then inhale and for for

180
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold and

181
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see. Push it all out of your mouth out of the mouth. Yeah. Hold your hands there. So let me do a little more instruction. It's a little hard to tell because it's all like a black color.

182
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this is how pay attention, less to what you see over here really turn your attention to

183
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Being mindful of your shoulders going up and down, up and down, you're going to know that you're just doing this top long thing versus paying attention to those hands that are expanding out

184
00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch. Let's just do a few breaths. Just to see if we can even do it within to your nose and push that air push those hands out can even do it all. You did it. You are doing it. That's fantastic.

185
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did it. And it really doesn't move very far. That's fine. Okay, and then push it out, of course.

186
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Really flat like as much as all that are that you possibly can, letting it out and then you hold it.

187
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you hold it out. So I've given you instruction and you I've watched you you were doing it along with me. You didn't have to. When she tried it on. Now I want to actually have us do it together. You

188
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.260
Know,

189
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: First of all, let me check in and see any parts of it, you have questions about or that's confusing.

190
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.000
Daniel Guerrero: Questions. Okay, so

191
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's basically 444444 seconds of

192
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, four seconds hold four seconds of exhale four seconds of hold breath.

193
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Very awkward, not a natural breath.

194
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want to, I want to put it to the test, a little bit. I want you to think about something recent that happened. It was kind of like, oh, I wanted to bring that kids neck.

195
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And got very frustrated insulted maybe maybe disrespected, those are usually pretty big triggers for people kind of get that in your mind. Can you picture an event that happened fairly recently. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Not hard to search for right there, right there.

196
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so how distressing is that for you which you say

197
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:39.390
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, it's pretty disturbing you know it's it's not even a stressful, it's it's a it's a disturbance also yeah so

198
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to do the exercise now. So this is because this is an actual technique. So you have that in your mind, you can tell, this isn't just stressful. This is a disturbance. So now we're going to do this together.

199
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me just watch you. And now let's have a nice inhale through the nose.

200
00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 push it all out.

201
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold, hold, hold. Let's inhale through the nose.

202
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: big belly, push, push, push, and let's hold 321 push it all out of your mouth, push it all out flat belly.

203
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it out for 321 and let's inhale through the nose.

204
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: big belly big belly. There we go. And let's hold it for 321 pushing all that in that mouth, push, push, push, push, push, nice flat belly, get it all out of their time said out breath as longer hold it out 321 let's inhale.

205
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale it out, push it all out conscious of that air coming out of your mouth paying attention to it.

206
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's hold

207
00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's inhale feel that are coming through the nostrils and filling up the bottom part of your long

208
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's hold it for 321 push it all out. Feel that air on those pure slips pushing it all out flat belly fat belly. Let's hold 321 inhale.

209
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's beautiful 321 push it all out. Exhale.

210
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 that's inhale.

211
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice Buddha belly right there, push that out. Got it. Hold it 321 and exhale.

212
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, just do it on your on quietly.

213
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice and open your eyes.

214
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's let me check in with you how how distressing. Are you feeling now.

215
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.760
Daniel Guerrero: And I'll be honest, I'm kind of quite relaxed, you know,

216
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Amazing, huh.

217
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.980
Daniel Guerrero: Right, good, you know, minute, just a

218
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.770
Daniel Guerrero: quite relaxed, you know,

219
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Another thing that's happening. Just so you know, not only that physiology that I explained to you about the Vegas nerve that that sending a signal to the brain that you're okay you can be, you can afford safely be in a relaxed body. There's actually no danger.

220
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just a perceived threat response. So not only is that happening, physiologically, but look how much concentration this drug.

221
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a really concentrate to learn something new. Right. It's not a natural breath, you'd like have to like think about it.

222
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Guess what your brain is doing is focused on the breathing and not on some, you know, Oh no, my son. Oh no, my son. Oh no, my son. Oh, no.

223
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's sitting here, focusing all of his attention on this very difficult breathing technique.

224
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay, which in and of itself works. Think about it. We get stressed, we get upset about something, if we're at work all day. We kind of forget about it. We're focused on our job. That's the same mechanism of action happening right there.

225
00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Where it takes concentration we want that we like the distraction, because it takes our concentration it especially happens when we're learning something new and just now, you learn something new. So your focus was like really trying to get it right. Right.

226
00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And you also notice that your, your stress level went way down and you get older, you're like, man, I gotta feel calm.

227
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When you hear me say, Hey, Daniel. Have you been box breathing. Have you been taking even three 410 cycles of that when you notice an elevated heart rate when you notice, maybe your jaws clenched or your cat clenched hands. I'm not sure what your stress response is

228
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But taking that time to do this. Maybe you do it in front of people. You can do it without it really being noticeable. Or maybe you decide to go into the restroom or off you know off on the walk or in a car in your room and you do it.

229
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going to happen is you're gonna be able to think straight, you kind of like the decision, you're going to have that. Oh, I thought it through.

230
00:30:52.650 --> 00:31:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I like the outcome better. I thought this through. In fact, I thought it's so true. I'm not gonna mess with this anymore the timings off. I don't want to deal right now that might end up being what but you'll be able to think a little bit clearer. Okay.

231
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm going to invite you to do to really play with this because, again, I've watched this has been a powerful piece of people's recovery process.

232
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That that they have this that they know even if I'm completely wigging out. I can go to this breath and I can be in a relaxed body. I will think better. I will solve this problem better

233
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: They use it and use it and use it, use it.

234
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I would invite you to do it as soon as consciousness as soon as you wake up. Maybe you already do a routine of of prayer or you're reading the Bible or some some cons something you're doing, I don't know, but you can incorporate this breath work with it.

235
00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Soon as you wake up, you're like, Oh man, I'm awake.

236
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know it.

237
00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:53.400
Daniel Guerrero: That's how I woke up this morning.

238
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.410
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I have been having

239
00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:04.350
Daniel Guerrero: You know, last couple weeks. You know, my wife's car messed up. And then she woke me up this morning. She's like, there's something wrong with my car, you need to go figure it out.

240
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.750
Daniel Guerrero: And so I go out there and I go to turn on the car and it just makes this

241
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.580
Daniel Guerrero: Weird like cleaning, cleaning and

242
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:25.020
Daniel Guerrero: Cleaning and noise and I'm just like, oh my gosh. Here we go. Another $500 to fix it, you know. So, my mind's already racing. I'm already like thinking the worst.

243
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.040
Daniel Guerrero: But come to find out it was just a loose ball.

244
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.010
Daniel Guerrero: At it, so

245
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:33.750
Daniel Guerrero: Anyways,

246
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: No, just perfect. That would have been a good time.

247
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.070
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

248
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you heard, you know, you'd say, I'll be right there and you

249
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can tell your wife. Hey, I'm doing this funny funny breathing. So if you ever see me look a little weird.

250
00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You get in your heads up, you're not losing your mind.

251
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And later on. I mean, you're going to hear a lot about this later on. I mean, why can't we teach it to our kids. Hello. Yeah, we're going to teach you to them because what if they're in class.

252
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And the teachers being nasty and we don't want to take it personally. We meet. We just need to get our work done buckle down focus

253
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We can breathe, we can teach our children how to emotionally regulate. Wow. Powerful stuff wish they were already teaching this in the school system, but we can teach it to them. Right.

254
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but first you may want to fall in love with it. First, see if you like it.

255
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, of course, it's easier to teach. Once you've got that confidence. This really works man you you angry, frustrated with your someone's got your toys someone's got something

256
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Doable breath work and figure out how to solve it. Okay.

257
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We want to do that before we grab the toy before we hit someone before we act out. We want to get centered and that's a powerful way to do it. So my invitation is in the morning.

258
00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: My invitation is maybe on a lunch break. And right before you go to bed. And when you notice that you're getting really pissed off.

259
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Do that. First you already. I think you you know some things about you take a little bit of time. But now you have this very structured way to spend that time and doing this breath work is going to help you be in a relaxed body and your brain is going to work better.

260
00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that

261
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is box breathing so glad to have it now. Do you have any questions about it.

262
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:43.800
Daniel Guerrero: OH NO MA'AM. You know, I'm just gonna be honest, I, you know, it's something I think that I'm gonna have to pass on, you know, you gotta be honest man there's sometimes there's just so much going on knowing our and it's like, what are we going to do about it.

263
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.230
Daniel Guerrero: dressers you know we got a lot of

264
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:56.970
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know, my family. I don't have a small family you know and i and i do have toddlers in house and and it's something that they like to catch a flight to catch new things, you know, so

265
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:03.990
Daniel Guerrero: I want to, I want to experiment with this with them, you know, I'm yelling and screaming and I'm like, hold on, let's

266
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:05.400
Daniel Guerrero: Read

267
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

268
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, oh my gosh, it works.

269
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:15.120
Daniel Guerrero: And then we can talk when you're calm. So there's breathing. It's something that I think they're going to enjoy it and accept it.

270
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would invite you, again, really, really see if you're going to buy into it.

271
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it for, you know, a few days even just to be like, hey, wait, I did it when I as I caught someone on the phone and we're normally I couldn't even think straight

272
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready. So here's the thing that happens with memory, you actually don't have access

273
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: To the memory that you need when you're trying to problem solve. When you're talking with someone when you're so stressed out. This is going to help you be able to access the needed memory in order to even have an hour decent argument, make your point.

274
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it helps it helps it helps it helps and everything.

275
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Wake up lunch break before bed or, you know, during prayer, meditation, however, you go about it. And then also catch it. See if you can actually say, Oh man, I'm remembering to do it right now. I'm so upset. Oh, we're doing now.

276
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And you do it and then you can come back in here and you can say whether I'm making it up or not, you can come in and say,

277
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, this really did work or maybe you'll come back and say, No, and I can see. I'll fine tune and see what maybe might be off a little bit. Okay. Yes, ma'am. But I'm excited. I'm glad you liked it. That's cool. I don't have to keep selling it, you already like it.

278
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um, why don't you spend a little bit of time talking about

279
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're really talking about here. We've got a little bit of time. Why don't you tell me what's going on with you and your boys what's what's really going down when you guys are arguing

280
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.700
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know what I think.

281
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.640
Daniel Guerrero: What I really think it is.

282
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:10.380
Daniel Guerrero: And you know, I, and I've been asking, you know, I you know I asked myself, all these questions like what's what's really, what are they really doing. It's gonna be so much, you know, and so

283
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:12.930
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know if you know who

284
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.540
Daniel Guerrero: Steve verdict is or not.

285
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:17.070
Daniel Guerrero: These

286
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.980
Daniel Guerrero: Asterix great pastor and I watched him quite a bit and

287
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.980
Daniel Guerrero: So anyways, um,

288
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:41.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know what irritates me most was that they have no self discipline. Okay. And what I mean by self discipline is that they don't pick up after themselves, you know, they don't voluntarily, you know, throw out the

289
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.960
Daniel Guerrero: Dishes, you know, and that irritates the shit out of me. I want to be honest, you know, when I was there.

290
00:37:49.860 --> 00:38:01.650
Daniel Guerrero: Now, is there a little stuff that that my parents made me do you know that I did my own damn analogy, you know, if I use the dishes. I cleaned up at the trash was full, and it can be thrown out. I threw it out.

291
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:15.570
Daniel Guerrero: Without question, you know, and this, this is I just, I just think it's the age that we're in now it's it some parents aren't pushing that on their kids, you know, they're letting them run wild and letting them do whatever they want.

292
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:27.900
Daniel Guerrero: And so then the first time that they get in trouble. Their parents are bailing them out of the trouble or taking the responsibility of their actions into their own hands.

293
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:46.830
Daniel Guerrero: And it's something that I'm not going to allow myself to do for them, you know, they have to. They have to be able to take, you know, responsibility of their own action. You know, there's a, you know, I learned. I learned there's you know there's there's two definitions of

294
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:58.500
Daniel Guerrero: What was the consequences. You know, there's a good consequence. And there's a bad consequence if you if you have a if you if you're doing what's good and you're doing what's right.

295
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:10.980
Daniel Guerrero: The consequences of that is you're going to be rewarded or you're going to be recognized. When you're doing that shit and you know you know that we all know that, you know,

296
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:25.710
Daniel Guerrero: Maybe going to gym, you know, maybe getting in trouble are being put on probation. And that's not where I want to see them. I don't want to see them bad consequences rewards. Better yet, I would rather have good consequences.

297
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.020
Daniel Guerrero: And so

298
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel. Let's talk about that with the time we have the way you learned it your parenting, if I'm not mistaken used it fear.

299
00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To shape that behavior.

300
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.470
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah yeah

301
00:39:43.980 --> 00:40:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't think you want to do that. And what I'm wondering is do you know what to do. Instead, do you actually know that there's this whole field of parenting information on what to do to shape behavior when you aren't using the threat of corporal punishment. Do you know what to do.

302
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.360
Daniel Guerrero: You know I'm

303
00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:21.090
Daniel Guerrero: Going to be honest, you know what, what I've been trying to do is, and I don't know if this is the right thing or not but you know I had been taking the time to sit down and say hey look, guys. If I'm doing something wrong. I want you to hold me accountable for you.

304
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.430
Daniel Guerrero: Know and and I'm going to hold and I'm going to pull you out on your shit to

305
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: With you.

306
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.660
Daniel Guerrero: And but I know it's like I told them.

307
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.970
Daniel Guerrero: You can change.

308
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.460
Daniel Guerrero: And and I'm willing

309
00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.890
Daniel Guerrero: I'm willing to change with you.

310
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're showing

311
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Respect. You are a respectful man you are respecting your children. That's really beautiful to hear about and

312
00:40:48.120 --> 00:41:04.110
Daniel Guerrero: So that's what I try to do is I try to meet them halfway, not where I want them to do is I try to lead to try to leave my home by know I go to work every day and margin needs to be done. I do it when purpose needs to be thrown I throw it dishes need to be done. I watched them.

313
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:21.570
Daniel Guerrero: You know, so like I tried, and I tried to build, you know, in them. You know what it is to be responsible but they don't they don't catch it well. And so, and I'm gonna be on the ship pisses me off.

314
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it.

315
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:29.790
Daniel Guerrero: Gets me upset that whenever I come home from work and there's a sink full the dishes and I have three teenagers in the house, and no one has done.

316
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:30.960
Daniel

317
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: When does a human brain stop developing

318
00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.190
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know. I don't think it ever stops.

319
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: As well.

320
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It keeps there's this thing called neuroplasticity is a different discussion. I'm talking about child development, a brain actually becomes developed at a particular age, we have an adult brain. Do you know when it is, is it 13

321
00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.130
Daniel Guerrero: I think it's like 18 isn't it.

322
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It is not keep going, keep going.

323
00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.110
Daniel Guerrero: 25

324
00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: For women.

325
00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: For men, it's closer to 27

326
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You believe that

327
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.900
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I didn't even know that.

328
00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. And you know what part is the last part to come online. The last part of the brain to grow. Do you know

329
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:34.830
Daniel Guerrero: Maybe because I think that I might know but I don't know what we're going to call it because I'm at the age of 40 now and I finally realized, you know,

330
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.740
Daniel Guerrero: I'm finally getting my shit together and I'm like wait a

331
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:45.780
Daniel Guerrero: Terminology to this.

332
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but, you know, it's probably somewhere. I've isn't about right, wrong, good, bad, like doing the right thing.

333
00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah, it is. That is the part of the brain. So hold on yourself.

334
00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, if our culture if if our school system, our government. Right. You notice how you said 18 you know 18 because now I can pull you into the military, you can smoke for a while there you could drink, you can do all kinds of right this is based on science.

335
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:21.630
Gwenevere Abriel: If it was based on science. It'd be like 25

336
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

337
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch because you don't know

338
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll just play devil's advocate here. I don't mean I'm not attacking. I'm just saying. Most people are doing this. Most people don't know that there's 13 year old son.

339
00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have the frontal lobe. That's not what I was talking about the one you need to really think through and problem solve.

340
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not done growing in fact that 13 year old won't be done for what another 14 years

341
00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.430
Daniel Guerrero: Years well

342
00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on to that aha moment, right, so I've been asking my son.

343
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To know how to think through the consequences of something

344
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Really way before

345
00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: His brain is even finished developing so hold on yourself. Right.

346
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What is what's been happening when you nag you can pick it up. Pick up the laundry. Why don't you go do the dishes Z right when you do that.

347
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're doing is you're you're being the

348
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Executive functioning. We call it that's that frontal lobe part executive. Doesn't that sound like that's higher order, it's like the best you can be an executive right

349
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what that is executive functioning all this organization and Planning and thinking this analytical thinking it through and do a drawing the dots between my actions now delayed gratification will will come later.

350
00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: We have 13 year old is like not even remotely. It's not even on his radar hold on to yourself. Here we go. But when you nag.

351
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You are folding outside of him and external

352
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Executive functioning. Now, if, if, on top of this, this information, you say to yourself, Oh, now I get it. He's not being defiant

353
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: He's just not grown up yet. Well, I want to teach him how to develop that part of the brain, right, I can tell you, do you want to have responsibility you don't you

354
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yes. So if you let go of a stigma, or an opinion that he should know already, if we let that go. Because your frame of reference was

355
00:45:43.920 --> 00:46:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Very much based on on a fear threat response you learned it because of fear and that there's another way to learn. There's another way for this 13 year old to learn and develop that part of the brain, but it will ask a view that you're going to have to do some

356
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned the word reward and recognition that's positive reinforcement and there's also discipline which could be privilege removal. We take phone, you don't get to stay up as late you right privilege removal, you don't get to go out, things like that.

357
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:19.200
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

358
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That will help shape that developing brain.

359
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to have to get over the fact that for a while. I'll make up a number. The next three weeks if you did like the the parenting ideas that I have

360
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It might take a while for them to believe that you're going to follow through. They're going to test it like any adolescent would they'll find out, well, because you really got to do that.

361
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And then your job is to follow through and then they learn. Oh, I'm going to avoid the discomfort of not having my phone, not being able to stay up til 10 o'clock at night. I want to be able to watch the TV. I want to be able to go on the family gathering

362
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta, I gotta keep an eye on how I'm talking and I need to. Oh, I got this. This a chart, my, my chart that I'm supposed to be working on get done each day I'm knocked out. I did it. Now, I don't have to hear my old man talking to me right

363
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.420
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

364
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

365
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of hurdles to get through on this. There's an understanding that the brain. They're not trying to be a jerk. It just doesn't occur to them.

366
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you're willing to do the parenting part which has to do with

367
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I told you, I'm a marriage and family therapist, right. So this is like my groove right

368
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you're willing to get past the should like he should already know if you can kind of let that go and say, all right, let me have a fresh look at this, I may have been asking

369
00:47:51.900 --> 00:48:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: My son to do something but wasn't willing to shape the behavior in a healthy way. I don't want to do it. The negative way. My family did it all I do is shaped this behavior in a positive way.

370
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What can work if you're willing to follow through and that's that's on you is you lay out. This is how it's going to go, man.

371
00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to yell anymore.

372
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to be this stressed out longer from my heart. Alright so I'ma tell you right now, these are your chores, they got to be done by this time, or this privilege is going to be removed and if you do it for a month. Guess what.

373
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to go and we're going to go get lessons such video game or upgrade your phone. I don't know what

374
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And then your job is going to be

375
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.340
All those throws

376
00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let me check in so far out for right at the top of the hour, but just so far. What are you hearing that seems like you like it you don't like it, you're interested not interested. What's happening for you.

377
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.020
Daniel Guerrero: You know I'm always open for

378
00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.600
Daniel Guerrero: For change. I'm always open for you know trying to

379
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.400
Daniel Guerrero: You know better myself as a parent. And also, you know,

380
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:12.060
Daniel Guerrero: Because you know i want i want my parenting skills to be able to go to my kids so that

381
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:25.020
Daniel Guerrero: So that their parenting skills will also be as you know as good, you know, like, you know, I wanted to, I want to be a better parent and my parents were to me, and I would like for my kids to be better parents than I am to them to their kids.

382
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:34.650
Daniel Guerrero: What I mean, and so, and that's something that I, you know, I'm going to be honest, it's hard for me, you know, because the environment that I was raised and, you know,

383
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:47.190
Daniel Guerrero: I catch myself, you know, doing things. The thing that my parents said to me that I know at the time was, at the time, you know, and everybody's all pissed off, you know,

384
00:49:47.700 --> 00:50:00.900
Daniel Guerrero: And everybody's just barking back at each other. It's like, it really doesn't have an effect at that moment. But as we linger on to it. It's like, yeah, I can't believe I said that, or I can't believe that it went that far.

385
00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.350
Daniel Guerrero: And so then it, then it becomes

386
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:09.390
Daniel Guerrero: It becomes a questionable. Well, is that how they really feel

387
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Know we said it in the heat of the moment, and we regret it. I understand.

388
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm offering you Daniel is this is basically how the world works. What I'm suggesting is in this little microcosm of your home.

389
00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a cause and effect. There's a consequences. You mentioned and let's just say that they start over time to realize that what they do or they don't do affects the people that they live with.

390
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And there is a consequence, you've laid it out and you follow through and they had to write 100 sentences.

391
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: They will learn over time. I would rather just real quick. Do those dirty dishes and run that run it through, because I'm sick and tired of reading the sentences and guess what. Isn't that how the outside world works. When I don't register my car.

392
00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens. Oh, I get pulled over.

393
00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: When I don't put oil in

394
00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: My car right when I don't put gas in it.

395
00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That is actually how the world works. We don't

396
00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that we don't get yelled at by our boss or hopefully we don't we don't get punched hopefully by our boss.

397
00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But we might get fire, we might get written up. We do have a net. It's very much like what I'm talking about. It has to do with this is how the world works. You've got it, got to

398
00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: live in harmony with people and do your fair share. That's appropriate developmental age, you take on these chores you show respect to speak, respectfully, these are our family values. Well guess what, when you go out into the world. There's a bunch of rules out there.

399
00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You already learned as a young man, how to follow rules and know that you're still a good love

400
00:51:50.370 --> 00:52:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Young man, but you follow them. And guess how much easier is going to be to go get your first job bussing at a restaurant when your boss says, Man, this is, this is your section. You've got these these six tables. Why you in the back.

401
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not going to do that. He's gonna remember

402
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to do the job if I want money I needed a job because I want to avoid a consequence of a write up or getting fired because he will have learned it in your home.

403
00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's how the world works. We follow these rules, some of them we like more than others. Some of our early annoying and they don't make any sense to us.

404
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's how the world works.

405
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And he gets to learn it in the home with you.

406
00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't give yourself a hard time for losing it, Daniel. The work I want to do with you and I haven't gotten there yet, but we will is getting at, at that trauma you you had some real trauma early on. Okay. And so when someone does something like just relax you or

407
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel this

408
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

409
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This is some

410
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Big

411
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: For part time a little better. Okay.

412
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hope you heard there are ways morning more mind a ways to teach our children.

413
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: what your values are so that they can go out into the world with confidence that they know who they are. They have a sense of efficacy. I can work hard for something

414
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And the world is predictable, it will reinforce me with a new Xbox game.

415
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Or money, which is an adult reward. I'll have a rewarding relationship. But guess what this person that's respectful to people in the family will make friends and keep those friends out there in the world.

416
00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're teaching in this home it expands outward right all the way out into the community.

417
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's come back to this and if it turns out that you like the the box breathing.

418
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What you and I can do is whatever's coming up for you at the time. We can either go and we can do if you want to. I could go into some parenting techniques, if you want to. If not, we'll go whatever direction is needed at the time.

419
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But just let it kind of sit there and see, see what happens for you as far as kind of the expectation that you have for your, your, your teenage boys they pick their brain isn't done growing

420
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:32.400
Daniel Guerrero: Well, that kind of puts a different a different perspective to it, you know, because now I can look at a different you know

421
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.790
Daniel Guerrero: Maybe I'm just trying to make them grow up too fast. Maybe I'm just being, you know, a little hard ass. Maybe I need to sit back

422
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:48.600
Daniel Guerrero: A little bit. And, you know, look at the whole picture and I just what I expect you know and so that's something that most definitely going to do and take time and, you know, reflect on

423
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So far what you said is, you're asking reasonable things taking out the trash cleaning, I think.

424
00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are reasonable for the age that you've just described. It's about how you're shaping the behavior, you've been using yelling and I like the talking about the discussion with the with the respectful conversation that was really cool.

425
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And now what you might do is in those discussions saying and I need to show you

426
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'll reward good behavior.

427
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: With this, what do you guys want we can kind of make a little plan together, but I'm also going to take away some privilege when you when you drop the ball just too so that

428
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Over time, you remember to get those chores done. Okay, that's what that's going to look like now I can't yell anymore. All right. We'll talk more. Okay.

429
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have up. Do I need to message, your doctor.

430
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.810
Daniel Guerrero: Please, and

431
00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:45.180
Daniel Guerrero: I was going to ask you, I'm really having. I don't know.

432
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.390
Daniel Guerrero: What it is, when my insurance but

433
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:54.180
Daniel Guerrero: They're not wanting to, I guess, I don't know if they're not wanting to pay for twice. That's

434
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's find out which which insurance do you have, do you have

435
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:01.260
Daniel Guerrero: Cross Blue Shield.

436
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have a lot of people that are in Blue Cross, sometimes it's. Did you get a letter in the mail. What happened.

437
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:15.450
Daniel Guerrero: It was a pharmacy. They told me that they weren't wanting to pay for it, they were making you wait

438
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay for the medication.

439
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.520
Daniel Guerrero: Wait, huh, okay.

440
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's your doctor, Dr. Solomon. I've got a client that's going to come in shortly. So I got to talk fast is it all men are all real.

441
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:29.520
Daniel Guerrero: Man, okay.

442
00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, let me just write it really quick.

443
00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:39.540
Daniel Guerrero: I would like to get it you know like once or once a week, like the whole week.

444
00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's the deal, Daniel. The reason why it's had these short ones is to reinforce you're showing up for

445
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Various so

446
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been showing up pretty consistently. I think you're, you're, you've got some buy in. I think you like some pieces of it.

447
00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can give it a try. We can I can I can say, hey, let's give it a try. Let's see it. See, this is positive reinforcement. So if you continue to show up for services that we can sort of reinforced by extending that prescription and let's try that. Let's do it for from group to group.

448
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: group to group and then you keep but the motivation for coming in and seeing me will probably as everyone does it gets minimizing it dissipates or like a NOTHING GOING TO HAPPEN IF I but it will it will go back even to daily dosing so

449
00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:29.760
Daniel Guerrero: Please don't.

450
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't lose that. Okay. But let me do it now. Do you need any other medication besides this Suboxone

451
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:36.690
Daniel Guerrero: No, no, just

452
00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:38.910
Okay, so he attended

453
00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Individual therapy today.

454
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Which Day Is your group.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.240
Daniel Guerrero: We meet on Monday mornings at nine o'clock. Okay.

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So what may happen is, so probably right now, get you to Monday and then it'll start Monday to Monday. Okay.

457
00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:14.970
Daniel Guerrero: That'd be great. Thank you. Sure.

458
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, man. Let's talk about our next session when we're going to meet

459
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.040

Daniel Guerrero: Sundays off, but I don't know if you want to work on a Sunday.

462
00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Not these days I HAVEN'T BEEN I'VE BEEN squeaking in people here and there on Saturday, just because people cannot get away, but the derivative Buddha Buddha, boo, boo, boo.

463
00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:55.230
