56
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.720

59
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.730
Angelo Sanchez: The person and so few and I was a minor

60
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.110
Angelo Sanchez: Why, I guess. Notice my mom and his store and wanted to walk up and apologize or something.

61
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.030
Angelo Sanchez: For I guess because that person knows they're in the wrong but

62
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.250
Angelo Sanchez: That's not going to be really like work or anything.

63
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.690
Angelo Sanchez: So taking legal action and stuff like that.

64
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.940
Angelo Sanchez: You know, I mean, even if, if not

65
00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:04.500
Angelo Sanchez: Them getting sued and criminal charges will then I'm suing the lease or the law enforcement department that should have been taking care of it.

66
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.460
Angelo Sanchez: Major jurisdictions own

67
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.630
Angelo Sanchez: And then have sure I sue whoever. Yeah, I'm pretty annoyed.

68
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.330
Angelo Sanchez: We'll have to see what happens. But

69
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.800
Angelo Sanchez: There is a chance, like nothing is done after I sue whoever rivers, you know, I just

70
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.190
Angelo Sanchez: You know, go off and

71
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:46.470
Angelo Sanchez: You know, if it is that law enforcement doesn't want to do something and then they don't do something, then I'm gonna do something pretty much

72
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.090
Angelo Sanchez: Because that's pretty

73
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.630
Angelo Sanchez: Much where the point where as the spirit.

74
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you don't want to do that, you know,

75
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.680

76
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.450
Angelo Sanchez: Like some shows just just or something, not

77
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.060
Angelo Sanchez: You know, that's just, you know, that's not even good

78
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.960
Angelo Sanchez: And I don't think are really just let it slide.

79
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.240
Angelo Sanchez: Like that and stuff.

80
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.550
Angelo Sanchez: They the law enforcement, he said they're looking into getting me some type of justice.

81
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.080
Angelo Sanchez: So that pretty much means they're going to do it already.

82
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.190
Angelo Sanchez: I just need to get into more therapy.

83
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.100

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have you have goals you know you have things that you want to do.

99
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:59.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, reacting in a manner that takes you away from achieving your goals, you know, is counterproductive.

100
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:01.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

101
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.490

Good.

105
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.580

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, causes you any more harm than you've already

107
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.620

108
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.290
Angelo Sanchez: Oh, yeah, yeah.

109
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.620
Angelo Sanchez: Well, I mean, you know, they're gonna have to be the ones you get in trouble for it, you know.

110
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.790
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah, I've already been suffering enough for a minute and

111
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:53.820
Angelo Sanchez: There you have to get in trouble for it now and search suffering and, you know, because I mean it's, it's, you know,

112
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.010
Angelo Sanchez: Inquiry, they're going to say, seeing, they're going to be justice is

113
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.970
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah, I don't really see things the same way as most other people you know I get

114
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:17.220
Angelo Sanchez: That conviction on my record that's not going to slow me down and doing something somebody at all like or something that's just going to speed up the process with me.

115
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:25.860
Angelo Sanchez: Well, say, Screw it. I'll take a plea deal, you know, everyone else has to do whatever they want and it's cool. So

116
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:34.200
Angelo Sanchez: But thankfully not you know trying to, I don't think they even want to really get me like going like that.

117
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:41.250
Angelo Sanchez: Even maybe feel bad, or maybe a combination of reasons.

118
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.860
Angelo Sanchez: Maybe they feel bad and don't want to do any more paperwork on me and

119
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.910
Angelo Sanchez: Other reasons to and why they might not want to

120
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:57.510
Angelo Sanchez: That pretty much already learned not to not to get myself charges all damn

121
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.880
Angelo Sanchez: It took a while. I did get a lot of

122
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.390
Angelo Sanchez: altercations with people would bug me or whatever but

123
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.860
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna

124
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.260
Angelo Sanchez: Be able to get myself into trouble anymore. Now that I know the difference.

125
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.240
Angelo Sanchez: I think they're

126
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:25.140
Not

127
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.730
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah.

128
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:40.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, just because you know plan to take forward and knowing what the consequences, you know, could possibly be in remember that, you know,

129
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:55.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Remember that things can go wrong. And so when you play the tape forward in your head about a plea deal. You don't know what that's going to look like you don't even know if they

130
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:06.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, whatever happens, it's like future tripping about a scenario that hasn't happened playing the future out in your head. You know what I mean, just if you just play it.

131
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.470
I mean,

132
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.750
Angelo Sanchez: I don't know if it's even after you come down to that the fetal or not, you know,

133
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:26.730
Angelo Sanchez: They kind of did something and it's too bad. If they wanted. They're already trying to start a life now for themselves because they have things that they, you know, having a finished doing with from the past and stuff.

134
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.740
Angelo Sanchez: Like, honestly.

135
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:36.990
Angelo Sanchez: They should be the ones you get in trouble now. Like a pretty much that's what's been needing to happen.

136
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.170
Angelo Sanchez: You know there's been a

137

186
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.130
Angelo Sanchez: That mean about just getting another game and a

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you identify what's this where the sadness is coming from.

Yeah, you know what I mean.

284

291
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.180

Angelo Sanchez: Now, China to

297
00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.110

298
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:03.900
Angelo Sanchez: And then I'm

299

310
00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.840
Angelo Sanchez: Uh huh. And now only pay like 12 or 13 bucks for all the equipment, a month.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.160
Angelo Sanchez: It came like was like not even a drop of oil on the engineer anything

355
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.500
Angelo Sanchez: And there's one of those ones with the engines that might go 400,000 miles.

Yeah.

371
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:08.760
Angelo Sanchez: Thankfully, it's all over with on they even sent me the letter from my old bank, seeing that my credit card has been paid zero

372
00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.850
Angelo Sanchez: I can't like it's entirely closed account card and everything.

373
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:25.080
Angelo Sanchez: Else. It's all the way closed down. And there's no way I can spend anything off of it. And there's no way it can collect interest. So it's paid off.

374
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:32.070
Angelo Sanchez: My credit, it's even like getting really, really good. Again, you know, excellent addition thing.

375
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.200

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:43.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it takes a couple of months after you pay off your debt before it reflects on your earliest a month before it reflects on your credit

377
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:45.090
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah.

378
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.840

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:55.170
Angelo Sanchez: We want to work on my credit. Shoo, shoo more

381
00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:05.460
Angelo Sanchez: And once last slide to my credit debt situation would be the predatory cash loan. I took out

382
00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.030
Angelo Sanchez: But from what I hear, like the

383
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.710
Angelo Sanchez: Person that I got in touch with with legal aid got me in touch with my legal defense person.

384
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.420
Angelo Sanchez: They're all like both of those people are all the way on my side and stuff.

385
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:31.680
Angelo Sanchez: They think that the predatory learn places like the owners of them are real like low lives and stuff like

386
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:33.870
Angelo Sanchez: That like

387
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.730
Angelo Sanchez: And like a bad ish word they both like put it as

388
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:39.540
Yeah.

389
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:46.440
Angelo Sanchez: So sounds like they're my legal defense versions are you talking about like the calendar suing

390
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.770
Angelo Sanchez: You mentioned something about that already.

391
00:31:50.820 --> 00:32:01.890
Angelo Sanchez: I'm just waiting for him to like send me the letter to take me to court. We both said don't even pay him another set, you know, they're the ones who already screwed up because I already told him the truth and stuff that

392
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:11.250
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah, he told him I was on social security and they still gave me that type of a learn and you know it's on them, you know,

393
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.040
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah, so

394
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:22.950
Angelo Sanchez: That's good. You know, it's just you have to be at least made fair. I'm going to be one suing them, you know,

395
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.940
Angelo Sanchez: Yeah, possibly mentioned

396
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:36.540
Angelo Sanchez: So either way it's gonna help out. And then once that's done probably get my credit back up to like an 812 like

397
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.090
Angelo Sanchez: Credit Score, you know,

398
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.730
