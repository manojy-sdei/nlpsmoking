00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.210
Us.

2
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on.

3
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.740
Nicole Bacon: My parents decided to come

4
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.470
Nicole Bacon: Right at the same moment.

5
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.820
Nicole Bacon: Here with you. I don't think I'm gonna

6
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.870
Nicole Bacon: I don't think oh right heart going

7
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I'll tell him you're here.

8
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.220
Nicole Bacon: I think next time I don't think I'm gonna house it. Okay.

9
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.390
Nicole Bacon: All right, yeah.

10
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.020
Nicole Bacon: It's I could feel like triggers. You know, I had a couple

11
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.080
Nicole Bacon: Triggers, gotcha.

12
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that's smart. Look, you're, you're starting to pay attention to it. And that's a, that's a self protection.

13
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I like hearing that. Okay.

14
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Not but not that you're triggered obviously

15
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.270
Nicole Bacon: Right, right.

16
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But your awareness of it can be useful.

17
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So hello how triggered. Are you right now. Like how activated, you're kind of hustling and bustling around

18
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.000
Nicole Bacon: Right. Is that a better I level.

19
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.010
Nicole Bacon: Uh huh. Okay, I'm about a four okay okay right so makes going a little bit, but I'm like

20
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.600
Nicole Bacon: Just

21
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.370
Nicole Bacon: So really beaching

22
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.290
Nicole Bacon: Not gonna do this next time because last night.

23
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:45.510
Nicole Bacon: It was the same thing about let the cat in over and over again because my mom's watching the camera. Oh, I can't sleep cuz the green camera keeps going off.

24
00:02:46.080 --> 00:03:01.050
Nicole Bacon: And only needs to come in. And so basically like I'm out, you know, hanging out with my sober friend Lucas and she's you know they want to be controlling I that's what I

25
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm confused. You could not sleep because the ring was going off or they couldn't sleep.

26
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.820
Nicole Bacon: My mom couldn't sleep. That's what she said. Okay.

27
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And is this ring and video you install

28
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.270
Nicole Bacon: No, they installed it on to their house that and I'm housesitting all the animals right now in Santa Fe.

29
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:43.260
Nicole Bacon: So, this happened last time where my mom got really intense like let Odin in now through text well and it happened again so not as intense but the same pattern.

30
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.960
Nicole Bacon: It's strange.

31
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been. I've been thinking about

32
00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom right the relationship with her and I want it. Can I ask you a few questions just to find out.

33
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.640
Yeah.

34
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Does she ever say things that

35
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Annihilate. In other words, no, that's the wrong word, how do I say I'm deny your reality. So if you say

36
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.220
Nicole Bacon: All the time. All the time.

37
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me a story a little one. So I see for saying the same thing.

38
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:38.730
Nicole Bacon: As well. The big thing was the thing that's going on with my skin that it's a little that's called merge Ellen's disease and she she thinks it's all in my head.

39
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:59.670
Nicole Bacon: And then if if it's if I'm telling her something that she's either not interested in or doesn't understand, she just goes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like my mom. Did you even hear what I said, Yeah, something about that, uh,

40
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now that's I'm a lack of atonement and we've kind of talked about the sheet herself dissociate.

41
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.280
Nicole Bacon: This is

42
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: A little different than what I'm asking. Can I keep

43
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking questions. Okay. We just kind of keep asking some questions. So let's say you go to a dinner at someone's house and

44
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone says something

45
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's an exchange between you and your mom and she says something to you and you say, oh, that hurt my feelings or something.

46
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then later on. You come back to it the next day and you say, Yeah, Mom, can we finish talking about what happened yesterday and she says, What are you talking about

47
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I have no idea what you're talking about. That's what I'm saying.

48
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say denies your reality.

49
00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:07.020
Nicole Bacon: Denies my reality. Right. Um, I feel like sometimes yes definitely that happens in varying degrees and amounts

50
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.660
Nicole Bacon: And I guess I could

51
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.790
Nicole Bacon: You know, rewarding the question a little bit more like I'm trying to think of a specific example.

52
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:37.500
Nicole Bacon: I guess what's coming to mind is like kind of a supernatural phenomenon that has happened to me and she I can't talk about anything like that around her.

53
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that. So you just gave me two that have to do with I not believe, which is not the same thing as we were both there you can see the lights went on and off. That's different. So let's, I'm going to sort of shift gears a little bit and kind of left

54
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go to what

55
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What triggers happened to you last 24 hours talk more about that.

56
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.130
Nicole Bacon: And why so last night was the biggest one.

57
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:31.920
Nicole Bacon: I was told, three times to let Odin, in which is the youngest cat. And that's because ever since my parents installed this ring camera outside of the garage. My mom's been really intense about it and watching and

58
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:39.810
Nicole Bacon: Being a detective my both my parents, kind of like being little detectives. Okay.

59
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.990
Nicole Bacon: So,

60
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But it. What's a trigger for WHAT'S IT what is IT triggering

61
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.370
Nicole Bacon: When there's movement when there's movement and it rings on the

62
00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:04.950
Nicole Bacon: The phone over and over again. So the cat was outside late at night and my mom doesn't want him to stay out late and so so that

63
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.230
Nicole Bacon: And then also

64
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:18.450
Nicole Bacon: Oh, this is what really triggered me my grandma. OK. OK, so my mom asked me to take my grandma.

65
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:28.530
Nicole Bacon: Yesterday morning to get her blood work done right. I said what time. Okay, great. I get up.

66
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:44.010
Nicole Bacon: I call my grandma Grandma You ready I'm I'm about to leave to go get you to take you and she's like, Oh, no, no, it's okay. You know, it's just around the corner, but just tell just tell your mom that you did.

67
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:46.740
Nicole Bacon: And I'm like,

68
00:08:48.780 --> 00:09:08.160
Nicole Bacon: Are you sure like what I'm about to go get you and I didn't tell her. At that moment, but later when I visited that she put me in a really weird position to lie to my to say to lie to my mom and I didn't want to lie to my mom, so I kind of

69
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:23.160
Nicole Bacon: neglected her texts about how's how's gramma gramma until later when I had time to actually call her on the phone and explain the whole situation that I felt like monkey in the middle.

70
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.900
Nicole Bacon: So these like stressors that I that

71
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.030
Nicole Bacon: I guess just family stressors. Okay.

72
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're a trigger for what

73
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.220
Nicole Bacon: A trigger for what stress.

74
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.840
Nicole Bacon: Okay wait trigger for what so

75
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's my question. So, rewind. I'm not going to stay house in anymore. I've been triggered. So my question is triggering what

76
00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:01.350
Nicole Bacon: Oh, triggering stress triggering like I want to use, you know, when I say triggers that

77
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.600
Nicole Bacon: stressors that I still have a

78
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:17.310
Nicole Bacon: Don't have full capacity to coping skills without my mind going there a little bit.

79
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm still going to ask the question, no I of course that's what I guess. But I'm going to still play stupid and I'm going to ask you what you need, because I don't want to make any assumptions about it.

80
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.780
Nicole Bacon: Okay, okay. I didn't know. Okay.

81
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

82
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:32.730
I'm going to ask

83
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

84
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so

85
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You told a very similar story that you told yesterday. Do you know that you told me that story yesterday with a slight adjustment.

86
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.920
No. You're kidding.

87
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.800
Nicole Bacon: I've had a really hard time sleeping like I haven't

88
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, yeah. Because you literally started the session yesterday with the same exact story.

89
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.410
Nicole Bacon: Wow. Yeah.

90
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking. Look, I'll read it.

91
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Client reported this morning. Mom asked me to take ground to get blood test the grandma said she could do it herself.

92
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom is asking how his mom, I told her I would go later. I want to feel better. Take Black elderberry and go over there. Mom sees the camera. Anyway, Grandma put me in a weird position.

93
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You right like you completely forgot

94
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:34.200
Nicole Bacon: Right. But then I I went to see my grandma later.

95
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.760
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I talk to you and then I talked to my mom later after I talked to

96
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.110
So,

97
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the new part

98
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You said

99
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Not to tell your mom. I feel like monkey in the middle, that's a metaphor was that effective with her that metaphor.

100
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.160
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yes, she said.

101
00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:03.510
Nicole Bacon: That my grandma shouldn't be asking me to lie to her. That's not okay. And she would talk to her about it. Okay.

102
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What was that like to address a process interaction with your mom to to address something that made you feel weird and uncomfortable.

103
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:34.320
Nicole Bacon: Um, yeah. Way better just to be direct and I actually want to try to instead of texting. Just call and, if possible, talking person because there's just so much miscommunication that can happen.

104
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.360
Nicole Bacon: And I wasted time and energy. I feel like, you know,

105
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:41.550
Nicole Bacon: So,

106
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to

107
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple of things, she said.

108
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Felt stress from being monitored and

109
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, almost like your, your assessment of whether to bring the cat in or not you've got someone constantly telling you to go do something. You're the one that's how sitting so

110
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. This is causing you to want to use. So for you, right, it's

111
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And you identified. Oh, I don't think I have the coping.

112
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:20.940
Nicole Bacon: Skills.

113
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't write it exactly down, but there was some mention of I don't quite have all the coping skills I need for it. I'm not going to house it anymore.

114
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:36.930
Nicole Bacon: Not for the time being, or I need to at least have a conversation with my mom say and say, Hey, Mom.

115
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:55.560
Nicole Bacon: You know, if you had someone else how sitting, you wouldn't be micromanaging them and I don't appreciate it and I don't really know where that's coming from and it feels just like a controlling energy and I'm trying to see it as

116
00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:15.240
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, my parents really really care. And I appreciate that. But you know, I think it's her, you know, projecting oh the cat. The cat when she's actually is worried about me being out late, even though I'm an adult. Okay.

117
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There's that what you just said there's a lot to unpack in there. Um,

118
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the most interesting piece of what you just said. What's the most interesting piece for you.

119
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.240
Nicole Bacon: Oh,

120
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:57.210
Nicole Bacon: My mind's kind of going to another place. Actually, I'm a little stressed. So I wanted to talk to you about a new roommate situation and kind of how to navigate that that that's what's like I'm about to write send her the lease and I met her, and

121
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.930
Nicole Bacon: I'm nervous about it and I just

122
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.520
Nicole Bacon: Want to feel good going into it. I'm

123
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Living with her, or just talking with her feel good. What's the event. I want to feel good.

124
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.160
Nicole Bacon: Feel good

125
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:20.550
Nicole Bacon: About making sure that my boundaries are are

126
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.710
Nicole Bacon: In place because I have noticed that

127
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:34.320
Nicole Bacon: If I'm too nice off the bat. It kind of seems like I

128
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.290
Nicole Bacon: Kind of

129
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.230
Nicole Bacon: What's the word

130
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: set a precedent.

131
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:47.790
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yes, set a precedent. I don't want to do that, I want to have mutual respect and

132
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we'll do, we'll talk about boundaries full on that pull up a poster for you. Welcome to take a picture of it will also get into

133
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you said, navigating it maybe this is how I can put things out. These are predictable things that you've seen living with other people. Maybe I'll put them out there and say,

134
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what I'm comfortable with. Are you going to be comfortable with this might be a good time to talk about it. Now, before we right so we can get some real specific content.

135
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's first let's do a little bit of weather. Let's define our terms because

136
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you saw a little bit of my naming a boundary violation yesterday. And that was just from someone unloading on you. So I have a pretty wide definition of what a boundary is, I wouldn't. Let's just make sure we're using the same term somebody pull something

137
00:16:44.280 --> 00:17:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. And I haven't forgotten about the sleep you're taking it and I'll Prowse Alam I believe it's a benzo about a half a milligram at night that should be getting you snooze. He. Why is it not, what's a you purposely staying up late and what can you do to make a change.

138
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:12.090
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I have been purposely staying up late because I have this whole goal List of getting organized while I'm here.

139
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.280
Nicole Bacon: And that's

140
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.720
Nicole Bacon: I've been working on that for like years but

141
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.750
Nicole Bacon: I guess I'm putting too much on my plate right now and that's

142
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:32.130
Nicole Bacon: Okay, that's me, forcing myself and then not taking my medication to go to bed.

143
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I wrote a note goal list too much on plate. I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to that.

144
00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:38.910
Yes.

145
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

146
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundaries boundaries. It's all about boundaries.

147
00:17:47.040 --> 00:18:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all trees look we just talked about boundaries of bond we talked about with Grandma with yourself, your own boundaries of, how do I balance self care versus achievement. I mean it's bad or down.

148
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: On your boundary boundary

149
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.430
Nicole Bacon: Right.

150
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't get enough of that learning curve in there. It's just so important.

151
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.010
Nicole Bacon: So are there like 40 names of different boundaries or a

152
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: List isn't quite that long. That's cute.

153
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm gonna be here on boundary man all day. I know I want to know. I want to know.

154
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:27.600
Nicole Bacon: Because I didn't learn that growing up on either side of the family. Yeah, I got you.

155
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: None of us.

156
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: None of us do. I think this is my revised version. It's number. Let me see if it opens up. Yeah, we'll do this one.

157
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It was when I got a number here. This way you can call it a number. You can take a screenshot of it to

158
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:50.250
Nicole Bacon: Send them once. Let me get it right in there. Okay, I'll see this lines all funky. Okay, what did I do

159
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.470
This one up.

160
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello there. I think I just moved it up. It's a little better. So you know I typed it based on this other thing. I have. So it's not quite as pretty but darn helpful.

161
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So, yeah, yeah. I think what I can see, I must have done a group activity on it because I can see I said rank from zero to five, I'll probably you'll probably run across me doing this again in a group, someday through there and one but so

162
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just take the first one. Let's go to healthy

163
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so really key.

164
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, right.

165
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you can say no. I should probably put those in quotes, but you could see it better. I bet you can say now and you can say yes. And you're okay when others say no to you that is healthy.

166
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:47.640
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

167
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel just sick stomach. You want to throw up and your hardest racing and you just you're mortified. Like, I can't do it. I can't say no.

168
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's, that's an area that that we need to work on. So an unhealthy over on the right under the second column is you can't say no because

169
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: conscious or unconscious and I wish this was a big enough piece of paper. I could write that you are afraid of rejection or abandonment.

170
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Underneath at all. We are oftentimes we are run by our fear of these big pieces my resources support acceptance and love will be at stake. If I say no.

171
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.550
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

172
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But it holds us hostage and as an adult, we have to set ourselves free from that and we do it in these small ways like like you did with your mom.

173
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't be afraid no longer can I be afraid.

174
00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: To speak my truth in fear of confrontation.

175
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: About what's going on and mixed message with Grandma, this, this thing that's going on. I've got to be able to talk and not live in fear. This is key. Just number one, easier said than done short little sentence very hard to do for many people.

176
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:41.430
Nicole Bacon: I feel like it's, you know, learning how to grow up to, because you know before I I feel like I just go with the flow and try not to disrupt things and be like, he have like evil Nicole and now I'm just like, no, yeah, no. Yeah.

177
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

178
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're going to be in tomorrow's group right

179
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. So you're going to see. Hold on. What you just said, He that one.

180
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.310
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

181
00:21:53.670 --> 00:22:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to that when you see this list tomorrow on that I'm doing unless the group goes into another direction which is always welcome to do a fit. There's something sort of pressing for someone. But if it

182
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's on task. You're going to be like, Oh, I see myself on paper.

183
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, okay so numero DOS is

184
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Healthy over here. Let's go healthy. Let's go. I'll highlight in blue, healthy, you have a strong sense of who you are right.

185
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And you respect yourself.

186
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I know who I am. This is immovable

187
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I know who I am. It's not subject to the winds of change right I stand for something, so I do not fall for anything if

188
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.650
Nicole Bacon: You see it. Yes.

189
00:22:49.920 --> 00:23:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you're in that stage right now that you're your time, you're a young person this is this is the timing on this is good for you to be really solidifying it so you're right on time for that. So even if this addiction wasn't there.

190
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on time for you've had some some mistake. Maybe teaching opportunities that you're there to be learning who you are, what you stand for what you won't budge from

191
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Very oh what's going on.

192
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.830
With missy.

193
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.680
Nicole Bacon: I'm just trying not to go to the places I've wasted so much

194
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.250
Nicole Bacon: Time that it could have been growing and learning. No.

195
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:44.490
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

196
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work I I've seen people try to shame induction to whip and beat punishments lead let that be the thing that motivates it won't work for you. It just won't

197
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Just unconditional love and acceptance apps, what's going to work.

198
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the nourishment of growth.

199
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Work regret, it's useful right in the crisis of a trigger. Like, I'm just about to use no REMEMBER YOU DIDN'T GROW during those years okay it's handy. Then, but not not now.

200
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:21.780
Nicole Bacon: Right.

201
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but she crushed it you touch the gravity of it, the intensity of it. It's right there for you. And you can use that

202
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're thinking of using you can grab that thought. Right. That's when you need to remember. So I'm not saying throw out the whole thing. But when it's time to lean into your own potential of what's possible.

203
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:53.040
Nicole Bacon: You don't have to feel bad if you don't want to that you don't have to do that one. Right. And also, I've been

204
00:24:54.450 --> 00:25:11.520
Nicole Bacon: Really trying to let go of my story of I'm a victim or I'm a martyr, or I'm my hero. And like the merry go round of being stuck in one of those roles and just letting go of any story that I tell

205
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:21.960
Nicole Bacon: And just be me and not have to prove or try to say this is my story. SO YOU MAKE SENSE OF ME OR

206
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That's me when I like that trick.

207
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you go make sense of me. This is my deal that's, that's interesting.

208
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So hang on to that but but just notice that the topic was identity.

209
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what just brought those tears.

210
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be a bit of unraveling for a little while, as we've worked together because you're letting go. You might be grieving the story that you attach to for so long.

211
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.920
Nicole Bacon: I think so.

212
00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And so we're going to cry. Yeah.

213
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to cry because, well, this is the future is unknown, and what will I be without that story.

214
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.550
Nicole Bacon: Right, yeah.

215
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I have faith. I know that you will be there and you know

216
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's exciting because once you really get that the story is I'm brand new EACH DAY I GET TO PAY ATTENTION. That's why am I attend to what I want. Today I really with intention wake up and I'm like, Well, I'm feeling ambitious, I'm gonna get some stuff done, and that's

217
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Who I am today.

218
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.420
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, and I've been happier, like, you know, letting go and just

219
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.500
Nicole Bacon: Being this like a blank slate.

220
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

221
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:59.430
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah. And the happier state the store.

222
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: story goes, but the atonement. The staying in touch with the changes in you, you write is important that you that the thing that hopefully is coming into places I feel

223
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

224
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I know

225
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I want

226
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the story and it's different every minute.

227
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can hold on to those phrases and it brings you right back. Well, what are they, I am tired. I want a nap. I'm feeling grumpy. I'm not such good company guys like I'm if I bite your head off. I'm sorry. I'm super grumpy irritable haven't had much sleep.

228
00:27:50.670 --> 00:28:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I am in touch with myself. I love myself I'm someone who pays attention. What if that's the new what if those stories are starting to develop

229
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.860
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

230
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.400
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, it's exciting that

231
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: is scary.

232
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right. I don't know what your story is the victim. The martyr like

233
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Help me.

234
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

235
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:28.410
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, it always goes back to, oh, I lost my life and when

236
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at this one.

237
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The negative, right, the unhealthy version, let's look here.

238
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you see yourself in here, your identity consists of what you think others want you to think

239
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.800
Nicole Bacon: Yay total shapeshifter over here.

240
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Amelia shapeshifter that

241
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right and and don't be fooled. This is a skill you can use it, use it to. You don't have to throw it away. Don't add shame to the pot. It has to do with you, adapted it for a reason was there to keep you alive. You can just give it a nice little blessing of gratitude and

242
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to find another another skill to use. Okay. That one's played out.

243
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're depleted. I'm guessing feeling kind of this emptiness.

244
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.180
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

245
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Sometimes we're givers gift gift gift. Sometimes we're takers, and we need to read what's the need for me right now. What's my need I've got this state of abundance

246
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have plenty and I have to give. Why then it's hello at the supermarket and it's, Can I carry that for you. And it's all of that. And on another day. It's, uh huh.

247
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And I call someone and say what's up when she doing, and I reach out sometimes I'm a taker. Sometimes I'm a giver again. How am I feeling. What do I need right now. What am I, resources, but there's no label of bad on any of it.

248
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:20.970
Okay.

249
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Number trace. Let's take a look at number three.

250
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh god, you expect reciprocity in relationship and you share responsibility and power such a timeline of how few words are in this. Look how powerful that is I'm just blown away with that one.

251
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what reciprocity is it's a cool word

252
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:52.560
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I'm balancing now a given take great

253
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.580
You got it.

254
00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:58.980
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm.

255
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Share power share responsibility share

256
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That's healthy. You get to see me as capable. Guess what I do I get to see you as capable to

257
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I am not more capable than you. I don't think that I happen to have learned some things right. My focus was elsewhere. That's it. I'm not better than you. You're not better than me.

258
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go.

259
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go over to unhealthy.

260
00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You have no balance of power and responsibility in your relationships, you tend to be there overly responsible

261
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And controlling or passive independent

262
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't you I love this list.

263
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.560
Nicole Bacon: Everything.

264
00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it lays it out so raw

265
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.120
Nicole Bacon: It says

266
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.090
Nicole Bacon: Oh, goodness.

267
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I know fun. Oh, growing is so fun.

268
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.850
Nicole Bacon: Why didn't he says

269
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.430
Nicole Bacon: It would have been really helpful.

270
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I our parents grew up in the 50s and

271
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.210
60s.

272
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.010
Nicole Bacon: To

273
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Write something like that.

274
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So, number four.

275
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll get to a little bit with your roommate here. We'll move through this. We may not get all the way through. This is intense stuff.

276
00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can reflect on it and journal about it to, you know,

277
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know, number four, you know, in the problem is yours. And when it belongs to someone else. Okay, so this is one you'll hear me, a lot of times you'll hear that phrase. This is a you problem or a me problem.

278
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your internal thought you never want someone to hear that because I get pissed off.

279
00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds like a huge problem. What

280
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it

281
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So, number four is over on the right, though. However, you really know is this something that I take the lion's share of responsibility for or is this really someone else's stuff and responsibility and I'm just gonna let them work. Yeah, and

282
00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Number four, I get the unhealthy version of that is you take on others problems as your own.

283
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:37.170
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

284
00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yes. That was a piece that yesterday thing with that woman walking up to you.

285
00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:42.900
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

286
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That says this is why when you really know who you are. That's where this is so key this identity piece.

287
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.620
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm.

288
00:33:50.190 --> 00:34:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get there through. Notice how all my examples where I feel I want I need it's developing rehearsal at what's going on with me, who am I in this environment. If this person who am I, oh, I know how I feel. I know what I know. I feel mad.

289
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I do.

290
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why the eyes. I'm not going to turn you into some selfish narcissist. Okay.

291
00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:24.090
Nicole Bacon: This is just no no no i i love the I Am stuff.

292
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:30.690
Nicole Bacon: Like I yeah I yes because it's really irking when

293
00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:39.930
Nicole Bacon: People try to start to say, we, we, and you're like what we what

294
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yes, that's a slick one

295
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I am glad you catch it little tricks to with a lot of that kind of communication people pulling into their story right

296
00:34:53.850 --> 00:35:01.500
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, at least I'm catching them, you know, even if I don't know what to do at least I'm being like, oh, oh.

297
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:04.890
Nicole Bacon: No.

298
00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So number. So, this one, this is right. That's that lady coming up to you and trusting you with her precious information. Way too soon she tested the waters that she has very poor boundaries. So when someone shares personal information gradually

299
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: In a mutually goes back up to here. Look, mutually

300
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:30.810
Nicole Bacon: Mm.

301
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, yeah. Gradually in a mutually sharing trusting relationship, we do not meet someone you know at some, you know, on the street corner somewhere and you spill your guts.

302
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.380
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

303
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to be judicious with it and careful because

304
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What we have our vulnerability

305
00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When we hold it out there all our vulnerable stuff beliefs. When we trust someone is subject to someone else hurting it like right that's what trust is I'm going to put out all my squishy underbelly stuff I

306
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:11.250
Nicole Bacon: Might

307
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.030
Not be

308
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Trustworthy

309
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.470
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, no, definitely not.

310
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.620
Nicole Bacon: And that's why

311
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:26.670
Nicole Bacon: I did meet the potential roommate. And that right there. Sharing too much.

312
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:32.400
Nicole Bacon: Gary did that and it's kind of freaking me out.

313
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you caught one he caught it than you. Okay, I'm gonna all I'm going to do is read them really quick over there. Right. And then you're going to tell me, she did this, she did this, she did this. Okay.

314
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, because now we'll dive into your

315
00:36:47.100 --> 00:37:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your situation with navigating what to do. So she already over shared. Um, let's see purse information. So you have she may have had a high tolerance for abuse don't know I'm being treated with disrespect. That was you in there clearly right putting up with crop.

316
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your wants, needs and feelings are secondary to others and are sometimes determined by others.

317
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:20.430
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

318
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.270
And

319
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You ignore your inner voice so

320
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.920
Nicole Bacon: Huh, and allow

321
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And other others expectation to define your potential

322
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.810
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah, good grief.

323
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's look at that time Sutton's. It's like your whole life right in front of you.

324
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.640
Nicole Bacon: Because everyone else knows bass.

325
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: No, we don't. You do.

326
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Not you, do we just got to get you in tune with it and remembering

327
00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right that. Yeah, this one's kind of whack. And you know why the 10. Let me see if something I did something weird with my numbers.

328
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.080
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah, I see that

329
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel responsible for others, happiness and fulfillment and sometimes rely on your relationships to create that for you.

330
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.750
Nicole Bacon: I yea yea I know

331
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you tend to absorb the feelings of others, you guys to cause yourself and pass and

332
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.470
Nicole Bacon: Says I must fun

333
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.060
Nicole Bacon: Little spanking. Yeah, I know, but

334
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you gotta be a discriminating sponge.

335
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Sponge maybe drop doubles punch metaphor all together.

336
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.690
Nicole Bacon: To come up with. Right. Yeah.

337
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you rely on maybe a screen or something. So you rely on others opinions feelings and ideas more than you do your own

338
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: See, see, I gotta work out these numbers.

339
00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.350
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

340
00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You allow others to define your limits or you try to define the limits of others. So this is

341
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Similar to that controlling piece you compromise your values and beliefs in order to please others or avoid conflict. We've covered that one.

342
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. So yeah alright so what you saw in her was, what's this galson

343
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.590
Nicole Bacon: Kelsey

344
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so Kelsey is an over sharer did she also share some stories about

345
00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: her ability to reliably keep a job and therefore pay her part of the rent.

346
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:36.240
Nicole Bacon: That's one thing that was kind of weird because

347
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.890
Nicole Bacon: She actually said she's gonna quit her job.

348
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:49.170
Nicole Bacon: But then look for a new job but us rely on her fast cuz she's

349
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:56.040
Nicole Bacon: Taking class right now but it she's, she's seen a couple of

350
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.510
Nicole Bacon: Like conundrums know is a conundrum.

351
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:07.260
Nicole Bacon: Questions one thing, one thing and then sane insane. Another thing.

352
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.860
Nicole Bacon: The opposite. Yeah. Yes.

353
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we recognize over share contradictory information.

354
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did you, how did your gut feel when she was over, sharing and telling her stories. How did, how did you, how was your body responding

355
00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.120
Nicole Bacon: Um, I guess.

356
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:39.780
Nicole Bacon: I kind of just was on automatic pilot, honestly, because I kind of go into this zone where like almost like I'm working on a hair client and we're just talking about whatever and flowing

357
00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:54.990
Nicole Bacon: It takes me until after where I can process and kind of think about things and how they make me feel and it made me feel a little bit like Barbie, a little bit.

358
00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:06.660
Nicole Bacon: And a little bit like one roommate iris that I used to have in Portland, where her boundaries were just

359
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:21.420
Nicole Bacon: And she had a lot of issues with the guys and she told me all about it. And basically what Kelsey told me was like

360
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:38.040
Nicole Bacon: Like she's like, oops, I accidentally did this and there's no way that could have been a mistake like like I'm like, Are you sure and she's like, Yeah, I'm like, So lying already like

361
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh ok ok misinforming yeah okay line. Yeah.

362
00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Already

363
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I mean, you've picked up on on the over sharing contradictory information. She doesn't have accountability to her word what we

364
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Write it members, um, and she is showing herself to you and will you pay attention to it or not this is this is tricky. I know you need the money.

365
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But wouldn't it be therapeutic for you and I don't know what the answer is going to be, but therapeutic for you right really kind of good for your mom parents to see you using discretion using your newly learned skills, not just give everybody a chance. Not that one. Right.

366
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, I got it, I got it, that's gotten you a lot of stuff. I understand. Get rid of it, it's sweet.

367
00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's puts you in danger.

368
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.050
Nicole Bacon: And

369
00:42:43.410 --> 00:43:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So what they are tuning in, is she, she's got that part honed in is this unconditional interesting curiosity about people, but she's not protective of her space. So if you paid attention to it. So let's just imagine in the moment.

370
00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If I was carrying on about these stories, right, once you do look down at your list of the things you want as a roommate.

371
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your

372
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.400
Nicole Bacon: What's your, what is it,

373
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:43.830
Nicole Bacon: Respectful me mutual respect, healthy boundaries healthy communication having the house fill like sanctuary. I don't want it to be a party house there can't be alcohol in the house because of probation. I told her my situation.

374
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.040
Nicole Bacon: And

375
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:49.890
Nicole Bacon: Oh,

376
00:43:50.910 --> 00:44:12.810
Nicole Bacon: You know when when doors are closed to respect that and she kept saying, Oh, we have an open door thing, but I'll keep my cat and my whatever and my room and my but you know I have a key that you could lock your room and just like you know I'm okay with the open door thing like

377
00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:30.150
Nicole Bacon: Okay, I just, I guess it's just big red flags and I'm just pressure. My dad's like, Well, you're gonna have to make a decision like here really soon. And I think it'd be real dumb of me to just because I've been

378
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:41.460
Nicole Bacon: Holding Back sending her the least I feel like if I felt like, yeah, I would have sent them. The least you know I'm feeling like

379
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.590
Nicole Bacon: An

380
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you're all right. So notice, would you agree, you're all you are just learning how to pay attention to the subtle cues. Right.

381
00:44:55.230 --> 00:45:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So imagine that you're this lady. That's just learning how to pay attention to subtle cues and already. There's a no. So you're not even good at it. And even with that low grade effectiveness, you're already picking up on BS. Come on.

382
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.350
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

383
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's go to, you need to make up your mind soon. I want to know what the deadline is from dad.

384
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would be like, Dad, I'm gonna tell you something. I'm learning about boundaries right now.

385
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: She over shared I'm worried she didn't even in the conversation respect the fact that I need closed doors. This is not to be played with. I can't have alcohol. I can't have drugs. She's minimizing when I'm talking to her.

386
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: She contradicted statements, she's talking about quitting her job. She's an unreliable. This is the honeymoon phase of a roommate and she we're already at like I want to break up with you like this.

387
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you're supposed to be like fantastic and the perfect roommate.

388
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:11.850
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah. And it. Yeah, it was like, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, really energetic and then it was like, by the time she left. I was like, oh, like if

389
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: If we're in an interview. I'm stable with a long term job I'm respectful. I'm listening to you more than I'm yak, yak.

390
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: She's overly charming.

391
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: She's overly it I my flag is way up.

392
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.510
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

393
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: But. So notice how you have competing needs you need money. She's not the right person. She is a train wreck that hopefully will be

394
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Down the

395
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Road somewhere else. But you get to let it pass

396
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.080
Nicole Bacon: Yeah. Yes. Yes. And I'm gonna be

397
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:58.890
Nicole Bacon: I'm going to tell my dad that this is not a good idea. And I will

398
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:12.900
Nicole Bacon: Put it on poses and hopefully pick three people that I can do a interview with within the next week and final somebody by the first

399
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:14.190
Nicole Bacon: Week.

400
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We need to go soon. But let me let me point out a couple of things.

401
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You are just learning what healthy boundaries are. So asking that someone would be difficult. Let's, let's just look at it from just the hardcore nuts and bolts.

402
00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:45.210

Adam: I thought I don't know I just in the morning. I guess I thought I was buying the in the morning. It's even worse. I didn't know and I was just

483
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:32.700
Adam: It just got real sick and then can, yeah.

484
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you a question about that, but feel free to say, hey, I'm my stomach's really upset. I might have to dip out of

485
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Run out to the restroom. Can I answer my questions. First, remember that because I don't know if remember the the subtle things with with people because there's a lot to manage when there's a group of people. It's hard for me to remember

486
00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And I couldn't you can be assertive and speak up. Absolutely. So let's talk about that list for a second because you had yeses on all of them.

487
00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, really. You can really say yes to all of us.

488
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Or were you thinking it

489
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.170
Adam: Is their way to pop that up again.

490
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but first have the courage to say I prayed up and row. Yes. I didn't really mean it.

491
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:19.740
Yeah.

492
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:22.320
Adam: It did.

493
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Play. I don't play me. I've been working with y'all for a long time. Okay, so, um, let's go here and look at them and that's why I wrote, I was like, for real right now. I mean, I get it. In the past, maybe, but I don't. I don't think you're doing these things all the time.

494
00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:37.890
Not now.

495
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:44.160
Adam: Few I thought it was kind of in the past. I didn't know. I thought, that's it. You said it when

496
00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Now not currently

497
00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Currently, yeah.

498
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:50.010
Adam: Okay. So currently,

499
00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:57.510
Adam: Number one, I would say, No, I don't really play a big now. I used to a lot

500
00:56:59.100 --> 00:56:59.730
Adam: And then

501
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what a martyr is

502
00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:03.690
Adam: Whoa. What was that again.

503
00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, a martyr would be someone that just let's say you did everything for everyone. And you were super helpful and super generous and and then someone got mad at you and you said how could you say that to me look at everything I do for you.

504
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a very powerful position.

505
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes parents can take this

506
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: An enabling sister or onto your cousin, like they can they make it seem like just because they're generous or kind they're infallible like they don't make any mistakes which is ridiculous. Even generous people make mistakes. Yeah.

507
00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but they use that as a power thing so

508
00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, moving on.

509
00:57:54.780 --> 00:58:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What about this one you have, are you still doing this act helpless to get someone to do some for you. Come on up.

510
00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.920
Adam: Yeah, I guess so.

511
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:06.330
Adam: I would say yeah for that I'm some something

512
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:16.530
Adam: And then. Yeah. And then number four too loud. I guess I would say yes.

513
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi. All right. And same thing acting compact. Same kind of thing. No, actually, we should

514
00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: act angry. Have you ever done that where you puffed up real big even, you know, to get someone to do something used anger to manipulate someone you're done that.

515
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:35.160
Adam: Um,

516
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:42.000
Adam: I wouldn't say recently know like when I would get money or something.

517
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that would have been back then but not anymore.

518
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So temper tantrum, you know, kind of start throwing things around making a bigger deal out of it than it needs to be.

519
00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All this, this one. What about this one. Oh yeah, whatever you want. No problem.

520
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.590
Adam: Yeah.

521
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I see this a lot in the therapeutic relationship. People will play Kate me they'll say, Yeah, sure, sure, sure. But, you know, you guys don't mean it.

522
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not really going to show for the appointment, not really going to do the homework, you're not really going to do that. Learn skill you're just shutting me up.

523
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That is very

524
00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.190
Common one right there.

525
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Same thing I complain when you don't want to lie about how you feel.

526
00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.800
Adam: Yeah. Pick one.

527
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you could be scared, but you might be like, Oh, fine.

528
00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:38.970
Yeah.

529
00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:41.580
Act lost

530
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:43.590
Confused.

531
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And this one, you heard me talk about this one, remember I went into more depth about that.

532
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: If you ever acted suicidal to get someone to not leave you

533
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.630
Adam: I have in the past.

534
00:59:59.220 --> 00:59:59.880
Adam: No.

535
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Activity hopeless and pathetic. That's kind of the same 12 1314 kind of all cluster together confuse that's kind of up here with play stupid tell stories. You can change someone's focused by carrying on and on and on with a story.

536
01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.080
Adam: Huh.

537
01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so really what I wanted to do. We don't have to go too far into this. It was really to say

538
01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You know was what you had sent more of a hurry up and get it done kind of thing are we really saying you're still doing all of these things because it wouldn't surprise me if you were typically people

539
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Come back online to their belief about what is moral for me and my family, what's the right thing for me and my family and they don't end up doing some of those things anymore, once they're in a recovery program or mindset anyway.

540
01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so I didn't think they were all yeses.

541
01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Not currently. Okay, so let me hear about that job of yours. Are you working. What's your boss, like what's the environment like

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:14.070
Adam: Um, yeah. Well, right now I'm only working. I'm only doing inventory for them.

543
01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:26.070
Adam: But I'm hoping to get into. He said that he needs somebody for for their trucks like for the stock will to unload the truck. Not really stocking. I guess just to allow the tracks to this kind of a big place.

544
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:36.090
Adam: And they said they get like a like a three to four day truck or something like it takes three to four days to unload the truck. The trucks or something.

545
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:50.340
Adam: But I only work though they only been working like two weeks or this was my third week and it's just, it's only Tuesday and Wednesday and it's up from

01:01:54.810 --> 01:02:07.050
Adam: Four to 10 four to 10 and it's just doing inventory this with the scanner. You just go in pretty much as it's a lot of people to that very and you just

548
01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:22.770
Adam: Scan the whole store to do their inventory scanning each and every single item and the boss was cool. He's cool. But right now I was supposed to get paid on Wednesday, but they messed something up with my pay card.

549
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.160
Adam: So right now I'm trying to get fixed.

550
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.130
Adam: A couple of things.

01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:03.360
Adam: Did you

557
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you think of other obstacles that might get in the way of getting that driver's license.

558
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:22.440
Adam: Um, no. The only thing was the glasses because my mom said to the if I don't have the money. She'll help me with it because it's like 25 verse $25 I think what

559
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:33.930
Adam: I get paid. I was supposed to get paid Wednesday, but I'm probably not going to get paid till tomorrow. So, and tomorrow. I could well I don't think I'll get my glasses tomorrow, but

560
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:40.770
Adam: It'll be a while, whenever I do like I just need to go to the VD in I could get it right away.

569
01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:45.210
Adam: They're like actually helping me like, like I said, with the car situation. And then my mom said they could probably even help with getting me an apartment or something right now.

570
01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about the car. Did you are they finding a car for you. Do you have it.

Gwenevere Abriel: Driver's licenses for

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.730
Adam: That's the whole thing is that they just, they said, Get the driver's license and then talk to them. So, okay.

574
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's put a pin, but I want still to know when to bring the topic up again.

575
01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So how about we do this. How about I bring this topic up in three months, and we'll just see if you're feeling more settled in. Then how does that sound.

576
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.590
Adam: Good.

577
01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:24.630

580
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of wanted to

581
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:47.550
Adam: Put a

585
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:07.770
40

586
01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've got your, you should really

587
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Take pride in what you're doing, Adam. This is not this one unstable domain you basically have everything walks and you're still keeping it together.

588
01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.170
Adam: Did you

589
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, did you have any slips recently.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:43.080
Adam: No, no, this one time I went like I told you, and I went back with my baby's mom.

591
01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but

592
01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.160
Adam: It wasn't with heroin. It was with math and

593
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:53.040
Adam: I just couldn't do that. I don't like that. Yeah. All right.

594
01:06:53.070 --> 01:07:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, um, I hope you hear the compliment Adam, because even one of these disruptions child could really throw off the I'm being triggered. I don't care. I'm not. I can't deal with this on life's terms. I'm going to use

595
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're you've got unstable residence transportation some challenges with with your family, but your kids see wifey. I mean, and that's only meaning if you didn't have my glasses didn't my driver's license, you have

596
01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.590
Adam: A lot. Yeah, so

597
01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To give yourself credit for how hard you're working seriously.

598
01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:33.750
Adam: Yeah, and it's just that I think it's just too. I was

599
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:49.590
Adam: I'VE BEEN ON THE LEAD FOR SO LONG SINCE I WAS 19 and it's just taking Suboxone is I just, I love waking, the thing I love most about it is just waking up every morning without

600
01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:52.860
Adam: Having to be sick or

601
01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.490
Adam: Or anything like that. Yes.

602
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really quite an amazing substance for people work in a program really I'm glad that's available to you. Definitely.

603
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.380
See what else we got in here.

604
01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:09.810
Adam: Yeah.

605
01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so right now I'm just going to make a note how many milligrams. So you taking a day. Is it 18 or something. I forget it.

Adam: To 16

609
01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. Oh, that's easy. Now you don't have to do any of the

610
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Slicing other piece there.

611
01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:37.650
Adam: Okay, so

612
01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: 1860 milligrams. Great. Fantastic. Um,

613
01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Now, what is it like it's been we've had kind of a roller coaster here. But when you're in group. Are you noticing, it's still really difficult to talk, is it starting to get easier. What's it like for you in there.

614
01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:00.480
Adam: I just can never get it.

615
01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:12.270
Adam: I didn't know it. I guess it's a little it. I don't know. I like is it is just when I if I know sometimes it's just that I don't understand.

616
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:23.820
Adam: Like some of the things and then that's what tarde went to like talk about because like I don't really understand and like everybody else like understands it and

617
01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

618
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you heard, but some people asked this, even in this list right there are some words in here that I don't even use very often like a

619
01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:38.640
Let me show you.

620
01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What just happened.

621
01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.380
Look,

622
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see like this word.

623
01:09:52.590 --> 01:10:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I explain it to people because a lot of people don't use that word right martyr, and most people don't know that one. So you'll hear me.

624
01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Or or hyperbole, people don't know that word, and I can explain it to you or ridicule. So that's why I say synonyms, which means same as and I'll say criticism or look at this one solicitous

625
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Uh huh. Or ingratiate. These are super big words. Most people don't know.

626
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know, I don't know if you can hear the other people are saying, what does that mean, because in my groups, maybe it wasn't the one you were in that day. People are asking, what does that. What does that mean,

627
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.830
Adam: Well, and

628
01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: For whatever reason, you're feeling sort of insecure around it. You don't need to because you're not alone. Um, people don't know what those things mean.

629
01:10:53.850 --> 01:11:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You have every right this is your treatment program to say, I don't, I don't know what that word means. What does that word mean when or could you give me an example of it.

630
01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

631
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.670
Adam: Can you give me an

632
01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Example of that. And then I can, I can go into it. Yeah, what you're getting out of it is just as important as someone who's already familiar with, with those words.

633
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:20.310
Adam: Right yeah that's that's going thinking group that really

634
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:38.640
Adam: But every out and I'm yeah I like it's just that is just like when I understand it, and I could answer it then. And then it's no problem, but like when. Yeah, I just don't understand something, and then like something that other people go first, and it's

635
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.620
Adam: All good and and then I still don't. I didn't know this is

636
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What, what do you believe about yourself when you notice

637
01:11:50.130 --> 01:12:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Right or wrong, right. You think people already understand something, and it may not just be happening in group and might be, let's say you're at a train and it looks like everybody already knows what to do, but I don't understand something.

638
01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what do you believe about yourself at that moment.

639
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:08.670
Adam: I guess that

640
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:19.230
Adam: I didn't know that I could understand that, too. I just think I need a little bit more help than other people because that's how I was in school too late.

641
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:25.440
Adam: But I was just always shy to, like, I wouldn't even want to ask the teacher something but like

642
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:29.760
Adam: It would seem like when I'm in school, everybody like

643
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:34.650
Adam: Me to go do the work and stuff. I worked on.

644
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:45.510
Adam: Everybody would seem like if I didn't understand it seemed like everybody was writing in I wasn't like I was the only one not writing, but I would

645
01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.370
Adam: Eventually understand it and

646
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.470
Adam: I know I could

647
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.790
Adam: That I'm a fast learner. I guess I just need to

648
01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:00.000
Adam: Ask questions more

649
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. And people

650
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to go back a little further, let's that's the dude. The solution is I need to ask more questions, but go into if you are someone

651
01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Who asked questions, listen closely to this, don't answer right away, really think about it, if you were someone who asked more questions like another guy like, well, if I was out them in an ultra universe, and I could ask any question I wanted, I could just get clear if I was confused.

652
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What would add them in another universe believe about himself.

653
01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.050
Adam: I'm

654
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.770
Adam: Late so Jesus. So can you say that again over time.

655
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I told you this is the this is one of these sort of therapeutic questions. Yeah, so

656
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I tried it. I tried to ask you in real time and you ended up kind of changing subjects, a little bit. So I'm gonna come out at a different angle. Just picture that there's another you

657
01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Who was in group.

658
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And you saw me look just like you.

659
01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: taught me how to use the bathroom.

660
01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And he said, hey, Quinn Quinn grand, can I can I can I go like first or second I'm noticing my stomach starting to get all like Topsy Turvy I might need to leave.

661
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Quickly. Can I answer mine. And before I do. I've got a couple questions about some of those words. Now once you to tell me if I'm that that Adam

662
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think my belief about myself is

663
01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:54.660
Adam: That I'm

664
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:57.480
Adam: Still trying to

665
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:03.270
Adam: That I'm still trying to get what I need done even though

666
01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:05.010
Adam: I'm

667
01:15:06.450 --> 01:15:09.480
Adam: I'm sick at the time, something that I still want to complete it.

668
01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting really close.

669
01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can do the I am really make that statement, nice and short. Just a few more words really tight. I am. What's the belief

670
01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I am what

671
01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:29.970
Adam: I am

672
01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh hey, you've got someone feeding you, your lines.

673
01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That is money.

674
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That is, I've never heard anybody have that happen, man. Sister article

675
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:47.400
Adam: Yeah.

676
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's your mom.

677
01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.060
Adam: Yeah, that's cute.

678
01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, this doesn't need to come from me, these are these are hard to get to. So, so just imagine that

679
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:03.900
Adam: Pictures.

680
01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: One in group.

681
01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you've seen. Oh, I know I got it picture. You remember when you were in a group and you saw other people

682
01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:12.870
Mm hmm.

683
01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's their self esteem. Like, what's their self confidence like compared to yours.

684
01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.340
Adam: More than I do. They're just more

685
01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:38.910
Adam: Have more self confidence. I didn't know i i never, I didn't. I never really had self confidence in myself by

686
01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.940
Adam: Everybody else though ladies everywhere in the day, it just seems like

687
01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:47.550
Adam: Everyone has a morning so

688
01:16:48.840 --> 01:17:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: See, that's what we're getting out. That's the point. It's, it's a learned skill, though. Just so you know, right over time what has happened is maybe when you were younger, you were a curious about something and you wanted to explore

689
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe in school right there was something you didn't know, and your environment didn't encourage you to just be you.

690
01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes you had the answer. Sometimes you didn't, it wasn't reinforced maybe the way you needed it to be.

691
01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I see my part of my job is to tell you the same way I was praising member I was saying. You're doing a great job because you're working

692
01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're having to keep your head together under a lot of pressure right now, I want to make sure you're hearing compliments on how hard you're working and that indeed.

693
01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You are good enough. You are strong enough.

694
01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To handle what comes your way, including risking publicly

695
01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone saying, well, how do you not know that word, and it is scary because we don't know if someone's going to criticize us. We don't know if they'll make us

696
01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.460
Adam: Think that's what it what the market is like in

697
01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:11.100
Adam: In school lot like yeah I think it just started from school like that's what it was. And I just never read since school. I never

698
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:23.940
Adam: Like to ask questions because it seemed like everybody else knew it. And, but, I mean, and if I were to ask the question everybody would just dumb or something. So I

699
01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, we don't know what they were thinking, what did they actually do. What did you hear with your ears or see what's your eyes, but to the kids actually do

700
01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:42.000
Adam: Nothing though that's the thing they never they never really made fun of me or nothing like that. But it was just, I guess I would

701
01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:45.870
Adam: Think of what they're thinking in their head. I don't know.

702
01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You were doing the mind reading

703
01:18:47.940 --> 01:19:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, there's a lot of freedom when you let go of that and you actually check your own assumptions. I'm a professional right and and i don't even mind read

704
01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm actually I could be pretty good at it. If I wanted to, but it's not it's not a polite thing to do, right, this is my mind. I'll tell you what's on it, get out of it.

705
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what you do is you pay attention to that and try to remember when you're going into group I have every right just like everybody else.

706
01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: To not be confused. I want to understand so that I can heal so that I can grow so that I can benefit from this program to

707
01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You do you have the same light. You could ask, I, you know what, I know you gave that example I still don't get it, and we would laugh.

708
01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And we would say, oh, I know this is such a hard word we don't use it very often and such a weird one. Let's use a different word, and we would get there. You can even a third time, it's okay because you understanding is the most important thing

709
01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but I get it, but that you do.

710
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.500
Yeah yeah

711
01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But that that confidence that's there that's been there for quite some time. Everybody seems to have been ahead of you, you can remember it, since you were younger, they seem more confident

712
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:17.430
Adam: Well, you know,

713
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:22.560
Adam: And even with it. What I remember doing is like

714
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:32.490
Adam: If I had like a friend that was next to me and like we had to, I guess it was mostly like reading aloud, because I didn't know like

715
01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:49.200
Adam: If I didn't know a word like because then, again, it seemed like everybody knew, like when they would have to seem like they knew all the words. So what I would do, I would go ahead of everybody to see what part. I was going to read, I would read it if I didn't

716
01:20:50.280 --> 01:21:00.840
Adam: I wouldn't ask somebody that I knew next to me like a, what's this word. So when it was time for me to read it would seem like I knew what I was reading

717
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that was a good solution and then you know the word, but the next level is to be able to tolerate publicly, not knowing something

718
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not, at that develops the confidence.

719
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. The way you do it. It's still feed.

720
01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: This idea that

721
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something shameful. There's something wrong or bad about you. There's, there's nothing you get you get to say I am run across that word because you want to know why you're in your life, you may not have run across some of these words.

722
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. I've run across them because I literally went to school got a master's degree in all these fancy words.

723
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But

724
01:21:52.080 --> 01:22:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: The next professional someone who is a certified public accountant or someone who's an attorney when I open their books. I'm like, Are you effing kidding me. I don't know what these or the or the medical terms that neuro what from from Dr. Aubrey. All right. I'm like,

725
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:11.160
Adam: No.

726
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't feel stupid. I never learned this stuff. What I'm gonna feel stupid. I don't know. I don't know what those are.

727
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I pronounce it out right

728
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So the key is, is how the meaning that we make in a situation when we're feeling uncertain when we don't know something that's the moment

729
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can capitalize on your confidence. Wait a minute, how would I treat my child right if if he didn't know something. What would I say to who you're so stupid. How could you not know that. No, you'd say, well, let's pronounce it out.

730
01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:56.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You would encourage it. And you've got to kind of have that inside of your heart and in your mind to to have that gentle approach.

731
01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe it or not risking looking like a fool. It does elevate it does. It's the weirdest thing you think, oh, I need to be confident. First, they'll risk looking like a fool.

732
01:23:11.490 --> 01:23:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: work that way.

733
01:23:12.810 --> 01:23:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got a stick our neck out there. You gotta go for it right you dive in and you see in real time on turns out I'm just as good as anybody else.

734
01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.790
Adam: Yeah yeah

735
01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But it is risky and I know. So let's continue seeing you in group do your best to do a look. Check in a little early so that you have time, you're getting the whole session.

736
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

737
01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another time to meet. Do you know what your schedule is for next week.

738
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:59.580
Adam: Um, I think it is Tuesday, and it's going to be Tuesday, Thursday, like then but Tuesday I could do group because I don't go in till till four in the afternoon. So if we could keep it for Thursday.

739
01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:03.030
Adam: Yeah.

740
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, that's fine. Right now, that's fine. At one o'clock on March 5

741
01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now is there medication bridged to today. Should I messaged the doc.

742
01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.630
Adam: Yeah, she only gave me some for two days. So

743
01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just say, whoops, you're going to be there on Tuesday, and then

744
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get there. Let's, let's talk about maybe making your prescription weekly but but here's the commitment, Adam. You've got to show up to the individual therapy to

745
01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:46.230
Adam: Yeah.

746
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you know what happens. Right. Oh, I've already got my medicine. Why, man, to show up and see therapist, then it's going to go back to being bridged so

747
01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't lose the motivation. You may not have fallen in love with therapy yet because we're still sort of doing really sort of superficial things we're talking about

748
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You know job and license. We haven't really gotten into to the psychotherapy part, but we will. Okay, so once your life gets more settled.

749
01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to really encourage you to set that phone down. We're going to be looking I and we'll do more intensive work together. But for now, let's let's get your life settled.

750
01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me send a message. Well, we're in here together and go, so at

751
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: March third three three.

752
01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have Clonidine or anything else that the support medicine. Do you have a need anything.

753
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:58.560
Adam: Besides the sponsor. No, I got some of that still

754
01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.340
Adam: Actually kind of helps

755
01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:03.390
Adam: Left here.

756
01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's everybody says it helps with the sweating. The runny nose part. What does it help you with

757
01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:13.830
Adam: Yeah, it's that both of those, and just

758
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.860
Adam: Just SLEEPING WELL BECAUSE SHE GAVE ME, SHE GAVE ME, I'M THE Seroquel to

759
01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:25.110
Adam: Oh, and I don't, I don't, that kind of knocks me out too much.

760
01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't take as much out of what she would tell you and talk with her about it. This is why well because it's a very heavy duty medicine that that's hardcore stuff so

761
01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.230
Adam: If you take

762
01:26:37.290 --> 01:26:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Quite a bit less. Um, you might benefit from it. And you know what the neat thing is if you have any depression, sometimes even though you're taking it for sleep. It can help with any kind of low grade depression that's going on to that's kind of nice.

763
01:26:53.340 --> 01:27:01.770
Adam: Yeah, yeah. And yeah I I do take this drug. It just, I guess I only take 25 milligrams, I think, and

764
01:27:03.090 --> 01:27:03.540
It's really

765
01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:06.780
Adam: And it's just when I

766
01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:20.190
Adam: Guess it's just when I wake up in the morning. I still feel kind of geography and then like when I know when some days when I don't take it. I don't wait go jobs you and I just take the clutter dinner at every

767
01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can avoid the circle. I don't blame you. Because that's heavy duty stuff.

768
01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:38.580
Adam: Yeah yeah yeah I just really think you have on nights like guy that I'm having trouble going to sleep or something, then I'll just take you and yeah but I usually just take the commodity. Good, good, good, good.

769
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: All right out of my sent the message. I will see you Tuesday morning. Be good to you. Okay.

770
01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:45.720
Adam: One.
