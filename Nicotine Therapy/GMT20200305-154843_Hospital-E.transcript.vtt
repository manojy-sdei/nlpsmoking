00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.010
Dawn Abriel: No kidding.

31
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.830

Dawn Abriel: Yeah. Wow, that's I haven't heard that before. That's great.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.280
Dawn Abriel: I'm glad to hear it and and he knew about bright heart health.

35
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.110
Dominic Martinez: Know, he just knew that there was programs out there.

36
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.630
Dominic Martinez: I had my mom. My mom was the one that

37
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:11.850
Dominic Martinez: I searched around, and I guess she had called the clinic and they told her that this one like it would video chatting or not.

38
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.880
Okay.

39
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.860
Dawn Abriel: Okay, one provider.

40
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.690
Dawn Abriel: Box. Alright, so I assume that your last dose of Suboxone was this morning.

41
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.410
Dominic Martinez: Yesterday morning

42
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.240
Yesterday,

43
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.720
Dawn Abriel: And you're on 20 milligrams

44
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.700
Dominic Martinez: Yes.

45
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.620
Dawn Abriel: So,

46
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.090
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, it is. I noticed that you had been taper down. Did they taper you down slowly.

47
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.400
Dawn Abriel: Like one milligram

48
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.500
Dawn Abriel: Oh. Oh, good.

49
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.780
Dawn Abriel: That's how we do it. Also,

50
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:12.900
Dominic Martinez: Okay, so like he had me on like before one every morning, whenever you need to. The one in the before I go to bed or something like that.

51
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.160
Dawn Abriel: Okay, that's, that's, I do not understand why doctors do that.

52
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:30.660
Dawn Abriel: The only thing I can think of is that they don't didn't get all the education about the medicine because that's not how it's meant to be taken.

53
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.070
Dawn Abriel: And it's a long acting opioids buprenorphine is a long acting opioid

54
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:53.430
Dawn Abriel: Heroin axes. They're short acting opioids, but buprenorphine is long acting, it's, it's in your system 24 to 36 hours.

55
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.110
Dawn Abriel: So,

56
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:11.400
Dawn Abriel: You have to get the full, you have to get the full load of medicine in your blood at one time for it to sustain you. So you need to take the 20 milligrams. First thing in the morning, same time in the morning, every day.

57
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.600
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and you take it under your tongue right

58
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.150
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and you don't smoke or eat or drink anything before you eat it, put it on your tongue.

59
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.450
Dawn Abriel: If

60
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.380
Dawn Abriel: You smoke.

61
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.180
Dominic Martinez: I do smoke. Yes.

62
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:49.560
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, if you smoke before taking the subs that the chemicals in tobacco causes your blood vessels to cramp down and you're depending on those blood vessels under your tongue to absorb the medicine. So if they're cramped down, you're not getting all of the medicine.

63
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.190
Dominic Martinez: Oh wow, I never knew that. Oh.

64
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.610
Yeah.

65
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:05.040
Dawn Abriel: It, it's it really makes the difference. Sometimes like one or one and a half milligrams of the of the drug.

66
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:14.760
Dawn Abriel: People say, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And I asked him, Well, did you smoke before. And that's almost always the answer.

67
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.460
Dawn Abriel: Is mostly for taking their sub

68
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.540
Dominic Martinez: Or even needing to fill it does the same thing.

69
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:36.210
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, because it gets mixed up with the food, you have to have. You just have to let the saliva dissolve it under your tongue for a good two minutes.

70
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.580
Dawn Abriel: Because as soon as as soon as it hits the top of your tongue. It's degraded.

71
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.040
Dawn Abriel: It's broken up in and you don't get the effect of it.

72
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.480
All so

73
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.330
Dominic Martinez: Don't drink don't smoke. Before I take

74
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.410
Dawn Abriel: Correct, yeah.

75
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.590
Dominic Martinez: If I do. Should I like wait like 15 minutes after I smoke or eat or drink order.

76
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:05.280
Dawn Abriel: Well, yeah, you want you want to make wait at least 15 minutes after you take yourself before you

77
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.410
Dawn Abriel: eat or drink.

78
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.520
Okay.

79
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:17.880
Dawn Abriel: And I'm assuming you developed tolerance and dependence on the medicine, most people do. You had to take more and more

80
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:18.960
Dominic Martinez: Yeah.

81
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.420
Dawn Abriel: Were you ever an IV drug user

82
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.140
Dominic Martinez: I'm like needle.

83
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:25.950
Dawn Abriel: Uh huh.

84
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:27.090
Yeah.

85
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.150
Dawn Abriel: Any medical complications from the IV drug use any abscesses or

86
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.010
Dawn Abriel: heart diseases from it.

87
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.910
Dawn Abriel: Contamination any legal problems from the drug use.

88
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.450
Dawn Abriel: And ever have any overdoses.

89
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.500
No.

90
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.010
Dawn Abriel: One lucky guy.

91
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:57.480
Dominic Martinez: Yeah, I mean for my dealer to be, you know, trying to get me off of it must show me something. Right.

92
00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:58.470
Yeah.

93
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.570
Dawn Abriel: And how old were you when you first started using any kind of substance.

94
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.510
Dominic Martinez: Because maybe like 16 when I tried marijuana

95
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.140
Okay.

96
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.650
Dawn Abriel: And has your drug use resulted in problems with relationships in work.

97
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.570
Dominic Martinez: Work yeah not relationships will work. Yeah.

98
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.140
Dawn Abriel: And this is

99
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:36.690
Dawn Abriel: Dr.

100
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.810
Dawn Abriel: Sergio

101
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.930
Dawn Abriel: Harry that is that his name.

102
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:49.830
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. Yeah. Does he have a program or it was just a doctor who was giving you the medicine.

103
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:59.280
Dominic Martinez: It was a it was a program that I was wanting to every month, I would go into his office and have a meeting with them, take a drug test and then. Yeah.

104
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:06.660
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so that it didn't include psychotherapy. It didn't include group work.

105
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.370
Dominic Martinez: No, I mean, I could have done the the

106
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:22.830
Dominic Martinez: The therapy and all that. It was my choice to do that. But, you know, he saw that there was nothing really emotionally or physically wrong with me, so you know

107
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:36.840
Dawn Abriel: And so you understand that this program you're signing up for one hour a week of group plus one hour a week of individual therapy. That's what this program is about

108
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.350
Dawn Abriel: So,

109
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.830
Dawn Abriel: You may not think you have emotional problems. But, you know, writing that

110
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:59.520
Dawn Abriel: You know, you use the drugs to get away from the pain that life offered you means there is some life skills, you still have to be learning

111
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.450
Yeah.

112
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.200
Dawn Abriel: And that's what the therapy does so.

113
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:06.900
Dominic Martinez: So,

114
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.690

Dawn Abriel: Not yet. There was a let me. Yeah. Now I see it. And the other side.

361
00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.790
Dominic Martinez: Okay, just a moment. Again,

362
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.350
Dawn Abriel: Good. Okay, you know,

363
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:11.070
Dawn Abriel: You have this same sheets on that bed that I used to have many years ago. It's funny, I recognize

364
00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:22.020
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so let's talk about the program.

365
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:28.020
Dawn Abriel: Because you work. So what are your hours of work.

366
00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.060
Dominic Martinez: I'm like nine to four easily

367
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:34.530
Okay.

368
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:47.190
Dawn Abriel: So you're going to want a night group, I assume, unless you want to do an early morning seven o'clock group.

369
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.720
Dominic Martinez: You know what the evening, I'd be a lot better.

370
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:53.880
Dominic Martinez: Okay.

371
00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.300
Dawn Abriel: So let's put you on Monday night.

372
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.150
Dawn Abriel: At

373
00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.420
Dawn Abriel: Six o'clock group.

374
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:12.840
Dawn Abriel: And that's with Jessica peer Bailey is the therapist name.

375
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.780
Dawn Abriel: And

376
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:28.890
Dawn Abriel: When you come to group it has to be like this. Good lighting where we can see we can read your facial expressions you absolutely positively no exception must be alone.

377
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.680
Dawn Abriel: There cannot be anyone walking around.

378
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:52.710
Dawn Abriel: You can imagine if someone saw the screen and saw someone they knew what a violation of privacy. That would be so there can't be anyone. We asked people to use earbuds just in case. So that someone can't accidentally hear what another person is saying so.

379
00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.540
Dawn Abriel: If you have, that would be great.

380
00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:14.400
Dawn Abriel: And before every group, you have to fill out a form called a bam ba n. It's a brief addiction monitor. It's similar to one of the forms you filled out but it allows me to read your

381
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.960
Dawn Abriel: How you're doing in the program because people can't talk about everything in group right so

382
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:29.190
Dawn Abriel: In order for me to really understand what's going on for you. I read every single one from. Every patient, every week.

383
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:41.550
Dawn Abriel: So I really take it seriously because this way. I don't miss things if I see that your, your score on sleep is going up, I will take you aside and see if we can do something about that.

384
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:58.890
Dawn Abriel: Or anything else that's going on that you're answering questions too. But so that has to be done before group, otherwise you'll have to do it and you you'll be late for group and you get your prescription. When you come to group.

385
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.900
Dominic Martinez: Okay, so

386
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.230
Yeah.

387
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.400
Dawn Abriel: So it's an hour long. Yeah.

388
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.060
Dawn Abriel: Go ahead.

389
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.900
Dominic Martinez: Um, so I won't get a prescription. Now after

390
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.950
Dawn Abriel: I'll give you a prescription. I'll give you a script that will get you to Monday.

391
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.970
Dominic Martinez: Okay.

392
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:21.600
Dawn Abriel: Okay, thank you again and you know you keep your appointments and you're doing well in the program.

393
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:28.290
Dawn Abriel: In a couple of months, we can move you to every two weeks, or once a month depending on how you're doing.

394
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.380
Dawn Abriel: And it sounds like you're going to progress like that pretty quickly because

395
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.150
Dawn Abriel: We've been doing this for so long.

396
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:53.550
Dawn Abriel: So right after you get done with me. I want you to go back to the virtual clinic, the virtual clinic that that zoom room where the care coordinator, you know, got all your information.

397
00:36:53.940 --> 00:37:09.180
Dawn Abriel: They are the go to people for any problems, you need to get ahold of the therapist, you need to get ahold of the doc something's going on with the pharmacy, you go to them first and then they have ways of getting ahold of us to solve your problems.

398
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.860
Dominic Martinez: Okay. Alrighty.

399
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:21.000
Dawn Abriel: And so when you go back to the virtual clinic after we get through talking, you're going to do two things. You're going to say, tell me how to do that. BAM thing.

400
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:38.550
Dawn Abriel: And one more survey called the adverse childhood experiences. It's just 10 questions one time. Just do it, get it over with. It gives us a real good idea of what your early childhood stressors were so

401
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.860
Dawn Abriel: We ask everyone to do that.

402
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:51.960
Dawn Abriel: I will be giving you a prescription for Narcan by law. Whenever we prescribe buprenorphine. We have to prescribe Narcan did you gather doctor do that.

403
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:59.880
Dominic Martinez: Yeah, yeah. And actually, I will give the Narcan to, you know, I would see druggies walking around, and I would give her

404
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.690
Dawn Abriel: Perfect. That is exactly what it's for.

405
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:04.530
Yeah.

406
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:13.710
Dawn Abriel: And I do, what are called E prescriptions electronic prescriptions. So you'll never get a piece of paper.

407
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:15.960
Dawn Abriel: And I

408
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:24.600
Dawn Abriel: I submit it. And sometimes it can take 1520 minutes because

409
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.390
Dawn Abriel: Perhaps all of the electronic prescriptions.

410
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:32.910
Dawn Abriel: Go to Philadelphia and then they get, spit out to the individual pharmacies.

411
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:45.360
Dawn Abriel: Okay, that sometimes doctors are all prescribing at the same time, I guess that's what was explained to me one time I it seemed like it was taking longer than it should. And that's what they told me

412
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.130
Dawn Abriel: So,

413
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:55.320
Dawn Abriel: I really recommend that you call and say, Is my E prescription packaged ready for me.

414
00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.540
Dominic Martinez: All right.

415
00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.550
Dominic Martinez: And that's going to be in the Walmart in Britain, Leo or

416
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:11.130
Dawn Abriel: Whatever one whatever one you told the care coordinator. She wrote down. It's in your chart, it automatically comes up to that one. So,

417
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.510
Dawn Abriel: Whatever you told her.

418
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.040
Dawn Abriel: Or him.

419
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:23.820
Dawn Abriel: And every month you'll get one in a row, all kinds of things flew at me.

420
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:30.600
Dawn Abriel: A manila envelope like this in the mail really make sure that

421
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:49.320
Dawn Abriel: Bright heart health has the address where you are. If you change addresses MC bright heart health. The first people you call and say, I need to tell you my new address because if you don't get one of these. And what is it will have a urine drug cup in it like this.

422
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.660
Dawn Abriel: When you get the package.

423
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:59.220
Dawn Abriel: Do not open it. If you open it. They don't count it. It's not valid. They won't use it, they'll send you to a lab.

424
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:00.810
Dawn Abriel: So,

425
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:10.680
Dawn Abriel: This will happen once a month. So you just get it in the mail. And when you have a minute, you go to bright heart health virtual clinic and you say, Hey, I have one of these. What do I do with it.

426
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.430
Dawn Abriel: I forgot to turn this off with

427
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.220
