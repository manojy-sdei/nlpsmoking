Gwenevere Abriel: And how have you been doing

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:23.670
Samantha Scott: I feel like I'm doing pretty good. Um, I mean in terms of the in terms of the drugs and craving and stuff. I mean, I feel like I'm doing really well.

19
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.720
Samantha Scott: You know, like

20
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:39.690
Samantha Scott: I'm just not even focusing on that so much. I just take my medication. And then I'm trying to refocus and work on. You know what I'm trying to work on like my coping mechanisms and what I can control and

21
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.440
Samantha Scott: I've been doing some writing and

22
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.920
Samantha Scott: Just trying to be honest with myself, you know, and kind and

23
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.540
Samantha Scott: And then all the other stuff, you know, the

24
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Pandemic yes i mean you gotta leave room for panic. Don't forget to panic also

25
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.720
Samantha Scott: Don't forget

26
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:10.500
Samantha Scott: Come on. Yeah, I know. And I definitely do. Still, I mean, I definitely don't want to go out, you know, there's gonna there's a, you know, they're starting to reopen and

27
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:22.800
Samantha Scott: You know, I don't. I mean, I think it'll be a while before I feel comfortable going out and sitting in a dining room or something but but maybe I'm but I don't know, you know,

28
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.880
Samantha Scott: But also don't want the economy to get any worse.

29
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, my gosh, it's very cordial. Our economy is fragile, you have to be delicate

30
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.340
Samantha Scott: Already got so many people like out of work, you know, so

31
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.110
Samantha Scott: Boo.

32
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can't help so i think i think this will be welcome. But literally, I shouldn't be talking about anything like this, but I have a feeling that you'll you might like it. I don't know, I just have

33
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was like, you know, I wish it was in a country that what my government would do is they would take the shit ton of

34
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Money.

35
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: They have and they would put everyone who's out of work building something

36
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Totally frickin you

37
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.110
Samantha Scott: CPT like my grandpa was in the CC CP the Civilian Conservation Corps and they going

38
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.040
Samantha Scott: Good people

39
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:30.210
Samantha Scott: Yeah, the WPA. I mean, that stuff's all had a lasting impact to on like society and culture. You know, so yeah.

40
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.480
Samantha Scott: We'll see.

41
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not going to happen. That's not. Yeah.

42
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.650
Samantha Scott: But it's a really nice idea. I totally agree.

43
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we are very bright creatures we can

44
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Can build a

45
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Bomb.

46
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.850
Samantha Scott: Right, yeah.

47
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: We can do like how we can look at all the amazing science. I don't understand how this works. I mean, we're smart, but we're still

48
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.190
Samantha Scott: Totally, yeah.

49
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay, so my rants over

50
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.820
Samantha Scott: A lot. No, no. And I think it ties into what a lot of people are feeling like lately I've been thinking about, like,

51
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:18.450
Samantha Scott: How now, I'm making a living wage by being on unemployment, with the $600 stimulus thing.

52
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.210
Samantha Scott: And so now I'm making about like 15 to $17 an hour by not working.

53
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:37.590
Samantha Scott: Which is probably the most have made in my adult life. And then it's just weird, like we're on food stamps, we got on that. And they're like, No, now you're making too much on unemployment, you're making a living wage.

54
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.510
Samantha Scott: But luckily Medicare doesn't count that.

55
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:58.890
Samantha Scott: Unemployment income. So my Medicare my insurance is safe and everything, but it's just I can't imagine that I'm alone and thinking that we don't really want to go back to the same normal that we were doing before, you know,

56
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:11.340
Samantha Scott: Because we weren't making enough money. I could never afford therapy or had time for therapy. You know, it's like, but, um, but I'm glad I'm here and

57
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:22.920
Samantha Scott: And I feel like I'm doing a lot better. You know, I mean, I'm still having lots of, you know, I mean, it's still really stressful. So having a hard time communicating, sometimes with my husband.

58
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.820
Samantha Scott: Well, we're

59
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.600
Here.

60
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a deep breath and

61
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: One more, one more, one more.

62
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.610
Samantha Scott: Let me say one real one.

63
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like a real

64
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A real settle in to to do some meaningful work here today.

65
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.880
meaningful for you.

66
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Still having a difficult time and so

67
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.810
Samantha Scott: So yeah, I mean,

68
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.950
Samantha Scott: One of the things is that just these, um,

69
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:09.450
Samantha Scott: I've been doing some reading to about just Narcissus sense, stuff like that. And it's like, with my mom. And it's like, I feel like one. I'm so

70
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:21.300
Samantha Scott: One of the big things is that I'm so attuned to everything he does and said that I miss interpret and I project meaning on to it.

71
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:31.710
Samantha Scott: And then I start acting out the same sorts of things that she did, which is if you're passionately arguing, you know, that's fine. And

72
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:52.440
Samantha Scott: You know what I need to win and and I don't even want to be like that, you know, um, I don't want to fight anymore and I don't want but it feels normal. It feels like somehow it feels like when I get angry. It feels normal, but I don't want it to be normal, you know,

73
00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I do and we don't need to move anywhere. Beyond that, but turn check in with yourself and I'm going to say it back to you and you sort of assess is that were meaningful investment will be here today. So it'll be around this space.

74
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And holding it and really maybe coming away today with a deeper understanding of

75
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This way of passionately arguing a point

76
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Being, you know, angry passionately arguing needing to win is familiar

77
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And there are times when you are so attuned to other you know husband right

78
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.050
Samantha Scott: Then remember to be your

79
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah, whoever it is that know

80
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That the default is that comfort that you can get into it, just with in a split second. And what ends up happening, you've noticed is sometimes you've misinterpreted. You thought you were attuned

81
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you misinterpreted.

82
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:14.190
Samantha Scott: Totally like taking personally things like when somebody gets frustrated because they're paying or something like that. And there are and then taking that personally just because I happen to be there.

83
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.660
Samantha Scott: You know, and I, I know I shouldn't, but I do

84
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.750
Samantha Scott: And I can't seem to. I mean, I guess the answer is just keep trying.

85
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, but wait, what's familiar is this way of me.

86
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you turn your attention to this other way of being, what is it, what do you think it is.

87
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:43.260
Samantha Scott: I think it's a little for one not taking everything personally and for to

88
00:08:45.120 --> 00:09:01.290
Samantha Scott: Trying to learn better strategies for communicating so that I don't project or fortune tell or anything, you know, besides like actually ask in a way that's respectful unkind.

89
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you mean you sound. I mean just just straight out of a psychology book you sound so like you've got it all figured out.

90
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.040
Samantha Scott: But somehow I still can't do it. So that's

91
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.620
Samantha Scott: Not very helpful.

92
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's good. It's a good start.

93
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Because when I asked you, I wondered, do you know where you're going. So this is what's familiar if you're about to go on a journey you have some idea of a map and you have a bit of a map.

94
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.380
Samantha Scott: That's what I imagined it to be. Yeah.

95
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so the map for some people is spirituality. Some people at psychology, maybe astrology offers some mapping

96
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm familiar with it.

97
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's there. So it's but it's a map and I like that metaphor, because

98
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: My GPS like on my fancy phone. It's like, not the same as as the terrain, meaning it weren't for me.

99
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the same as all this stimulation that's coming at me. Or there's so much coming at me.

100
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right cars, restaurants, I can barely can I see the sign. From here, my eyes are, sir.

101
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It is not the same as me having to navigate the terrain.

102
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:25.950
Samantha Scott: Totally. I totally hear that I don't drive because I just am too terrified. It's I'm scared to ride in the car because

103
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:34.020
Samantha Scott: Ever since we got into I got into a car accident with my mom when I was 14 we went off a levee

104
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:52.020
Samantha Scott: In Louisiana. You know what I mean, like, where there's like it goes down to the river, we hit a bunch of trees that stopped us halfway in the water. It was like this Mitsubishi Colt like a tin can. And ever since then I tried to learn how to drive when I was younger and

105
00:10:53.160 --> 00:11:08.280
Samantha Scott: I just, it's hard for me to even ride in a car, even with good drivers, you know, I just constantly feel like we're going to be hit and I constantly feel like I'm waiting for I'm you know I'm putting the brake on on the passenger side, you know,

106
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't know that. I hope you don't mind. Let me tell you what I just did.

107
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.200
Samantha Scott: I was fine, I realized I never told you I probably

108
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.790
Samantha Scott: Told you. A lot of stuff.

109
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So I took that that story. You just told me, and I put it inside of what I call the thermometer. It's a subjective unit of distress. That's that robot thing.

110
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I put it in there, but I i put age 14 yeah or accident landed in a levy in Louisiana. It's hard for me to drive in a car and constantly thinking I might be hit

111
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.710
Samantha Scott: Yeah, totally.

112
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm just talking about it right now. Can I put it in the right place. As far as the activation how activating. Is it just to even talk about it from zero to 100

113
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.060
Samantha Scott: I mean, from zero to 100

114
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.540
Samantha Scott: Right now it doesn't feel like a lot. It feels like a

115
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: 2525 okay let me move it. I had it randomly somewhere, let's go to 25

116
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:19.230
Samantha Scott: I mean, but when I'm actually in the car. Hey, cuz to 75 to nine.

117
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me add that, when in car 75 to 90. Okay, so I've got some ideas. Later on, for us to maybe do some of the the somatic transformation work that comes out of Peter Levine's

118
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Work where we actually address that incident, but you can say, No, you don't. You don't have to

119
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.080
Samantha Scott: No, no, I started reading one why checked out a book and I only read a little bit of it.

120
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:56.640
Samantha Scott: About some of that about the somatic stuff, but I really liked what I read in the intro, which was basically that a lot of pre verbal

121
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.290
Samantha Scott: A lot of pre verbal stuff, which I feel like is a lot of the stuff

122
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.160
Samantha Scott: I maybe can access or whatever, but I know it's there. So,

123
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. So take what you just said. So we'll kind of put aside the story with them with the levee for a moment factor it organic

124
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's come back to maybe it's preferable hold on to that for a moment.

125
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, as, how likely is it that abruptly. Your mother became will use the word narcissist just because it's easy to communicate from there. How likely is it that it appropriately came about when you were eight

126
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.430
Samantha Scott: Miriam lightly so

127
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It may have been there.

128
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:37.590
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

129
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The whole time.

130
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:49.620
Samantha Scott: Right. And I mean sometimes I wonder if, like, I mean, I don't want to be like, Oh, I've got repressed memories or whatever. But, I mean, the mind does work in weird ways and it protects us

131
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:57.990
Samantha Scott: You know, from things. And I'm not saying I having those, but I'm also saying I don't remember like stuff I read about in that intro like

132
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:11.940
Samantha Scott: When you cry. What did your parents do and then the next time you cried. What did your parents do and stuff like that. It's like I kind of doubt she was constantly interested in patient with me, if anything,

133
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.380
Samantha Scott: You know,

134
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so that's it you're onto it. So add this piece that you didn't say which is I didn't know how to speak as a new and it didn't know how to speak right so 18 months or whatever those months word

135
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Love it on

136
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what but. So there you are, and your pre verbal

137
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:32.460
Samantha Scott: Right.

138
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's you're still responding to and your environment.

139
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.180
Samantha Scott: Sorry, I just have to let my dog off the

140
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Air. Yeah.

141
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.000
Samantha Scott: There you go.

142
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.990
Samantha Scott: Okay cuz she's too short. She's Corgi so she has short legs. She can't jump off.

143
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.110
Samantha Scott: Um, yeah.

144
00:14:53.970 --> 00:15:04.500
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I feel like, well, and even after that, I mean, even if I could talk a little bit. I mean, I definitely wasn't able to express myself. We really are cogently you know from like 18 months to

145
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.780
Samantha Scott: What now.

146
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well that's where the compassion comes in. That's where we we can say, wait a minute.

147
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I'm not broken. What if there's nothing flawed or deficient in me.

148
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But if my reaction to my husband was adaptive when I was, you know, six months 12 months age to what, what if that was adaptive. What if I am here today and I survived because I was attuned to the facial expression and the change in tone.

149
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.490
Samantha Scott: Right, right. That's big for me that's really big.

150
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.420
Yeah.

151
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So there's something about the time

152
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm curious about what the tone is have you noticed that

153
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.400
Samantha Scott: There's a dark if it's critical. If it's impatient.

154
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.360
Samantha Scott: Judgmental dismissive.

155
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.410
Samantha Scott: Those are the ones that really

156
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.310
Samantha Scott: Cut me to the core, you know,

157
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Now dismissive.

158
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to learn more about this time.

159
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to imitate it

160
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:33.060
Samantha Scott: Yeah, not really. I mean, basically. Okay. I think the best way describe it would be harsh.

161
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:37.710
Samantha Scott: Um, and a brusque

162
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.380
Samantha Scott: Angry

163
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.330
Samantha Scott: And

164
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:52.200
Samantha Scott: What heart brush angry and impatient. Those are the. That would be my best description of it.

165
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the reasons why I'm really focusing on this word you use, which is tone.

166
00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it is an auditory word

167
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But now, and I listened. I'm thinking

168
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.690
Samantha Scott: Maybe it's

169
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:18.240
Samantha Scott: Not. No, it's not so much. It's more if somebody. I mean, it doesn't really matter what their voice sounds like. But if they are raising it at me.

170
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.260
Volume

171
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:32.700
Samantha Scott: If they're raising it at me and it sounds like they are a like whatever job I have done, or I'm supposed to have done or be doing it was not done right, you

172
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta call. Yep. Okay. Now, this might seem overly precise, but I'm trying to get to this word of prosody. And this has to do with

173
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Memory was telling you it's not it's not only

174
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: The the the icon tax that can happen that I can show a tune it to a pre a pre verbal baby. I can also use my voice right

175
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I can say all which is okay.

176
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:01.890
Samantha Scott: All right.

177
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.120
Samantha Scott: You can take it together.

178
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I can now that's so notice the way it sounded you knew I was probably addressing a baby. Didn't you

179
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.780
Samantha Scott: Or a little puppy or yeah

180
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So does it say safety with that sound.

181
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.910
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I think so. I mean, feels like

182
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay.

183
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.470
Samantha Scott: Right. Yeah, no, I say that all the time to my docs, just like yeah

184
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So safe.

185
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.290
Samantha Scott: Safe safe. Safe encouraging welcoming

186
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

187
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not loud.

188
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.960
Samantha Scott: No.

189
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it came the volume, meaning the music is either loud or it's low but now prosody talks about this, it goes

190
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: prosody. Is this raising of pitch.

191
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: The variability in it.

192
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so that's like impatience. I mean, that's what I'm trying to describe, I think.

193
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.710
Samantha Scott: In terms of that. It's like, did you

194
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.810
Samantha Scott: You know,

195
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoot can imitate it. Gotcha.

196
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Frustrating.

197
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:21.870
Samantha Scott: You know, well I guess I'm working on. I'm working on trying to make them feel comfortable that

198
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.160
Samantha Scott: You know, or

199
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.280
Samantha Scott: Um, let's see.

200
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:38.220
Samantha Scott: I mean honestly it all. I don't even know if I should say this, but it really reminds me, and this is not even from my mom. It's from my dad, but

201
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:54.090
Samantha Scott: That's the same kind of tone, like when he used to say whenever I go the refrigerator. He'd always say something like going to go get some more to eat good and even though my husband doesn't sound like that sometimes it makes me feel the same way.

202
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.170
Samantha Scott: You know that

203
00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.140
Samantha Scott: I'm being judged that I'm not good enough that I'm not smart enough that I'm not, you know,

204
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm with you. And I remember that one. I remember that one.

205
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there's some other pieces to this, there's

206
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: This notice that it has this tempo to it. Yeah.

207
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you notice when your husband is starting to say something that you're all ready activated, you already care. You can tell me

208
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.880
Samantha Scott: I mean like

209
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:48.180
Samantha Scott: Well, looks like if I'm staying up late at night and like I worried that like the dogs up or whatever, you know, or the dog needs to go out or and then I hear him say so. And it's like,

210
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:58.410
Samantha Scott: Oh, something wrong and I mean, in a way, I am trying to change my sleep schedule for the better you know and I know it's not great to stay up late and stuff but

211
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:08.100
Samantha Scott: At the same time, I don't have a job. So sometimes, if I want to be flexible with myself. It's like, well, I feel like that's okay, but

212
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:18.930
Samantha Scott: I would just really like to not immediately associate because I feel like that's what has happened like it.

213
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:28.770
Samantha Scott: I've gotten to a point where I use my mom's coping methods and ways and the ways that I learned for so long. And now I've been in this relationship.

214
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:47.040
Samantha Scott: For a long time, like we've been together, you know, over 10 years now. And so I feel like using the same stuff over and over again and being a real asshole me. I'm talking about me being a real asshole again and again has put me in a position where

215
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.670
Samantha Scott: I am

216
00:21:52.560 --> 00:22:05.460
Samantha Scott: I want to be better. You know, like I I'm trying to be better, but it's like I've had bad behavior in the past, you know, and I want to re instill trust, I guess, or whatever, you know,

217
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to

218
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Sam, you spent just watch how much time you just did you just explained yourself to me. Just watch that old familiar thing play out. Even though I didn't say, well, why now. That was you. That was an old thing that that was a lot was a lot of explaining

219
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.550
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

220
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wanted Sam.

221
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wanted that

222
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.600
Samantha Scott: Okay, gotcha.

223
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just now. Do you feel criticized

224
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit, yeah.

225
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me where you feel it.

226
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.330
Samantha Scott: Right here.

227
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay okay so slow touch it. Take care of it, nurture it really tune in Word.

228
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it need

229
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.740
Samantha Scott: It's okay to be wrong. That's the only way you learn

230
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back in, go back in

231
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And who knows

232
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What part of you knows

233
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Or has an inkling that you did nothing wrong. Is there any part of you that knows that.

234
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.730
Samantha Scott: Maybe here.

235
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

236
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So get into

237
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe, almost like a relationship chest and that upper upper belly kind of right where those two things should just be present with both of them.

238
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing the same thing.

239
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just whose voice is louder. The one that says

240
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You screwed up.

241
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the one that says

242
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't do. I'm good. I'm fighting

243
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:04.080
Samantha Scott: The more I listened, the louder. The okay voice gets

244
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:05.220
So,

245
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, hold on to it Domo just keep rocking soothing keep caring for you, Dan tune and I'm going to do it again. I'm giving you a heads up.

246
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're into really purpose paying attention.

247
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:22.020
Okay.

248
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Deep breath, keep breathing.

249
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Sam.

250
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice

251
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.180
Samantha Scott: A lot better. I was a lot more grounded and my

252
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.460
Samantha Scott: Here.

253
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Up in the chest. Okay. And so, earlier you were he really for explaining

254
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Explaining and playing and I told you, you don't have to do that in therapy.

255
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right intention, you know,

256
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What that one.

257
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you feeling

258
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.290
Samantha Scott: Not as bad.

259
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Not as bad.

260
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.540
Yeah.

261
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:13.740
Samantha Scott: Maybe just because when I when I prepare myself for something

262
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.560
Samantha Scott: Like once you do it once or twice you like okay, I'm a little bit more prepared.

263
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:27.630
Samantha Scott: But I do, I do think that I could do something in terms of grounding myself in

264
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about preparation.

265
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, so

266
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How to prepare for things that happened randomly sound like you knew you were going to have Frankie maybe sleeping or I don't know what was going on, but

267
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.560
Samantha Scott: Right. No. Totally. Exactly.

268
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well,

269
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It is likely what I offer anyway is is this message that you're

270
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: The reptilian brain is going to respond fastest it's gonna, it's going to respond to the environment.

271
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And you're gonna

272
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna it's gonna

273
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Get you information that stomach of years as soon as you hear that voice.

274
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The tricky bit as you're like, well, how do I prepare

275
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Number one, if you assume if we say that yes what we got right here is what's going on, then you get in the habit.

276
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Of tuning into the body and then you get so used to it.

277
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You do it on a schedule for a while you're setting alarms for it.

278
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:44.550
Samantha Scott: Right. And I could definitely see myself doing that.

279
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So setting alarms and we can set up little, little, little routine to do three or four times a day. And then you also remember, maybe because you put up stickies or something.

280
00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.040
Samantha Scott: You tell people

281
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you write you write it on the back of your hand. And so then what you do is you remember to do it when you are startled or when you

282
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch yourself. I'm just about to yell back. I'm just about to make a snarky remark just defend myself a way to do it now.

283
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And I do whatever mindfulness practice. So here's, here's what I'm saying. Preparation looks like it's getting in the habit of tuning in your body's initial response to a

284
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.700
Samantha Scott: Threat right

285
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.490
Samantha Scott: And ultimately, even to non threat. Right. Right. Yeah.

286
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the reasons why I'm saying to set up an alarm is because there wasn't any threat. This was set off by an alarm to do

287
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right belly breathing.

288
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Right meditation or whatever it is you decide what you're going to turn

289
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:13.470
Samantha Scott: On your good pitch. I like the belly breathing. I mean, I like the belly breathing that really does physically made me feel calmer and physically makes me feel like I'm you know tuning into the logical martyr myself or whatever and healthy things more clearly and

290
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:26.220
Samantha Scott: And also trying to just like listen to my thoughts. You know what the closest I've been able to get to meditation or mindfulness is like just

291
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:40.710
Samantha Scott: Listening noticing what they what they are and then just saying, okay, honor that thought. Whatever it is, whether I agree with it or not. And then just trying to let it, like you said, like the last exercise just kind of let it float away.

292
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll be able to add on to that will be able to add on. I can tell by what you're saying, we might be able to add some features to the mindfulness practice.

293
00:28:52.800 --> 00:29:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to circle back just to make sure that there's an opportunity to really hold on to this if you if you like this piece of information around preparation.

294
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. When you do mindfulness or body awareness or any, any of those kind of things, which is what I'm recommending I'm saying preparation is getting in the habit.

295
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Of tuning into the body doing we'll call it a body scan, one of the reasons why is because you're building tissue. Remember, this isn't, this isn't like

296
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Although we don't understand how the mind works exactly right.

297
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.230
Samantha Scott: It is in there.

298
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.860
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

299
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.810
Samantha Scott: It's tissue. Yeah.

300
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And every time you doing. Oh, I got a scan my body and I will do the scam.

301
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: He goes through

302
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Your building tissue and your brain.

303
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what, there's tissue being neuronal connections. Right.

304
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You do it again at noon. You do it again at eight o'clock at night and you do it again. I don't know, go.

305
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And go to sleep or something.

306
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And then

307
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because those neural connections are there random parts of the day. Now you might remember it.

308
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When your body is in distress, like it's literally I'm just trying to get you were number

309
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:32.610
Samantha Scott: Right. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. I think the best way for me to learn and learn how to do things has always been to not to read about it not to whatever I have to actually do it.

310
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.590
Samantha Scott: Okay, yeah, so

311
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Within with that what you may want to do is set an alarm for three or four times a day.

312
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: To do a body scan.

313
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can do that together. I can kind of walk you through one in one way to do it. Of course, you know, with internet you can do any number of things more than welcome to make it your own. But, but ultimately this is what I'm inviting as far as

314
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What preparation looks like because if we're really then i don't i don't need anything but me. Right.

315
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I can tune right instead of this really adaptive thing where I am able to attune to someone subtle aspect and change in town.

316
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I can

317
00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn that same skill and I can turn it here.

318
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:17.850
Right.

319
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if I'm ready. I can handle anything

320
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.560
Samantha Scott: Right. One, I feel like it's gonna be a lot more useful turn towards

321
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.890
Samantha Scott: Other people at this point.

322
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Your husband is gonna be like, Oh, I like that one. Whatever that Glenn is awesome. I'm not getting yelled at no more.

323
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

324
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:49.440
Samantha Scott: That's all I mean, and I want. I mean, I feel like I'm on the right track. I mean, I feel like definitely taking the whole drug

325
00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:57.270
Samantha Scott: Seeking and and getting and that whole repetitive process because that was able to take up so much time and energy.

326
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:11.550
Samantha Scott: In my life, you know what I mean in terms of, oh, worrying about I have to take only this much and then I have to take this much. The next day to be sick or be or feel or right or whatever. And I've never gotten

327
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:30.240
Samantha Scott: I mean this not having to think about that is giving me a chance to think about all this other stuff and I'm so hoping and I feel like when I get to the point where we go doing the paper down, even though it sounds really scary to me right now.

328
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I

329
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:43.860
Samantha Scott: Am trusting that it will be easier. You know, because I'm actually doing the work I'm being honest and showing up. And, you know, hopefully.

330
00:32:45.300 --> 00:33:04.560
Samantha Scott: That was something I never didn't therapy. I was always hiding my drug addiction or like I hadn't realized yet what was going on with my mom because that only happened last year and I feel like, you know, this is a good process. And I feel like we're getting getting somewhere, you know,

331
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: New to and let's keep now what I noticed is

332
00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So I went into this space of inviting body awareness. It's a felt sense. So it's right. These are the feelings, emotions are happy, sad, angry jealous was her emotions feeling is often it's it's a tactile it's in our viscera. How am I feeling

333
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

334
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're going to find out. You're going to set an alarm. If you're willing to do this experiment, you're going to set it up. We're going to find out how in the middle of whatever

335
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to go off. It has nothing to do with whether someone said anything nasty or not, we're gonna

336
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get a sense of how you're doing on a regular basis. Right. You gotta get in the habit of it, you're going to do it. And then you're going to remember it.

337
00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right then, when you hear something that activates a part of your body. You might recognize the distress, and then you might take care of yourself in that split second, and I'm this this stuff I'm talking about, even though I'm saying it slowly it happens so fast.

338
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if, if you're if you're not Conscious. Conscious you'll be busy yelling before you even like Oh shoot.

339
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.610
Samantha Scott: Right.

340
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That happens that fast. So that's why really preparation is really already getting in the habit so yes practices like like meditation is one of the reasons why it's pretty cool because we're turning in

341
00:34:38.760 --> 00:35:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: One more thing, when we were doing this felt sense thing. And I was, you know, saying, Where are those things right after you said the word cognitive and you said the word thoughts you have a cerebral language, your language is cerebral. It's just thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking,

342
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, yeah.

343
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:08.190
Samantha Scott: I do. I agree. I totally agree with you though after the last time we talked. I was like,

344
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:25.710
Samantha Scott: I think I wrote some Facebook status that was like having a therapist who calls me on my shit like over intellectualizing instead of feeling my feelings is priceless like the MasterCard thing.

345
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Right. Yeah.

346
00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:35.880
Samantha Scott: I'm trying to be honest, and I feel like I feel like we have a good. This is a good therapeutic relationship.

347
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.110
Samantha Scott: Head, even though it's weirdly tell a therapy.

348
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:40.890
Know,

349
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:59.130
Samantha Scott: I've got a lot. I know that I have got a lot of ways to go. And I'm really willing to work on it. You know, I know this is going to take a lot longer than I anticipate probably or maybe not, but I'm willing to be there as long as it takes. And I'm going to set these alarms.

350
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.020
Samantha Scott: Okay and start feeling

351
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. So what I see in you that sets you very much a part actually from from many is an eagerness to apply what I call invitations. I don't like the word homework. I don't like the word task. So I don't say it like that.

352
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.320
Samantha Scott: Right.

353
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't give advice you

354
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't like it and. But you guys are going to hear it as homework and you're going to hear it as advice. Nothing I can do about that part. But I'm really careful about how I say things because of my particular philosophy about psychology and my role.

355
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, but what's really neat to hear is that you are actually willing to take on some behavioral experiments and do these invitations, because I think they're gonna work.

356
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.720
Samantha Scott: Yeah, well, I

357
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.350
Samantha Scott: Feel like

358
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:55.110
Samantha Scott: Either they're going to work or they're going to lead me to something else that works right

359
00:36:55.230 --> 00:37:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right well rule them out will rule them out and and that's exciting. So yeah, it's set those alarms and give them a cute little title. And so this is what it might look like when you do the body scan and maybe that's what the alarm is it's going to be something like

360
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: This now for some people, water kind of freaks them out to water doesn't work. And so they throw some things out and see what works for you.

361
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I like the Superman Stan where it completely goes all the way through me and it works its way all the way through the body like it's we can see through me, right, because then nothing is missed so you might do that and it goes all the way through the body.

362
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And as it touches. Right. I noticed as I reached here my I felt my shoulders drop. And I was like, oh, I needed that awareness, because they'll, they'll be up here.

363
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.250
Samantha Scott: I'll be talking to

364
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: A long time, and I'll realize. Oops.

365
00:37:53.850 --> 00:38:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: There, they're doing their thing. So, um, so then this gang goes all the way through the body all the way down to the toes and then it comes all the way up. So I'll do that with you. Okay. But you also may decide to say

366
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever temperature is perfect for me that is making its way through me.

367
00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: All the way through.

368
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you might say,

369
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Water washing over starting to feel it touching the skin, it's going all the way through my body.

370
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So for some people it's bad imagery. So you may come up with something unique yourself.

371
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:47.670
Samantha Scott: The water one resonated i mean i i'm not sure if it will keep but like, yeah, that the imagining that that definitely that's one of my ideas to try

372
00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I'm going to actually put this, I want to know that you like the water, some people, it's a feeling of like I feel like I'm drowning. I don't like it at all.

373
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:19.080
Samantha Scott: I don't know if I actually believe in this, but I was born with a call. Like what's his face and David Copperfield, like, it's like this Embry, the sack over your head and sailors used to buy it from from mothers, because it protects you from drowning supposedly

374
00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:26.340
Samantha Scott: So weird birthing only place I've read about it was I think it was David Copperfield, or something.

375
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.950
Samantha Scott: One of the characters had it.

376
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.850
Samantha Scott: But yeah, water, I think is good.

377
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm writing body scan using water imagery. OK. So now when you do it, and you're going to go all the way through the key is right. Starting at the top of my head, I'm noticing. Oh, I'm noticing a tingling hadn't paid attention to that.

378
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I can, I can kind of feel the throbbing of the blood of my ears. I can feel it now and noticing it's going inside and can I'm aware in my

379
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Office color right inside those bones for my eye sockets are. I can feel it.

380
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, wherever they move across

381
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Into my nasal passage, you can feel also my skin as it meets here.

382
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed my jaw seems tight and all my right neck. It's like the muscles pulling

383
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I just held my breath had noticed that before.

384
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed the taste and when

385
00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thirsty.

386
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I can feel the piercing of my lips kind of here. Stay not relaxed. See that I feel that

387
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my neck. Go to my neck.

388
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: conceal the muscles on the left and right, my shoulders relaxed. I remember like gravity kind of take care of them there.

389
00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And into the throat lungs like coughing or something. I think it was in hell, something that's about all right so I'm playing with you but but you get it right, del. Didn't you start to it.

390
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:25.380
Samantha Scott: Yeah, yeah, no, totally, definitely. I mean, I hadn't even thought about the fact that I can feel. I mean, the blood pumping in my ears or like the sockets in my eyes are like how my my jaw is or, you know,

391
00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll do well in the future will also not only will we do the belly breath, but we'll do this all the way through. We might maybe you'll be activated one day or or maybe I'll just say, Hey, let's go all the way through that when

392
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We get all into blah, blah, blah. Let's get into this, this, this. And so maybe like walk me through. That's how it will set the tone for the day.

393
00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:46.680
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

394
00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a key message I'm trying to send is, it's about paying attention.

395
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.540
Samantha Scott: To myself.

396
00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

397
00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It is because it's not about

398
00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.300
Samantha Scott: Here, not here here.

399
00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's it's really about

400
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:11.430
Samantha Scott: It's really challenging for me. I definitely know it is, but I know that when I do things over and over again. It gets easier so

401
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You can call that if you want you can call that meditation.

402
00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:16.980
Samantha Scott: Right.

403
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Call it whatever you want to

404
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're

405
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:23.220
Samantha Scott: Listening, you're

406
00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're know you're literally I can feel just

407
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling I'm

408
00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:27.630
Samantha Scott: Feeling

409
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling me as it meets the air as it meets my seat. I can feel the pressure. Did you notice that before.

410
00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: My seat bones. I can feel this one tush holding all the weight is it evenly distributed. Is it warm. Is it the edge of the

411
00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:54.900
Samantha Scott: I think could help with my shoulders to and like this whole I think I'm holding myself in a weird way, or like protectively sometimes

412
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe. Yep, yep, yep, yep.

413
00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.080
Samantha Scott: Yep, and yet.

414
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:03.720
Samantha Scott: But yeah, I know I'm gonna as soon as I get off I'm setting my alarm body scan.

415
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And then, and then but

416
00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:10.020
Samantha Scott: Right now, that's what works with my brain in terms of thinking about it. Oh.

417
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right on skin and then adding you could add I'll do one body scan and then I'll do three belly breaths and then I'll do another set of body scan that could be a new meditative practice for you that you just do on a regular

418
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And it gets remembered and you'll get more and more in tune to what the messages in your body when you hear, I take your volume.

419
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:34.860
Particular

420
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You are prepared.

421
00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:48.480
Samantha Scott: Right, and that's so I can respond. Ultimately, I would like to be able to respond to things that are inappropriate in an appropriate way.

422
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:52.560
Samantha Scott: And not respond to things that I don't need to respond.

423
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.210
Samantha Scott: I

424
00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Think I think before we get ahead of it. I think we'll do that thing of will go on and discovery. Let's go. You do if you're willing to do that.

425
00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's cool. And then it'll inform what our next step is

426
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's go for

427
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.460
Samantha Scott: Inform

428
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it teach

429
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:14.100
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

430
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: what worked, what didn't. What needs this or that and we'll find out.

431
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.120
Samantha Scott: And I'm glad I brought up the car.

432
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:25.230
Samantha Scott: Thing, because that is something that's in my life, I would like to deal with at some point I

433
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably definitely

434
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Have some desensitisation experience to it. So it's not as activating so that you're done right.

435
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:40.260
Samantha Scott: So that, at least I can be a comfortable passenger or maybe you know

436
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:40.980
Samantha Scott: Drive.

437
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you don't want to drive.

438
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:50.190
Samantha Scott: I would love to be able to, but it's just too. Right now, it's too. Yeah.

439
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you, I got you, I got you.

Gwenevere Abriel: He is

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have anything written down. I don't think do you

446
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.420
Samantha Scott: I don't have anything written down, but

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:13.560
There.

448
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:17.400

Samantha Scott: Is stressful.

453
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.230
Samantha Scott: Okay. Like, it seems like you guys were having some stressful.

454
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, I run six groups. So remind me. I am

455
00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.610
Samantha Scott: The Tuesday, it was

456
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.730
Samantha Scott: That we have like a couple of new people.

457
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:48.930
Samantha Scott: And it just seemed like everybody was kind of weirdly like not connecting or something, I don't know what it was.

458
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So, I think. Okay, so let me. I want to get to. Now I can't wait.

459
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, there you are. Sam new guy Aaliyah

460
00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.760
Samantha Scott: We to seem real nice.

461
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I think I know, I know what happened. Yes.

462
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes yes yes and yes

463
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:10.830
Samantha Scott: We all checked in. We did an exercise and stuff, it was just my observations about

464
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Waiting in it. Now, what if you just said that.

465
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Without any

466
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:23.580
Samantha Scott: Disclaimer because it's very difficult for me not to qualify everything I say apparently

467
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be now notice you didn't remember to breathe.

468
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.730
Samantha Scott: And do this right so

469
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You're it's so frequent for you. This is going to be like a lot throughout the day, it's going to be, oh, I'm feeling defensive. Oh, I'm explaining I'm I'm I'm explaining, I'm okay. But let me feel myself. How am I doing

470
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The destination is just, you're going to be okay. That's where we're headed with all of this, right.

471
00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.840
Samantha Scott: So I just need to be here and Stop jumping forward.

472
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, if it was that easy wouldn't need me. Right.

473
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.930
Samantha Scott: Right. But that's what I need to work on.

474
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.520
Samantha Scott: The feeling

475
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, but look how quickly old familiar comes in.

476
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so fast. When I say fast. I'm not kidding.

477
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You will upset wouldn't want to upset the therapists don't but I loved what you brought up, but all I just wanted to turn my head to try and look for my little scratch she'd like to see who is there so I can

478
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:35.100
Samantha Scott: I see that yeah and I interpreted in milliseconds in my brain. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

479
00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I wouldn't want to upset her. I don't want to insult her, heaven forbid, what if I miss perceived it probably had ruled out five or six instantaneously and made sure you covered your basis.

480
00:47:51.840 --> 00:48:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're right, you're fast you are here really quick. Now that big brain of yours is going to be in service to you, but it's also running through a lot of data bank of scenarios, very quickly.

481
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's, that's all. All top down, problem solving, what I'm asking you to do is bottom up.

482
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.020
Samantha Scott: Yeah, it's going to be a challenge, but I'm going to keep doing it.

483
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's in a group.

484
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When you notice, and I think I pretty much could say, I know what you're talking about.

485
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to validate you first.

486
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So we did that thing called you out just now right called you. So now I want to validate, you and I want to say.

487
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That was hard.

488
00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That was hard that group was hard.

489
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.770
Samantha Scott: Yeah, it seemed like it.

490
00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that group is hard.

491
00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But it was not

492
00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't like the group.

493
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: No, um, there's a particular chemistry that happens and the chemistry of that composition

494
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's didn't flow.

495
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:14.700
Samantha Scott: Right.

496
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have to look at, you know, what did I not do what did I do, what did I bring to that space where I brought my own no flow go you know

497
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:25.380
And

498
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Something I think I brought something to so I don't land on any particular thing. But there is a part of me that wants to pick you up and put you in my 11 to 11am Thursday group. There's, it's like, I want to pick you up and it's coffee and

499
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:54.210
Samantha Scott: Bromine everything we do is it all these challenges are good for us. Right. I mean, because we don't necessarily want to be with the people who are you know

500
00:49:54.420 --> 00:50:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you when you saw yeah you when you saw, and you're welcome to tell me, by the way, because I probably saw it too. So, but I just want you to if you're just testing out the water to see if you can talk about group members right now, which you can

501
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You just can't go touch your husband about the names

502
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:13.650
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

503
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:14.250
Samantha Scott: Yeah, we know.

504
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: With me, it's, it's part of therapy, which means

505
00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:23.190
Samantha Scott: Okay, then I will say, I will just go ahead and say what I think. And I don't know if it's what you think.

506
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:37.470
Samantha Scott: I'm thinking or whatever. But it feels like sherry is not very into it, you know, or not wanting to like participate and not not saying that much as to call

507
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:39.540
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

508
00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait for it. Bree Bree Bree.

509
00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:50.250
Samantha Scott: Yeah, geez. It's kind of off putting. Because she is

510
00:50:51.240 --> 00:51:02.370
Samantha Scott: She doesn't seem to want to participate and like I see the other guy, the guy who's been there for like years or something. And he's like really far down

511
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:11.100
Samantha Scott: Going on going down and he was really into the poem and stuff like that, you know, and you really felt like it reflected. It was that roomie poem

512
00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:15.960
Samantha Scott: And you can tell it, but I don't know. I mean, but everybody

513
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel your body. Once you feel it now. See how it's doing

514
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What's vibrating.

515
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:28.260
Samantha Scott: Is my warning to qualify

516
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel it. Feel

517
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: How is the body doing

518
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Do the scan doesn't have to take long. Just move through, see what muscles are tight tense flexed.

519
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:55.560
Samantha Scott: I've definitely, I feel like this is into it with a qualifying protecting

520
00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I see that

521
00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:00.420
Samantha Scott: I do it a lot.

522
00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:03.270
Samantha Scott: Okay, but yeah.

523
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:08.130
Samantha Scott: That's ok Cherie didn't seem very much into it.

524
00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:15.630
Samantha Scott: I don't know. And I do feel a lot of empathy and connection with the lot of people in the group. And I don't know, I guess it

525
00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:36.270
Samantha Scott: It, it got on my nerves that it seemed like other people even no matter what they're like the girl one girls crying you know and like still there with her mask on and stuff, but it's like you know don't if you just don't discount the process for other people, you know,

526
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so stay there don't have go inside. Feel how that feels. To say that and leave it leave it out there. Your opinion out there floating around.

527
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.600
Samantha Scott: Sort of uncomfortable.

528
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I bet it does.

529
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I misinterpret

530
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:56.790
Samantha Scott: I'm just gonna have to trust that you won't

531
00:52:58.530 --> 00:52:58.980
Samantha Scott: Right.

532
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's certainly one one scenario.

533
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And the preparation that you're going to get to is it will eventually not matter.

534
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether I misinterpreted eventually

535
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Eventually you'll get there, but we're just starting

536
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So just a little education part about groups.

537
00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: This group if you were in a process group, a true Process Group will you be invited to do is it would be like this.

538
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:31.350
Samantha Scott: Too, though.

539
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I would say, Sam, what's coming up for you. And do you want to say it to someone

540
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.100
Samantha Scott: Right. I'VE SEEN I'VE SEEN depictions of that for sure.

541
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's true. Process Group and

542
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Holy shit.

543
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:47.190
Samantha Scott: That sounds really intense.

544
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Its intense an hour and a half of that.

545
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And I could do it. I just love that stuff. Right. That's I live for that.

546
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hold intensity pretty well.

547
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.240
And I

548
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what you saw. Let's see, what did you see, um, you said yes. So it looked hard for you to, what did you see in me because I'm, I'm here.

549
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:23.760
Samantha Scott: I was. I thought it just seemed like okay well like you're saying like, okay, you know, just give me one second. To do this, and then come back, but then

550
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:38.400
Samantha Scott: I don't know. I think it was more honestly when now that I'm like know that I'm pinpointing it. I actually think I noticed it in terms of how your mom was acting and talking

551
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:46.170
Samantha Scott: That might have been like she was there late and then you're like, Oh, it's okay. We're here, we're all here and then

552
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So I forgot this

553
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I had to start that group room that was clunky. A lot of funkiness to that one.

554
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:56.550
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

555
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It clumped around what

556
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.940
Samantha Scott: I liked the roomie poem, a lot. Yeah.

557
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.240
Samantha Scott: Like I keep distracting you would only need to set an appointment.

558
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

559
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, thank you.

560
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Buddy, boo, boo, boo. How about right because it's Tuesday. Tuesday. Tuesday.

561
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Tuesday, because that's the space.

562
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.340
Samantha Scott: Where we got off.

563
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but I can't hear they're

564
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:29.730
Samantha Scott: fine with it. I'm glad I said what I thought it's good for me that. No, no, it feels

565
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: He but it is it's unnerving at first. So I'm thinking

566
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: About now. See, I don't know if you're going to pull this off. But right now.

567
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I have 9am

Gwenevere Abriel: Thursday. Yeah. May 28 at night. How'd you know it's going to be Thursday. How'd you know that

570
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.420
Samantha Scott: I'm psychic

571
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:55.170
Samantha Scott: Dude, no.

572
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:58.170
Samantha Scott: No, it was Thursday was

Gwenevere Abriel: See you.

575
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:11.220
Samantha Scott: Know 9am is good. I like I am trying to get up earlier for the most part, I've been getting up around eight or nine so

576
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's get ahead so that nothing gets gobbled up the network. This way I can protect something further along in

577
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:21.900
Doing

578
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's all the way into fully crepe June.

579
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now.

580
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I have oh it's Thursday again.

581
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Know what I like about Thursday puts a little bit of distance between

582
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Here is

583
00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.130
Samantha Scott: A little time to think for sure.

584
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let's do right after my 11am group will do 1210 those

585
00:56:55.950 --> 00:57:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn out to be really important. So I'm gonna keep taking them so 1210 1210

586
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:12.930
Samantha Scott: Fabric. So we got may 28 at 9am and June 7 12 to

587
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Seven.

588
00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.050
Samantha Scott: Isn't that right, I know, it's crazy.

589
00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's a Monday, that's gonna that's gonna just not work at all, let's let's look three

590
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Something went sideways here. Let's say June 4

591
00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:32.670
Samantha Scott: Oh no, I'm looking at may sorry June 7 is Sunday. Yeah.

592
00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we got June 4 at

593
00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:38.520
Samantha Scott: June 4 at 1210

594
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, my new

595
00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:46.830
Samantha Scott: Okay so 28th at 9am June 4 at 1210 got it.

596
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to tell you something else.

597
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is just because

598
00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You're at maybe a different level of investment, a different level of interest, a different level of empathy, compassion, whatever the level however you assess yourself in comparison to other

599
00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: don't rob yourself. Let me all the way through this don't rob yourself of where you need to stretch and grow the group will rise to the occasion or I will

600
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we won't, I don't know, but I don't want you to miss an opportunity because

601
00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it, it can be pulled off, we can pull it off with

602
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:42.060
Samantha Scott: Well, no, that was I think that's why I brought it up because I felt like

603
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:47.520
Samantha Scott: We have been pulling it off and I thought that was a kind of a glitchy thing or whatever.

604
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a little glitchy and

605
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: It may not go the way you want it. But you were there.

606
00:58:54.930 --> 00:59:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And so in a matter of how did you like or dislike how you were because right with this this disconnect that you saw happening in there for whatever altitude. There are now that I think that was

607
00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. There was a lot going on. And now I'm and I'm pretty sure I came with something. I think I brought a little son into that group. And I don't remember what it was, but I think I was in my feeling somehow

608
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:25.110
Samantha Scott: Or another i think i'm guessing we all did we all

609
00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you when you come back into it and the check in point is, look at that. Right. Oh, wait. Here I go. I'm gonna go scanning scanning. How am I doing

610
00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and paying attention to. Okay. I was with this. I saw this disconnection happening with this person is and just this one's not look at her nice doing nobody's rescuing nobody's doing whenever whatever it is that's going on around you turn it back to you.

611
00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, whenever you possibly can so that you're honing in on that skill.

612
00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:12.480
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I feel like that's big. I feel like that's something I haven't been doing my whole life. I mean like when I forget to eat all day. Maybe I learned that from my mom or maybe it's just because I'm not even tuned into myself enough to know if I'm hungry.

613
01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.490
Samantha Scott: You know, we'll see.

614
01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:16.890
Samantha Scott: All right.

615
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm

616
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:20.100
Samantha Scott: I had a really good good session.

617
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you so

618
01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:26.250
Samantha Scott: Much. Oh, yeah. So I'll see you on Tuesday. And then on Thursday.
