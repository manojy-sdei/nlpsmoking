00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi, what's happening.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.139
Lauren Kelly: Can you hear me.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.519
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. Okay.

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.030
Lauren Kelly: And thank you for finding time for me. Um,

6
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.120
Lauren Kelly: I just like, did my makeup some really good and try not to cry because I'm like a dentist appointment after run out to but I'm

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.790
Lauren Kelly: I'm

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:43.110
Lauren Kelly: So as you know, like everything has been super great like better than ever, no drama. No anything. So, um, last night, so he was visiting like the kids and stuff. Yesterday for a couple hours and he came back and he brought stuff, you know, just like I had asked him to and

9
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:59.670
Lauren Kelly: We were it was maybe like I don't know 20 minutes after he had gotten home and we were talking about. I'm just like, you know, are days and whenever, and he said something really depressing happened when I was there and and you know I'm like what, and he tells me that

10
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.020
Lauren Kelly: These like is f x had like pulled him into a room and told him how like that their kids are like really worried about this coronavirus you know like kids are like freaked out about it, you know, and

11
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then that

12
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.680
Lauren Kelly: Um, I guess she has a couple of like pre existing conditions, so the kids are convinced that and their two little girls. So they've always been like way closer to their mom than to him and like

13
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.640
Lauren Kelly: You just like that was one of the problems when he was there. Like, no matter what he did to try to like connect with them. They just always wanted their mom and like

14
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.000
Lauren Kelly: No matter how hard you try to do anything. It was like he would get home and they would like go upstairs to get away from him, basically. And he just felt like so disconnected or whatever but

15
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.360
Lauren Kelly: So they've always been like their mom is their favorite person and whatever. So the his two kids are coming. Like if their mom gets it she's going to die or something so

16
00:01:45.750 --> 00:02:00.600
Lauren Kelly: I guess his oldest Maddie, who's like a freshman in high school is 50 and said, Mom, if you get the coronavirus. I'm just going to kill myself because Daddy doesn't love me anymore. And like as soon as he said that I'm like I already know where this is going.

17
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.130
Lauren Kelly: He's going to go back, like I already know.

18
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:16.080
Lauren Kelly: And like I was just silent, and he was like crying, and he was telling me this. And I'm like, you're getting back like I know you are and

19
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:32.370
Lauren Kelly: He's like saying like these things like I'm here now, like what it like not telling me, he's not going to go back just like, Well, I'm here. You know, I came home and like, you know, and I'm like, Yeah, but I know you and you're gonna go back and

20
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.830
Lauren Kelly: Like, then he tried to like turns up the TV like not times icon, just like watch this movie with me or something and I was just like,

21
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.240
Lauren Kelly: To try to do that for like 15 minutes and I just couldn't do it. And I was like, Paul, I need you to be honest with me right now like

22
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.850
Lauren Kelly: Are you going to go back in and he's like, I don't know.

23
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.770
Lauren Kelly: And

24
00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.280
Lauren Kelly: Like

25
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.140
Lauren Kelly: I've worked so hard to get to this point, like

26
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.790
Lauren Kelly: Like in through so much to get here. Like all we've been talking about since I've been back is like

27
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.120
Lauren Kelly: Like marriage and our future and like

28
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.230
Lauren Kelly: Everything that like we were building in everything that we wanted. And like

29
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.810
Lauren Kelly: For him to tell me

30
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.580
You froze.

31
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think your iPod went down.

32
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lauren

33
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She got froze. She'll be back. I will start recording again when she comes back.

34
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:44.220
Lauren Kelly: Hey, I don't know that only happens when I'm talking to you. For some reason, I don't know. It doesn't happen in group. It doesn't happen any other time always with you, but it just shuts down. I don't know. But, um,

35
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:53.070
Lauren Kelly: I went on my walk and I came back and I just said, Like what, what do you want me to do. And he was like, just just come to bed like just, you know, above and I'm like,

36
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.640
Lauren Kelly: Are you fucking kidding me like you just want me to go to bed and like

37
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:05.610
Lauren Kelly: Sleep in your own rooms all night and like wake up and not know if that was the last night and like not know if you're because he the kids needed help. She like his ex had like some

38
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.130
Lauren Kelly: conference calls all day today or something, she had to do so that because he had help with homework. So he was going to go over there today.

39
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:20.160
Lauren Kelly: Anyways, and I'm like, so I'm just supposed to like just live my day and just go about things, normal, not knowing if like you come home today and say, yep. I'm going back there like

40
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:30.390
Lauren Kelly: You literally expect me to live like that. Like, I can't live like that it will kill me like I don't sleep. I don't eat. I like it makes me want to use like I

41
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:39.150
Lauren Kelly: I can't fuck you live like that. And that was basically his answer was, like, and he's like, trying to kind of backpedal like

42
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:50.730
Lauren Kelly: No, just forget what you said that, like, I'm sorry, like I'm not going anywhere. I'm here, you know, but like I just got this really heavy thing dropped on me and you know I have a responsibility to these girls.

43
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And she froze again.

44
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, we will wait

45
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Start Recording again when she logs back on.

46
00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.660
Lauren Kelly: Okay, I'm calling on my phone. Now, I don't know what the hell is going on there but um yeah basically

47
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:09.690
Lauren Kelly: He apologized and tried to backpedal and like it's just like, you know, I just got this really heavy thinking dropped on me and like you know I have a responsibility of these girls like

48
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.920
Lauren Kelly: You know she didn't ask to be brought in this world in like for me to just, you know, just makes you realize like, how much destruction. I've caused

49
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:29.490
Lauren Kelly: It's like, I feel the same way. Am I supposed to be like, No, stay with me and have your little girl be suicidal because of it. Like, I don't know what to do other than to like pack up and move out today. Like, I don't know what to do.

50
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:39.180
Lauren Kelly: And he says that's not what he wants me to do, but like, how am I supposed to just live wondering if today's the date. Like, I can't fucking do that like

51
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.260
Lauren Kelly: It'll hurt me to be apart from him so much but like

52
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:53.790
Lauren Kelly: I I think it'll hurt me more to stay and not know every day. If I can come in. You're going like I've been through so much of that with him already. And we were just such a good place and like

53
00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:07.710
Lauren Kelly: Planning our future. And then this happens like I can't, I can't live like that. And I just, I don't know if I'm overreacting. I don't know if, like, I'm running. I don't know if I'm doing catastrophic thinking, I don't know what I'm doing but like

54
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:22.020
Lauren Kelly: I just can't, like, go to bed every night just like hoping today isn't the day, something happens, where he decides to go back, like, and I told him that he said your answer can't ever be. I don't know. Like, I can't let you live like that.

55
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:30.720
Lauren Kelly: So I don't know, I just felt like I needed to talk to you because I don't know what to do. But everything in me is a grab your shit. And it's like, oh, and

56
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:40.650
Lauren Kelly: Like a friend is moving out of his place in like less like three weeks. So I'll have that garage for, like, you know, maybe two more weeks before I'm on the street, but like

57
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.120
Lauren Kelly: So like I have somewhat of an option right now but

58
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.640
Lauren Kelly: I don't know what else to do.

59
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, don't run

60
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because you don't know what the outcome is going to be and

61
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:05.910
Lauren Kelly: I can't live with the insured, even if it is this time, you know, I thought about it, and I'm going to stay. Then, when's the next time somebody says something to him. Like, I can't

62
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:14.340
Lauren Kelly: Like I needed him to be like, you know, I'll go to counseling with her, you know, like she and I will do counseling. We'll figure something out. You know what I mean, like,

63
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:23.760
Lauren Kelly: Not and it's like, you know, part of me is thinking, you know, his ex wife doesn't have coronavirus she's not dying. So it's like that. It's not even going to get to that, you know, like

64
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:30.870
Lauren Kelly: In time just to know like it's that easy for him to be like, I don't know, like I can't live like that Rebecca like

65
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, okay. So I want you to think about something. Okay. First off,

66
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're, you're talking about 15 year old girl.

67
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Who is that catastrophic thinking already going on.

68
00:09:46.920 --> 00:10:04.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Herself right you know the best thing for him to do right now is to really spend a lot of quality time with that that little girl and reassure her that no matter what he's going to be there. That's the best thing that he could do to reassure her. Okay.

69
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:05.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

70
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:14.190
Lauren Kelly: If I go there every day. He's been trying to do everything, and she basically said like Daddy doesn't love me anymore. Daddy wouldn't take care of me. Like, that's her book she honestly believes that like

71
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.830
Lauren Kelly: You would just care about me and not hurt like I don't know how he can change that like I

72
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It takes time, but he can

73
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's just got to be willing to put in the work with his daughter.

74
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now I want you to, you know, think about this. Because yes, he had this this dropped on him.

75
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:46.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that doesn't necessarily mean that that's what he's you know PLANNING ON DOING AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, HE WOULD THINK MAYBE I SHOULD GO BACK. I mean that's that's logical when you're a parent, you know,

76
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's, you know, am I, you know, how am I going to fix this with my kid, and at the same time live my life and be happy with a woman that I love.

77
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:04.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So he's in a really, really tough spot and not that he's trying to choose, you know you over her her over you at all.

78
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:16.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I'm sure right now he's trying to figure out how he can make it better with his daughter and reassure his daughter. This isn't about you know him wanting to be with you. This isn't about any of that.

79
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:23.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you should. I think that you should sit still for 24 hours just sit still.

80
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let's see what happens, go to the dentist, do what you need to do.

81
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:37.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Let him, you know, spend time with his daughter today and see what happens. Just give him the 24 hours.

82
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.090
Lauren Kelly: I

83
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:49.410
Lauren Kelly: I like can't do that. Like, I can't do this limbo is my entire life, about to be destroyed or not. Like that's worse to me than just running and and

84
00:11:49.950 --> 00:12:07.290
Lauren Kelly: And not having to live that way. Like, I can't, like, I give this man, my heart and soul every day. I can't do that, knowing that it it can just come home and it can all be gone in one fucking second like I can't live like that like the stress of that will fucking kill me.

85
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:17.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The stress is going to be, you're right, it's going to be horrible. I'm not going to say that it's not going to be, you know, there's no right answer. There's no easy answer to this.

86
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:19.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But what I know.

87
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that if you pack your stuff and you run today.

88
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:30.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a surety right it's a sure you've made your choice up for your relationship.

89
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:38.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I want you to think about it in those terms sit still for 24 hours and give him an opportunity

90
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:55.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then tomorrow. Tomorrow, if he comes tonight. And he says, This is what I'm doing, you know if he's still unsure, then by all means, then, pack your stuff and move, but just just sit for 24 hours till tomorrow morning.

91
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.220
Lauren Kelly: But I feel like anything you could say to me, would it matter now like like what if

92
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:16.590
Lauren Kelly: Even if it is no I'm staying. I want you to stay like to me that just fall so flat because the true answer was, like, I don't know. And when's the next thing that comes that that she says something he doesn't like and. Oh, I gotta go back, like I

93
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.430
Lauren Kelly: I can only build a life with someone if, like, I know that they're

94
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:30.570
Lauren Kelly: In it with me 100% like I can't do it when you're one foot in the door, one foot out and I feel like that's how it's been this whole fucking time and I said that Toby. So that's really unfair.

95
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:45.780
Lauren Kelly: Of me to say to him, and that's really unfair and I'm like this is like an unfair to me to like to expect me to just go to bed every night and wake up like everything's fine. Knowing my entire world can be shattered in like one fucking minute and I

96
00:13:47.070 --> 00:14:01.110
Lauren Kelly: It's just like, what, what could he say to me tonight. You know what I mean, just, Oh, it went well. They're like, I think I'm going to stay and I'm supposed to say yea. He thinks he's going to stay. Oh, I'm so happy. Let me get to put my heart and soul into this like

97
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You already have put your heart into it. And that's the thing. It's already there.

98
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, this is a tough, tough tough situation.

99
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to first off you know that

100
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:28.860
Lauren Kelly: I gotta leave it a lot easier. Like, I'm not sitting there being like, like number ones that I have made him choose like even after

101
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.470
Lauren Kelly: Him going back and forth. And like we having those

102
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.470
Lauren Kelly: Those insecurities. I'm still want 100% supported him.

103
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:43.830
Lauren Kelly: Go in there to be with his kids and like I understand that with what's going on in the world right now. He can't like take them out to pizza and be away from the house, pretty much the only option is for him to be in that house. You know what I mean, like,

104
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:51.150
Lauren Kelly: All supported that I've never asked him to come on, really. I've always lived in stay as long as you need. If you're having a good time with those girls you stay and you have a great time.

105
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.620
Lauren Kelly: Even though there's a lot of insecurity there. I've been such an adult about it and like

106
00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:06.720
Lauren Kelly: You know, even though. Yeah, I told you like last week when he was there for like six hours that I didn't hear from him. I'm spiraling but I do that to myself. I didn't like what him know I was doing that. I didn't freak out on him or anything like

107
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:14.760
Lauren Kelly: I have never made him feel bad. So it's not about like a choice to pick me over hurt like it's not about that, but it's it's

108
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:26.820
Lauren Kelly: I feel like I should make this easier on him and just, you know, like he's already got one foot in that door like why don't why don't I just leave so he can put the other one, you know,

109
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to you because you're taking away his, his right to choose by doing that.

110
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:42.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're taking away his, his right to figure out how he can his daughter can be okay and him have the love of his life.

111
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:52.830
Lauren Kelly: So I'm just supposed to live forever with, like, I don't know if I'm saying, or going, I don't know, like, how do you put in a future with that, like, how do you

112
00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:08.040
Lauren Kelly: Give like work so hard to give everything you have to be like the best version of yourself for this person and like just have them. I don't know. I don't know. It's like Wednesday next thing that somebody says that all of a sudden he doesn't know again like I

113
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here's the thing.

114
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With this morning.

115
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:19.860
Lauren Kelly: In and I just feel so fucking stupid like like how did I not info, this was gonna happen like I'm so fucking dumb, like

116
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.150
Lauren

117
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lauren that is catastrophic thinking right there.

118
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:39.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I want to correct you know correct you on something in the beginning you started doing this for your relationship, but somewhere along the line you started doing this for you.

119
00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:53.670
Lauren Kelly: Then why do I feel like I want to just use so fucking bad right now. Like, it's all I can think about right now. Like, I just want to go like us and not have to feel this right now because it hurts so bad.

120
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It does her because of the injury and I get that. Very much so.

121
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:09.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And of course, that's the first thing that you're you know that your mind is going to tell you to do. Nobody wants to be hurt or feel pain, nobody

122
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you just got moved back in there.

123
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.350
You know,

124
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You got to think about how you want this to pull out, you know,

125
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.020
Lauren Kelly: Obviously I know how to play I want him to to

126
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:37.620
Lauren Kelly: Be gentle with his kid and and you know figure it out without ruining our fucking life just because you know a kid said something dramatic, you know, like

127
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:57.270
Lauren Kelly: That's what I want. But it doesn't really matter what I want, what matters is how this kid fills in in him, you know, anyway. Oh, his obligation and responsibility there. And so I shouldn't know like being with this guy. Like I just I just just shouldn't know like

128
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.050
Lauren Kelly: I just feel so fucking stupid.

129
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you're not. You're not.

130
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:10.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not you gay you're giving an opportunity to somebody that you love.

131
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know what I want to point something out. We don't know if we even have tomorrow. We don't know if we have the next day. We just don't know life is not a guarantee at all.

132
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right you know that

133
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.690
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, but I need to know his hearts in it. I know that either of us could walk out the door and get in a car accident die like I'm aware of that. But like

134
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:41.520
Lauren Kelly: That's the stuff we can't control as far as the stuff that we can control goes like I need to know that he's in this as much as I am like I've sacrificed a lot for this like

135
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.660
Lauren Kelly: I've done so much for this like I've worked so hard for this. Like, I can't

136
00:18:46.050 --> 00:19:01.050
Lauren Kelly: I can't be the only one in 100% and have him in 6040 and I'm lucky because I've got that extra 10 on them. You know what I can. And I'm wondering for the rest of my life when it's going to go to, you know, they've got 51 and I've got 49 and then he's out the door like I

137
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:11.880
Lauren Kelly: That's that i i can't live with that insurance. Like, I can't go to bed every night and wake like I didn't sleep at all. Last night I woke up in the middle. And I like three times just crying like I

138
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:20.370
Lauren Kelly: I haven't eaten. I, I guarantee I won't eat for days. Like I just and it's not a choice. It's that I can't like

139
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:30.000
Lauren Kelly: I just, I don't. I mean like when I was a kid, I was told I like feel things deeper than other people. Like I there's times I used to use just so I didn't kill myself like

140
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:43.950
Lauren Kelly: It's like that. That's almost like where I'm at, like, I feel like I'm either gonna use or do something bad. So I got better that I use, you know, like it but I can't like feel what I'm feeling right now. Like it just

141
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.120
Lauren Kelly: I just like me to know me, I can't, I can't feel this like

142
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can't numb it

143
00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:03.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that doesn't get you anywhere either that just adds more, you know, more wreckage on top of what's going on already.

144
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:04.710
Lauren Kelly: But it was

145
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.440
Lauren Kelly: A meal out now.

146
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It might not

147
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:23.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You might not remember that you're, you know, you're on Suboxone Suboxone covers your receptors that the opioids attached to in doing that.

148
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You would have to take a hell of a lot to knock those off and it feel anything from us.

149
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that puts you at high risk for OD

150
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Listen there one

151
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You started doing this whole, this whole thing for your relationship.

152
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the end, it's about doing this whole thing for Lauren

153
00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And yeah, who wouldn't not want to feel. Who wouldn't want to, I mean, good lord. Nobody wants to have their heartbroken and be living on surely I get that 100%

154
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But this can't be your go to

155
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Every time something happens.

156
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

157
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.460
Yes.

158
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.110
Lauren Kelly: Sorry, I'm sorry. There was are you there.

159
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:25.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, yes.

160
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:33.510
Lauren Kelly: Are you there was like a call coming in and then a blackout. Sorry, I just for it. It was my dentist.

161
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.310
Lauren Kelly: I'm

162
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go to your dentist.

163
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do what you need to do today 24 hours. That's all I'm suggesting

164
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 24 hours if you're still unclear in the morning, then by all means.

165
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But what you're doing by sitting in for 24 hours not using

166
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: giving him the opportunity

167
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, is you're not running you're doing things different.

168
00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:09.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That make sense.

169
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:19.200
Lauren Kelly: What, what would I need him to do to stay like whoa, what am I looking for because right now it feels like anything he said or did would just be like,

170
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:29.640
Lauren Kelly: In fall I would fall flat on me, like, what, what would be an appropriate answer that would make me want to stay here. Like, I don't know what that looks like. I don't know what that is.

171
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:47.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Possibly making suggestions for ways that he can, you know, work with his daughter through this whole thing. That's what you're looking for, that's what you want him to come to his own conclusion and read, you know, conclusion about is that he can work, you know, with his daughter with

172
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know his ex wife support on this whole thing to make it better.

173
00:22:54.630 --> 00:23:01.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know if they're working as a team for the girls, then that's exactly what she's gonna do

174
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.470
That makes sense.

175
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:16.290
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, but I mean she hates him, she's not really trying to work as a team. I think anything he does, it's going to be like something he has to really push for it on his own, or not.

176
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.680
Lauren Kelly: They're not working as a team, but

177
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:31.500
Lauren Kelly: So I don't know. So if he comes home and tells me, hey, I thought of the things I can do to make this work. And then I stay and if he comes home and doesn't say that. Then I go like it.

178
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:39.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would ask him, you know, what are we doing, I need to know because if you're going to act. I mean, you just have to be true to yourself.

179
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:50.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And tell him you know if you're unsure. And if you're still unsure, and you there's still a possibility. Then I've got to secure myself. I've got to make sure that I'm protected.

180
00:23:50.940 --> 00:24:03.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I need to do something, you know for myself and, you know, give him the opportunity see right now. He's probably already expecting you to be a rotten to have right you know ran out the door.

181
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:07.800
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, he asked me before he left. Are you going to be here when I get home. And I said, I don't know.

182
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.790
Lauren Kelly: Then he cried he hugged me and cried and then love

183
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:14.370
Lauren Kelly: knows it.

184
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:22.560
Lauren Kelly: So yeah, he's definitely expected me to not be here is definitely it expected me to not be here when you get to

185
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So for for this one day.

186
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do something different.

187
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:34.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just this one time.

188
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 24 hours.

189
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go to the dentist.

190
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do what you need to do. Do what your original plan was pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray

191
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then just see just 24 hours.

192
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Once that that helps you start doing something different.

193
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doesn't make sense.

194
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.080
Okay.

195
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.820
Lauren Kelly: It's gonna be really fucking hard. Okay, I'll do my best.

196
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:11.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's gonna be hard. I'm not going to say it's easy, there is nothing on like worth having. That's easy to do.

197
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know that with recovery. You know that with relationships. You know that

198
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

199
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:19.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 24 hours.

200
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:20.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's it.

201
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:29.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now what I want you to do is check in with me at some point tomorrow and let me know one way or the other, what you're doing.

202
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, can you do we do that. Yeah.

203
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See tomorrow's Thursday. I don't care what time you check in just

204
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell them that you need to speak to me for a few minutes. Okay.

205
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We do that well.

206
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go to your dentist Dr safe.

207
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 24 hours.

208
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:55.470
Lauren Kelly: You can

209
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Give them an opportunity. OK.

210
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.670
Lauren Kelly: OK.

211
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:06.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: OK, so I will talk to you tomorrow. Pray, go to the dentist. Don't use

212
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get out of that that thought process because it wouldn't help anything anyways.

213
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:21.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: might not feel for a moment. But the wreckage that it's going to cause is going to be catastrophic. It's going to be 10 times worse if you if you go down that road.

214
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:23.760
Lauren Kelly: Yeah.

215
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:26.760
Lauren Kelly: Okay.

216
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.850
Lauren Kelly: All right, thank you. I appreciate it.

217
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:36.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anytime 24 hours and I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay.

218
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

219
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Holy cow.

220
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi. Hi, how are you

221
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:50.760
Good.

222
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.450
Michelle Espinoza: Yesterday, I had a bad day.

223
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.160
Michelle Espinoza: It was a really bad day from yesterday was my dad's anniversary and

224
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:12.870
Michelle Espinoza: I just thought about him a lot yesterday, but I got to see my mom. And once I saw my mom, my competitor.

225
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good.

226
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.320
Michelle Espinoza: Good. So yeah, they went out to a degree, but I didn't want to go.

227
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.990
Michelle Espinoza: I was enough to do in our cars. I don't know. Just was enough.

228
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:36.330
Michelle Espinoza: But other than that, I think you're right. I guess I mean I'm stuck at home. Really don't go nowhere, just to my daughters and see my grandkids and back here.

229
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you feeling

230
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.810
Michelle Espinoza: I'm just like, tired. I really haven't been seeking a good REALLY AM TIRED. Yeah.

231
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:57.750
Michelle Espinoza: I mean, just so much that's been going through my head. You know, I lost my cousin, we're really close, then my dad's anniversary came up and then I talked to

232
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:05.610
Michelle Espinoza: We couldn't do trauma yesterday because I wasn't, I was not feeling up to it, but we stay talking on the phone for a while.

233
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

234
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:09.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

235
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do you like her.

236
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:18.060
Michelle Espinoza: She's, she's really nice. I mean, the first time we did it. I thought really relieved. It was like, I don't know.

237
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:27.000
Michelle Espinoza: Like somebody came out of my bodies, I, I totally could have went to sleep while I was at my daughter's house so my grandkids will let me do that.

238
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:43.230
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah, it was like she gave me some pointers of like when I get anxiety, what to do and stuff, but just this whole week. I mean, last week, and then, you know, my dad's anniversary. It was just, I was so miserable last week.

239
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:49.320
Michelle Espinoza: You know, I mean, I even want to do group or anything, but I'm like, you know, get your butt up and you got to do it.

240
00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.330
Michelle Espinoza: Oh,

241
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, but

242
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.170
Michelle Espinoza: I didn't drink.

243
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See

244
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:08.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See it just shows you know right there shows you that you're, you have the capability, even when you're going through tough times, not to reach her a drink.

245
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:15.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, I mean an anniversary of your dad's death. That's a tough scenario. I mean, big time. It is

246
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And all the feelings come up

247
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, all the feelings come up, you know, the last isms up

248
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.980
Michelle Espinoza: repeats itself, you know, just like

249
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:32.910
Michelle Espinoza: He died and you know he had that suffered a lot he were he was strong man.

250
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:44.130
Michelle Espinoza: You know he he was spin sick. All his life he had sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure reading, you name it. He had it, but he worked really hard for me, my brothers and sisters, you know,

251
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:45.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you bring

252
00:29:46.020 --> 00:30:00.240
Michelle Espinoza: Up is was amazing. Like he brought us up to the best ability and I wish I could have brought my kids up at the ranch. The way we were brought up because it's so different, because of respect and like now these kids don't even have respect nowadays, you know,

253

Michelle Espinoza: Just everything and just all this stuff going on.

261
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:58.050
Michelle Espinoza: It's just scary like people are taking it serious at first it was just like a joke and stuff. And now it's like I lost somebody to it. So now that I mean, it makes my whole perspective differently than everybody else because

268
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:31.650
Michelle Espinoza: I don't know, I just, I'm a kind of person, though, when I start thinking about something to just stay stuck in my head for a while and it takes a while for it to go away, I guess.

269
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, remember that you're grieving.

271
00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:54.960

You got to process them like you're doing, you can't stuff and then you know there's going to be good days and there's going to be bad days, you know, always

272
00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:06.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Especially, you know, with the grieving process, my gosh, she could be driving down the road and a memory come to your brain, and boom, you know you're in tears. I mean, it's just part of the process, you know,

273

299
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Funny, you know,

300
00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:06.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's funny how our brain will add things on. Okay, so it's it's stressed out and you're going through this grieving process for your dad, then this happens.

301
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then it progresses on two birthdays and Easter's and what am I going to do. And you know what I mean it, it makes you feel overwhelmed.

302
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:18.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With I'm sure it

303
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know with anxiety with stress over over everything.

304
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The core issue is your loss and the anniversary

305
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:41.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so those two things right there. When you find your mind going on to what's going to happen as far as Easter goes, what's going to happen you know think resolution thoughts. Well, we could do this or we could do this or how

306
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:50.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and try to get your mindset for those things that haven't happened yet in a resolute loot of state. The other to

307
00:34:51.420 --> 00:35:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Michelle, you just gotta, you gotta agree that you got to walk through it. You got to feel those feelings so that they can come out and you can be relieved of all of that pain that you've been holding in, you know,

308
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:02.490

Yeah.

327
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:09.990
