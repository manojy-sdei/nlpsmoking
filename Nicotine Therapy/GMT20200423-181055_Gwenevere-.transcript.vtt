Gwenevere Abriel: Bio psychosocial please transcribe

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say things like client denies history of substance abuse treatment for hospitalization residential intensive outpatient allocation please transcribe specifically those levels of care.

8
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a lot of the transcription of the things that she doesn't endorse, they're also really fruitful because it means she's denying those things. That means that the clinician ask those questions so

9
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.320
Melissa Harrison: Alright.

10
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So all me. That was, um,

11
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That was I just I know better. I should have said it from 10 minutes after

12
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.760
Melissa Harrison: The

13
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hour to set place I'm going to be coming at you with lots of questions a little bit up

14
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And Harrison, you are born June 25

15
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um,

16
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I received was coming after you. After you

17
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you know what, let me let me send a quick message to her.

18
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to be probably a couple minutes late here.

19
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, here we go. So

20
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Today is a bio psychosocial

21
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going to be a lot of history taking

22
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But really quick upfront. I want to give you just a little tiny introduction of who I am, so that you at least know who your therapist is

23
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You already know for group you kind of get the idea. I can be sort of playful, I can get serious. I can cycle educate there's like

24
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: A whole range of different ways to be well today I'm going to be very methodical

25
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And today I'm going to be very, like, what was the age well how much for how long. And when was your last shoes and I'm going to be so repetitive, it's probably going to be annoying and I do apologize for that.

26
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But it probably will never be like that again. Okay.

27
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.890
Okay.

28
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What I've got to do because this is a two hour assessment that I have to jam in one hour.

29
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.020
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

30
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A little intro and me again don't add, of course impression. Let the next one be a better

31
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But again, you know, okay.

32
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So I am a licensed marriage and family therapist here in South Florida and been doing this for over 20 years

33
00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Most of my career has been in the field of substance use. I love it. Just got drawn into it, big piece of it 14 years of it was in a felony drug court here in Broward County.

34
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Great program really change people's lives in a positive way, you're kind of sort of in something like that. So I was like a anybody that comes through the drug court. I want to do it because I love working with folks. I love that idea.

35
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of got a positive angle on on having the judge and to involve most people don't think of it as a positive thing, but I like it because for some people that can't

36
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Remain clean. I can't knock on door. I can't put an ankle bracelet on it on y'all. I can't pull you in custody, if you're

37
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Still using I can't do that. But appeal. Can I can save your life. And I can't go knock on your door like that. So I've always seen it as sort of a positive thing. I'm kind of weird that way.

38
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm glad to be working with you.

39
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple other things. And then we're going to dive right in.

40
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: My phone so my phone, it's my personal cell phone.

41
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And it does

42
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It does mean that I will. I use it for scheduling only as a for scheduling. I don't use it for psychotherapy, so there won't be this ongoing conversation like a friend would it'll be

43
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Kenya can to attend all the work will happen here. I'm an independent contractor. So when you don't show up. Then I'm not going to be earning a living, so there's

44
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: No human over here, it's me.

45
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I work really hard to be here. I did my hair up just for you.

46
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well rested I've eaten well actually haven't eaten yet I'm hydrated. So I really want to be present for you. I'm going to work hard and I'll be here. It was 10 minutes late, and I am sorry about that. It meant that I was

47
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.420
Melissa Harrison: Kind of working with someone interface there. Yeah.

48
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's

49
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.940
Melissa Harrison: Wanting to make sure I didn't like Miss understand or anything.

50
00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So the key with the phone is it'll be tempting to want to have a long conversation, you'll pray, it'll probably happen to you, it happens to everybody. Or like, Yeah, but I'm going to be to be to be to give any of anybody

51
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll give them an Uber. Oh, let's talk about it in, zoom, or you might hear from a care navigator I learned over the years with the best way to do it is you either can attend. Yes, I can confirm. Don't be there or no.

52
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.780
No. Yeah.

53
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.940
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

54
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I really been good. This last year, I've been texting, everybody. The night before, I don't have to do that, but it seems to work for me. And it seems to work for you guys, so I'm gonna try to keep doing that. The other thing is you're in Dr our rails group right

55
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.650
Yeah.

56
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I gotta remind about my ears. I got this year condition and it makes me feel like I'm a 30,000 feet in the air.

57
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there's this pressure on the eardrum. The only way to clear it is I do this really cookie thing or I do that and it might look like I'm making fun of somebody. I'm not

58
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I have to do the hair flip

59
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. So you're going to see me a group probably do that a lot. And you'll just it'll you'll become so normal that it'll be you won't even see it anymore. I've noticed people forget, but I do like pissing people off with that.

60
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So, okay, one more thing. I know that. Oh, the doctor are real thing. So she is my mother.

61
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.060
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, she told me that

62
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So what doesn't happen is

63
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't refer to her that way I you never going to hear stories you know anything really about me. Anyway, I'm not a storyteller. It's better clinically if people kind of

64
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, yeah blank slate kind of thing. But that doesn't prohibit her from doing it. She's not the clinician. So she steps outside that lane.

65
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.610
Melissa Harrison: Gotcha.

66
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: To the degree that I'm comfortable with it. I'll let it flow. There might be times where you might see me kind of cut her off a little bit.

67
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

68
00:07:52.710 --> 00:08:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But here's the key all of it is grist for the mill, meaning it's something that if something you notice happens in group, bring it up, bring it up to me.

69
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.270
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

70
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk about it there. I don't ever get upset over anything. I'm just gonna do my thing. I'm going to take care of myself. No one ever has to take care of me.

71
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So, if you like, Oh that was so weird. I saw you do this and it remind me the way it was my own sister or my mother was like I felt so uncomfortable. I just wanted to call out of my skin.

72
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.250
Melissa Harrison: You

73
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Think happened, nobody ever said that, but it could happen.

74
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you would come to me right and you'd say,

75
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, I did not want to stay in group you, my point is, you can bring up whatever comes up for you. Okay.

76
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.060
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

77
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This is like your first time really being in psychotherapy first time in group is all just brand spanking new so it's going to be

78
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a great impression on you.

79
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:48.750
Know,

80
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Today's not going to be a great impression. So it's going to be super bossy.

81
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And I won't mean to. But this is a hard assessment to get done. Are you ready

82
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:00.480
Melissa Harrison: Let's

83
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Do this. Okay. Only way to do it, jump right in.

84
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And be soon as I can open up this note.

85
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So it is, it's a lot like being on the phone, where there's some discomfort that will come up in the silence. Like, are you still there like low, you know,

86
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll happen. There'll be this weird awkward feeling when it's quiet.

87
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But that has to we have to get comfortable with it. Okay.

88
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:28.920
Okay.

89
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:40.440

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.670
Melissa Harrison: I don't like the taste of alcohol, though I didn't really ever drink it. I would prefer not to. It's not my drug of choice by far.

133
00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:07.440
Melissa Harrison: More recently, I got, I started trying to kinds of wines and I like wines lot. They're not as high percentage or anything, but, um, I started drinking a lot of wine and that's where it progress, but it only progress, like literally a couple months, like

00:44:49.770 --> 00:45:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So client is currently on a one year probation and this treatment right heart health is mandated. Okay, well guess what we only have really three more things to do. Super easy, and they're kind of we get to wing it a little bit with a whopping five minutes that we have

564
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you think of your self esteem from zero to 1010 being, I'm a rock star I set my mind to do some I can kick ass and do it. That's a 10

565
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.560
Melissa Harrison: We like a 7.5 okay

566
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. And now here comes to goals.

567
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: First goal is going to be around why you're here.

568
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean, don't be around the alcohol, probably, or maybe it'll be around something else for you. I want you to think about this category of where I started the questioning, which had to do with substance use.

569
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm included tobacco. It included everything that you use that had a mood altering effect that's what, when you think of a substance use and say mood altering substance, all of those things in that first category.

570
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think of a goal that you have not my goal, not the judges goal of probation officers goal, your goal. That's the one that I'm interested in. That's the one that's going to steer us

571
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: For this time to go home.

572
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So think of it in, in, I want to kind of thing. How would you phrase that goal.

573
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.190
Melissa Harrison: I guess.

574
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:24.960
Melissa Harrison: I want

575
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:33.090
Melissa Harrison: To feel more comfortable with myself in order to not feel like

576
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:40.110

577
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:52.110
Melissa Harrison: A lot of it came with I started spending a lot of time with a certain group of friends and they're drinking all the time. So that's what we started doing I noticed I had stopped hiking a lot

578
00:46:52.980 --> 00:47:08.280
Melissa Harrison: I stopped taking care of myself as much more like I get off work and just go over there and start partying with them because I wanted to hang out with them. So I guess more. I want to feel more comfortable with myself so that I don't feel the need

579
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:14.970
Melissa Harrison: To rely on my friends, I want to be able to rely on myself, Lord.

580
00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:16.500
Melissa Harrison: I guess.

581
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You're almost there. Let's pull us apart. Just a little. I feel more comfortable with myself now picture yourself around your friends and your friends are using substances, right.

582
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Is the thing you want to do more of, I would like to feel more comfortable saying my yes to substance use, or saying my no to substance use, what are you really wanting to do

583
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:43.440
Melissa Harrison: I'm really wanting to feel, I guess, more comfortable and saying though because

584
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:50.490
Melissa Harrison: If you have the power to say no, then it wouldn't really matter what you're around, you would still be able to control yourself.

585
00:47:51.180 --> 00:48:04.560
Melissa Harrison: But if you have that uncertainty of like you might say yes, then, then you're putting yourself in danger, and I don't want to lose my friends as well as put myself in danger, you know, but it's kind of like I have to pick me over them.

586
00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:09.390
Melissa Harrison: About this, I'm going to get to the point where I don't have to make that choice, you know,

587
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Some pretty complex goals. You're saying we have a quite refined it yet.

588
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:15.240
I know

589
00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. I want to feel it might help you look at it.

590
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't look anywhere else. But right here in the blue actually

591
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to feel more comfortable with myself. Is that really it. And if nothing else was there. Would that be true. Is that what you really want. Right there.

592
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:39.000
Melissa Harrison: Because I'm pretty comfortable with myself.

593
00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe it's when

594
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: When

595
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.320
Melissa Harrison: When I guess when I'm at my lowest points.

596
00:48:54.030 --> 00:49:02.670
Melissa Harrison: Because I've noticed while I don't get like depressed. I will have kind of sad days, you know, I just feel like I'm focusing too much on the past and what

597
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:13.770
Melissa Harrison: Me like then what needs to be done. So when I'm down. I booked to my friends to bring me back up, I guess.

598
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.580
Melissa Harrison: And it should be more of a inside myself type of thing.

599
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any of this true, I want to be able to say no to

600
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

601
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it really alcohol and is that really it or

602
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.310
Melissa Harrison: Yeah, that's really

603
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: When friends were using

604
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:45.240
Melissa Harrison: With and I've kind of started getting practice on that nowadays, but it's helped with coronavirus because not, no one's really going out anymore.

605
00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now let's shift gears to more of this emotional stuff. This has to do with that thing you just said that had to do when I'm low

606
00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:57.480
Melissa Harrison: Okay.

607
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think of things you're going to do more of

608
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Or less of. So now think about what depression is for you what anxiety is with self esteem is what ego strength is what my identity, you're a young person right you really young. So what is it that you want more of

609
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:13.020
What

610
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You think about your emotional well being.

611
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:22.140
Melissa Harrison: I guess.

612
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:33.120
Melissa Harrison: I guess I have noticed that like since I started like drinking like my emotional state was way more fragile. I was noticing that like

613
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:46.950
Melissa Harrison: I was just getting upset like about little things like I would get super stressed out at work and like it wouldn't affect the work, but in my head, I could just feel it, you know, like I was worried about something else, the whole time.

614
00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want

615
00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to do more of what do you want to do less of

616
00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

617
00:50:53.250 --> 00:51:08.490
Melissa Harrison: I want to do a lot more being outside like going on hikes and being adventurous. I want to, like, I'm not out of shape but like my butt could get a bit firmer, you know, like I could work out a little bit and get that a bit more enhance and

618
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.230
Melissa Harrison: Just stuff like that. Like I feel like before like before I got on this bender.

619
00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:24.690
Melissa Harrison: I was always out doing fun thing like going to museums are going to concerts are doing this stuff that gets you out there. And then it was like, once I started hanging out with his people.

620
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:38.850
Melissa Harrison: I ended up just we're always going to our homies house and sitting on the couch and playing the same video games and drinking the same alcohol and just got in this word cycle and I'm glad to be out of that because I would much rather be out there doing things

621
00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to go outside doing more things as I get it.

622
00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:43.530
Melissa Harrison: Mm hmm.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to be looking at those every month.

624
