That's okay.

92
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.140
Cricket Icon: Um,

93
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:55.650
Cricket Icon: What I had to do before I make my will not make but I I like my children to earn, what would they get

94
00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:09.390
Cricket Icon: Yeah, well, so I'm like he has his, his monthly calendar and and you know if he's good all day, you'll get all three stickers you get three stickers at day one in the morning, afternoon, and night.

95
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:19.320
Cricket Icon: So, so, like, let's say, for instance, if I have to ask him more than twice to go put his pajamas on then I'll tell him boy sticker.

96
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:34.680
Cricket Icon: But, but, but, but I tell him. Okay, you can make up for that you could on it when when I asked you to brush your teeth. If I ask you one time and he do with that one time, then you, you could gain back your sticker.

97
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:45.960
Cricket Icon: So, so it so it really, really works with his mind. So he's like, okay, I got, I got a sticker taken away because I didn't this and the first time or she asked me to get dressed. So now she asked me to brush my teeth.

98
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:55.050
Cricket Icon: I'm not sure I'm I don't want to ask me a second time. So he goes to the bathroom and he gets to the fullest. He has a little store, you know that he pulls around with him because he's not tall enough

99
00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:03.390
Cricket Icon: And he goes and brushes his teeth right away and then we'll just wait for me to say it. And I'll be like, Okay, did you brush your teeth, and he shows me then.

100
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:11.820
Cricket Icon: They look all nice and pretty clean. I'm like, okay, they look clean and then I just stay quiet and he just waiting and waiting to see if I'm going to give him a sticker back

101
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.800
Cricket Icon: In because I want to see if he's gonna, you know, throw a fan or start throwing

102
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:30.840
Cricket Icon: You know, sorry, baby. And then I want my sticker back and I brushed my teeth and I listened and, you know, so I just kind of put it off and he's grown his grown to learn to just be patient and and and just

103
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:46.920
Cricket Icon: not overreact because you never know what's the what's what's. Well, I could be thinking you know i good on be thinking just just like just gotten him last night like you. You can't overreact about something because

104
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:55.350
Cricket Icon: If I say no. The first time I could be testing you just to see how you're going to act.

105
00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:08.130
Cricket Icon: And if you throw your if you say on that, that's all nonsense and you know goes and throws himself on the couch and start acting like a baby and I'm like month so that he can he get you nowhere.

106
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:18.960
Cricket Icon: That's not going to get to know where at all. All you need to do is say, okay, Mom. I understand. And that's it. You know, whatever the situation is

107
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:28.110
Cricket Icon: That's all you have to say is, OK, Mom, I understand and and then you'll end up getting what you'll want because you behave

108
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:41.070
Cricket Icon: You know, so, so I'm like, like last night. I am an incident had happened to where it had came to him getting dressed and I had to ask them a second time, so

109
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:54.450
Cricket Icon: So I had to go sticker away. Plus, his video game his time was up on his video game, but his father had even 15 more minutes before before he was ready before it's time for bed.

110
00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:03.120
Cricket Icon: So I told his father, he's not going to get that 15 minutes unless he were in SE were to brush his teeth without me having to ask him a second time.

111
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:15.450
Cricket Icon: So I asked him to brush his teeth and he brushed them and he didn't. He didn't bother me after that you just wait it for me to just respond on my own. So finally, like about

112
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:27.120
Cricket Icon: 20 minutes later when when he was getting ready to get tucked in and all that and we took his video games. I mean that I told him you know what month is you got you got your star back

113
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:36.240
Cricket Icon: I said you because you you listened. The first time when I asked you to brush your teeth. I told him so that that's all you have to do. You didn't throw a fit.

114
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:48.540
Cricket Icon: I mean, not a fit, but you didn't throw yourself on the couch and start you know like whining that, you know, Tom. You're not a baby you know you need to act like a five year old, you know,

115
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:56.370
Cricket Icon: I know, I know you're not you're not grown or you're not not grown but you know you're in between, you're growing

116
00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:03.990
Cricket Icon: So you need to start learning responsibilities and you need to start taking responsibility for your own actions.

117
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:20.100
Cricket Icon: So if you did something wrong. Like, like for instance, um, you accidentally kick the juice over on the carpet and automatically deny it. I didn't do that. And it's like, I just saw you do that it's. And so I started teaching him.

118
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:31.290
Cricket Icon: To take responsibility for his own actions because if I don't teach in it. If I don't teach him that now in life, later on in life.

119
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:39.780
Cricket Icon: He's not he's not going to know what to do in a situation like that happen all he's going to do is be in denial, all the time.

120
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:57.480
Cricket Icon: And you can get you can get through, through nobody by talking through like by by talking to them or you can get through anything without taking responsibility for your actions. So he's he's doing that as well to

121
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:08.490
Cricket Icon: Him being out of school. You know, it's, it's very difficult for for the father and I like the father comes over, over every day and hopefully take care of them.

122
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:19.260
Cricket Icon: All day and then you call it goes home and it just, it was same routine every day, but at least have his father to help me discipline him but um he's he's really really has has

123
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:32.250
Cricket Icon: has grasped on to everything that that you know that I'm that I'm trying to not trying, but that I am showing him. He's progress like 100% so

124
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:39.270
Cricket Icon: I mean, he's doing great. He's doing great out of school. Besides the fact that he misses his friends of course mean

125
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:58.470
Cricket Icon: Etc. And being that we can't do that, due to this coronavirus, you know, so, um, you know, I take him and his brother, while before they they put the lead the yellow tight. The yellow tape around the playground. I was taking sorry my allergies.

126
00:18:59.370 --> 00:18:59.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

127
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.900
Cricket Icon: It's going to my throat. It's getting to my nose. My eyes.

128
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:14.820
Cricket Icon: So, um, before the, the yellow tape was around, I would take him in his brother to go at the park for like 15 minutes, you know, we would ponder mass gloves.

129
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:28.410
Cricket Icon: You know, and stuff and constantly washing their hands in that. But, um, I mean, now we can do nothing, or go nowhere you know because I'm just really, really scared to catch to catch it such an awful sickness, you know,

130
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:36.660
Cricket Icon: Yeah, little deeds death. So, um, so just at this point. I mean, I'm just trying to just by, you know, fun activities like that.

131
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:45.270
Cricket Icon: To keep the kids busy as well as teaching them something. It's not just a video game that they're just stuck on and they're not learning nothing

132
00:19:45.690 --> 00:20:07.320
Cricket Icon: Yeah, yeah. So I got my son that and on Monday, my, my son turned one Mikkel Carlitos and like I said, we just had K for him in a little meal I bought in this little toy. I don't know if you see it, but it had like the balls and you could throw me in, you know, turn it on. It's like you

133
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.080
Cricket Icon: Put a man

134
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:26.190
Cricket Icon: throws the ball that him and stuff. And it teaches them his his his ABC and 123 years and it's interesting. So, you know, it teaches them I coordination and

135
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:39.660
Cricket Icon: Hand coordination, you know, hearing it teaches them a lot of stuff I've noticed when he plays with it. He has a blast. He's like, in, in his own little world. He's like, leave me alone. This is my little sanctuary.

136
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good.

137
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:51.240

163
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:45.780
Cricket Icon: Um, as a matter of fact, they told me that the latest is Friday, but but the thing is is I don't know how to go about it because I didn't claim my son wanted on these taxes.

164
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:59.880
Cricket Icon: Due to how I was telling you what the State if the state was claiming them or what, but I've had Montez since like January. So I've had him all year. So

165
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:13.770
Cricket Icon: I don't know who to get in contact with to see about getting his his his amount of money because they're they're only telling me that I'm only going to get for me and my and my two kids that I cleaned up my taxes.

166
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:24.270
Cricket Icon: Claimed in 2018 but not 19 but um I mean I need, I need his, his, um, his check as well, too, because

167
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:37.140
Cricket Icon: The $500 is they they get $500 teach kids so you know the course of $500 I'm going to spend on my teenager. The $500 to spend on my baby. And then what about him.

168
00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:58.890
Cricket Icon: Yeah, and and and then of course if they don't give it to me, of course. I'm going to buy him stuff out of, out of what they gave me but but with what but with the one I have, I need to use that on putting a deposit on to into another house and you know they they charge application fees.

169
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.580
Cricket Icon: Now,

170
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:12.720
Cricket Icon: That drop. I mean, it's $900 you know first month's rent everything. So that's what I was looking forward to that going to, so I'm gonna I'm gonna call. I'm going to call the

171
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:21.000
Cricket Icon: I'm not too sure what his name is. I think it. I think it's the IRS. The gentleman that that me when my check would be in

172
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:30.330
Cricket Icon: I'm going to call him to him about it and see what he says how how I go about that because I'm my son does deserve a check, you know,

173
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:45.360
Cricket Icon: Yeah, he with me. He's not with the state, he has to be able to state since January so um and I have a letter stating that you know that they its own since it's on on on sustained.

174
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:56.700
Cricket Icon: Meaning that it's over with his. Oh, I mean, I don't know why he wouldn't be approved for for the tech for the stimulus check

175
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:57.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

176
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.590
Cricket Icon: He should be

177
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:15.090
Cricket Icon: Handled in that, you know, hopefully, it might even be in the mail today when the mailman comes either today or tomorrow or Friday, but one of these days, he said he's all by, by the end of the week. It has to be in for sure. By the end of the week because it was sent out on the 24th.

178
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:21.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about. Let me ask you if you tried to apply for unemployment.

179
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:30.270
Cricket Icon: Unemployment, no I didn't apply for unemployment, I ended up picking up three hours at work.

180
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:39.540
Cricket Icon: And picking up that work. I found a client that that was willing to lead me in their house with this sickness going on just long so

181
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wearing gloves.

182
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.720
Cricket Icon: And a mask so

183
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:43.170
Okay.

184
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:57.300
Cricket Icon: I mean, okay. I have, it's actually better I should have when I should just go and apply for unemployment, because everybody that's getting employment is getting 1200 dollars we

185
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they're getting what they would normally get an unemployment plus and added $600

186
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:10.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A week. So that's why, like people are making more money on unemployment right now than they are the regular job.

187
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.290
Cricket Icon: Interesting. Very, very interesting.

188
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It really is in it because you're working. How many hours a week.

189
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:31.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: three so three hours a week. You know what I mean, I don't see why you wouldn't qualify for, you know, to get it for a little bit. Any little bit helps.

190
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:32.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

191
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:42.690
Cricket Icon: Yeah, if I if I'm only working three. I mean, I'm, I'm sorry, not three hours a week, three hours a day. So 20 hours a week.

192
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:51.510
Cricket Icon: If I'm on much when many hours a week what it will I still approve or for unemployment.

193
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your hours were cut in half right.

194
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.370
Cricket Icon: Um,

195
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.450
Cricket Icon: Yes, yes, yes, they were

196
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:06.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the idea is to help compensate for the hours that you have lost, you know,

197
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:14.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and it's definitely you know something for you to look into to help with your financial situation, um,

198
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:17.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

199
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.690
Cricket Icon: OK. OK, I will give you a call back. Okay, I'm so sorry.

200
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:33.630
Cricket Icon: I really do apologize. My sister's Kona. Then she said that it's urgent to answer. I'm sorry.

201
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.270
Cricket Icon: No, that's okay. Can you go on.

202
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I was just gonna say it's worth checking into to see if you qualify for it. It will help you financially.

203
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So okay, so just even if you look into it and they say no, you don't qualify. At least you know

204
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

205
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah, totally. But

206
00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't see why you wouldn't when you

207
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your hours have been cut in half.

208
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

209
00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:03.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's some kind of help to financially something to look into. Okay.

210
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.010
Um, alright,

211
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:07.920

Cricket Icon: And she she keeps on telling me, and I don't wanna. I don't want to argue with her, of course, because she's, she's a really good doctor. But she's like, No, I'm gonna keep you on keeping you on your on your weakness for now because

247
00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:53.700

Cricket Icon: So now, so now she's saying that that since since I missed. I don't know, whatever, whatever meeting, she's talking about. I told her, the only

250

Cricket Icon: For you to swear on a whole a whole month in order for you to start your, your, your two weeks, again, and I'm like,

254
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:14.850
Cricket Icon: This just just ain't fair to me. It's not fair when she's giving people their month lease and she's literally telling them like you've, you've already missed you. You already missed to um

255
00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:23.550

00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:53.490
Cricket Icon: And and she took me back down to my weeklies and there's people that that that that aren't even going to their meetings at all. And she's still giving them their month lease and it's just unfair to me it's unfair to me.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, so I just emailed her and

260
