Richelle Direny: If they

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.260
Richelle Direny: No one shows up in the next 10 minutes. I was just wondering councilman unless you have anything there anything going on, how's your dad ISN'T YOUR DAD in the hospital.

16
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:19.890
David Hollifield: Yeah, yeah. My dad was my mom has been in the hospital. She's home now and my dad's actually been really sick. I had to take him to the emergency room two nights ago

17
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:33.150
David Hollifield: But a latest thing is the real bad cold. He said, like the flu going around, I guess. And other than that everything's been all right you know I'm getting really, really antsy excited. You know, we started college

18
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.400
David Hollifield: I

19
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.650

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.940
David Hollifield: Yeah yeah

22
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.680
Richelle Direny: Well, you know, be stopped for a while and start macro down

23
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.750
David Hollifield: Yeah, it's been it's been probably

24
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.250
David Hollifield: 15 years, excuse me, since I've been but yeah I'm going back so

25
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:10.800
David Hollifield: I still got a long journey ahead of me. You know, I need a lot of work credits, obviously, but that's all right. Now please switch my major over I'm going for computer science now and back in them days I was going for business management.

26
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.050
Richelle Direny: Oh that's a big switch

27
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.410
David Hollifield: Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty good with computers. So

28
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.540
David Hollifield: I'm gonna

29
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.690
Richelle Direny: Are you work in that arena now.

30
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.910
David Hollifield: No, no, I'm not. I would love to, but I'm currently not working at all. I'm actually looking for a job, actually, as we speak.

31
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.370
David Hollifield: I mean, it will need

32
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.560
Richelle Direny: To find a job in in in that field. So now when you do

33
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:46.320
David Hollifield: Yeah, that's the plan. You know, hopefully give me a job in the field. While I am going to school and then that way you know I can.

34
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.350
David Hollifield: You know, build a resume a little bit, you know,

35
00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:03.810
David Hollifield: Like my brother, for example, he has a bachelor's degree in marketing and he's never had a job in that field. So always had his degree for about two years and he followed to stop looking, you know, he got into Chrysler. So he's just working there.

36
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.160
Richelle Direny: If you like that over in Michigan, the big, the big thing. You already have the people I speak.

37
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.900
Richelle Direny: To kind of work.

38
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:24.330
David Hollifield: Yeah yeah that was I told my experience. I used to work at Chrysler I had 10 years in there and I took the buyout, which was a major mistake in my life that I wish I could take back but

39
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.540
Richelle Direny: Not when you were working there.

40
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.840
Richelle Direny: Because they were closing down a few years ago.

41
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.230
David Hollifield: Yeah, I took it in 2009 so 11 years ago.

42
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.060
David Hollifield: You know what it was like a scare tactic, you know, they pretty much like scared is taking taking the buyout

43
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:55.410
David Hollifield: You know, because they were switching ownership to the company like it was diamond Chrysler when I got hired that it was Chrysler LLC. When I took the buyout and now it's Fiat Chrysler so they just keep changing ownership basically

44
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:16.620
David Hollifield: Everything's been going. All right. Like I said, I'm just, I'm just stressed about the cows thing. You know, like, I mean, I think I'm pretty much. Sure, I'll be all right you know just just just nerves. No.

45
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:28.530
Richelle Direny: I mean, when you think that what like what specifically are you anxious about, is it just the idea of going back into this structured setting and having to study in crime everything that goes with it.

46
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.820
David Hollifield: Yeah. Yeah. And I know that you know I'm looking forward to that structured setting for sure because it helped get me back on.

47
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:45.060
David Hollifield: A good regimen, I guess, if you will, but I'm just nervous. You know, like I said, I just hope that what I know and

48
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:59.700
David Hollifield: I like the way I've been taught how to study and stuff like that, you know, or just, you know, with everything going on with my doctor's appointments and me looking for a job. I just, I know, at times I get overwhelmed and I'm trying not to be that way.

49
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.670
David Hollifield: Things.

50
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.110
Richelle Direny: Going on at one time that

51
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:11.520
David Hollifield: Yeah yeah what too many things go on, you know, at a time for me. Yes, I definitely get overwhelmed and

52
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.150
David Hollifield: I tend to fumble the ball, if you will.

53
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.920
Richelle Direny: Oh, I mean, that's right. You live with your parents. So you're also helping them.

54
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:28.830
David Hollifield: Yeah, that's that's 80% of what I do. Right there. I'm already stressed out to the max because of that because my brother, my sister don't help at all.

55
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.190
Richelle Direny: Um site like what, exactly. So when you say you help them like exactly what do you do

56
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:45.840
David Hollifield: Do the laundry I cook the meals with the gold the grocery store. I do all the shopping. You know, you pretty much name it other than bathing them. That's what I do.

57
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.300
Richelle Direny: And they don't know where they are. These your dad or anybody where they are the veterans.

58
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.150
David Hollifield: My dad. Yeah, he's a visa better

59
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.380
Richelle Direny: But then didn't does he get some help from the VA.

60
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.860
David Hollifield: Know he put in four years in the Air Force.

61
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:11.760
David Hollifield: Years and years ago but now I don't think he's ever applied for any help from the VA. He tried. He tried one time, years ago, he said, and never helped them.

62
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:22.380
David Hollifield: It's like you here. Yeah, yeah, he's tried, I guess, because I'm the youngest of three kids. So I guess my mom was pregnant, my brother, who's the oldest

63
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:31.380
David Hollifield: My dad reached out to them because back in them days crisis was really, really slow because my dad retired from there, you know, and apply for help or whatever they never did you not to help them.

64
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.440
David Hollifield: So he just pretty much gave up on them.

65
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:46.230
Richelle Direny: I mean, maybe you can try to call back again. Or you can call you know because like even was getting help for someone to come out and help him. Like if he needs that visits and stuff like that, they will

66
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.930
David Hollifield: Yeah, yeah. To be honest, I don't even know where to start, you know,

67
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.640
Richelle Direny: Where's the closest VA to where you are.

68
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.380
David Hollifield: I don't know. That's a good question. I have to Google that I guess and find that out.

69
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.750
David Hollifield: You know,

70
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.250
Because

71
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:15.450
David Hollifield: I've just been overwhelmed, like, you know, with do it all that I do here, you know, and I'm grateful that I had my parents both still alive for one, you know,

72
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:29.130
David Hollifield: And always came up with the model like they helped raise me. So, you know, and they always were there if I needed help. So I would never give up on them. So it's just kind of frustrating to me that my brother, my sister like seem like they don't even care.

73
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.630
David Hollifield: You know,

74
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.210
David Hollifield: And that's very frustrating.

75
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.140
Richelle Direny: It is very do they live locally or they

76
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.960
David Hollifield: Know, they're locally and my bottle is about

77
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.330
David Hollifield: Two miles one way. My sister lives about two and a half miles. The other way.

78
00:08:53.130 --> 00:09:03.990
David Hollifield: So it's just tough, you know, my mom. My mom is really bad. You know, like she needs a lot of care. She's not only like slipping away physically was just slipping away mentally

79
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.260
David Hollifield: She has a lot of mental health problems, as do I.

80
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.200
David Hollifield: And, uh, you know, she is. Let me see. She's 69 years old.

81
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.080
David Hollifield: And my dad is 77

82
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:34.950
David Hollifield: My dad, he's in a way better spot and what my mom is but my dad, you know, he has a lot of pressure on him to. We don't all the bills and stuff. And I do what I can. As far as like, you know, to help them, you know, picking up cash jobs or or whatnot.

83
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.890
David Hollifield: And it just seems like there's there's only so many hours in the day, you know,

84
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:49.290
David Hollifield: And I don't know, like, like I well, contrary to what I said earlier I said I kind of fumbled the ball lot

85
00:09:50.010 --> 00:10:01.170
David Hollifield: Actually, I don't like a really good in the clutch, but same time, you know, just when I get overwhelmed. I can still pull it off but same time like it. It takes a big toll on me, you know,

86
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.800
David Hollifield: What's that

87
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.810
Richelle Direny: Yes, it is.

88
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.360
David Hollifield: Yeah, for sure, you know, but I won't give up on you know

89
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:23.580
David Hollifield: I mean, I used to have a home mortgage. I was at Chrysler vehicle everything night I gave all that away.

90
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.080
David Hollifield: You know,

91
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:27.930
Richelle Direny: You gave it

92
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.810
Richelle Direny: Like willingly on

93
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.020
David Hollifield: Ya know, willingly like I for close to my home willingly

94
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.760
David Hollifield: Everything like my car got impounded what that was like what I was like really bad in my diction to though, you know,

95
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.420
David Hollifield: But I've been doing

96
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:52.020
Richelle Direny: Jesus that's partly why your, your siblings have kind of like taking a backseat.

97
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.720
Richelle Direny: Where they're not necessarily

98
00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:02.550
David Hollifield: No, I don't think so, because even when I did have those things. I still help my parents, you're just like,

99
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:21.330
David Hollifield: Okay, there's three of us. I got older brother older sister. They're both married here I am, single, it's like they they've made comments to me several times being like, Well, you know, we have families, basically. So you don't. So it's pretty much like falls on you.

100
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.180
David Hollifield: Which I think is absolutely ridiculous.

101
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:42.810
David Hollifield: But I mean, I can only take so much to be honest with you, like, just the other night I felt like I was on the verge of cracking. Like I you know I gotta get out of here. I mean, that's how I look at it as I can only do so much. I'm not, I'm not Superman, you know,

102
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:47.220
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

103
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:56.010
David Hollifield: But at the same time. Like I said, I'm very, very grateful for them because if they weren't around i don't i don't know where I'm staying at right now, you know,

104
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:06.690
David Hollifield: And yes, I mean that. I mean, like I said, I'm very grateful for that. I'm very humbled by that but

105
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.200
David Hollifield: How I look at it I feel like I'm a burden.

106
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.700
David Hollifield: You know,

107
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.130
Richelle Direny: Like you're burning to them.

108
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:24.570
David Hollifield: Yeah for sure because you know my family's all from the south so like my grandmother's is 90 years old. She's the only grandparent, I have left it's alive as by Miles mother.

109
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:36.060
David Hollifield: And she needs. My parents down there is what she's been saying my parents are wanting to go, but due to their health reasons, they're not going. I just feel like, you know, I'm

110
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:50.460
David Hollifield: I'm like holding them up because I know they don't want to leave me until I'm stable. Like I told him, I said, you know, like, I'll figure it out. You know, if I just had my sister for a little while. My sister already told me that I could

111
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.340
David Hollifield: You know, I'll do that. But

112
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.590
David Hollifield: I don't know, it's just really, really hard to explain. I never really opened up too much about it.

113
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:08.130
David Hollifield: Even with like prior therapist like pretty much what I just told you in the past five minutes is is is a lot for me, you know,

114
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:15.930
David Hollifield: I don't know. I just don't. I already feel overwhelmed and I don't want to feel overwhelmed, to the point where

115
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.200
David Hollifield: I feel like a little, like, no.

116
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.980
Richelle Direny: You say you don't want to feel on the one to the point where

117
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.600
David Hollifield: Like I lose it. You know, like mentally. Hmm.

118
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.280
David Hollifield: A couple times.

119
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.020
David Hollifield: And I had been like, yeah, sure, you know, a couple different times.

120
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:44.130
Richelle Direny: What. Um, and so, but your stressor right now is it sounds like it's multiple things. It sounds like there is

121
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.500
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like a whole lot of things kind of what your stressor is

122
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.760
Richelle Direny: You having to be the caretaker for your parents.

123
00:13:54.270 --> 00:14:01.200
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I'm them possibly moving to you, said to her, your mom sister.

124
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.960
David Hollifield: Not my mom, my mother, my grandmother. She knows I'm talking here we are in Michigan.

125
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.280
David Hollifield: Okay, she

126
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.660
Richelle Direny: wants her to come there.

127
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:19.380
David Hollifield: Yeah because about three about three months ago, my grandmother stay with my uncle, which is my mouse baby brother when he passed away about three months ago.

128
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:37.050
David Hollifield: So now my grandmother died salt is like all alone, which is putting a big guilt of my mom because she's she was the oldest child of her family and my mom like she dropped out of school and like the seventh or eighth grade to take care of our brothers and sisters

129
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:50.790
David Hollifield: You know, so my mom feels a tremendous guilt and remember my mom really close and my mom just just come down there, but I can't. A lot probation, you know, you can't do it.

130
00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:03.870
Richelle Direny: So, so then you hear that, if your mom needs. If your mom and dad leaves to go to Kentucky permanently. You wouldn't you will end up not having somewhere to stay

131
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:11.490
David Hollifield: Well, my sister told me I can stay there, but I don't want to stay there. I mean, even if it's temporary or whatever, that's fine.

132
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:22.110
David Hollifield: But like, say if they moved to Kentucky tomorrow I put either a six months or 12 months goal that I'd be out there and I do what I had to do for work.

133
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:37.200
David Hollifield: And then I just save up every penny I had, you know, and hopefully be like employed to the point where it's actually stable for once, because the last few jobs that I've had have not been stable.

134
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:56.010
David Hollifield: Whether whether there are like through like a temp service or something, you know, and the job assignment and or the company I'm working for slows down had layoffs. It just seems like that nothing. You know, I work so hard. It just seems like nothing goes my way

135
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.050
David Hollifield: You know,

136
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:08.160
David Hollifield: And it's, it's very frustrating. So that's why I made the decision to go back to college, you know, because I'm very determined to have a successful future

137
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:15.090
Richelle Direny: And how long is so one of these, you started on one goal, you're, you're signed up for school, when are you

138
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.090
Richelle Direny: How long is the program.

139
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:27.060
David Hollifield: All bestsellers. It's a four year program but I already had some college credit transfer. So we're probably looking at about three and a half years.

140
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:39.960
David Hollifield: Maybe three. They said, depending, you know, if I take summer courses and all that. So it's gonna be, it's gonna be a little journey, but you know, I'm pretty confident that I can do it, you know.

141
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.100
Richelle Direny: The appearance teams have any support for you so

142
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:55.020
David Hollifield: A few friends here and there, but a lot of the friends I do have, they're not necessarily good influences

143
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.260
David Hollifield: But I do have a couple that you know I speak to their great influences

144
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:03.630
David Hollifield: And

145
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.220
David Hollifield: Don't know. Like I said, I bought like male friends, for example.

146
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.580
David Hollifield: I have a hard time opening up to males.

147
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.210
David Hollifield: I don't know. I said, I have a hard time opening up to

148
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.230
David Hollifield: Man, yeah.

149
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:26.670
David Hollifield: You know, I'm pretty sure I've never really spoke on it. Maybe you get to the bottom of it, but

150
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:34.230
David Hollifield: I'm pretty sure it's how I was raised, you know, like I wasn't really really close to my dad at all, going out.

151
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.800
David Hollifield: You know, I like here, he hasn't gambling addiction.

152
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.830
David Hollifield: And so he was never way there.

153
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.180
David Hollifield: You know,

154
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.490
Richelle Direny: How much older is your brother.

155
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.040
David Hollifield: My brother is five years older than me.

156
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.290
Richelle Direny: Okay. And so, you weren't getting close to him. Growing up either

157
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.770
David Hollifield: Now we're close. Growing up, but I'm

158
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.750
David Hollifield: Not as much. I was more close to my sister and she's three and a half years older than me.

159
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:18.870
David Hollifield: As far as opening up you know I know they're my family and stuff, but I just have a hard time opening up for males in general that I don't know why that is.

160
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:21.930
David Hollifield: Now,

161
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.550
Richelle Direny: Beginning that your father wasn't necessarily there because he was a gambler means that he was always

162
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.290
David Hollifield: Out of the house. Yeah.

163
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.340
Richelle Direny: And when he would come. He wasn't um

164
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.060
David Hollifield: Yeah, besides him working stuff. He always did.

165
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.180
David Hollifield: You know, six, seven days a week.

166
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.310
David Hollifield: Seemed like

167
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.610
David Hollifield: When he wasn't working or anything. He was always at the casino. So I didn't see him that much.

168
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.110
Richelle Direny: Is that the reason why your brother Pisces distant from you.

169
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.400
David Hollifield: I don't

170
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:05.910
David Hollifield: Know it just seems like like what's up with my addiction issues in the past and stuff like I'm kind of like the black sheep, so it's like

171
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:19.170
David Hollifield: You know, like my dad bought me to this day, like my dad. He just doesn't show me the love that he does my brother, my sister, because they they never suffer from addiction issues, but I did.

172
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.260
Richelle Direny: And you think that I'm the reason why you're not close to your dad. It's because of

173
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.080
David Hollifield: Absolutely.

174
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.390
David Hollifield: And, you know, that hurts like you know that

175
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.260
David Hollifield: That's really painful to talk about, but

176
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.120
David Hollifield: Yeah, absolutely.

177
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.120
Richelle Direny: Yeah, how is it now.

178
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.260
Richelle Direny: That you're there somewhere caretaker.

179
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.480
David Hollifield: Well yeah, I mean it's brought us together you know a lot more

180
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.610
David Hollifield: You know, but

181
00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:06.450
David Hollifield: I mean, I still feel like the black sheep, you know, like seems like he talks highly of them when it comes to me it's just always a lecture or if he's talking to somebody about me.

182
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.550
David Hollifield: You know,

183
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:16.110
David Hollifield: It's like he doesn't say it, but I know how he's feeling like I know I'm like I let him know you know growing up and

184
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.710
David Hollifield: It is what it is I goes

185
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.630
Richelle Direny: It's still like way now.

186
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:31.290
David Hollifield: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, he doesn't respect me as much as he does my brother, my sister. Hundred percent and that hurts. That hurts me a lot.

187
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:46.380
David Hollifield: Even though I am here. I did come back here to help take care of them. It was originally from my mom, you know, my dad always had good health. You know, they end up having heart surgery and he's blind in one. I know.

188
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:53.640
David Hollifield: You know, and so he needs me to help him and which I do I don't complain about it at all.

189
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:55.770
David Hollifield: No.

190
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.920
David Hollifield: I don't know i don't i don't really know exactly what I'm trying to figure out what point is

191
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.450
David Hollifield: It just hurtful, you know, really is.

192
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.100
David Hollifield: You know,

193
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:23.310
David Hollifield: Because I've never really spoken before me. I have you on the past I've tried a little bit here and there but I tend to backpedal I guess would be the right word because

194
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:36.660
David Hollifield: I don't want to say too much, you know, and then cuz me my sister, even over very close. Growing up, like my dad is super, super close with her and she has a tendency to flip it on me.

195
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:43.620
David Hollifield: Like just start like a lot of arguments and stuff. And I don't know, it's just, it's just hard. It's very stressful.

196
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:53.040
David Hollifield: But my brother. He pretty much stays to have amongst himself and his family. Like, I don't see my brother, Ralph.

197
00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:05.070
Richelle Direny: And the line of that is because of the addiction, like the stream between your, your relationship with your brothers because of the addiction.

198
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:14.820
David Hollifield: Partially yeah but same time it's like my dad's addiction to stopping by and you're like, I mean, growing up like

199
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:27.510
David Hollifield: You know, we're considered like mid to upper middle class, I guess you could say. But there were several years growing up. We had no school clothes or nothing because of his gambling.

200
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:33.750
David Hollifield: You know, I mean, he made 100,000 hours a year, there's no excuse why you couldn't you couldn't put a

201
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:45.210
David Hollifield: pair of Nike is on his sons and honest kids feet. You know, we never had closed like that. I mean, we did, but it was always scrambling

202
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.560
David Hollifield: You know, so it's like I feel like my dad didn't put us first

203
00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:00.510
David Hollifield: You know and trust me, I'm not a materialistic person whatsoever. I got a pair of shoes, my feet. I'm grateful, you know, but

204
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.540
David Hollifield: I feel strongly in there, Mr 22. I can. He never put us first

205
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.490
David Hollifield: Yeah, man, that, that hurts me

206
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.650
Richelle Direny: Do you find you say you follow up with a psychiatrist in the community. Right.

207
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.410
David Hollifield: Yeah, yes, I do a lot of different medications. Yeah.

208
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.530
Richelle Direny: When was the last time you saw your secretary

209
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.840
David Hollifield: Was about two weeks ago.

210
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.470
David Hollifield: I got another appointment while so my phone. So we figure, a month out

211
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.260
But they put the put

212
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:39.810
David Hollifield: The

213
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.280
Richelle Direny: put you under, who is it a try a new medication.

214
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:58.110
David Hollifield: No, no, I've been on the same medications. I mean, for quite some time that the medicines are doing great for me. But I do think like my mood stabilizers stuff needs to be altered, which I'm going to talk to her next time I go see her.

215
00:23:59.520 --> 00:23:59.970
David Hollifield: You know,

216
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:11.400
David Hollifield: I take an antidepressant a mood stabilizer, you know, and then I also takes up to for ADHD and I take something for insomnia and stuff at night.

217
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:25.800
David Hollifield: So I take a you know a different amount of medications and which I've been doing for years. It's like my early 20s and now I'm almost 40, so I think I'm on the right restaurant right now.

218
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:35.760
David Hollifield: Well, because I'm bipolar y'all been diagnosed that for years. And I do think my mood stabilizer needs to be adjusted.

219
00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:44.040
Richelle Direny: Okay, so maybe when you speak to him. When you meet with your doctor, you could just let them know

220
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.810
David Hollifield: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to for sure that you fill in for you.

221
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:56.640
David Hollifield: Yeah, she's really, really nice. I'm a senior now for about a year and a half, and she's very understanding. She actually listens.

222
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:10.680
David Hollifield: Know, because a lot of times I've been going some of the sites and stuff over the years that usually when I come into the room dirt automatically like right my scripts without even talking to me. Yo, and

223
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.680
David Hollifield: That right there is just like

224
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.200
David Hollifield: Like label. I mean, you know, like, okay, like you're not even listening to what I'm trying to say, you know,

225
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:31.830
David Hollifield: What Dr. I have now. Yeah, she's very, very good. She actually listens like no like me. Hello, sit there and talk for 2025 minutes. No one session alone, and then we'll talk about medication, you know,

226
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.430
David Hollifield: I definitely feel like I haven't very good psychiatrist right now.

227
00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.000
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

228
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:51.690
Richelle Direny: That's good, that she was gone. When you speak to her again. It's just to discuss, you know, kind of

229
00:25:54.450 --> 00:26:00.240
Richelle Direny: You know, if there's an urgent need to adjust your medication or we kind of like what needs to happen.

230
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.230
David Hollifield: All right. Yeah, I'll do that when I see you next time. Definitely.

231
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.850
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah cuz I mean I think right now, your mood. You said you're diagnosed with bipolar one or

232
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:17.070
David Hollifield: You know what, I'm not sure which one it's the one where I'm more manic depressive you know I get very, very low.

233
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:26.760
David Hollifield: I want to say it was one is I don't remember. But yeah, my mood y'all is it's been all over the place.

234
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.030
David Hollifield: we're to the point where I'm having a hard time controlling it. No.

235
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:46.530
David Hollifield: But I do take meds for you know antidepressant. I do. I do have a mood stabilizer. I take something for anxiety I take something for ADHD that takes some time for sleep.

236
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:57.330
David Hollifield: So like I have a lot of medicine. And that's another thing I don't like sharing that with a lot of people because I seem to automatically get judged, you know,

237
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.090
David Hollifield: And I don't know, like, really gets to me.

238
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.130
Richelle Direny: You say you feel like you're judged. When people know that you're on a lot of medication.

239
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:21.810
David Hollifield: Yeah, because the first thing they always say is, Oh my gosh, run a lot of medicine. Is that necessary, you know, yeah, it is necessary because that's what works for me. You know, I just I can't help it, that I need that kind of medicine, you know,

240
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.980
David Hollifield: And I don't know, it just seems like my life is like a constant roller coaster ride.

241
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.250
Richelle Direny: Do you have children.

242
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.240
David Hollifield: Yes, I have two sons. Do you see them.

243
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:45.810
David Hollifield: Yeah, I haven't seen him in a while, you know, because I was going through pretty much guard period. And I told her mother. You know, honestly.

244
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:57.630
David Hollifield: I'm working on me right now, but I do talk to them. I just, I just don't want to see them or my mood is all over the place. You know, because it's a child doesn't understand, you know,

245
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.700
David Hollifield: My oldest is 15 and my youngest is nine.

246
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.040
Richelle Direny: And do they live close or they live.

247
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:17.340
David Hollifield: Their different two separate mothers. So my 15 year old yeah he lives about 10 minute drive 1015 minute drive not far at all.

248
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:33.360
David Hollifield: But my youngest they live in to come to Michigan, which is a couple hour drive because his mother graduated from nursing school. She's a nurse out there. So I haven't seen him in a while because like I said it's two, two and a half hour drive, but I do speak to them.

249
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:36.720
David Hollifield: You know,

250
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.360
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

251
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.400
David Hollifield: I do what I can. No.

252
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:54.390
Richelle Direny: I mean, I would agree with you, um, you know, like you said, working on yourself. I'm kind of being in a better place. But you said right now you're currently is that you're really anxious right now.

253
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.820
David Hollifield: Yeah, pretty much. Yeah.

254
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:04.080
David Hollifield: Just, I mean, I'm sure I'll feel better. Once I actually do skirts know start school and get going.

255
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.520
David Hollifield: You know, like the job situation really stresses me out.

256
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:18.420
David Hollifield: Because I am looking for work. You know, I know the school like had a couple of job postings for doing a little bit here and there.

257
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:32.850
David Hollifield: You know, and I actually took it and I got the email saying that they want me to do it. I'm waiting for some like welcoming kit mail right now to actually, you know, sign up and do the job. They said I was selected so

258
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.510
David Hollifield: Which is a great thing, I think, no.

259
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.150
I think it's a good thing is

260
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:50.910
Richelle Direny: Thing and you know once you. I mean, that's a you already have your goal for what you want to do.

261
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:52.320
Yeah.

262
00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:06.600
Richelle Direny: You know your plan, you know you for your fallback plans if your grandmother, what you're saying if your, if your mom moves in with your grandmother, your fallback plan is that you would

263
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.050
Richelle Direny: Stay with your sister, but um

264
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.680
David Hollifield: You said that

265
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.620
Richelle Direny: You pretty much have a decent relationship with your sister.

266
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:25.440
David Hollifield: Yeah, when it's up and down, cuz she suffers from mental health as well. And she chooses just a smoke weed smoke marijuana and she's not medicated

267
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:32.940
David Hollifield: She I don't do that. I mean, there's nothing wrong with it, but I just I don't smoke marijuana. It's just not me and

268
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:41.370
David Hollifield: So, you know, made her get along great at times are times were fighting like crazy, you know,

269
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.020
David Hollifield: So,

270
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.400
Richelle Direny: But being in that environment isn't. Wouldn't that be a trigger.

271
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:57.360
David Hollifield: Was with my sister for her smoking marijuana. No, I don't think so at all because like I said, I am not a fan of marijuana whatsoever.

272
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.070
David Hollifield: No.

273
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.500
Richelle Direny: Okay.

274
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:09.390
David Hollifield: Okay. Yeah, no, I don't agree with that at all. I mean, that's just me, but no, I'm definitely not a pot smoker.

275
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:22.770
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's kind of like, you know, if that that bridge came, you will have to consider whether or not you would be a bridge.

276
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:28.830
David Hollifield: Yeah. Yeah, but I already know. Like I said last time I spoke to

279
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.650
David Hollifield: Oh yeah, I mean,

280
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:45.090
David Hollifield: That's why I'm working on to have another option because I really don't want to stay with her, you know,

281
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:53.490
David Hollifield: I want to do it all by myself course. Well, I'm just not in the position to do that right now.

282
00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:58.290
Richelle Direny: Yeah.

283
00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:59.280

David Hollifield: School

293
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:38.580
Richelle Direny: You know, not putting not over exerting yourself with anything else just kind of just saying focus on school. The rest will kind of fall in place.

Richelle Direny: Okay. Well, look, I said one thing at a time. It's just a focus on one, especially if you, you know, you get overwhelmed and stressed very easily. It's just taking just you know one thing at a time.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.430
Martin’s iPhone: What

363
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:41.880
Richelle Direny: Will have sometimes a little consistency in my break where it gets really, really cold, but I remember there was a few years ago it they said that they had real snow flurries in Tallahassee, like that's how

364
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:49.590
Richelle Direny: Like that's as far as it I guess it got cold and it got to the which slowed

365
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:49.680
Up.

366
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.320
Leah Stover: When I was reading

367
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:55.110

368
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:06.990
Martin’s iPhone: Well, I've never seen the gecko. And I've never seen a palm tree. So I'm waiting to tell her son graduates and then I'm going to go at least visit for a while so

369
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:14.730
Richelle Direny: There you go. You will see jackals you'll Lana's. I mean, as long as here. Hmm, like nobody's business they own the place

370
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:28.500
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, there's another, there's another type I forget what they call it starts with the sea, but it's a lot of. There's a lot of Facebook invasive species down there. I mean, we have some here but not like four different sounds like steel heads.

371
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.680
Martin’s iPhone: wantagh's and polos and

372
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.190
Richelle Direny: No.

373
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:50.400
Richelle Direny: One is, like, especially if there's like a little canal or any kind of water like one off or whatever, I guess they out of the water and they just chill out and get some and these suckers are like camped out on the sidewalk and our baby alligators is what I call them.

374
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.260
Martin’s iPhone: That'd be crazy to see. I mean, I can't, I can't even fathom that. I mean, we had a guy here.

375
00:40:56.310 --> 00:41:05.910
Martin’s iPhone: That had some some alligators as pets and they got too big and got loose and ended up in the river and it is like it all the news stations, it was

376
00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:07.530
Martin’s iPhone: It was

377
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:11.520
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah.

378
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.280
Dr Jameson: That sounds good.

379
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.550
Dr Jameson: Sounds like a Florida story.

380
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.490
Richelle Direny: Yeah, we here, we have

381
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:28.350
Richelle Direny: Those that are baby one of them suckers get upon all running things a little dog running down the

382
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:29.640
Way.

383
00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:37.440
Richelle Direny: But, you know, it got cold day really cold. I guess it dropped delete below I think 50 degrees.

384
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:43.320
Richelle Direny: And they, they, so they fall off the trees that are not

385
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:49.770
Richelle Direny: Immediate hibernation, I think, is what they go into and then it warms up and then they wake up.

386
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.750
Richelle Direny: And have collected the whole of the car and when they warmed up. Well, you have all these life. You go on to the cart.

387
00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:02.520
Richelle Direny: They're big. They're huge. They aren't huge

388
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:04.230
Richelle Direny: Maybe in one of my session. I'll take a

389
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:10.950
Richelle Direny: Picture and then asked our share my screen to see how big these things aren't there like maybe I'll

390
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:27.810
Martin’s iPhone: Stay. A few years ago I was gonna go down south, and I didn't have much to my name at the time and I would had to camp out for a while and things in one of my biggest worries was, I would have to set up some kind of like fence or something around me, just to keep you know

391
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:34.050
Martin’s iPhone: Things out. I mean, even if they weren't in my area or whatever. I still in my head would have thought that so

392
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.530
Martin’s iPhone: It's going to be an experience will I go

393
00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.180
Dr Jameson: Are you coming down.

394
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.490
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah. One more year I'm waiting till our son graduates.

395
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:52.590
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, maybe year and a half or so yeah we're definitely going to be heading south. I don't know if we're going to go to Florida, per se. We're going to visit there for sure, but

396
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:55.770
Dr Jameson: Closer warmer.

397
00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.040

If

Alyse: And

433
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.240
Alyse: I had x rays done and

434
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:08.490
Alyse: They were able to tell me. So my my neck is completely out of line with the rest of my body like 15 years ago I got a bad car accident.

435
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:19.530
Alyse: And the with flash like they told me that in the time that they've been doing this they haven't seen somebody have this bad of a correction in their neck like the way my neck isn't the way it should be, why

436
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.120
Dr Jameson: They tell you that like just

437
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:21.480
Yeah.

438
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.040
Alyse: I have like early stages of

439
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:33.630
Alyse: Scoliosis because it it's a genetic scoliosis. The generic name so um

440
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.460
Dr Jameson: Well, don't let that

441
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:41.220
Dr Jameson: Make you to him, said I, oh yes, it's so bad. I had to wear a brace when I was in middle school scoliosis itself does not hurt.

442
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:49.890
Alyse: Yeah, I know. I'm looking in that, you know, doing like with Europeans public that will help me with my back and a lot of my life I had ignore

443
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.290
Dr Jameson: It so that it might get worse before it gets better.

444
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.150
Alyse: Yeah, I know I've experienced it.

445
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.680
Dr Jameson: Okay, sorry, but

446
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.220
Dr Jameson: But it is good to do it. I hope I'm glad you're doing that.

447
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:00.540
Alyse: Well, being

448
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:05.700
Dr Jameson: And then we'll come back to him. Sure. Brittany and I think you need medicine right

449
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.970
Brittney Mettke: Yes, I need to know for sure.

450
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:09.750
Brittney Mettke: Okay.

451
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.540
Dr Jameson: And is that pharmacy going to fill your medicine.

452
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.590
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, because I didn't argue with them. Yeah, they'll show

453
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:33.240
Brittney Mettke: Well, I have had an issue with them. I can go and visit them, but I honestly where he's going. Now, it might just be better for me to switch. But just because I'm leaving, I'm on Friday. I'll be back Monday I, I'd rather

454
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.560
Dr Jameson: Just leave it alone. Yeah.

455
00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:35.130
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, and

456
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:43.200
Brittney Mettke: Then, like any because you were doing it for the month now. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, it's not been an issue with me. Yeah, okay.

457
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.200
Dr Jameson: They were getting suspicious about all the early fills, I think.

458
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:47.940
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, the traveling

459
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:48.780
Dr Jameson: Because it like

460
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:52.590
Dr Jameson: You guys are a little bit, you know, outside the norm as far

461
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.020
Dr Jameson: As you know what I mean. And so I was like, No, no, there's

462
00:46:55.650 --> 00:47:10.860
Brittney Mettke: Only two, and he was always one picking it up and they were just like there was like an issue of just being super judgmental and yeah and at one point you know he he had enough and let it known so they have no issue with me so I can go and pick up my medicine.

463
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:11.520
Dr Jameson: Well, I had

464
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:22.380
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I had spent like 15 minutes like talking her off the cliff about because then when she got word, have you confirm that they like she's speaking in a conference, have you confirm that and

465
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.810
Dr Jameson: Actually, as a matter of fact that

466
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:29.100
Dr Jameson: This is going to be where I live. Wait a minute. You're in Florida. What, and then

467
00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:31.440
Brittney Mettke: I know

468
00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.590
Brittney Mettke: So I did that they're all

469
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.250
Dr Jameson: Like what do we do we meet weekly we do do we do

470
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:46.290
Dr Jameson: Clan. I went through the whole program. That's what we're doing. And she was finally like, all right, like she was talking to the other. What do you want to do telemedicine.

471
00:47:46.620 --> 00:48:00.360
Brittney Mettke: They literally wanted. They were just trying to find anything but like this CDs, where he goes to their director actually works with opiate patients and he's very so it's gonna be a lot easier. So like probably I'll switch just for us those pick it up. But for now, does he

472
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.100
Brittney Mettke: Care and hopefully there's no issue.

473
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.920
Dr Jameson: Oh you catch more flies with honey, as they say.

474
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:09.540
Brittney Mettke: I know I try it.

475
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.110
Dr Jameson: Right, I know you do. I know I'm just, I need just a general thing but it's

476
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:13.860
Brittney Mettke: Know your

477
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.270
Dr Jameson: Killer gets the better of you.

478
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.560
Brittney Mettke: Hard

479
00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.800
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, it's hard to not want to say something to stand up for yourself.

480
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.140
Dr Jameson: Especially if they're being and so I know, I know.

481
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:27.930
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, I get it. Totally. That's just one thing I've always learned is that you do like

482
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.580
Brittney Mettke: A nice and calm, you know,

483
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.800
Dr Jameson: This isn't. It's a shame that

484
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.770
Brittney Mettke: They have the power, you know,

485
00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:46.440
Brittney Mettke: It just, it just like crazy like power tripping and and I just, you know, I'm like, You should always assume innocence and give grace and they're not like that at all, but

486
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.580
Robert Bowlin: So how come I never see any flies around beehives

487
00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:54.750
Dr Jameson: That's a good question.

488
00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.860
Dr Jameson: He's being a smart. You know what, today I'm

489
00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.280
Dr Jameson: Your medicine earlier. Robert, because I

490
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:10.290
Dr Jameson: Had left myself on a note for last week, which I missed and then today. I saw what was supposed to send his medicine so i just i did it about

491
00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.060
Dr Jameson: Three o'clock.

492
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:12.390
Today,

493
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.810
Brittney Mettke: So you'll send mine tonight. Then, so I yeah

494
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:22.140
Brittney Mettke: And I don't know, it would it be me picking it up early. I don't think it. Well, I

495
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:22.980
Dr Jameson: Think so, because I

496
00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.460
Brittney Mettke: Didn't

497
00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:25.020
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, I don't think

498
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.450
I sent it on the 28th.

499
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.530
Dr Jameson: I don't know when they let you pick it up.

500
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:38.970
Brittney Mettke: Just want to make sure that I can get it by Friday. So I don't know if you have to make a note traveling

501
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.720
Well,

502
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:41.460
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

503
00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.130
Dr Jameson: Let me write that on that.

504
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:52.680
Brittney Mettke: Just for the week and it'll be fine. I'll work it out. Either way, gosh, this is the stuff that literally

505
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:58.890
Brittney Mettke: Makes me be, like, though. Want to just get off of it though. Honestly, I feel like I'm so like chained

506
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:02.280
Brittney Mettke: It's definitely better than heroin, obviously.

507
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:03.810
Well,

508
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:13.500
Dr Jameson: You know, I'm not gonna lie like having, you know, cutting dropping a quarter of a strip every couple days a week, so that you have a little bit

509
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:14.610
Yeah.

510
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:17.880
Dr Jameson: And then generally

511
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:18.540
Brittney Mettke: You know,

512
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.960
Dr Jameson: If you want to start tapering which see what happened. I mean, you can see what

513
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:27.120
Brittney Mettke: Else do it. Yeah, no, I definitely I'm some days I don't do take the full now.

514
00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.740
Dr Jameson: Make that most days and then. Okay, let's do that every day and then

515
00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.340
Dr Jameson: Start again.

516
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:40.770
Brittney Mettke: Do you feel like sometimes people like you could go like a little bit lower for a feud like and just leave it at that for a few days.

517
00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:47.190
Dr Jameson: Or just do just do like one day at a slightly, slightly, slightly just a teeny bit lower dose.

518
00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.070
Dr Jameson: Ideas for your body to barely notice it.

519
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:51.870
Brittney Mettke: Notice it at all. Yeah.

520
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.000
Dr Jameson: And then do your regular dose for two or

521
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.080
Dr Jameson: Three days and then do the

522
00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:56.700
Dr Jameson: Tiny slightly lower dose.

523
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.180
Dr Jameson: Again,

524
00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:05.520
Brittney Mettke: What I noticed is when I did lower. And then, but I didn't. And I thought I was OK. The next day, and even the next day. But then the third day, I felt, and I was

525
00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:07.860
Dr Jameson: Well that's, I think, not doing it multiple days.

526
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:09.810
Dr Jameson: Okay, might be better.

527
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:20.100
Dr Jameson: I mean, I will tell you I have several patients that I've kind of inherited recently who have been on it for a very long time and then very super, super gradually really gradually like

528
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.850
Dr Jameson: Yeah, very gradually so it's almost not noticeable face.

529
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:24.660
Brittney Mettke: Okay, cool.

530
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:38.730
Dr Jameson: Right, and then you just have to make sure you're super in touch with how you're doing. You know, when we tell you about these like the very first stage of relapse, where you just start thinking about, you know, you have to like really be

531
00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.140
Dr Jameson: Well, yeah, basically.

532
00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:48.240
Brittney Mettke: I would notice that I was a little bit more anxious than usual. And then I just feel okay yeah so I get. I get what you're saying, makes it

533
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:57.000
Dr Jameson: You just have to be really in touch and like it's not for everyone, like if you have to be someone who's like really

534
00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:08.220
Dr Jameson: You know, just did, and like, you know, dealing with adversity without, you know, even thinking about using a couple times and then, like, make sure you're really

535
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:14.880
Dr Jameson: Solid and just always keep in mind. You know what you might have to go back up or something's going on and you okay

536
00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:16.920
Dr Jameson: We can always backup and that's fine.

537
00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:20.010
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, it totally I totally get that. Yeah.

538
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.350
Robert Bowlin: What

539
00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:29.190
Robert Bowlin: When a last month when I had a problem with a medication. They wouldn't feel it because they said they had a pre author issue.

540
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:39.150
Robert Bowlin: They told me that the reason. Another reason that they're having issues is because I go every 20 I get a refill every 28 days.

541
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:49.260
Robert Bowlin: And that now they no longer allow you have to have a whole month's worth. I said, Well, once a month where she said 30 days. I said, What are you going to do in a month. That's 31 days.

542
00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:52.860
Dr Jameson: Well, the reason we've done 28 is because

543
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:59.640
Dr Jameson: Usually when you do 30 like that's going to end up on a Sunday every so often and then you're not

544
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.640
Robert Bowlin: I don't know, it's just usually it works better if we do it.

545
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.590
Dr Jameson: On the same day of the week, every week and then we have our visit the same to it's

546
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:08.670
Yeah.

547
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.040
Robert Bowlin: It makes sense to me.

548
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.550
Robert Bowlin: I'm just telling you what the lady at care stores told me that they forced my

549
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:25.050
Robert Bowlin: Pre op through last month because the reason. One of the reasons was because I was trying to refill before 30 days. I said, Well, we've been doing it every 28 days for

550
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.670
Robert Bowlin: You know,

551
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:28.740
Dr Jameson: every four weeks.

552
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:43.590
Robert Bowlin: Hasn't been a problem yet. And so she said, Well, if you could pass the message on it went and changed this year with our whatever I guess they did a bunch of changes where they were like Walgreens went out of that really changes. Yeah.

553
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:49.260

554
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:51.750
Robert Bowlin: Yeah, I was born in Arcadia

555
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:54.150
Dr Jameson: Well, I live here now. I'm not from here, but

556
00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:58.260
Brittney Mettke: Also, speaking of Florida no issue picking up the prescription

557
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.310
Brittney Mettke: Easy could have went anywhere.

558
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:03.450
Leah Stover: It's so funny.

559
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:06.660
Dr Jameson: How the regions are different. I don't know what that's about.

560
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.690
Brittney Mettke: I mean, I was like Jesus almost easier just come down here.

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:22.350
Dr Jameson: Can I just make

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:35.550
Michael Hudson: Jack yeah I gotta stand in for flash

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:39.120
Dr Jameson: And I know you need a refill.

572
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.780
Michael Hudson: How can I ask for tablet someone to go back to the tablets, if you don't mind.

573
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:43.200
Okay.

574
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.770
Dr Jameson: It's why just curious. I don't care about

575
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:56.010
Michael Hudson: Today, well my insurance. I didn't pay it last longer than I got a month, you're gonna have to pay out of pocket and you're extremely expensive on the film so

576
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:59.280
Dr Jameson: Make sure you're using the good Rx coupon to

577
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:09.090
Michael Hudson: Yeah, that's what I did doesn't use the coupon for the film is just not much else like pennies. So, okay, I kind of tablets takes it down to for the month like $70

578
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.320
Dr Jameson: That's okay.

579
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:16.350
Michael Hudson: Yeah, that's right. Research today. So it's my stupidity. Hopefully before the end of the month.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:20.280
Dr Jameson: Leah.

631
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:41.010
Leah Stover: Deserve test.

632
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.250
Leah Stover: Yeah, I, I didn't do that. I didn't do that.

633
00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:48.240
Leah Stover: Okay, I don't know what that is. I did not do it.

634
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:57.600
Leah Stover: Because before that wasn't even my thing before it was anything like what I'm learning. Yeah, I was here without it.

635
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:05.010
Leah Stover: So I'm not real sure but well I'll just, I'll just stay on for a few minutes after we're done.

636
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.080
Dr Jameson: Okay. Yeah. Okay, well,

637
00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:08.730

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:14.940
Dr Jameson: Alright, well it sounds like you're getting getting closer to your delivery.

639
00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:16.950
Dr Jameson: Package.

640
00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:19.830
Dr Jameson: It'll be

641
00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:23.610
Dr Jameson: Good to have you done any of the childbirth classes or anything.

642
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:29.730
Leah Stover: God, I should have. I should have walked all dude.

643
00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.310
Dr Jameson: Wow.

644
00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:33.570
Leah Stover: I don't get

645
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:37.770
Dr Jameson: Too late to do it. Maybe you could find out like a YouTube video or something.

646
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Leah Stover: Well, Mom. Yeah, my breathing thing, I think,

647
00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:45.540
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I think that

648
00:59:45.960 --> 01:00:00.540
Dr Jameson: Just knowing a little bit of what to expect. So it's not all completely foreign and because you're going to be in pain, and then you're scared and like it just I think having a little bit of preparation of what to expect. It might help make it less

649
01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.320
Brittney Mettke: Oh, this is her first me

650
01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:05.670
Brittney Mettke: Yeah. Oh.

651
01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:07.440
Brittney Mettke: Hi Miss black

652
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:12.030
Richelle Direny: light headed, like you're

653
01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:13.650
Richelle Direny: Getting lightheaded in the process.

654
01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.070
Brittney Mettke: For C section. So I never got to do any of that.

655
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.500
Dr Jameson: I didn't either.

656
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.720
Leah Stover: Like

657
01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:32.280
Leah Stover: I've never felt one guy will be pregnant stuff is something I've never fail. That's how I know it's

658
01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:36.810
You know, to

659
01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:45.930
Leah Stover: Three and night. There were kind of worried about it and I was like, wow.

660
01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.240
Alyse: We're up to 40 these these so it's that's not nothing

661
01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:03.060
Alyse: You know if they offer if they offer to give you a mirror. Some hospitals will offer to give you a mirror so you can actually see because like with my first son.

662
01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:09.600
Alyse: I had no idea. Yeah, like, listen, you know, they saying bear down like if you are like pooping. Sorry guys, but

663
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:10.920
Alyse: But it's like, you know,

664
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:24.900
Alyse: It. That's so foreign to you when you're having your first baby. You have no idea. Even with on last class. They can prepare you for that feeling so they offer you know for a mirror so you can actually see what was going on. You can have a

665
01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.090
Alyse: Better understanding of that push

666
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:31.800
Alyse: You know, and was it. It's beautiful to watch. At least it was for me. My son was

667
01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.580
Alyse: So if they, you know,

668
01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:42.120
Alyse: Just be prepared to just ask them, you know, like, Hey, do you guys do offer a mirror or something, you know,

669
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and I better instead of

670
01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:47.820
Leah Stover: Saying what I'm doing.

671
01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:54.210
Dr Jameson: Is I'm having you crouch or like anyway they not just keep it. Anyway, hopefully they'll be

672
01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.690
Leah Stover: open minded. Yeah, easy all

673
01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:01.350
Dr Jameson: Right. Did I get to

674
01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:03.720
Dr Jameson: Delivery. Yeah.

675
01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:15.720
Richelle Direny: Yeah, baby. I'm it it's it's in the moment. You don't think it's the greatest experience, but after that wins that little baby full kind of go, cuz

676
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:25.080
Richelle Direny: I thought about a lot, but you know once you see that little bundle of joy. If there's nothing better than that.

677
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:26.460
Leah Stover: And then

678
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:33.810
Dr Jameson: It. Yeah. And then as far as sometimes people, you know, worry about the baby having withdrawal symptoms.

679
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:40.290
Dr Jameson: Which can happen. But if you are able to breastfeed the likelihood is is

680
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:49.680
Dr Jameson: Much better than I mean, the chances of that are much smaller. If you're able to breastfeed, because then the baby still get some overtime.

681
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.150
Leah Stover: Oh, okay.

682
01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:51.570
Leah Stover: Yeah.

683
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.970
Dr Jameson: I mean, it's always good to breastfeed anyway. But in this case, it's like extra helpful.

684
01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:03.930
Leah Stover: Yeah, I was like, Oh, I'm I think about that. I forgot about that. Yeah, I'm not good.

685
01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:05.190
Yeah.

686
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:09.390
Dr Jameson: It's good for all the antibodies and all the rest of it too, but

687
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:23.970
Robert Bowlin: They want us to change that because my wife was on 70 tax when she was pregnant. Yeah. And they specifically told her like they didn't want her to do it. Of course that was used nine now so nine years ago and

688
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:24.870
Dr Jameson: I think

689
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:36.180
Brittney Mettke: It's so different from nine years from my nine year old to when I just had my he's almost three like now I'm like, and I was on Zoloft, and like they're small, even with that. And they're like, Nurse. Nurse.

690
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:42.090
Brittney Mettke: You know, and he was breastfed he was almost to it. Definitely. They always push it now.

691
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.800
Brittney Mettke: It's much better if it's

692
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:44.310
Leah Stover: If

693
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.120
Dr Jameson: It's a better way for them to gradually wean off really i mean they'll

694
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.290
Brittney Mettke: Still get a little bit of whatever is in your system. Yeah.

695
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.220
Brittney Mettke: It just, the better. I think for bonding and everything.

696
01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:57.270
I definitely

697
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:00.240
Dr Jameson: Cheaper than

698
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:10.860
Brittney Mettke: I think it's easier. I only had one that was on. I think the nerve breastfeeding was easier like sleeping at night and everything than the one that I had that was formula fed

699
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.980
Leah Stover: Yeah, it's natural. It's a natural version.

700
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.470
Dr Jameson: Preheated it's

701
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:21.090
Brittney Mettke: It's free. You don't say get up and make bottle.

702
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.080
Dr Jameson: Sort of left

703
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.640
Dr Jameson: It does leave you being the only one who can

704
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:29.550
Robert Bowlin: You handle with your time.

705
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.620
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Downside

706
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:32.400
Martin’s iPhone: Fast food.

707
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:34.650
Dr Jameson: All right.

708
01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:37.200
Dr Jameson: All right.

709
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.000
Richelle Direny: Everybody checked in.

710
01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.110
Dr Jameson: I believe so.

711
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.490
Leah Stover: Okay, now let's talk to everybody. I'm going to use the bathroom.

712
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.300
Leah Stover: As like Eric to jack and now

713
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:55.320
This

714
01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.570
Leah Stover: Other right back.

715
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.320
Okay.

716
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:00.570
Dr Jameson: I think that happened last week.

717
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:02.190
Dr Jameson: For thing.

718
01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.650
Richelle Direny: Oh, okay. So we'll get started. I have a little

719
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:19.230
Dr Jameson: Martin house asleep going about any better.

720
01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:25.830
Martin’s iPhone: I'm getting to sleep. I'm kinda it's kind of nice to have that

721
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:31.860
Martin’s iPhone: The dreams are just still the same. I mean, I know I'm gonna have to

722
01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:34.620
Martin’s iPhone: Just keep going, counseling and

723
01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:35.910
Martin’s iPhone: You know,

724
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.130
Martin’s iPhone: I had a sleep study on the fifth

725
01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.300
Dr Jameson: Oh good, and they

726
01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:43.560
Martin’s iPhone: Were supposed to do it before that, but the insurance did pre authorize it so at least

727
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:52.350
Dr Jameson: shocker. And then there's that em, Dr. Yeah. Which is good for

728
01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.190
Richelle Direny: PTSD type sometimes that helps to

729
01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.200
Martin’s iPhone: End our success.

730
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.450
Dr Jameson: So it's a

731
01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.790
Dr Jameson: Well, I mean, it's just plain and Michelle because you

732
01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:04.200
Dr Jameson: Probably can explain it better than I can.

733
01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.980
Richelle Direny: I can. I know it's something about rapid eye.

734
01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:10.980
Brittney Mettke: Movement rapid disorientation.

735
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:16.020
Brittney Mettke: Yeah. And you sit there and like how they move their fingers and everything I did that.

736
01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:20.310
Brittney Mettke: For PTSD or yeah for a cup of for almost a year.

737
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.030
Dr Jameson: But I do think

738
01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:24.270
Martin’s iPhone: I do want to measure it. Hence,

739
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:29.010
Brittney Mettke: It can be really intense but I definitely feel it helps. I was in like a long term treatment.

740
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:39.300
Brittney Mettke: And I do definitely feel like it helps, but you just have to make sure that I doing it regularly or with someone say, because sometimes it felt like he got a little bit worse. And then they got before it got better. I

741
01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:41.460
Dr Jameson: Mean it's not like you show up and they just wham, I'll do

742
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.710
Dr Jameson: A lot of preparation. Yeah.

743
01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.790
Brittney Mettke: A lot of its intense for sure but I definitely feel like it helps

744
01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:53.730
Martin’s iPhone: I think that's what I'm doing. I can't remember off the list on the paper, but it said there was a particular test, they were doing.

745
01:06:54.990 --> 01:07:04.920
Dr Jameson: Sleep studies, probably not. This is a type of counseling that's meant for the way it was explained to me, which, in layman's terms because I don't they

746
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:15.930
Dr Jameson: Right now memories are mixed in with emotions and feelings. Right. And so you think of it, and it makes you feel a lot of things. So what they're doing is it's a way of

747
01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:31.290
Dr Jameson: Basically re cataloging, so instead of the memories being stored along with them with the emotion, they get separated into two different parts of your brain. So you can still remember things but they they don't trigger as much of the

748
01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.120
Martin’s iPhone: Like

749
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:42.420
Dr Jameson: emotional response anymore over time. And for some reason, it had they move your eyes in a certain sequence as you're thinking about

750
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:53.880
Dr Jameson: Thing one or whatever thing, whatever. And then I that part. I don't know too much about, but that seems to kind of help your brain like beef. Beef stock store things in a different way.

751
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:55.920
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I was gonna say that the

752
01:07:57.150 --> 01:08:00.960
Martin’s iPhone: Severity of what I mean every once in a while, have this

753
01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:05.160
Martin’s iPhone: The last dream. Well, not the last one, but a couple games ago

754
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:12.450
Martin’s iPhone: And it's weird because I can have the Dream Within it seems like meant a minute or two have fallen asleep.

755
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:28.470
Martin’s iPhone: I want to say dream, but a lot of them are basically nightmares I do recall having one country about two weeks ago, but the last major one. And the reason why I'm concerned is because in my dream I was fighting some guy.

756
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:38.490
Martin’s iPhone: I ended up getting behind him and I started to choke him and I was trying to break his neck, and I'm sorry I have to scrap it, but this is what I'm going through

757
01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:52.860
Martin’s iPhone: I had a dream that I woke up and that I was doing that to my spouse and I got really upset and I stopped, but I couldn't get off of her

758
01:08:54.030 --> 01:09:06.600
Martin’s iPhone: And within maybe 20 seconds after that I woke up and she was fine, but I wasn't okay so I mean I'm starting to get concerned, you know, I got to deal with this.

759
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:14.970
Dr Jameson: Well, I'm glad you're going to the sleep study because there may be some sort of like sleep cycle disorder and they may be able to help that with that.

760
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:23.220
Martin’s iPhone: I went to college for a year and in that I took psychology for a semester. And I remember them talking about REM sleep in.

761
01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:34.830
Martin’s iPhone: After 90 minutes or so, sleep, it seems like that's and that's your dream when you started reading. I guess I don't understand why I'm just have it as Susan. Right. So there's something funny there. Yeah.

762
01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:43.080
Dr Jameson: I had an elderly couple one time when I was back in primary care and something like that it happened, her husband, like in the middle of the night.

763
01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:56.760
Dr Jameson: Mean, she was this frail old lady with like rheumatoid arthritis. Like you could break her if you knew at or two, and he did something like that in his sleep. Same thing. And I'm like, he literally could have broken her neck. Luckily he did

764
01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:57.900
Martin’s iPhone: You remember

765
01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:06.930
Dr Jameson: We were like, I think we talked about them sleeping in different rooms until it got sorted out and like I mean it was. Yeah. It was scary.

766
01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:10.050
Martin’s iPhone: I got up and I slept on the recliner. The rest of the night.

767
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:20.460
Martin’s iPhone: My girlfriend didn't handle. Do I thought it was gonna, I think I just kind of need to keep that to myself next time that happens. Yeah. Um, yeah, it's just

768
01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:25.320
Dr Jameson: Oh yeah, well, I'm sorry. It's horrifying to even

769
01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:36.930
Dr Jameson: Have a thought of that. And then, yeah, yeah. And you're seem like such a gentle like you're like, I can't even really imagine you fighting

770
01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:38.970
Martin’s iPhone: Almost

771
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:45.600
Martin’s iPhone: Say 50% of the dreams I have and I never served in the military. I mean, I've done a lot of things, but

772
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:54.360
Martin’s iPhone: What a lot of the dreams are me being some kind of war or some kind of a situation where I have to fight people

773
01:10:57.510 --> 01:11:04.020
Martin’s iPhone: Some of them are weird. You know that there's a misconception that when you fall in your sleep that when you hit the ground you wake up.

774
01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:11.310
Martin’s iPhone: I feel the pain of hitting the ground in my sleep. It's not quite as severe as what you know obviously what it would be if

775
01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:13.380
Dr Jameson: You're not actually falling, are you

776
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:14.640
Martin’s iPhone: In my dream.

777
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.890
Dr Jameson: And you're doing but you're not sleepwalking, and then

778
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.730
Martin’s iPhone: I don't think I am. But there's that's another thing when I was younger.

779
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:32.670
Martin’s iPhone: I remember one of the dreams dream that somebody was that I had me and my friend were playing with the dryer and I got him to my room is my brother, I think it was

780
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:49.770
Martin’s iPhone: And he he got stuck in the dryer was tumbling around in it and I literally woke up while what I did. I wasn't awake. I was sleeping stone. But I came downstairs and my dad said I was crying. Let him outside now is probably like 14 at the time.

781
01:11:50.820 --> 01:12:04.230
Martin’s iPhone: Let him upside and in was trying to show them the dryer that he was in and you know there was no dryer. Another time, I ended up on a dresser and for some reason I was climbing to get peanut butter.

782
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:06.690
Martin’s iPhone: Now, who's on your dresser.

783
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.280
Dr Jameson: Huh. Wow.

784
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.560
Martin’s iPhone: So, but, I mean, I don't think I

785
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:15.510
Martin’s iPhone: Really don't know but i don't think i've slept since for a long time.

786
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:27.330
Dr Jameson: Well, this will be really helpful for that, you know, you make sure you tell them about all this. When you're going for the sleep study so they can know what to watch for target and he recommended recommendations for therapy.

787
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:42.750
Dr Jameson: But I still think, you know, people talk about analyzing dreams like it can be a matter for for you feeling like you're in a battle of some other kind, even an emotional one, you know, sometimes things are translated into funny way, your dreams. Anyway, so

788
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:49.800
Dr Jameson: I still think working with a therapist and continuing to process through that stuff is going to be worthwhile to. Yeah.

789
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.990
Martin’s iPhone: Sorry, I got dropped off the subject.

790
01:12:53.820 --> 01:13:04.590
Richelle Direny: I think I do actually believe that dreams do have meaning it's just a matter of exactly how the dreams that you're having

791
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:12.930
Richelle Direny: Oftentimes there's a correlation between like the people that are in the dream and what you're doing, there's a correlation

792
01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:18.840
Richelle Direny: There's a saying that Dreams don't walk straight, meaning that the dream. You're having

793
01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:27.120
Richelle Direny: doesn't exactly mean like you see how you say you're choking your girlfriend. It doesn't mean that you are. It's but there's there's a correlation between

794
01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:36.300
Richelle Direny: The individual being your girlfriend is somebody close to you and the whole war thing, there's a there's a dream is to have meaning and I truly believe that.

795
01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:49.560
Richelle Direny: I think throughout my life I, you know, I've had dreams in a really weird. And there's a particular team that happening that later on. I found out what the tree was really meant and it actually was true.

796
01:13:51.270 --> 01:14:02.160
Martin’s iPhone: Read part of one. So it's a real there's a book out that came out in the 90s. I read part of it was about, you know, that what what your dreams mean and things and

797
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.160
Martin’s iPhone: I know there's more to it than yeah

798
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:14.490
Richelle Direny: There's there's various is dreams do have a meaning, especially when they are repetitive and the content in somewhat the same

799
01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:26.550
Richelle Direny: There is a meaning behind it, you're fighting with something like in like I know when I used to get really stressed, I would have a particular dream, and then later on.

800
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:31.020
Richelle Direny: Because I don't dream often and later on I realized what the dream meant and it

801
01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:45.660
Richelle Direny: Found to be true, but again if yours couldn't be committed to other things. So I'm not saying with documents and said, you know, speaking with a therapist. Also, you know, doing your sleep study is definitely a route to go but I truly believe that.

802
01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:56.280
Richelle Direny: So sometimes what you're going through throughout the day. Somehow kind of goes right back into our if you're watching a particular I

803
01:14:56.730 --> 01:15:04.440
Richelle Direny: Mean, another thing when you're watching a particular movie or a series of movies somehow kind of crawl right into your dream, all of a sudden you're having this crazy dream.

804
01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:05.640
Martin’s iPhone: And it's really good.

805
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.100
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I'll wake up and and

806
01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:17.040
Martin’s iPhone: My girlfriend beyond her phone next to me and I'll say how long always asleep and to say, I don't know, but like probably only a couple of minutes.

807
01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:28.710
Martin’s iPhone: You know, it's, it's weird. It's, you know, I don't fall asleep during the day and daydream, obviously. I mean, I take naps, or I want to take a nap a lot but

808
01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.950
Martin’s iPhone: When I take a nap. I mean, I have them.

809
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:44.340
Martin’s iPhone: There's a lot of dreams where I'm incarcerated and either trying to like smuggle drugs in or trying to get or I'm not trying to get out. But I'm with a group of people that are

810
01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:52.980
Martin’s iPhone: Trying to get out and I'm kind of like stuck with them. And I actually one dream I had this is weird. I mean, it's their dreams are weird but

811
01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:07.770
Martin’s iPhone: I was in like a giant. I don't think I can describe is like a play police would be like plastic balls somehow that was the fenced in area around the jail. I was in, and I had to climb through like that.

812
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.540
Yes.

813
01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.140
Robert Bowlin: All part of the simulation.

814
01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.770
Martin’s iPhone: My neck, make sure I'm not

815
01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.030
Martin’s iPhone: Connected in any work.

816
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:22.170
Richelle Direny: So yeah, so

817
01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:26.130
Richelle Direny: I'm just going to read. I know I like to

818
01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:37.260
Richelle Direny: Read different things. I'm like, something that I've listened to. And I thought, oh, this will be a great discussion for our group, and I know we have a shorter time. That's okay.

819
01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:48.780
Richelle Direny: Um, I'm going to read a little statement, which I thought was pretty interesting. And it all relates back to if you notice, like it within my group, it's always kind of discussing

820
01:16:49.650 --> 01:17:08.760
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, things that you appreciate, you know, be mindful living in the moment and just kind of thinking about some of the things that you still battle with, whether it be anger, whatever it is that you still battle with because oftentimes the things that you battle with

821
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:20.580
Richelle Direny: Without realizing it, we feed it, and with feeding it if someone keeps us in bondage in ourselves within ourselves.

822
01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:29.640
Richelle Direny: Um, so I like to just talk about, like, just being aware of our actions or behaviors or just even how our. I'm sorry.

823
01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:45.120
Richelle Direny: Being aware of your thoughts and how those thoughts gets translated actions in our behaviors and our emotions and what have you. So I'm going to read this statement. And I just want you to just consider and think about

824
01:17:46.680 --> 01:18:01.050
Richelle Direny: What part of this are you feeding currently in your day to day life. So it says a wise man was talking to a boy and said, there are tools always fighting inside of

825
01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:19.620
Richelle Direny: One is filled with anger, hate jealousy shame and lies the other wolf is will filled with love, joy, truth and peace. This battle rages inside all of men.

826
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:32.250
Richelle Direny: The boy thought for a moment and ask, well, which will flow in the old man answered the one that you see. So I want you to just think about

827
01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:48.600
Richelle Direny: What, which one are you when you think about your day to day lives. The things that you're encountering especially your stressors or whatever that may be. What will keep your feet or are you aware of which one

828
01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:57.540
Richelle Direny: You're feeding or are you unaware. So that's kind of the question, when you just think about it for a second and ask you

829
01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.020
Richelle Direny: What are you feeling

830
01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:05.790
Richelle Direny: And the one that you're feeding is the one that translates into the

831
01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:08.100
Martin’s iPhone: Great on a day to day basis.

832
01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:12.930
Richelle Direny: So I'm going to have Brittany want to go ahead and share

833
01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:37.260
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, um, I actually, I heard this a few times told in different ways. But I, I feel like I always and I always try to operate from a part of the positive perspective and a lot of things I tried to be solution oriented and not a right away. I'm just because

834
01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:54.960
Brittney Mettke: I said, I've just learned. It's the only way to get through things so like I don't just sit there and like dwell on you know when shitty things happen. I always just try to be like, Okay, this is what I, you know, this is what it is and what can I do about it right now.

835
01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:01.080
Brittney Mettke: And that's how you know I haven't always been that way. That's definitely how I operate now.

836
01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.330
Brittney Mettke: So I don't feel I don't feed the wrong wolf.

837
01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:11.610
Fleeting

838
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:13.950
Richelle Direny: Moment.

839
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:18.030
Richelle Direny: There were always presented with two things in

840
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.560
Brittney Mettke: Ways. Yeah.

841
01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:23.640
Richelle Direny: Well, you have you saying that you think about in the moment. Okay, what can I

842
01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:24.960
Brittney Mettke: Write

843
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:34.320
Brittney Mettke: Like I'm usually just like okay this is this is whole oh this is not ideal. I mean even pretty recently I've had, you know, a sick.

844
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:39.630
Brittney Mettke: Last week I wasn't last week, I thought I was going

845
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:48.330
Brittney Mettke: I have seven felony convictions and they changed the law in Ohio where they're letting people get expired, getting them expunged. If they were lower level felonies.

846
01:20:48.630 --> 01:20:56.340
Brittney Mettke: And I got a lawyer and I was all helpful and then I found out there were only I'm doing it. If they're up to five and right away.

847
01:20:56.730 --> 01:21:04.200
Brittney Mettke: I got really upset because they you know just through my life like the last 10 years, even though I'm better, it's just always a reminder and

848
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:16.950
Brittney Mettke: And you know, I wanted to get feeling discouraged and, you know, like, but then right away. I just kind of popped out and like okay well what can I get out of this. What can I do, you know,

849
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:30.840
Brittney Mettke: And instead of, I guess, just like throwing myself a pity party I i do i think i do pretty well snapping myself out of those situations today, not all that there's definitely a

850
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.500
Moment.

851
01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:39.900
Brittney Mettke: Okay, thank you so much. Thank you, Robert. You want to go ahead and share

852
01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.370
Richelle Direny: Robert, if you're talking, you're on mute.

853
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:59.640
Robert Bowlin: Sorry, can you hear me now. Yes. All right. First one asked her, Brittany, a question. When did they pass a law because I have a long

854
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.960
Brittney Mettke: Term felony and I really

855
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.830
Robert Bowlin: Liked the root of it.

856
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:07.890
Brittney Mettke: October of 2019 so pretty recently.

857
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:10.410
Robert Bowlin: Said you said representation charge

858
01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:14.040
Brittney Mettke: Yeah, if it's just one possession charge, they're knocking those out.

859
01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.900
Robert Bowlin: Yeah, they weren't money before

860
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:17.250
Robert Bowlin: That's good to know.

861
01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:31.170
Robert Bowlin: Me. Most of the time I tried to feed the good wolf. But sometimes the bad wolf sneaks in and steals the food from the good wolf. So, I mean, I always try to

862
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:41.490
Robert Bowlin: I try to think positive to and I mean there's gonna be bad shit that happens all the time. But you can either be part of the problem or part of the solution.

863
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:59.280
Robert Bowlin: And I tried to try to be the solution because if I get caught up in being part of the problem, then nothing gets better. Just seems to get worse. So, I mean, I try to find a silver lining and everything, it's not always easy, and I can't say that I always find it.

864
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:05.010
Robert Bowlin: Sometimes I'll let that bad wolf get fed. Occasionally, you know, it's just

865
01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:13.050
Robert Bowlin: My nature, I guess, but I try to be quick about catching myself and redirect and myself and

866
01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:21.810
Robert Bowlin: You know, I mean if I snapped at my wife or my son, whatever, just because I was in a bad mood from work and I'm bringing work home then. Yeah.

867
01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:33.900
Robert Bowlin: I gotta be the big guy and go to apologize and tell him I was wrong and such doing that because I had King baby syndrome where I think the whole world should be delivered to me on a silver platter.

868
01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:35.790
Robert Bowlin: But

869
01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:37.890
Robert Bowlin: You know, it's just

870
01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:40.530
Robert Bowlin: It's not how life works so

871
01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:43.680
Dr Jameson: Just be very disappointed.

872
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.940
Dr Jameson: Oh,

873
01:23:48.330 --> 01:23:50.670
Richelle Direny: My God says, you know, we both we we

874
01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:58.350
Richelle Direny: All it says all men, we have it raging on the inside. And I think instinctively. We are all by nature are very impulsive.

875
01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:00.030
Richelle Direny: Something happen.

876
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:12.420
Richelle Direny: impulsively by nature will kind of go to that wolf that you are going to feed it, but that's automatically where you go to. So you have to be kind of aware and say okay

877
01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:21.720
Richelle Direny: You know what, let me kind of find a way to calm down and let me think of a different way of how to handle it. Because like you said, if you go the impulsive route.

878
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:29.550
Richelle Direny: You end up becoming part of the problem. And now it's just like the whole thing is just beyond your control at that point.

879
01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:42.420
Richelle Direny: So I think it's just everything is just kind of being aware being like okay let me find a way to calm down and let me not act upon my impulses because naturally are all very impulsive, the

880
01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.430
Richelle Direny: Person who says that they're not impulsive have some denial going on there. Maybe don't

881
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:51.630
Richelle Direny: Like, or what impulsive is

882
01:24:52.170 --> 01:25:03.750
Richelle Direny: Right but naturally. We're all just impulsive and we were prone to want to feed that will anchor of self pity or whatever it is we

883
01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:05.070
Richelle Direny: naturally want to do it, but

884
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:12.930
Richelle Direny: We just have to think, Okay, you know what, let me like the one of the things like I teach my daughter. Now we have to practice the art of ignoring

885
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:26.280
Richelle Direny: Because when we ignore. It's not that it's just like, Oh, you just want no I'm ignoring you. Because I'm calling myself down right now. That's what I'm doing. That's really truly what I'm doing. Because if I really act of how I'm thinking

886
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:28.650
Richelle Direny: It's not gonna be good for both of us. Yeah.

887
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:36.720
Richelle Direny: And that's just kind of out you read a wreck yourself to feel that good wolf to calm down. Think about it, and then move on.

888
01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:50.340
Robert Bowlin: I mean, there's even done. I have to just remove myself completely and just leave the whole situation just till I can get my head straight and then come back and you know and then try to deal with it then. And sometimes that's

889
01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:54.330
Robert Bowlin: Not the right thing to do. And the other person's eyes but

890
01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:04.170
Robert Bowlin: And I try to explain that afterwards that you know if it may have made you upset at first, but believe me if I would have stayed in this would have continued and

891
01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.430
Robert Bowlin: They were much worse than what they are now. So wouldn't

892
01:26:08.610 --> 01:26:11.520
Richelle Direny: Open it's, you know, people can respect it or they don't. But

893
01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.030
Robert Bowlin: Yeah.

894
01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:13.740
Richelle Direny: I'm saving you from me.

895
01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:16.020
Robert Bowlin: Exactly.

896
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:20.220
Richelle Direny: Robert

897
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:21.150
Robert Bowlin: Yeah, no problem.

898
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:23.970
Richelle Direny: Martin, could you go ahead and share

899
01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:32.010
Martin’s iPhone: I know I hit my head three or four times this week. And every time I did. I got mad.

900
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:34.200
The one

901
01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:41.160
Martin’s iPhone: I got shocked. I was up in a buddy of mine, put in some GMC either

902
01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:47.190
Martin’s iPhone: They interrupt the circuit if you get like water, so you don't get electrocuted and

903
01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:56.400
Martin’s iPhone: The light switches were on a separate breaker and you know I just was kind of hurry in and I pulled one out and I grabbed both sides bit

904
01:26:56.850 --> 01:27:15.000
Martin’s iPhone: And it just so happens that he had left the cupboard door open in a came up and I hit it and I have like an on and off switches and it seemed like that just triggered it. And I just got mad and he said, You Are you okay, Miss, uh, yeah. But in my head. I was cussing and he was upset.

905
01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:21.000
Martin’s iPhone: It's hard for me not to feed my dogs on the wolves.

906
01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.860
Martin’s iPhone: I guess they all need attention but you gotta

907
01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.330
Martin’s iPhone: Sometimes I'm gullible and sometimes I'm

908
01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:34.470
Martin’s iPhone: No, I don't know how to explain it just seems like

909
01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:38.490
Martin’s iPhone: It's hard for me not to get rid of some of them animals.

910
01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:41.010
Martin’s iPhone: It's

911
01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:46.620
Martin’s iPhone: I feed anger a lot and having the knowledge on in an off switch.

912
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:52.560
Martin’s iPhone: Sometimes, you know, I take it on. Oh, my girlfriend. All y'all here for something and

913
01:27:53.580 --> 01:28:00.480
Martin’s iPhone: You know, I'll apologize to her takes good 510 minutes for me to come down from that anger.

914
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.380
Martin’s iPhone: I lost the good job. That way you know the guy.

915
01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:10.560
Martin’s iPhone: was upset because I messed up a gutter and I mean it's an easy fix. But he had been

916
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:24.120
Martin’s iPhone: He had had a lot of problems with the last three or four jobs and they were bearing down on him and instead of keeping my mouth shut. I blamed him for everything I could, and walked away from the job and that really hurt me.

917
01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:26.580
Martin’s iPhone: My biggest

918
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:31.740
Martin’s iPhone: Dangerous wolf is one that I'm dealing with and

919
01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:36.480
Martin’s iPhone: Like to just keep learning on how to

920
01:28:38.130 --> 01:28:48.030
Martin’s iPhone: How to relax and how to let things go. My dad gave me the biggest, best advice I've ever heard. Which was if Mark is not right. Nothing is right and

921
01:28:49.020 --> 01:29:03.660
Martin’s iPhone: That's true. You know, it's what I'm trying to stay sober because I definitely am more goal, but when I'm hi I'm I let my guard down, it's not good for me it's not good for anybody around me and I start to do bad things, you know,

922
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:16.710
Martin’s iPhone: And that shows takes a lot of time to repair the past, especially as much as I've accumulated. I still had finds that I'm dealing with from back when I was 19 it's crazy.

923
01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:27.810
Martin’s iPhone: I will say, though, in the last two years that my fines have, you know, I've been able to I've been more sobering less two years and I have my entire life.

924
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:49.800
Martin’s iPhone: You got to stay sober and the times that I relapsed I gave you know I gave into the drugs and I would spend, spend, spend, and I would rob cheat, lie, steal, whatever I needed to get him. I turned into a totally different person not proud of that. And that's not who I want to be.

925
01:29:52.530 --> 01:30:00.990
Martin’s iPhone: And far about four months ago and pretty sure that my son and his buddy. A friend of mine. Matter of fact,

926
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.610
Martin’s iPhone: They store some stuff out of my garage and they set the fire to

927
01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:09.090
Martin’s iPhone: Cover up with the stove and, you know,

928
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:15.930
Martin’s iPhone: I was. Yeah, it was messed up while all that happened. I couldn't piece anything together.

929
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:26.190
Martin’s iPhone: And now that I teach it all together. I kind of hinted to my son that I was looking for some tools and if he knew, and boy, the ladder.

930
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:36.840
Martin’s iPhone: That I needed it, you know, stuff because I never found the remnants of is in the fire, and I was heading to my son's house to get some weed when that happened,

931
01:30:38.130 --> 01:30:45.630
Martin’s iPhone: I just don't have happened is I came back and I think what happened was the guy was in my garage and he was talking to my son.

932
01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:53.490
Martin’s iPhone: To try to get me back out house. My son's Rodman, are you, are you on your way yet or young way yet.

933
01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:57.420
Martin’s iPhone: I got so mad that I wanted to

934
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:07.800
Martin’s iPhone: You know, I'm not proud of it. But I messaged my son and I was going to set him up to come see me and I was just going to dump the living crap out of him.

935
01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:11.760
Martin’s iPhone: And I, I'm not proud of that.

936
01:31:13.410 --> 01:31:14.730
Dr Jameson: Well, you didn't do it though.

937
01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:15.750
No, I didn't.

938
01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:17.730
Dr Jameson: Maybe that's

939
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:20.370
Dr Jameson: Writing dreams you have

940
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:25.350
Richelle Direny: No, it seems like I'm like, Okay, I'm not a dream interpreter, but

941
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.850
Richelle Direny: It sounds like your dreams are

942
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:38.220
Richelle Direny: If you're not only just fighting with yourself, but you're fighting with so many different people and maybe the core on your side.

943
01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:46.380
Richelle Direny: You have so much anger towards maybe yourself into so many people around you and that's where your dreams are coming from.

944
01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:56.850
Dr Jameson: Or you have to suppress the fight in real life. Thankfully, you are able to, but then the anger has nowhere to go. Yes.

945
01:31:57.570 --> 01:31:57.900
Martin’s iPhone: Take a

946
01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:58.650
Boxing.

947
01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:01.830
Martin’s iPhone: Well I you know I

948
01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:05.610
Martin’s iPhone: Actually saw you said that because I keep walking past

949
01:32:06.690 --> 01:32:19.350
Martin’s iPhone: And nevertheless box. And again, you know, punching bag it store and I'm almost ready to buy it because I get that mad but you know i think that's might not be a good thing for me to take my anger and any physical way.

950
01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.070
Martin’s iPhone: Other than, you know, biking or, you know,

951
01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:36.000
Dr Jameson: Then yeah, gaining through the with help from my cows are gaining your voice to address things when they happen with words. And, you know, and

952
01:32:36.570 --> 01:32:39.480
Richelle Direny: That's, that's, that's, I'm telling you, dreams, to have a lot in there.

953
01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:40.860
Dr Jameson: It.

954
01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:41.820
Richelle Direny: Sounds like the

955
01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:51.000
Richelle Direny: Monster in your dream or whatever you become in that dream is the anger. It's the anger. The, the, the

956
01:32:51.720 --> 01:33:06.900
Richelle Direny: The amount of anger. It seems like all of your anger or just piled up on top of one another and they're just getting bigger and bigger. So maybe that's what your dream is telling you so much anger locked up inside of you, they're just kind of, you need to work through letting it go

957
01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:08.790
Martin’s iPhone: And manage myself for

958
01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:13.410
Martin’s iPhone: For for the biggest part because if I hadn't been trying to chase a high

959
01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:16.680
Martin’s iPhone: There's so many things that I would have avoided.

960
01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:18.960
Martin’s iPhone: Accident

961
01:33:20.130 --> 01:33:22.200
Martin’s iPhone: Injuries and fights.

962
01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:23.700
Richelle Direny: You

963
01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:26.280
Richelle Direny: Use the drugs to

964
01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:26.760
Richelle Direny: Help

965
01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:36.330
Richelle Direny: To suppress them of that anger and you use the truck, so to say, you know, if you never chased the high, this would not happen, but you are chasing it because of

966
01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:46.560
Richelle Direny: All of the different things that was going on in your life and how were your inability to cope with all the different things that was going on, but again that's that's individuals.

967
01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:59.790
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I mean, being mad at myself, uh, you know, in a way, I deserve to be mad at myself because sobered up and I've come to realize that, how many people and let her me

968
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:19.470
Martin’s iPhone: I knew they were doing and I let him and I always had this philosophy that if I gave somebody a leash and they took it. I gave him 20 bucks and they took it. That was the best 20 bucks I ever spent unfortunately I spent thousands of dollars and

969
01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:24.360
Martin’s iPhone: starting to realize that if I don't put myself in that situation.

970
01:34:25.650 --> 01:34:34.230
Martin’s iPhone: You know, obviously along in life you know you're going to come into things that you can avoid I probably couldn't have avoided this my son was probably going to do something either way.

971
01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:37.260
Martin’s iPhone: I'm not certain, but you know

972
01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:38.040
Dr Jameson: I don't like to

973
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.940
Martin’s iPhone: blame them.

974
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:43.230
Dr Jameson: You can't all wet that that he did that, though, that was not your

975
01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.160
Martin’s iPhone: Last like

976
01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:52.950
Martin’s iPhone: I lost $30,000 worth of stuff three animals almost my life and my dogs his life and

977
01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:55.410
Richelle Direny: This

978
01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:57.510
Martin’s iPhone: Message, my son, he put on

979
01:34:57.510 --> 01:35:00.660
Martin’s iPhone: Facebook, just so you know I'm not your friend.

980
01:35:02.370 --> 01:35:09.660
Martin’s iPhone: He posted that to to in general, but I knew it was directed at me and I did everything I could for that.

981
01:35:11.610 --> 01:35:21.840
Martin’s iPhone: Unfortunately, I couldn't get him out of the scene that you know he was living in a bar and his mom and his grandpa ran a bar here in town on it today.

982
01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:25.320
Martin’s iPhone: And he was experienced a lot of people

983
01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:29.850
Martin’s iPhone: And every time I tried to reprimand when he was at my house.

984
01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:46.650
Martin’s iPhone: His parents or grandparents his other parents or grandparents would come and take him because he complained that he didn't like the rules, so I couldn't even install anything on him because he was able to escape it. And now I see him doing some things that

985
01:35:47.760 --> 01:36:04.200
Martin’s iPhone: I know I was a bad kid, you know, I did a lot of bad stuff. And I've done things in my adult life. But when you see your child doing it. I hope it hurts everybody that sees their kid do that. That's one of the biggest things that can be sober.

986
01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:07.200
Martin’s iPhone: Part of the nightmares that I have

987
01:36:08.370 --> 01:36:13.080
Martin’s iPhone: Are about the fire about finding the animals about trying to escape.

988
01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:14.880
Martin’s iPhone: And

989
01:36:16.890 --> 01:36:25.800
Martin’s iPhone: I like the fact that I'm trying to deal with it. But when I wake up the first hour of my day, sometimes the way to get back at those people

990
01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:37.650
Martin’s iPhone: I am thankful that I have not acted on that I have to be the better man. But in a way, I feel like a coward, because I could have done.

991
01:36:39.450 --> 01:36:39.960
Martin’s iPhone: And I don't

992
01:36:40.770 --> 01:36:41.820
Richelle Direny: I'm going to recommend

993
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:44.070
Martin’s iPhone: That's a hard wolf to handle

994
01:36:45.150 --> 01:36:52.290
Richelle Direny: It's a big wolf is, this is what I would recommend as you're talking, I recommend that if you have a pair of different

995
01:36:55.290 --> 01:37:04.260
Richelle Direny: That would recommend that each time that you go to therapy, you take out something out of that back. You can unload it all at one time take something out of that man.

996
01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:16.530
Richelle Direny: That you're going to talk about you're going with the intention that you are going to talk about it. You're going to release it and you're going to leave it there and you're going to walk out of that room and you're going to say. All right.

997
01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:19.020
Richelle Direny: I'm

998
01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.120
Richelle Direny: No longer holding on to it. It's no

999
01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:35.790
Richelle Direny: Longer A WAY TO BE UP A hinderance a shackle and that's what you're doing. You're taking it out and you're really, you're going to take out one issue at a time that you bring to each one of your therapy sessions.

1000
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:46.020
Richelle Direny: And then you leave it when you're gone. You're not allowed to go back to pick it up. You're not allowed to say hey you know what you want to come back home with me now you're saying right there.

1001
01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:53.310
Richelle Direny: And each session. I'm going to recommend that you do that once you're going to take out each problem each thing.

1002
01:37:54.210 --> 01:38:01.050
Richelle Direny: That's what you're going to discuss in therapy, you're going to leave it there until eventually your duffel bag is empty and you can live

1003
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:11.220
Richelle Direny: And I think that will help to decrease, a lot of those nightmares, because I think a lot of your nightmares are related to things of your past and what you still struggle with today.

1004
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:25.980
Richelle Direny: And I think that there are people who go to. I mean, being a therapist. I can see it. People come to therapy and they're not willing to let go the therapist is working with them and helping them to

1005
01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:27.840
Martin’s iPhone: Let

1006
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:42.510
Richelle Direny: Go, but it's so hard that you walk back out of the room with the problem instead of saying, Okay, I'm ready to let go of one thing and this is the one thing, and I'm not going to pick it back up. So I would definitely recommend that when you do

1007
01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:43.770
Robert Bowlin: It.

1008
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:45.540
Robert Bowlin: Can I say something real quick.

1009
01:38:47.190 --> 01:39:07.440
Robert Bowlin: My dad always told me that I mean, are you saying you feel like a coward. My dad always told me that it takes the stronger man to be able to walk away and not not go in and and fall to that level. So, I mean, you can look at different ways. You know what I'm saying. But just a little

1010
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:20.040
Robert Bowlin: You know word to maybe make you think that, you know, you might think you're a coward, but really you're the stronger man because you're, you're not fall. You're not stupid to that level and feeding into that show

1011
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.570
Dr Jameson: I agree.

1012
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:25.890
Dr Jameson: That takes a lot of of strength.

1013
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:27.120
Richelle Direny: Courage and

1014
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:33.390
Martin’s iPhone: I'm definitely glad that I i have i don't have to put that on my conscious

1015
01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:40.320
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, you would just feel that much worse, it would just be that much more angry at yourself. Right.

1016
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:47.910
Martin’s iPhone: I don't even trust myself, you know, to say that I can say 100% that that's what happened. But I'm 90% sure sounds

1017
01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:58.200
Martin’s iPhone: That 10% tells me, Martin, if you did that you might not even be doing it for the right reasons, let alone, trying to justify

1018
01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:02.550
Martin’s iPhone: You know what they did. Karma was gonna get them.

1019
01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:07.440
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, land you in trouble will get anything else.

1020
01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:12.450
Dr Jameson: I do think that we got to go because it's after nine but I'm

1021
01:40:12.630 --> 01:40:12.900
Sorry.

1022
01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.900
Dr Jameson: Finding some sort of

1023
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:31.830
Dr Jameson: Physical, whether it's exercise or I'm not kidding, like a martial arts of some kind or something where you can actually blow off some of this energy in a in a safe, healthy way. Actually, it might actually be helpful for you.

1024
01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:38.130
Martin’s iPhone: Normally I take a lot of it out at work. I'm a carpenter by trade, I need to get

1025
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.490
Martin’s iPhone: I can demolish stuff.

1026
01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:45.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's good.

1027
01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.220
Robert Bowlin: So what is Jesus.

1028
01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.020
Martin’s iPhone: good cook, too. So, I mean, when I'm done.

1029
01:40:54.810 --> 01:41:05.160
Richelle Direny: Guys, SO I'M SORRY EVERYBODY didn't get to share what I know we're kind of ran out of time, so we will join us again next week.

1030
01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:18.180
Richelle Direny: I'm saying, same time if it's, you know, depending on the day that you come on the if you're every other month of same day, same time, we'll both be here already waiting. Okay.

1031
01:41:18.930 --> 01:41:21.720
Dr Jameson: Michael, can you hang on just one second. I have a question for you.

1032
01:41:22.290 --> 01:41:23.370
Richelle Direny: I think, last one.

1033
01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.630
Dr Jameson: Yes, that's fine.

1034
01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.200
Dr Jameson: Alright, Martin I

1036
01:41:38.610 --> 01:41:43.200
Dr Jameson: Kind of areas. This is going to get you wearing trying to go

1037
01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.310
Martin’s iPhone: Well, I hope everybody else opens up to any of their problems don't hide it.

1038
01:41:48.690 --> 01:41:51.480
Martin’s iPhone: You know, it's a lot easier if you just talked about.

1039
01:41:51.630 --> 01:41:53.010
Dr Jameson: You feel better already probably

1040
01:41:53.610 --> 01:41:54.960

Dr Jameson: I'm gonna you MC K supposed to help shorten the duration.

1054
01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:31.860
Alyse: What's the call.

1055
01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:36.600
Dr Jameson: You you MC K. It's like a geranium extract or something that

1056
01:42:36.630 --> 01:42:37.590
Alyse: Was the over the counter.

1057
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:39.810
Dr Jameson: That and elderberry

1058
01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:44.850
Alyse: Yeah, I've heard elderberry I was trying to do like that. I came in the beginning, you know, the nose.

1059
01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:52.620
Alyse: But I just think like was lack of sleep, and with lack of proper nutrition and being stressed out.

1060
01:42:53.970 --> 01:43:02.310
Alyse: Probably made everything a lot. Where's the room. So how are you. I'm so sick life has been so d amp D around here lately so

Leah Stover: A Neighbor neighbor.

1091
01:44:27.930 --> 01:44:34.800
Leah Stover: Yes, and I can match it never liked what he said, remember you said one will go outside.

1092
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:37.800
Leah Stover: Go outside, but I was in there for about

1093
01:44:38.970 --> 01:44:41.790
Leah Stover: Oh, five, six, maybe 10 minutes

1094
01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:48.750
Leah Stover: Yeah, I thought that that model. And that's the one thing I think of because I haven't done that.

1095
01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.690
Leah Stover: Okay, I won't be there.

1096
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:54.120
Dr Jameson: And you're gonna stay away from that trailer. Right.

1097
01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:55.440
Leah Stover: Oh, yeah.

1098
01:44:56.970 --> 01:45:01.230
Leah Stover: Yeah, that was pretty good, but pretty much

1099
01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:03.390
Leah Stover: Yeah.

1100
01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:04.950
Leah Stover: That's it, yeah.

1101
01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:08.040
Dr Jameson: No, no, no, no worries.

1102
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:10.380
Leah Stover: No. All right.

1103
01:45:10.770 --> 01:45:13.110
Dr Jameson: Good luck. If I don't see it before you have this

1104
01:45:13.410 --> 01:45:15.060
Dr Jameson: Baby. Good luck.

1105
01:45:15.930 --> 01:45:21.870
Leah Stover: Okay, yeah, one more thing. One more thing. Yeah. You think the prior authorization thing will go through

1106
01:45:22.770 --> 01:45:24.570
Dr Jameson: It should I don't

1107
01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:33.090
Dr Jameson: Oh so Danielle. If there's i don't know i don't get in the middle of those too much.

1108
01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:39.540
Leah Stover: Okay, well, just all be and yeah like whatever happened. Okay.

1109
01:45:39.930 --> 01:45:40.470
Leah Stover: All right, you

1110
01:45:40.770 --> 01:45:42.540
Dr Jameson: Take care. Hi.

1111
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:55.590
Dr Jameson: Hey, I didn't want to call you out in front of everyone. Either your, you know, your test came back positive for something that wasn't supposed to be there to. Did you know that

1112
01:45:56.610 --> 01:46:01.050
Michael Hudson: Probably did yeah Adderall. I had a prescription for Adderall. When I started this

1113
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:06.780
Dr Jameson: Okay well unless they read it on that wasn't it. Did you have any like procedures done or anything sedatives

1114
01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:11.100
Dr Jameson: Said barbiturates know

1115
01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:15.690
Michael Hudson: Would only thing I've got in my system would be the

1116
01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:19.890
Michael Hudson: amphetamine. And I don't mean barbiturate

1117
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.770
Michael Hudson: Taking having

1118
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:26.490
Michael Hudson: haven't taken anything. I honestly haven't. The only thing on

1119
01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:28.020
Michael Hudson: Go.

1120
01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:32.760
Dr Jameson: Well, it's possible they they read like they were you know i mean they wrote the wrong.

1121
01:46:33.810 --> 01:46:39.510
Dr Jameson: I can't, like, I tried to look at them, but it's all blurry. And I can't tell which one is which line.

1122
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.860
Michael Hudson: Right, yeah.

1123
01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.130
Michael Hudson: Richard I'm trying to see if

1124
01:46:44.670 --> 01:46:45.480
Michael Hudson: This happened, what

1125
01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:52.170
Michael Hudson: Just happened once before on some I was taken and describing is showing up as a barbecue. One of them was

1126
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:57.090
Michael Hudson: There's a possibility that I did, it's

1127
01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:06.210
Michael Hudson: I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll look through my prescriptions and tell you what I've taken because I take medical diabetic stuff. And one of them.

1128
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:08.160
Michael Hudson: Is take yeah oh yeah

1129
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.500
Dr Jameson: Oh, I don't have that written. Now, what do you think

1130
01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:11.790
Michael Hudson: I'm sorry. Um,

1131
01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:14.400
Well, I don't think I was your fault.

1132
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:20.490
Michael Hudson: Which one of those shows up as a barbiturate and it's I take that to me.

1133
01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:21.270
Uh huh.

1134
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:23.640
Michael Hudson: Do you take

1135
01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.890
Dr Jameson: A while I'm at it. Is it 500 or thousand

1136
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.180
Michael Hudson: Two. A day 5000 2500 to 1000 invoke honor

1137
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:36.180
Michael Hudson: To listen to it once a week.

1138
01:47:36.210 --> 01:47:36.600
Gotcha.

1139
01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:49.200
Michael Hudson: Yeah, so I got to talk to you about food. Yeah, there is another it's muscle relaxer I've had an infection in my leg here for the last week and a half.

1140
01:47:49.290 --> 01:47:50.070
Of illness.

1141
01:47:51.450 --> 01:47:52.080
Dr Jameson: Or something.

1142
01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:58.770
Michael Hudson: Yeah, maybe flexor all are trying to think of the name of it. I've got it there. This happened before.

1143
01:47:59.490 --> 01:48:10.320
Michael Hudson: When I was going to pain. Doctor, actually this is okay and they coming up for barbiturates so I'll look and see what it is because it's something, it's nothing major. I promise you I'll give you my word.

1144
01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:11.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no, I wasn't

1145
01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:13.620
Michael Hudson: I know

1146
01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:22.860
Dr Jameson: Right. And then so you think there's Tramadol there's flexor was just like, whoa benza Preen they're

1147
01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:24.990
Michael Hudson: Flexible I definitely I take flexor all

1148
01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.930
Michael Hudson: Okay, yeah. Do you have flexible, but I didn't know that was a barbecue.

1149
01:48:28.110 --> 01:48:28.440
Michael Hudson: Well,

1150
01:48:28.770 --> 01:48:32.430
Dr Jameson: It's a muscle relaxant, but I don't know whether I'd have to look it up on their cross reacts.

1151
01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:39.120
Michael Hudson: Tramadol I've had before. I don't know. But I remember them bringing it up because she was like I was trying to figure out what what's

1152
01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.670
Dr Jameson: An Adderall or what do you think

1153
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:47.640
Michael Hudson: When I started here. I had an Adderall prescription and I had this six or seven left in the bottle and

1154
01:48:48.270 --> 01:49:01.200
Michael Hudson: This driving thing where I've been driving. I've just been so worn out. And one night I was driving and I told her, when she was going to take the test done. And she said, what didn't show up. So yeah, that's, that's what I thought you were asking about

1155
01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:01.710
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no.

1156
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:03.300
Michael Hudson: Idea.

1157
01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.250
Dr Jameson: I'm like, wow, that's not one that people

1158
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.900
Dr Jameson: Don't see that

1159
01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.120
Michael Hudson: From the 70s. Right. Yeah.

1160
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:10.170
Michael Hudson: Yeah.

1161
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:11.640
Michael Hudson: I'm old. I'm

1162
01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:14.310
Michael Hudson: Me like

1163
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:22.560
Dr Jameson: You. I want you to read up or learn a little bit about how diet can reverse diabetes, you know this. I mean,

1164
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:24.240
Michael Hudson: I've lost 70 pounds.

1165
01:49:24.450 --> 01:49:25.350
Dr Jameson: Oh, awesome.

1166
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:26.010
Yeah.

1167
01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:28.710
Dr Jameson: There's. Do you have Netflix.

1168
01:49:29.370 --> 01:49:29.820
Michael Hudson: Yes.

1169
01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:34.560
Dr Jameson: There's a documentary on there called Forks Over Knives.

1170
01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:45.030
Dr Jameson: And so it's actually you can eat as much as you want, but you have to eat the right kinds of foods or avoid the ones that are toxic to us, which are

1171
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:50.580
Dr Jameson: That come from animals, basically, which is never well received, but

1172
01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:51.660
Michael Hudson: It's true.

1173
01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:53.850
Dr Jameson: We see people literally come

1174
01:49:53.850 --> 01:49:57.240
Dr Jameson: Off their diabetes meds. If they switched to a plant based diet.

1175
01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:10.320
Dr Jameson: Fact, in fact, you can't just do it because you're on so many meds your sugars would drop like dangerous if you just tomorrow started a plant based diet. So it would have to be done under supervision, but

1176
01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:13.620
Dr Jameson: At least watch the documentary. And then there's there's some more.

1177
01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:24.330
Dr Jameson: Well, there's game changers and there's fed up. And there's what the health isn't actually that would be good to watch what the health system, what the hell.

1178
01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:27.420
Dr Jameson: Just be like,

1179
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:34.290
Dr Jameson: Look into it. And unfortunately, I was one of them. I only recently stumbled somebody introduced me to these

1180
01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:49.020
Dr Jameson: Things, because you don't hear about it in med school and the mainstream doesn't really understand they don't buy into it. The science is kind of suppressed because it doesn't jive with our agro industrial complex.

1181
01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:49.890
Michael Hudson: Here.

1182
01:50:50.400 --> 01:51:08.790
Dr Jameson: And pharma Big Pharma either like if we cure diabetes, they wouldn't be selling something drugs. So I'm cynic in me. But anyway, um, I think you might be interested. And even if it's not, if you're not 100% if you're 80% or even 75% you're still going to have better

1183
01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:12.360
Dr Jameson: better outcomes and better blood sugars, because all this

1184
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:19.230
Dr Jameson: That's what they teach us through this medicine that that's not this medicine and they don't, we don't ever like, wait a minute. Let's go back to the root of

1185
01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:32.280
Michael Hudson: My he wants, he was like a 12 seven and I finally got got it back down to seven. So that's a good seven and that's great. I have, I have a new diabetic. Dr. Darcy now twice a year, or actually three times.

1186
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:37.080
Michael Hudson: Okay, and she's, she's up my rear end about it so we can work on and you can

1187
01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:51.120
Dr Jameson: Ask if she's familiar with any of the science in the plant based diet and like there's like there's a thing called the American College of lifestyle medicine and they have a big website, there's probably studies and stuff on there too. You could look into, but

1188
01:51:52.320 --> 01:52:00.570
Dr Jameson: Don't do anything without talking to somebody first because and somebody that seems like they know about it, because what we find is that almost instantly.

1189
01:52:01.710 --> 01:52:07.410
Dr Jameson: You have to start dropping or eliminate dropping doses or stopping meds because the sugars just

1190
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:10.500
Michael Hudson: Go down. That's the worst feeling in the whole wide world.

1191
01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:24.390
Michael Hudson: Ya know, that's what my wife suffers from queue at she drops and that's that's her pancreas just bottoms out. Yeah. And I felt at a couple of times like that. And it's the worst. Yeah, I can't imagine feeling well dangerous. Yeah.

1192
01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:31.350
Dr Jameson: I mean it's dangerous. So it sounds like maybe as you lost so much weight, they may be able to start dropping doses anyway but

1193
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:42.090
Dr Jameson: That might you might. I mean, it depends how long you've had diabetes. So you may not ever get off to all of your meds, but you can certainly get down and those are expensive. I don't need to tell you if some of them so

1194
01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:44.310
Michael Hudson: 800 bucks.

1195
01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:45.990
Michael Hudson: without insurance one Bob

1196
01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:46.980
Dr Jameson: Are you wanting

1197
01:52:47.190 --> 01:52:48.360
Michael Hudson: To know

1198
01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:52.920
Michael Hudson: Like saying when I was in to know what when I was insulin dependent and, you know,

1199
01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:53.880
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

1200
01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:01.620
Michael Hudson: Yeah, so it's like couldn't believe how much it cost me I'll watch that I watch that. And then, yeah, it's

1201
01:53:01.650 --> 01:53:03.900
Dr Jameson: It's sort of and you want tablets don't let me

1202
01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:05.790
Michael Hudson: Write you if you don't mind if that's okay. Yeah.

1203
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:18.480
Michael Hudson: I'm old enough to honestly will tell you. I can answer your question, but I will look and see you again. I haven't felt well but I haven't taken anything that I know.

1204
01:53:18.930 --> 01:53:25.920
Michael Hudson: I haven't taken a pain medication or anything like that. So I'll look and see, because this is a trace of something that came up and I will keep thinking about it because

1205
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:33.930
Michael Hudson: She kept saying, you know, the barbiturates are popping up and you're showing your system trace amounts and she goes, I couldn't figure out where they're from. But there's one

1206
01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:40.680
Michael Hudson: But I have had flexible and I'm I do take that that was just, I mean that was that's not

1207
01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:51.960
Dr Jameson: That's okay. I am if we're really that worried. We can always send you to blow the lab where they do the higher level tests that have less false. I mean, some of them so false positives, but

1208
01:53:53.610 --> 01:53:53.940
Michael Hudson: Anyway,

1209
01:53:54.690 --> 01:53:57.360
Dr Jameson: If it keeps happening. Maybe we'll think about that next time.

1210
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:03.180
Dr Jameson: Okay. Well, I just wanted to touch base about it without their own you. You know, putting you

1211
01:54:04.530 --> 01:54:06.450
Michael Hudson: Know, I understand it's hard to talk to me but

1212
01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:18.960
Michael Hudson: Also on my one on one. I rescheduled with our girl here so I could, I just, I never talked to the other person that much and just wasn't and I just didn't think I could have a conversation

1213
01:54:19.170 --> 01:54:20.580
That well so that's fine.

1214
01:54:22.110 --> 01:54:22.410
Michael Hudson: It's

1215
01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:25.500
Dr Jameson: I'd rather you be with somebody you feel is going to be helpful. So

1216
01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:29.940
Michael Hudson: Yeah, that's good. I just wanted to make it worth the time of somebody talking to me so

1217
01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no worries.

1218
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:38.460
Dr Jameson: It is no people, no. There's never a 100% match rate with anybody can

1219
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:45.750
Michael Hudson: You switch. It's not too personal and she's a perfectly wonderful person. I just know people I can talk to you and certainly

1220
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:46.710
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's fine.

1221
01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:59.250
Dr Jameson: That's true for everyone. Okay. Well, we'll see you next time. You know, I think I've said it before, but I kind of prefer people come every couple weeks instead of once a month. I think it's a little long to kind of be

1222
01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:00.690
Michael Hudson: You want me

1223
01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:03.240
Dr Jameson: Every day. I mean, if you can I, some people have to pay

1224
01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.340
Dr Jameson: Cash and then I'm not gonna insist

1225
01:55:05.370 --> 01:55:06.090
Michael Hudson: What if it's

1226
01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:08.370
Michael Hudson: Just this month. And it's not the money. Yeah.

1227
01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:11.640
Michael Hudson: But admission. What you know like if you don't have insurance and you're paying cash every single

Michael Hudson: I just thought I was over one stage and going back now. So it'll be okay. You know, I have a daughter, now.
