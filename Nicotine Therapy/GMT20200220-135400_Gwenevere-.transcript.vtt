00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You can take your time, got a couple minutes here while I open up a document.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.420
Jay: Yes, ma'am.

18
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.650
Huh.

19
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.430
This is our first

20
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.120
First. First. First. This is

21
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.010
Okay, we go into

22
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.530
Just do recently.

23
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.890
Grab something somewhere else in bringing in here.

24
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.550
Well, I'll think I'll just go, I'll go from my memory. I'll do the best I can.

25
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Hi.

26
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

27
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning. So today is really fast and give me a chance to have a better first impression. Today it's just lots and lots of questions, much like what you did, probably with with a physician.

28
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: There's really no time to process thoughts, feelings, stories, but it may still elicit some negative feelings.

29
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And so will probably want to use some deep breathing. Some compartmentalization and we're just, you know, have to feel into those responses. We just want to answer them so that I have a quick snapshot and then we'll move on. And then later on.

30
00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and easy and no rush. Okay, so today is really about gathering the bio psychosocial information from your history, but just at least so that you know who you're talking to, and who your therapist is I want to at least introduce myself a little bit

31
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe Dr. Solomon is the one who did your health and physical, is that right

32
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.970
Yes.

33
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And then working with him for a few months, we have pretty good alignment in our, in our sort of philosophy about the medicated assisted therapy. Sometimes we depart here and there, but most of the time we're right on same page.

34
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm very transparent when it comes to kind of like what we're doing. If I'm going to do a technique or I'm gonna do something. If you want to know the physiology behind it. The theory behind it. I'll spend time doing that.

35
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But you won't learn much about me this therapy is for you. So the little bit. I'm going to tell you now is kind of the deal because volley got 60 minutes. And believe it or not, it'll go by like that so

36
00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:03.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist by that's the formal training here in Florida and have had my license for over 20 years

37
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And certified trauma specialist and electronic. I don't even know it's it's such a silly one. But it's for doing the telemedicine. I decided to get certified in that too.

38
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But I've always been fascinated by addiction. And so I've always ended up working enough people and I just love the population. I love it. In a sense, it's, it's so individualized

39
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: There's really no single answer. The science is getting closer and closer and closer to having

40
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of this neurobiological understanding and thank goodness, I have even more information scientific information to offer about addictive behaviors about the chemical dependence, so that's exciting.

41
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I do use my phone for you saw for confirming appointments. It's also I want you guys to know you have access to me. If you want a bit

42
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to like I'm having a shit Day of Giving cravings and I want to know. It's just that me sending stuff back is going to feel cold.

43
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I won't do therapy via text. It's too risky but you will see me say something like this. When's the next time we can meet

44
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In zoom. So I'll make myself available or you'll, you'll hear you know if you're suicidal, let's make sure we get you to to emergency department. Let's use a safety planning.

45
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's call a friend. Let's just exercise. Take a shower clean your room, whatever we gotta do to get past, even those first 60 seconds and then okay we're past those initial cravings. But I want you to know you have access to me.

46
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It just means you may have this long message and I'll be like, when can we meet

47
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not meant to be cold hearted. It's just that I'm an independent contractor I earn my living here when you don't show up. I don't pay my bills.

48
00:05:50.130 --> 00:06:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So really important you keep your commitment and I very rarely don't keep mine, but I'm healing. Sometimes I do get sick. And it's, it has been a couple years, but it does happen.

49
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It is eastern standard time over here anytime I ever say a time like seven in the morning I'll talk in your terms. You don't have to think about it. I'm pretty good at it. But if it ever sounds weird, just let me know.

50
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What else everything we say in here stays in here. So let's say something comes up for you. And you're thinking, geez, I don't really want this shared in group I don't bring what sharing group into I mean in individual therapy into group.

51
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Have the most it might ever sound is I might say, you know, how we talked to Jay about you're wanting to talk about something in group to remember. And do you feel like talking about that and you'll be like now.

52
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be like, cool. And are you been like. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, confidentiality is really, really, really important to me because

53
00:06:46.290 --> 00:07:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of stigma still around. Chemical dependence and I want people to feel like they can lay lay out just the the raw stuff that disgusting, the embarrassing humiliating the shame activating all of it in here and know that ain't going anywhere. Okay.

54
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So without further ado, I, I'm going to be focusing on the progressive development of the opioid dependence.

55
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: When was your first use of an opioid what's context broken ankle and then I fell in love with it. Like what happened.

56
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.510
Jay: Well, I have my wisdom people now whenever I was a

57
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.800
Jay: Okay, and I was

58
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:39.840
Jay: I was given oxy code on, then I think I was given was supposed to be 10 and they gave me a bottle of, I think, with 110

59
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.560
Jay: Yeah.

60
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.750
Jay: Yeah.

61
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And no no no okay so

62
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You used it and how did it make you feel

63
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.910
Jay: Kinda like

64
00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.790
Jay: Shielded. I don't know if

65
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.870
Jay: It would put like a blanket of comfort over. You know what I mean.

66
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it.

67
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.780
Okay.

68
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to put over me, since it's not me, but I'll put felt like a shield a blanket of comfort over me, because we're not talking about whenever we're talking about you.

69
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, beautiful got that initial use. And so I'm going to give you an example. This is not you, this is, this is an example what progression is going to be like, because it's going to be like this for all the substances that you've used

70
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Age of first use the progression how bad it got its worst, most recent use. So walk me through big pieces of this for some people it's this then I didn't use again till I was 23 did HEROIN FOR SIX MONTHS got arrested.

71
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Last use was yesterday. That's, that's a snapshot. So kind of break me down the progression from 16 to now.

72
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.890
Jay: Well, I really been messed with heroin peels idea a little bit

73
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.880
Jay: My big thing was math for a long time.

74
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:14.940
Jay: Whenever I got out of prison. I GOT OUT ON PAROLE last year. And while I was in prison.

76
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's, let's, I want to make sure that this, this has some timeline to it. So listen, listen closely to this. Here we go. A different use of an opioid acting

77
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on one. Now you're on a long acting one. So there's still an opioid so you're on this first one age 16 the progression. So here we're at 16 I run out of the hundred and 10 what happened.

78
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:54.630

771
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not sure if I can stick with this timing I might be able to other got one client that used to have that every week. I'm not sure what's happening with him but Fridays at seven in the morning will be your spot. So our next appointment will be February 28

772
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Your medication will be bridged to these days, people just kind of need that motivation so that they don't blow off therapy.

773
01:04:53.520 --> 01:05:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be that way for, I don't know, a month or something and then once you show that you know you got good by end and we won't be doing that anymore. Okay.

774
01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Because mobile app. I don't need to talk to her. I already got my meds.

775
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So that tends to change over time. When you see the benefit of therapy. But for now, that's what we'll do. So your next

776
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Your next service is February 24 at nine in the morning, get into group pop in there a few minutes before and then you and I will meet still have to go to virtual clinic, but we'll meet February 28 at seven in the morning.

777
01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we can slow down. Now, of course, today I'm going to be giving you a quick call at two or at for a real quick just like run through some, some of the remaining questions.

778
01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:38.310
Jay: Okay.

779
01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.250

781
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.200
Jay: All right, thank you. Quinn.

782
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And oh, is the medication bridge to today. Should I be telling Dr. Solomon, you were here.

783
01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:53.460
Jay: I yeah probably

784
01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.150
Are you out.

785
01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.810
Jay: No, no, I picked up. I got like three more days, I think. Okay.

786
01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't make it all the way to Monday, though. So, so that's a problem. I'm going to let them know you're here. So my guess is there was some bridging going on. I'll let him know you made it today. Okay. Okay.

787
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:12.960
Jay: Thank you.

Gwenevere Abriel: He's registered part time or full time.

800
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:03.750
Christina Haro: Well, full time.

801
01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:09.360
Christina Haro: I got him into school because he never got his high school diploma.

802
01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:19.620
Christina Haro: But what they're offering at the at the community college is that while he's doing his GED. He can go to to college classes. So he's doing the dual thing.

803
01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Dual enrollment.

804
01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, what's so exciting. You must feel so good.

805
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.410
Christina Haro: Yes. And it was his idea. So I thought great.

806
01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you didn't have to convince them of anything.

807
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: No idea. All right.

808
01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:40.890
Christina Haro: I took him over there. And once he saw the girls. He says, you know what mom, I think I want to go here.

809
01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.270

813
01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's start with just some sort of updates on

814
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Your overall

815
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Mood over the last week. Has it been pretty steady ups and downs kind of tell me how you've been feeling

816
01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:52.380
Christina Haro: Emotionally, it's been pretty steady. I didn't get since I've been keeping busy and, you know, things are going good. I've been. I've been. Actually, With all this going on with my son. I've been feeling really really good. This is, I tell you, I had, I had a great week. I felt really good.

817
01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And how many hours of sleep. Are you getting

818
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:05.490
Christina Haro: Um, I say bye to seven hours. Okay. Most of the time.

819
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:13.380
Christina Haro: Yeah, I think I've been doing. Okay, I think I've been sleeping better these days than I was before.

820
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: One of your goals is I want to be happy and not bring baggage.

821
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So one of the things that I've invited you to do as a task and activity is to engage in really really regularly engaging in the box breathing that I taught you, or grounding in the five senses.

822
01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people forget that second one, because the breathing is such a great one. They forget about this other technique.

823
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember grounding in the five senses. You remember how to do that one.

824
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.490
Christina Haro: No, let's refresh that one.

825
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll do

826
01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:17.160
Christina Haro: Actually I left my little journal in the car so

827
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it just outside

828
01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:21.960
Christina Haro: Yeah. Can I run and get it now.

829
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to use the ladies room. It's perfect timing.

830
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Seconds.

831
01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.770
Christina Haro: That's fine. Let's go ahead and do that.

832
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:29.580
Christina Haro: Be right back.

833
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:33.240
Christina Haro: It's not even in here I have everything else written

834
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:38.010
Christina Haro: I'm thinking it's in my other book.

835
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I forgot who we were talking about

836
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:46.440
Christina Haro: We're talking about the five senses.

837
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah. No, that's okay. We'll do it together. In fact, that will use it as an activity today for for emotional regulation will just do it. Just do it again.

838
01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really a very handy one

839
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.900
Christina Haro: Let me, let me grab a pen. So I can write it down. This time afterwards.

840
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.330
Christina Haro: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Alrighty.

841
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So I won't share the poster this time.

842
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But the overview is what you do is when you're in a sort of activated state you're angry, you're stressed, you're sad and if you don't want to be as activated. A lot of people use this or like, not only to regulate like not feel those feelings as intensely, but also if you start to if

843
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: If part of your history is distance

844
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Is dissociation.

845
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a way to get you grounded back in your body.

846
01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:03.780
Okay.

847
01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like you to do is think about typically there's there's some dynamics going on with your older daughter.

848
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe there's we started to talk a little bit. You didn't give any details.

849
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's still some shame inside, there's still parts of it. You don't want to name it. You don't want to talk about it.

850
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It brings up some sort of negative feelings for you. So just in your own mind when she to think about them sort of bring them into your awareness at picturing dynamics with someone

851
01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to what happens to your body. If there's a charge or a shift that happens when you start to think about that event or that memory.

852
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And what happens

853
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:56.310
Christina Haro: Um, my heart starts beating

854
01:13:57.690 --> 01:13:58.440
Christina Haro: Fast

855
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is what you do as soon as you. So we're going to do the activity. Now open your eyes.

856
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you through your eyes. I want you to name as many colors, shapes angles. Anything you can right from here just list them.

857
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:27.570
Christina Haro: Um, it's tan brown mid looks bumpy it it looks hard

858
01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:31.830
Christina Haro: It has some soft, soft sides.

859
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.810
Christina Haro: Um, but I don't know. It looks like a piece of cake.

860
01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And close your eyes.

861
01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you to tell me

862
01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: as many things as you can, what you hear.

863
01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.660
Christina Haro: What I hear here. Yeah.

864
01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:09.030
Christina Haro: Anywhere I can hear the cars outside. I can hear the garbage trucks picking up the garbage. I can hear a car honking I hear my my cat meowing A DOG BARKING

865
01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And with your hand just kind of grab an object and describe the tactile what you feel temperature texture changes in ridges bumps. Anything that you can feel

866
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.580
Christina Haro: What's the temperature. It's warm

867
01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:43.740
Christina Haro: It's it's a big mug. I'm

868
01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:48.840
Christina Haro: Movie was no bridges. It's soft this have religious

869
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.100
Christina Haro: It's a funny shape. Yeah.

870
01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and now I want you to inhale through your nose and pay attention.

871
01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you smell.

872
01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.180
Christina Haro: I smell coffee.

873
01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Taste.

874
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.890
Christina Haro: Um I taste coffee and then they taste the

875
01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:40.500
Christina Haro: The film I had this morning.

876
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. Now,

877
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Real body scan and see how you're feeling sort of scan your body, maybe from your feet.

878
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to the calves and knees and through the thighs.

879
01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: To the seat bonds for your bottom meets the seat up through the back

880
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:02.760
Gut

881
01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:07.710
The chest, the shoulders, neck,

882
01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.190
Had a face.

883
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And compared to how you started with a racing car. Are you doing

884
01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:37.530
Christina Haro: Right, like calm. I don't. My mind's kind of blank. I'm kind of a instead of thinking of what I first started with them, kind of like thinking about my warm coffee.

885
01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and

886
01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:42.840
Christina Haro: Other things, you know, just calm.

887
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's why this is a useful activity because it's actually a difficult thing to do, to name to focus on just information coming through the eyes.

888
01:17:55.860 --> 01:18:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not labeling it not a cake, not a rock and I know you were tempted to do that, but you just want to describe it. Not with labels, but as much as you can't just data coming through the eyes.

889
01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Just data coming through the ears. Just data through the nose just data through taste and I forgot the tactile so typically that tactile, the one with touch you can put in there.

890
01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I think I do it either the second or the third one. That's a great one, because you can. It's rough. It's bumpy, it moves to jag it

891
01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you can just sort of sit here and for some people. This is such an important part of how they regulate they keep some they keep something in their pocket.

892
01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:45.810
Okay.

893
01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of times people have very stressful work environments and they're dealing with a very toxic sort of

894
01:18:54.150 --> 01:19:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: supervisor or manager and they need to be able to stay in their truth and not get angry or cry or get so distressed dissociate when they're with this person, that this is a way for them to get back and they can feel this in their pocket.

895
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And they can be feeling it going over it right with their finger and good not getting lost in. Oh my gosh. I'm going to lose my job. Oh my gosh, I'm gonna lose my job. They're not up here. They're back in their body. So it's pretty useful. So I really want

896
01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:36.480
Christina Haro: I have, I have a friend negative, but I have a friend that goes to therapy right for other things, but she she has a rubber band around her wrist and when she things get stressful, she pops the rubber band.

897
01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's, um, that's

898
01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that's something

899
01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not one I use. I don't like pain to be

900
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:48.000
Christina Haro: Anywhere.

901
01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:52.860
Christina Haro: I guess it helps it helps her go. But that's you. Yes.

902
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see that it would indeed. So let's go to

903
01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So dynamics with your son are awesome feeling really good about that. What about for a while. Was your daughter living with you are now she's down the street and things are good.

904
01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.970
Christina Haro: Law, she actually called me.

905
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:14.160
Christina Haro: Yeah, long to me.

906
01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:21.690
Christina Haro: That was going to tell you that she called me to tell me that she loved me and she was sorry

907
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What she says

908
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:25.860
Christina Haro: Yes. Is that she was sorry

909
01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:37.050
Christina Haro: For what well just because when she left from here. She was very angry. Remember I told you she kind of blew up and the whole hormonal thing and

910
01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:49.080
Christina Haro: She cussed me out left and right, and she disappeared. I never saw her again. She actually left with her boyfriend and I really never I didn't get to see her. I didn't even know where she went

911
01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me just check on who we're talking about. Hold on, let me see my

912
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:56.430
Christina Haro: older daughter Kareena. Okay. Yes.

913
01:20:57.030 --> 01:21:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. Daughter Kareena Kareena called out of the blue.

914
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:03.450
She called

915
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It something, huh, when was this

916
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:23.310
Christina Haro: Um, Sunday, and you know it's funny, you know, I look how do I tell you I KNOW WHY SHOULD CALL ME BECAUSE boyfriend left her and he's in jail now and he's out of the picture. So she

917
01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:37.740
Christina Haro: I guess she's feeling lonely and she she realizes she made a mistake and you know I told her you know honey. The best thing you can do is make your life over there and try to make your life if you need anything, call me and she said, Okay, mom. And that was it.

918
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So not a lot of processing of old wounds. But at least there's this contact again.

919
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and she has. Is she the one that has the brand new baby and the 10 year old as well.

920
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:52.620
Christina Haro: Yes.

921
01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So what that means to you, does that mean there might be more access to your grandchildren.

922
01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.460
Yes.

923
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring it up at all.

924
01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:08.790
Christina Haro: No, I didn't. But you know my granddaughter would always come and stay with me like a week out of the summers.

925
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

926
01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:18.120
Christina Haro: And she was away so I'm hoping it opens up the door to where I can have her this summer for a week. It'd be nice.

927
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't it be nice.

928
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.210
Christina Haro: Like oh yeah well

929
01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Very cool. Well, that's a nice surprise.

930
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And it sounds like you have in the back of your mind.

931
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That there may be the possibility of some manipulation, possibly, but maybe not might just be that she misses you. Right.

932
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Let's hope so.

933
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, either way it's nice to have that access because I know you want to hang out with your grandkids.

934
01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:54.090
Christina Haro: I know. Yes, and I do worry about her, you know, I really do.

935
01:22:56.730 --> 01:22:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you worry about

936
01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:06.090
Christina Haro: Her being out in the street and she's always she's never made good decisions, you know, she just

937
01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.200
Christina Haro: She's like a 30 year old in

938
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:14.970
Christina Haro: She's like, Yeah, she's a 30 year old with the 15 year old mind.

939
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we talk about a topic that might be a little uncomfortable for you.

940
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:27.270
Christina Haro: Should go ahead

941
01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Gets uncomfortable. You can just say, I don't really want to talk about it. Okay.

942
01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:31.350
Okay.

943
01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

944
01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oftentimes we ourselves as you've shared with me develop compensation will you substance use, or maybe we will act out sexually or will get in fights or

945
01:23:48.690 --> 01:24:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Will become gamblers or something will act out in some way, we often do it because there was something missing in childhood and you've shared a lot around just your mother just was not not available to you in a lot of ways, coming up and

946
01:24:06.570 --> 01:24:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look the other direction. When you look at you in the role of parent

947
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What are some of your areas that maybe would have liked to have done more of, or maybe some things you would have liked to have done less of as a parent.

948
01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:41.040
Christina Haro: You know, I look back. Well, now that I've gotten older, you know, my kids are older, you know, I get a lot of feedback from them right and and I do look back and I see that

949
01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:43.890
Christina Haro: I

950
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:58.050
Christina Haro: I never ever spanked them and I wasn't a mean parent like to the standards, the way my parents were real strict and I think that if I

951
01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:12.750
Christina Haro: I look back at. And I think that if I would have been a little more strict with Kareena and not let her get away with things. And, you know, the problem was that I didn't want to be mean. I didn't want to be my mom so

952
01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: He said if I was more strict with Kareena then what

953
01:25:18.090 --> 01:25:27.330
Christina Haro: Then she would have had better values. I think if I would have guided her better and been a little you know just more discipline, she would have

954
01:25:28.350 --> 01:25:29.490
Christina Haro: Taken a different road.

955
01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:44.610
Christina Haro: I think I let it. I think I let her do too much of things she died just gave her. I just gave her the road. Let her do whatever she wants. And I think if I would have been more strict as her and that were discipline.

956
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. And do you think that maybe there was a little more disciplining with your son, and with with your other daughter.

957
01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you.

958
01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:17.370
Christina Haro: I really, I don't know, I just I just look back and I think they were different times in my life. And maybe I was like changed as I got older, I was different. I don't know. But you know, I look back at it. And I think, you know, Kareena was a wild child, you know, um,

959
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:24.840
Christina Haro: She just like we didn't go to school and the local police would always drag your home.

960
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:30.660
Christina Haro: And, you know, it was funny because I look back at it and I think

961
01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:43.560
Christina Haro: If, if I would have been a little more strict with her and discipline her. There was a time where that local cop was bringing her home all the time and you know he finally told me I remember him so clearly Dale. His name was Dale.

962
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:55.800
Christina Haro: And he told me, You know what, Christina, if I was you get the belt and flipper one because she's very spoiled you let her get away with too much. He says, and you need to put your foot down.

963
01:26:57.270 --> 01:27:08.670
Christina Haro: And then I look back at that and I think, you know, she was like 15 and still I didn't discipline her. The way I should have, you know, I didn't school to discipline her. I didn't grounder

964
01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:25.320
Christina Haro: I do want to be my mom, you know, I didn't want to be my mom to where if I don't get her or I scolded her I discipline her, I was going to go overboard and end up abusive like my mom. So I held back. Okay, I get it.

965
01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What was going on. What was your romantic relationship like during those formative years of Kareena

966
01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:41.250
Christina Haro: Um, then I was I was I was married, I was married, but not to Kareena his father.

967
01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:43.500
Christina Haro: I was married to

968
01:27:45.120 --> 01:28:05.910
Christina Haro: My two youngest father and he raised them he raised the to my two older ones, and I was married them, you know, and we got along great man him, you know, he never he never disciplined them. He never spanked them you know yeah he scolded him, you know, verbally, you know, whatever, but

969
01:28:07.770 --> 01:28:16.470
Christina Haro: And they they always told me, even now, even after we got divorced. They've always told me that he was the person that I was like okay

970
01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And

971
01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Specifically, what did you do is

972
01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Your other daughter.

973
01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That felt like you were offering more discipline. What do you do

974
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:33.840
Christina Haro: Um,

975
01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:41.010
Christina Haro: Oh yeah, with Kareena you know when she went she went out and stuff. She, she just

976
01:28:41.610 --> 01:28:49.770
Christina Haro: Would go out and solicit come home late, I would not get mad at her and with Clara. It was different and maybe because Clara was different, you know, now I look

977
01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:57.960
Christina Haro: You know Claire's different Clara didn't fall out. She didn't have boyfriends. She didn't go out to parties, she she was more of a homebody

978
01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:02.580
Christina Haro: And maybe that was the difference between the two. I really didn't have to do much there.

979
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.080
Christina Haro: But

980
01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:16.290
Christina Haro: They do tell me that the two younger ones that I probably just let them run around too much and they saw it, I guess, you know, the two older ones ran around more than the two younger ones.

981
01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Your son is so talking about fun

982
01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:34.590
Christina Haro: Yeah and you know one of those places, but not when he was younger. You know, now he's a little older, you know, he'll be 21 days here, but when he was younger. He wasn't, you know,

983
01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:40.470
Christina Haro: They didn't. They, they might be my two younger ones just weren't

984
01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:42.570
Christina Haro: In holy

985
01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Friend, who are you talking about, I guess I don't understand. There's another

986
01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:59.880
Christina Haro: Clara, Clara in one right. They just, I don't know. They just never went to parties and stuff. They didn't run around. But my tool of seven Alderson which Kareena and her brother more team.

987
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're talking about more to it.

988
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:18.060
Christina Haro: Yeah, I don't see those Kareena and my team. The only a year apart. She was one may 9 and one may 11 so they were so close in age that everywhere they went. They were always together always

989
01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:23.640
Christina Haro: If she if she did school. So did he

990
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So in reflecting this, this is your deepest regret.

991
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.770
Christina Haro: What you might regret that I did not discipline them more

992
01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: When you hear from from your children. What is their biggest concern.

993
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:53.100
Christina Haro: When I hear from my two younger ones, the biggest concern is that

994
01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.670
Christina Haro: You know they they

995
01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.740
Christina Haro: Worry. They were we, they worried about

996
01:30:58.980 --> 01:30:59.790
Christina Haro: The enemy of

997
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Any of them i i'm not saying any particular one just just just assume all of them are one.

998
01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:08.640
Oh,

999
01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What are they saying to you, what's their concern.

1000
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:17.490
Christina Haro: They tell me, you know, Mom.

1001
01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:25.800
Christina Haro: I don't know what we're gonna do a party now because they worry that she's going to end up worse, you know, in the

1002
01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:34.650
Christina Haro: The things she does. And they worried that they're going to end up having to bring her back and we're going to have to take care of the kids because that's what usually happens

1003
01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:45.150
Christina Haro: We end up taking care of Kareena because she's like a little girl, you know, she just you have to take care of her. And they know that we're going to end up having to bring her home.

1004
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:51.630
Christina Haro: That's their biggest concern because even though they lover. They don't want to take care of her.

1005
01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:00.690
Christina Haro: And they know that that's why Korean is calling

1006
01:32:02.010 --> 01:32:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

1007
01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to do with Kareena. What do you think you're capable of doing as far as what resources you have to offer.

1008
01:32:13.710 --> 01:32:17.940
Christina Haro: Oh, I wouldn't, I would love to bring Kareena home and take over, but

1009
01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:26.190
Christina Haro: It would not work. I've tried it already. I've tried it so many times. There's countless times more than I can count on my fingers.

1010
01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:39.990
Christina Haro: And Kareena will be the sweet loving little five year old girl. And so tell me, Mommy, I love you mommy, I love you and she'll be the sweetest thing in the world, and she'll be like that for maybe two, three months and then all of a sudden

1011
01:32:42.570 --> 01:32:43.620
Christina Haro: She's just

1012
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:49.320
Christina Haro: Told her colors and things will start going down hill.

1013
01:32:52.110 --> 01:32:58.740
Christina Haro: I would love to take care of Kareena if she allowed me, but she she just she's she won't

1014
01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me a little bit about what you mean by baggage. What are you bringing to the family relationships.

1015
01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.770
Christina Haro: Um, I've heard from my kids I guess sometimes when I'm

1016
01:33:16.770 --> 01:33:27.750
Christina Haro: I guess you know everybody has a bad day and stuff. And I, my kids will tell me cuz you sound like grandma or oh my gosh, you're going to get older, you're going to be just like grandma.

1017
01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:36.240
Christina Haro: Because they think that maybe sooner or later I will maybe

1018
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:47.850
Christina Haro: I don't know, maybe they worried that I'm gonna blow up one day and I'm really gonna be like my mom, you know, they tell me that I'm so much like my mom, but not in the bad ways

1019
01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:49.770
Christina Haro: But

1020
01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.550
Christina Haro: I just think I bring a lot of what

1021
01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:59.790
Christina Haro: The emotional abuse my mom instilled in me. I think sometimes

1022
01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:06.810
Christina Haro: I feel like if I'm having a bad day. I kind of

1023
01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:11.700
Christina Haro: Have a short fuse and sometimes I feel like my mom.

1024
01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.100
Christina Haro: That's a lot of the emotional baggage. I agree.

1025
01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's the you're handling.

1026
01:34:23.010 --> 01:34:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: A frustration.

1027
01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they recognize that with the way you handle it. They recognize that and they've seen that in your mother. Yeah, and that's that's the part you don't like about you.

1028
01:34:39.150 --> 01:34:39.840
Christina Haro: About me

1029
01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:56.940
Christina Haro: As the baggage. That's the baggage and I've seen it. And I think I'm because my first husband, which was Kareena Martine father he abused me for years, you know, and I think in my next relationship.

1030
01:34:58.410 --> 01:34:58.800
Christina Haro: I

1031
01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:02.130
Christina Haro: Brought that along with me.

1032
01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you mean by that.

1033
01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:05.820
Christina Haro: I dis

1034
01:35:09.450 --> 01:35:16.290
Christina Haro: I felt like I had to pick a fight because I think to me. I, in my mind, fighting was normal. Yeah.

1035
01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So in the next relationship you you saw yourself almost listening and picking a fight.

1036
01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:25.080
Okay.

1037
01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:37.620
Christina Haro: I didn't never did. He will he wasn't abusive. That's one thing about him. He was not abusive. The only thing that ended our relationship is because I caught him with another woman. So that was the end of that I could not handle it.

1038
01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So there might be. I think that

1039
01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe being able to

1040
01:35:50.040 --> 01:36:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Have so the two things that I've taught you so this thing. We just did today. Can you picture actually being able to use the the box breathing and grounding in the five senses when

1041
01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You get frustrated with someone. Can you picture taking time walking away and doing one or both of those activities to bring your distress level down. Can you picture doing that.

1042
01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.690
Yes. Okay.

1043
01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

1044
01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we'll get into some more about that. I think that's, that's a big piece, you've really labeled it. I have a short fuse and sometimes there's this almost

1045
01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That findings normal that that raised voice and arguing, that's a normal thing. That's what you were raised with there was all this, the history with your with a husband and so there it's showing up again.

1046
01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I know you were putting some effort into I'm just touching base a little bit on some of your goals that you wanted to get a job and how you doing around that.

1047
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:53.520
Christina Haro: I actually, I got

1048
01:36:54.660 --> 01:37:05.070
Christina Haro: I had actually apply for this job because I always did up the I'll do the caregiving. Right. So I had a place with this job, two weeks ago and

1049
01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:13.230
Christina Haro: I applied on I'm on Craigslist. Right, I answered an ad. Anyway, let's put it that way.

1050
01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:21.270
Christina Haro: And I had talked to this man I had texted him and he texted me back and he told me, You know what, for sure. I want to talk to you right

1051
01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:29.670
Christina Haro: Yes, it's I'll be giving you a call. Well, that was like two or three weeks ago and he never called me so I figured, oh well, he found somebody else. Well, yesterday.

1052
01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:42.060
Christina Haro: He left me a message and he told me, Christina. He says, are you available Sunday. So I'm supposed to call him back today, are you available Sunday. He says, because I want to talk to you about taking care of my mom and I said,

1053
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:51.930
Christina Haro: Wow, I waited three weeks. I thought he had forgotten about me. So I'm all excited. It's really good pay its private pay really good. I don't have to go through the company.

1054
01:37:52.710 --> 01:38:00.750
Christina Haro: And it's really good. It's an eight to five job Monday to Friday. So if the hours are great. I thought it was just great. So hopefully I'll get it.

1055
01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And how for drivers for you.

1056
01:38:04.110 --> 01:38:13.830
Christina Haro: I'm not bar, probably not even not even 10 miles. So that's a pretty good distance here in the city. I'm not even close.

1057
01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So we may our, our appointments may change a little bit. We may move to, you know, 630 or something to create some people what they do is they get ready.

1058
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: They and then they do the therapy in their car. Sometimes they do it in the residence home. So we'll have some flexibility in there, we'll see if we can carve out a way to make that work for you.

1059
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:37.980
Christina Haro: Yes, that's why. I'll let you know for sure to see what pans out. But I'm all excited

1060
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, yes. That's so great and and you had kind of given up hope on them.

1061
01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:44.490
Christina Haro: Yeah, I had given up hope.

1062
01:38:46.650 --> 01:38:47.190
Very cool.

1063
01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

1064
01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you ever use with any of your children.

1065
01:38:57.810 --> 01:38:59.370
Christina Haro: Did I ever use what they did with children.

1066
01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:20.460
Christina Haro: Not with the two older ones that my my using started in my 30s. So that's what I was talking about. I mean, it was, it was my using started with my second husband. Yeah, that's when all that started

1067
01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever use with your children.

1068
01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:28.320
Christina Haro: In front of them by them that they saw me.

1069
01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, with them.

1070
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:42.390
Christina Haro: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, definitely not had to. No, no, no, no, no. And they've never seen it. You know, it's funny because I had all my kids. And we talked, and I was very, very honest with them.

1071
01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:49.680
Christina Haro: And I sat them all down. And this wasn't too long ago this was probably when my daughter was still here. We talked, and they all told me the same thing.

1072
01:39:50.100 --> 01:40:07.350
Christina Haro: Mom, if you would have never told us that you were that you did anything we wouldn't never know says, because we never saw you drink, drink because I never drank it for them, we never saw you drink and we never saw you do anything. This is for you, admitting it now, we would have never known.

1073
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.640
Christina Haro: It was a secret part of me.

1074
01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:14.850
Christina Haro: But to us with them. No.

1075
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:23.070
Christina Haro: And I probably would never do it even if I became you know that other person. I probably would never do anything like that.

1076
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you mentioned that you're, you have a daughter, that's in this program.

1077
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.610
And yes,

1078
01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Which was she dependent on on opiates as well.

1079
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:36.570
Yes.

1080
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:49.740
Christina Haro: And because she didn't doesn't it with me. You know, I didn't really know what was going on. I figured it out after a while, and I figured it out on my own.

1081
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:58.140
Christina Haro: Okay, so, um, when I discovered this program because I started looking for something for myself right so

1082
01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:05.790
Christina Haro: I started looking around and I had told her. Right. I told her as a suggestion I just tried to, you know, I didn't

1083
01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.350
Christina Haro: Ask her if she wanted to and I didn't tell her I just told her I was going to do it.

1084
01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:21.900
Christina Haro: So when I found this program. It was, um, I was a really, I thought, really, really low. That night, and it was probably like two in the morning when I was talking to an intake worker with this program.

1085
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:33.540
Christina Haro: So the next day I told her about it. Right. And I didn't go through with doing what I was going to do. She ended up doing it first. A gave her early

1086
01:41:34.650 --> 01:41:39.360
Christina Haro: And she decided to go ahead and then to the program. So she entered the program before me.

1087
01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:43.380
Christina Haro: Which is good because I suggested it to her and she did it.

1088
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:49.710
Christina Haro: And I told her I was really proud of her. So yeah, we try not to talk about stuff, you know,

1089
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:56.520
Christina Haro: I just Howard, are you doing, you're counseling, she tells me. Yeah, but that's about it. You know, we tried to just

1090
01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:08.310
Christina Haro: Not talk about, I don't know if it's a good idea. I don't know if that's good or I, I just think if she wants to talk about anything. She'll talk to me.

1091
01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so today I'm kind of touched on a lot of different areas.

1092
01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Reviewed grounding in the five senses and I'm encouraging you to use at least through three to five cycles of that diet for medic breathing.

1093
01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When you start when you hear your voice getting elevated or you he feel that heart rate beating fast. Just say give me a minute.

1094
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: We've always got time. We've got time to self right if we've got time to yell at someone. We've got time to calm ourselves down to bring that heart rate down. So give that a try. See if you can remember to do it. A lot of people need reminders, put some stickies up

1095
01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Put something posting it around. Let everybody now I'm trying to work on my my temper, a little bit. Want to do this breath work want to remember the grounding in the five senses.

1096
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then let's think of something that you can tell yourself. Let's work a positive reframe so picture. The last time that you lost your temper.

1097
01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Just hold it in your mind. Maybe it's with your son. Maybe it was with a daughter.

1098
01:43:24.150 --> 01:43:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And

1099
01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you

1100
01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe about yourself in that moment.

1101
01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: These are difficult. These are difficult to get to. So if you can't find the I Am, or I believe I am statement I can help you if you, Jenna, just kind of give me some free association about what's what's going on in your head.

1102
01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So here. Tell me who were you upset with

1103
01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:56.400
Christina Haro: Um,

1104
01:44:00.810 --> 01:44:03.600
Christina Haro: I was upset with my son because

1105
01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:08.520
Christina Haro: This was about. Probably a week ago when he

1106
01:44:09.630 --> 01:44:19.020
Christina Haro: He left with that he left with his friends and and then he told me all I'll be right back. I'm just going to be out like an hour and he didn't come home and all night and he didn't come home to the next day, about three o'clock in the

1107
01:44:19.410 --> 01:44:29.700
Christina Haro: In the evening, so I didn't see him like for 24 hours and I was calling everybody I was I was worried and he wouldn't answer the phone. So when he got home, I was upset.

1108
01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So here it is. He's missing. Don't you don't know where he is. This is a hard thing to get to. So go nice and slow. Christina.

1109
01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: He's missing.

1110
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know where he is can't reach them. I'm worried

1111
01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about yourself at that time.

1112
01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can finish the sentence, I believe I am

1113
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:04.230
Christina Haro: I believe I am a good mother because if I wasn't a good mother, I wouldn't worry

1114
01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm being a good mother by worrying.

1115
01:45:10.050 --> 01:45:10.560
Christina Haro: Yeah.

1116
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:26.700
Christina Haro: I didn't know cuz my son, sometimes tells me you know when mom. He says, I see my other friends and you know they don't have much of a parent either one or the other. He says, and you he says when things happen and I don't come home. I know you're always worried. And I know you love me.

1117
01:45:29.970 --> 01:45:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now when he came home, let's look a little further. When he came home and I'm assuming, correct me if I'm wrong you yelled at him.

1118
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:40.290
Christina Haro: Yes. Okay.

1119
01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the part you don't really like about what you did.

1120
01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:43.770
Christina Haro: Yeah.

1121
01:45:44.250 --> 01:46:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine, right, I got it. That's the part of your history, you kind of wish that had dropped away, but unfortunately that's what's normal. That's what you were raised with so showed up again. Okay, hold on to that while you are yelling at him. What's the belief about yourself.

1122
01:46:11.490 --> 01:46:13.350
Christina Haro: I believe I sound like my mom.

1123
01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: When you sound like when you sound like your mom.

1124
01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Finished the sentence, I am

1125
01:46:22.590 --> 01:46:23.670
Christina Haro: I am

1126
01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:25.920
Christina Haro: Abusive

1127
01:46:29.670 --> 01:46:29.970
Okay.

1128
01:46:34.230 --> 01:46:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

1129
01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to be thinking about yourself when you are when you love your son, and you are concerned, trying to track him down and you finally see him.

1130
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to be believing about yourself. What, what do you want to be thinking about who you are.

1131
01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: No longer I'm abusive, but I am

1132
01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: The opposite of that. Let's try that.

1133
01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:18.150
Christina Haro: And just said that. I just want to be thinking that and

1134
01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.940
Christina Haro: I don't know. I don't know how to put it

1135
01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard, and these are really difficult. Don't, don't be too hard on yourself. These are hard to get to. So, in the absence of right

1136
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I catch myself I'm yelling. Oh, I'm almost helpless to it. I'm being abusive, but I can't stop it. This is all I know. Like, it's almost unconscious. It's happens like automatically

1137
01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But what we're doing right now is we're going to introduce some choice.

1138
01:47:48.420 --> 01:48:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this breath work will give you time to remember. Other things. What I'm hoping that breath work and grounding in the five will do is help you remember this new thing that you can be thinking, instead of I'm abusive.

1139
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be telling him, things like I was worried about you.

1140
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt scared.

1141
01:48:13.050 --> 01:48:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's what worry is I'm scared something would happen to you.

1142
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now, if you were talking like that.

1143
01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What might you believe about yourself. If you were saying.

1144
01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so worried, and scared. You didn't tell me where you were going.

1145
01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I stayed up till three in the morning looking for you. What might you believe about yourself.

1146
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:43.320
Christina Haro: That I'm a good mother. Damn, I'm normal mother.

1147
01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a good normal mother.

1148
01:48:46.710 --> 01:48:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you see how the way I spoke is a choice and the differences is that I use I statements.

1149
01:48:55.560 --> 01:49:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I own my own key. He didn't go out just to make you miserable. He went out because he's his own man zone person.

1150
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And if the only way that you show good mother is by worrying see reinforced it. You got to worry you worry, it's, it means you love me. Well, then there's that worry again. But that's not the only way to show you're a good normal loving mother.

1151
01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: There's other ways to and another one is when he does come home, you can be honest with him. And you can say, I was so worried and so scared. Something might happen to you.

1152
01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Um I stay up late and I lose sleep.

1153
01:49:37.290 --> 01:49:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell me, can you leave me a little note.

1154
01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.730
Something like that.

1155
01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been able to do that where you say, I feel, and it's not the word like it's not the word that that you say a feeling we're right after it two very distinct way of communicating. It's an if statement I feel scared.

1156
01:49:57.450 --> 01:50:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And afraid and worried that something bad has happened to you. And then we zip it and then we let this person your son, say, Yeah, mom, I get it. You know what I need, I need to be more respectful and I need, I need to tell you, I need to leave a note, but I'm afraid you're going to yell and

1157
01:50:13.650 --> 01:50:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me not to go

1158
01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:16.260
Christina Haro: Okay.

1159
01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's the change for you is this. You breathe.

1160
01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember I'm a normal good mother. I love this boy and you use an ice statement.

1161
01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:30.690
Christina Haro: Statement.

1162
01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel and the tricky bit and I know that I'm making this sound really easy, but this is hard. Most people don't remember to use an emotion word they instead. So you put if you're writing something I feel the big blank space and you've put in some of the big ones scared angry lonely.

1163
01:50:52.410 --> 01:50:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Happy afraid jealous embarrassed.

1164
01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:02.910
Those are big ones.

1165
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Only an emotion word you it will not work. And most people don't even know they're doing it, don't do it right in front of me. I feel like, Nope, you lost it already on the third word I feel that nope lost it on the third word

1166
01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But on your note can't say the word like can't say the word that

1167
01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:28.560
Christina Haro: Word.

1168
01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That's subject to opinion, there's no there's no debating that you were scared. There's no no that is actually what was going on. But instead what most people do they start telling a story.

1169
01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is, such as the debate now you're in this this spattering sparring match with your son about whether that's our logistic thing that. No, it's not. This is how you felt

1170
01:51:52.410 --> 01:51:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And it said what it is, is it's expert pressing how we feel versus showing

1171
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people the way you were raised emotions were shown we throw something we show it by yelling, we show it by passive aggression.

1172
01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Showing it by hiding things breaking things ignoring that people love withdrawal. That's a show that is most people's upbringing.

1173
01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: The tricky bit and most people don't teach this, and they don't know it is that it's more efficient, more intimate and kind to share how you're feeling and not show it.

1174
01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So instead, you say, I feel scared when you don't tell me where you are and I worry for hours and hours and hours.

1175
01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you shish. We'll go over that a little bit more later, but we're at the top of the hour and I just wanted to introduce a couple of those things, see if

1176
01:52:55.740 --> 01:53:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You try it and it works. We try it and come back and tell me a story like I tried it, but tell me what you actually said because probably be where you snuck in like

1177
01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We, like I said, we still got in an argument, and I'll listen and you'll, you'll end up using having said the word like instead of I felt scared.

1178
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: When you dropped out of school.

1179
01:53:20.370 --> 01:53:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Period and then you let the listener talk. Okay, okay. It's hard to do, but that's sharing

1180
01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And we have every right right these are the people we love and care about. We want to say

1181
01:53:32.370 --> 01:53:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it's with your older sister older daughter right later on. This is not just saying it would be something like, I feel remorse. I feel deep sorrow.

1182
01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: For some of the way that I may be under disciplined. I didn't show you consistency and couldn't grow and see with a follow through on on things.

1183
01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Period. I feel sad about that.

1184
01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm trying to, it's a different way of communicating. That's very direct and you're owning your own emotion.

1185
01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not acting out and trying to show them. Well, this is how I feel like I'm going to show you. I'm going to hurt you. The same way I was hurt like that's that it doesn't work over and over again.

1186
01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.320
Christina Haro: Showing

1187
01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work.

1188
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.330
Christina Haro: Okay.

1189
01:54:16.050 --> 01:54:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But sharing does

1190
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's um let me see.

1191
01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:40.380

1195
01:54:52.650 --> 01:54:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and then regarding the texting. Is it because I'm sending emojis. Maybe that it's not going through

1196
01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.400
Christina Haro: Yeah, I think so.

1197
01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's on me. I'll just use regular words, I'll say confirmed or yes

1198

Christina Haro: Okay, we'll
