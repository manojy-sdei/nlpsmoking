00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.330
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Really

23
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.590

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.280
Galaxy J3 Orbit: This has just taken off for

27
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.730
Galaxy J3 Orbit: This but

28
00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.630
Katrina Groves: This is. Yeah. It's the history kind of for bright heart. We have to start over from the beginning and

29
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.820
Katrina Groves: Takes a little bit of time.

30
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.040
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay.

31
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.120
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Alrighty.

32
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.620
Katrina Groves: Alrighty. Alright, so, hey, just kind of start from the beginning and

33
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:31.680
Katrina Groves: Let the let us know when you first started using narcotics what you used your drug of choice, just kind of like when you came into the clinic and talk to Tony and me. So, just tell me about your

34
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Like two years ago.

35
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.300
Katrina Groves: Or how however old you are, just let me know that the summary of how you got into the mess you got into and how you're getting out of it.

36
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.470
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Maybe this most recent time or the keynotes. I was in it a couple times, so it's it's a hard, hard one.

37
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.430
I know

38
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.740
Galaxy J3 Orbit: We just started the second time.

39
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.560
Katrina Groves: So know how old were you when you first started abusing drugs. I mean, did you start with marijuana when you were

40
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Like 13. Mm hmm.

41
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.060
Katrina Groves: And

42
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.430
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's like 13 sorry when we first

43
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.890
Katrina Groves: And then what

44
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Drinking

45
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I didn't use metals like 15

46
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay.

47
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then I was just on a

48
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: On it until I was like

49
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.240
Galaxy J3 Orbit: 35 or something.

50
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.760
Katrina Groves: On the math or heroin to

51
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.050
Galaxy J3 Orbit: All of it.

52
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Whatever I could get

53
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.260
Wow.

54
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.890
Katrina Groves: Yeah. So what was your drug of choice of all those do you think he was mad or heroin.

55
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.220
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Heroin fentanyl

56
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.740
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then like what what fit and offers came out, it was like the suckers and stuff, you know,

57
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.080
So,

58
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's what was around

59
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.240
Katrina Groves: And how did it affect your relationships here where

60
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.730
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Did you weren't affected dad.

61
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.340
Galaxy J3 Orbit: As days I couldn't work for good habit, you know,

62
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.470
Galaxy J3 Orbit: A lot of hang in your head and Shane.

63
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.420
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

64
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.060
Katrina Groves: And when's the first time you were able to get clean

65
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.610
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm

66
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.440
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Actually was on Suboxone program. When I first met you.

67
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: A long time ago when I when I was in my

68
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.160
Katrina Groves: 20s.

69
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.050
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, I think I was like

70
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.660
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Now I even bought in my 30s, I might be like 31 or something. Okay.

71
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.620
Katrina Groves: You're 14 how time flies.

72
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Right. I remember telling you

73
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:57.900
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's weird to me that how open my eyes are because they're used to being squinty and I'm used to having them droopy filling and it was hard for me to adjust for my eyes wide open.

74
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.510
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And just weird.

75
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.650
Katrina Groves: And so then you had a relapse or two.

76
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.420
Galaxy J3 Orbit: In between, yeah.

77
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.070
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I stopped going to group.

78
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.730
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then I got back in trouble ended up in jail again and

79
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.220
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Back down the same path.

80
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.330
Katrina Groves: So do you have any

81
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.720
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Do you can get in jail. You can get just as much drugs as you can on the streets. Yeah.

82
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:40.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: But this last time when I went to jail. I put myself on lockdown for nine months. And so I can figure myself out.

83
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.380
Yes.

84
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.640
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Being violent so they wouldn't let me out with others and

85
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.610
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know, it's all good and bad.

86
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.100
Katrina Groves: How long ago was that very

87
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Five years ago, six years ago since I've been in jail. Good.

88
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.790
Katrina Groves: And you have no outstanding anything

89
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.410
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, nothing.

90
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:14.490
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No by sat it all out. But they did 36 months and then I sat half of it out because it was halftime

91
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.750
Mm hmm.

92
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.170
Katrina Groves: How's that feel to be

93
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:29.040
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Out of the system. It feels good to be clean and out of it now. Um, I haven't had a drink in like four years.

94
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.810
Wow.

95
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.790
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

96
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.670
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Everything's been good.

97
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.920
Katrina Groves: Any other substances that you're using right now. I know you're still smoking. Right.

98
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.550
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, constantly. I mean, that's it.

99
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.060
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's half of my sobriety. I think

100
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.060
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Really is. Yeah. It helps me with a lot of different things.

101
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.640
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Kind of a stress reliever. Yeah, being able to cope with people to

102
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.320
You know,

103
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:13.830
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Using using drugs and stuff. It kind of made me not non social just not tolerant to people's bullshit.

104
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.520
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I remember you had a lot of anger issues.

105
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.530
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

106
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.680
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's a problem.

107
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.030
Katrina Groves: Still right

108
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.570
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Now, I kind of control it better. It's it was uncontrollable when I was using

109
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.690
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It would just spike up. Now I can. I know what to do before it happens before I get to man.

110
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.310
Katrina Groves: What do you do

111
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.270
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Have hobbies I garden.

112
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I have my plants. And it's not just

113
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.630
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Marijuana is got my food and stuff my flowers and

114
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.110
Galaxy J3 Orbit: All different kinds of stuff. That's great.

115
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.220
Katrina Groves: So you smoking pot to or just cigarettes, or both.

116
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.410
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I don't smoke cigarettes.

117
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.430
Katrina Groves: So we were talking about pot not smoking cigarettes. I

118
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.050
Galaxy J3 Orbit: missed out. Okay.

119
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.150
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I just smoked smoked weed.

120
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.580
Katrina Groves: And any kind of

121
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.830
Katrina Groves: Other coping skills that you have besides the gardening.

122
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.190
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, my kids can't concentrate on my kids.

123
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.810
Katrina Groves: How old are they now.

124
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:44.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My son just turned four my daughter's five and my other daughter is 11 and my twins are 17 amazing

125
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:54.300
Katrina Groves: Yeah. Any sign of, you know, addiction runs in families. Any sign of anything in your 17 year olds or

126
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.710
Are they pretty

127
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:04.620
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Well, I never heard nothing from them. When I was going through it. I was with they had a question. I was honest with them.

128
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:11.400
Galaxy J3 Orbit: When they seem me tore up. I told them this is the the bad part of it. This is the sickness.

129
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know, it's, it's

130
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.660
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know I told them when they see somebody strung out

131
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: They know now. You know what I mean it's not

132
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:29.190
Galaxy J3 Orbit: They don't get too close to them because they know they're either could be messed up or something.

133
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.770
Galaxy J3 Orbit: They don't want to get too close to people, but my daughter is starting to drink.

134
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.870
Katrina Groves: Your 11 year old.

135
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Know,

136
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.860
Katrina Groves: My 1717 year old. Yeah.

137
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.670
Yeah.

138
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.510
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My 11 year old hates alcohol.

139
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.150
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Good GH whoever drinks.

140
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.930
Katrina Groves: Well, that's something that runs in your family to like your dad. Wasn't he an alcoholic. I remember

141
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.570
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, he sobered up when I

142
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: When he said over it up when I was probably like 14

143
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.430
Galaxy J3 Orbit: When I started actually

144
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.950
Galaxy J3 Orbit: With it too late by then.

145
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:24.510
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I still have it was always there was always ice chest there. There was always never a soda in the fridge. It was always a beer right

146
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.380
Katrina Groves: Here that's not

147
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.660
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, he's here with me.

148
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.600
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's not drinking drinking is not

149
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know, it's not like in your blood in your genes, but it's inherited

150
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.890
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Get in here I inherited is like it was passed down like it was a trophy. It wasn't

151
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That was how it was for him.

152
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.600
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, he grew up that way he grew up getting beer at eight. Yeah. Yeah, it was.

153
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:04.350
Galaxy J3 Orbit: The thing to do. I guess it grew up in Arkansas. You know I may grow up, but a lot of different places.

154
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.060
Galaxy J3 Orbit: He thinks different

155
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.400
Katrina Groves: Sounds like you're breaking the cycle for your family, though.

156
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.510
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You didn't do that for your

157
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.280
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You didn't have beer in the fridge.

158
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: There they don't know. They're clueless to everything I was grown up in

159
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.360
Katrina Groves: That child abuse and

Galaxy J3 Orbit: Last month I did, I had to go get some antibiotics. Good.

223
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.630
Katrina Groves: Don't let that go, just go right in, because that can turn bad

224
00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:03.240
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Unless it's a scary thing. I feel like that's the only thing that can take me out.

225
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:04.770
Katrina Groves: Wow.

226
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.870
Katrina Groves: So you had pilot SEC on your old chart used to take some for heartburn. Do you take that anymore.

227
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.800
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Well, I had that pain on my side, my stomach and they did, they

228
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.010
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Didn't know what it was my liver or my gallbladder. I went and had the

229
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:31.650
Galaxy J3 Orbit: The ultrasound down or extra with ultrasound. I think from my gallbladder and they said it all the vowels are fine. Everything's fine. There's no stones or not, then

230
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.240
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Huh, but it kind of feels like I broke a rib maybe last summer. And that's kind of what it was.

231
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.830
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Like I like a little river something in there that's hurting

232
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:49.200
Katrina Groves: So I know that as far as you said, liver, and made me think about your blood work on right heart has

Katrina Groves: They might be, I don't know.

240
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.410
Katrina Groves: So yeah, I'd go on NPR, but I think they're open, but I don't think they're open for that.

Galaxy J3 Orbit: Not since I've been in the program.

265
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.270
Katrina Groves: So did you have an overdose. At one point,

266
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:03.330

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.130
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Now go pretty good.

281
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.530
Katrina Groves: All right, signs of diabetes like paying too much or being thirsty too much.

282
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:06.180
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I don't know. I have to get that checked because i've i've i've had a problem with that in the past, so I'll have to get that looked at

283
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:16.680
Katrina Groves: Actually, so the labs that she's got if you put, if you go in fasting, don't eat anything they do a blood sugar. And that's a way to tell if you have diabetes.

284
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.520
Galaxy J3 Orbit: All right, I'll do that. The night before.

285
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:29.490
Katrina Groves: Right. Well, now you can eat dinner but just make it like an eight to 12 hour fast and don't have anything in the morning, no gum, no sugar with your coffee just water.

286
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.120
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay, that's a good check for diabetes.

287
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:38.850
Katrina Groves: All right, how about your eyes and a change in your vision blurry vision or double vision.

288
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, I don't think they're getting as good is a word, but it comes with age.

289
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.400
Katrina Groves: Yeah, I was gonna say your old now. You're 40 man.

290

Katrina Groves: Any redness or

292
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.000
Katrina Groves: dry eyes.

293
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:55.860
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Know,

294
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.240
Katrina Groves: How about hearing difficulty hearing pain in your ears.

295
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:01.920
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No.

296
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.460
Katrina Groves: Any tinnitus. That's a buzzing sound. Do you hear

297
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.560
Galaxy J3 Orbit: In your ears, sometimes. No, no, my dad has that. Yeah.

298
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:17.400
Katrina Groves: So, nose, mouth and throat any kind of sores on your mouth or your tongue.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:19.320
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No.

300
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.780
Katrina Groves: And you did say you

301
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.170
Had

302
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.790
Katrina Groves: The dental pain already. Yeah.

303
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.630
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, I have my nose always like

304
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:38.910
Galaxy J3 Orbit: swells up and I can't breathe. But it's always been like that I think has been broken so many times.

305
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.500
Katrina Groves: So it's not allergies. It's just you don't have a lot of

306
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.270
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Room and no

307
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:55.200
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, I, if I have to use that spray now and it kind of opens it up, it makes it on swell because I can't even stick my finger in there. It's like completely swelled

308
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:56.610
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Shut

309
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.340
Katrina Groves: My nose phrase in a prescription or over the counter.

310
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.070
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That like that afren or whatever.

311
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:20.730
Katrina Groves: Oh, be careful with that. So afren works really good, but it's kind of like Vaizey. It's just a temporary fix. So you're actually it's it's opening everything up and because the blood vessels kind of contract and then it comes right back in a few hours. And so you get addicted to the African

312
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.310

382
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:35.700
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I know it depends on what I do, I guess if I if I know I have a lot to do that day like go pay bills day or something. It's kind of stressful.

433
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:00.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's it.

434
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:02.400
Katrina Groves: It's pretty awesome.

435
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.700
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It is. It's been good.

436
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:07.920

438
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:36.300
Katrina Groves: So probably you know maybe one month, once a month with bright heart for a couple times and then I'll just let you guys go longer. I mean, there are people that are changing too bright. Her that have been clean for seven, eight years, you know, since the beginning so

439
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.810
Katrina Groves: The transition is good.

444
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's just driving me crazy. Yeah.

445
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:10.590
Katrina Groves: This is kind of nice because you can do it in the comfort of your own home. You know, you get your phone. They'll just be a few other people up on top and you probably know some of them. I mean, I'm who's going to be on Pacey will be there on the 17th, I believe.

557
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.000
Katrina Groves: So,

558
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:06.510
Joshua Hayden: This is

559
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.700
Katrina Groves: history and physical, they call it, although I'm not sure how to do a physical over the

560
00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.460
I can see your face. That's about it.

561
00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:25.800
Katrina Groves: So you're we're just going to spend some time, you're going to have to pretend that I'm like a doctor that you've never seen before. And I'm going to ask you all this stuff about your history and just kind of go through a

562
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.600
Joshua Hayden: detailed history. So if that's okay. Sounds good.

563
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:39.960
Katrina Groves: Alright, so the first thing I know about you is that you came to our program me see if I got this right. July 16 2014 is that

Joshua Hayden: Yeah, that was, yeah. That was my second time. Yeah, right.

565
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:49.140

566
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.710
Katrina Groves: No, no relapses, no nothing.

567
00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:53.490

Joshua Hayden: Doing good. Excellent.

569
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.720
Katrina Groves: Let me get organized here so

570
00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:06.630
Katrina Groves: I kind of want you to start from the beginning like again pretend I don't know your history.

571
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:18.120
Katrina Groves: And then they want to know what age you started using substances and what it what you and you may have already done this with the people at bright heart on your intake.

572
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:25.920
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, a little bit. It was kind of hard though because the questions that they asked didn't really pertain because they're like

573
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:35.700
Joshua Hayden: It was a 12 month period. And I've been clean for 12 months. You know what I mean. And so it was really kind of hard. It doesn't pertain to me.

574
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.510
Joshua Hayden: You know,

575
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.180
Joshua Hayden: And so yeah, this will be more

576
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.330
Joshua Hayden: I guess in depth. Yeah.

577
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:51.870
Katrina Groves: So start from when you first felt you had a problem where, you know, were you five years old, smoking, drinking, where you were, what

578
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.670
Joshua Hayden: Well, it was

579
00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:00.870
Joshua Hayden: My freshman year of high school. So what I was

580
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.060
Joshua Hayden: 15 1415 maybe and

581
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:15.510
Joshua Hayden: Smoke Pot, just a little bit like but never really got into it and then I dropped out of high school.

582
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:37.620
Joshua Hayden: And my mom was like, well, you know what, like you're not doing anything. Fly little bird. And so she gave me the boot and I moved up to Seattle, Washington and was working up there and my roommates that I was with

583
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:47.400
Joshua Hayden: Drank and smoked pot and I drink a little bit smoke pot a little bit. But then one of my co workers and I was working with

584
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:55.920
Joshua Hayden: Was doing heroin and introduced me to that and I

585
00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.360
Joshua Hayden: Did was shooting up probably

586
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.460
Joshua Hayden: Two and a half years. And so it was kind of like

587
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:12.570
Joshua Hayden: To the extreme end of the, you know, ladder right away and then

588
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.340
Katrina Groves: At that point, did you get a

589
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.840
Joshua Hayden: Job, like I was

590
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:26.400
Joshua Hayden: 15 when I first did it and I moved back to Crescent City when I was like 1717 and a half and

591
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:49.230
Joshua Hayden: My mom paid for a bus ticket home came back here to Crescent City and she dropped me off at my friend's house and his parents were just all plant family, friends and like he took a leave from school to stay with me 24 seven while I got better.

592
00:46:50.370 --> 00:47:02.460
Joshua Hayden: And I stayed sober from opiates or heroin for quite a few years but I started dabbling and methamphetamines

593
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:07.710
Joshua Hayden: And really didn't drink really didn't smoke weed.

594
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.070
Joshua Hayden: And then

595
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.290
Joshua Hayden: I was

596
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:25.620
Joshua Hayden: 19 when my daughter was born. And I stopped taking methamphetamines then and

597
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:39.630
Joshua Hayden: It was two years later, I had a black lung and they prescribed me prescription painkillers and

598
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:44.310
Joshua Hayden: That just turned into a smorgasbord for me and really

599
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.760
Joshua Hayden: Got me back into that realm of opiate use and

600
00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:58.260
Joshua Hayden: Gosh. When was the first time that I joined the Suboxone program here. I want to say.

601
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.330
Joshua Hayden: My daughter.

602
00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:02.070
Joshua Hayden: My oldest this

603
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:11.940
Joshua Hayden: Was in like the eighth grade. Maybe I'm not sure I can't remember the exact time that I first joined the Suboxone program and I had

604
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:18.030
Joshua Hayden: Like three years sober and then I ran into some medical

605
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.050
Joshua Hayden: Some internet issues where

606
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.020
Katrina Groves: June 22 2011

607
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:42.390
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, so she was 11 yeah yeah and I stayed. I was in the Suboxone program and then I ran into insurance issues where I couldn't afford to pay for the medication and

608
00:48:45.060 --> 00:49:01.140
Joshua Hayden: I was able to stay clean for like a year after that. And then I fell off the wagon and started using again and then I came back to the Suboxone program. The second time.

609
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.640
Joshua Hayden: Currently have right around five years claim.

610
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:09.600

Katrina Groves: When you do group on a Monday, my group is going to be 545 to 645

618
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:42.510
Katrina Groves: You'll, you'll see a bunch of other people up here. And so just you and me.

619
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:44.790
Joshua Hayden: But pacing.

620
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:50.400
Katrina Groves: Pacing is going to be kind of difficult because we all get dizzy. If we watch you. I mean, I'm okay.

621
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.310
Katrina Groves: I'm fine with it today.

622
00:49:53.700 --> 00:50:08.190
Katrina Groves: It doesn't bother but in group, you'll have to kind of sit in one place and they also like you to use earphones. I don't know why because it's just more private I have one lady who goes and sits in her car and door so

623
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.790
Joshua Hayden: So you said that was Monday at 545

624
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:25.770
Katrina Groves: Right. But I wanted to ask you just while we're talking about it. When is your prescription to because Josh, I want to get you like on seeing me like the week that your Scriptures do or something.

625
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:36.600
Joshua Hayden: Um, it's not. I believe it's not this this Thursday, but the following Thursday. Let me look at the calendar. Sorry.

626
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.440
Katrina Groves: And grab

627
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.930
Joshua Hayden: If you want, we have your pills with you.

628
00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:43.590
Katrina Groves: I think you're you had it done on the 23rd, is what I'm gonna say

629
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.350
Joshua Hayden: Um, it should be.

630
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:57.510
Joshua Hayden: The 20th of February is when I would come in and do my talk screen.

631
00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:04.950
Katrina Groves: Alright, so you have a choice. I think they scheduled you for this Monday. But if you want to switch to the 17th.

632
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.960
Katrina Groves: Do that, that would be, but I don't care. You can keep it Monday and get it over with.

633
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:16.200
Katrina Groves: Just so that you're about a week or two prior to your script. Which do you prefer.

634
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:27.840
Joshua Hayden: We can do I can do the 17th and that would be that Monday at 545 Correct, yeah. The 17th. Okay. Yeah, I'll just plan on doing that already.

635
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:30.750
Joshua Hayden: installed it on my calendar right now.

636
00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:36.600
Katrina Groves: I think they probably told you before, to do it on the 10th, but I'm okay to change it. If you are

637
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.320
Joshua Hayden: Okay groves. Sorry, I'm writing it on my calendar.

638
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:46.590
Joshua Hayden: I am to 545. Now I have a question. Um,

639
00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:58.080
Joshua Hayden: When because the number that I entered to join the meeting with you, she said that that's a temporary number and it changes.

640
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.150
Katrina Groves: Okay, what was the number

641
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:08.640
Joshua Hayden: It's 522-649-3217 yeah

642
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:12.450
Katrina Groves: So I don't know if I don't know how they really work it.

643
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.710
Joshua Hayden: Okay, it's technology again so

644
00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:32.460
Katrina Groves: It may be the same number. It may be a different one. You just need to call in, like, you're good about being early so they have if we have five or six people in group, they have to do a little brief addiction assessment for a few minutes. So I would get in at 530 ish

645
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:40.440
Katrina Groves: And just call the regular bright heart number and they'll walk you through it. It'll take a while for us to get used to this.

646
00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:46.200
Katrina Groves: Okay, alright, so I'll put you down for the 17th right it

647
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:49.980
Joshua Hayden: Sounds good to 70

648
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:56.280
Katrina Groves: Right. And I'm talking about this box on you're currently taking eight milligrams and you're on the fourth day right

649
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:58.140
Katrina Groves: Correct. And

650
00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:01.530
Katrina Groves: Pride to paper in the past, but it's been difficult.

651
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:06.000
Joshua Hayden: Yeah. You had mentioned the last time I talked to you. You had mentioned that we can

652
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.710
Joshua Hayden: Cut them in. I didn't know if we wanted to.

653
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.950
Joshua Hayden: Try and do that.

654
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.020
Katrina Groves: Do you feel about that.

655
00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.750
Joshua Hayden: Well, what I'm wondering is if

656
00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.850
Joshua Hayden: I could

657
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:23.910
Joshua Hayden: Take one of the

658
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:40.020
Joshua Hayden: Four strips and chop it into surgery and start winning that way. Start trying to remove one third of a strip every day or

659
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:41.610
Katrina Groves: I would not do every day.

660
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:42.870
Joshua Hayden: Okay.

661
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:50.160
Katrina Groves: I would cut it into fourths, actually, because you're sensitive to it. So if you cut it into fourth. That means you're going to drop by.

662
00:53:50.820 --> 00:54:01.020
Katrina Groves: two milligrams and I would do it only like once a month or once every two weeks. And what if there's no big rush. I just want your body to kind of get used to it.

663
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:02.070
Joshua Hayden: Okay.

664
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.420
Katrina Groves: Because right now, even what one in the morning. How are you taking your Suboxone right

665
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.490
Joshua Hayden: So usually I do

666
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:21.270
Joshua Hayden: Two in the morning. One mid day one in the evening, but there are the times where I do the opposite where I do one in the morning. One afternoon to in the evening.

667
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.500
Katrina Groves: And why did you choose that what's happening that makes you decide to do that.

668
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:26.850
Joshua Hayden: There is

669
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:31.830
Joshua Hayden: Those days that I know.

670
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.310
Joshua Hayden: Are going to be problem days or I just I just

671
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:46.590
Joshua Hayden: Was what's planned out for that day. I know that my problem. Time is going to be in the evening.

672
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:52.170
Joshua Hayden: Rather than in the morning, you know, and it's really hard to explain but it's just

673
00:54:53.010 --> 00:55:07.140
Joshua Hayden: With work or personal family stuff that I know that's going on taking care of my mom. I know that I need those in the evening when I'm with her because she just mentally stresses me out. Right. You know, and so

674
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:19.290
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, like I take care of her Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, and those are the pretty much typically those are the days that I will do two in the evening, rather than

675
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:21.600
Joshua Hayden: Two in the morning.

676
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:28.440
Katrina Groves: And do you notice when you take only one in the morning that you're having issues throughout the day or doesn't bother you.

677
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.810
Joshua Hayden: It dare dare

678
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:47.400
Joshua Hayden: There is that thought mentally. I know you took one but I resolved that to where I know that I need to in the evening. Right. I know that I need that.

679
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.340
Joshua Hayden: And so it's

680
00:55:51.660 --> 00:56:03.990
Joshua Hayden: I don't know, like my own little conundrum that I'm that I deal with where it's like, I really do want to in the morning, but I know that I only have enough, you know, so

681
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:06.900
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, that's my

682
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.140
Katrina Groves: That's your OCD thing huh

683
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:16.680
Joshua Hayden: Yeah yeah it's i i don't know why i don't know if it's just like

684
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:18.300
Joshua Hayden: The

685
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.400
Joshua Hayden: addictive personality issues or if it's

686
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:26.400
Joshua Hayden: What it is, but

687
00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:29.520
Katrina Groves: It's working for you and that's okay.

688
00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:32.790
Katrina Groves: So perhaps what you want to do.

689
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.040
Joshua Hayden: Here noise. Sorry. It was my phone beeping at me.

690
00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:51.750
Katrina Groves: If you want to try and do this one quarter of the strip less when would you do it because it sounds like sometimes, morning and evening are different, but the noon time doses stays the same. So I wondering if you

691
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:52.620
Katrina Groves: Did

692
00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:58.770
Katrina Groves: Do the midday dose just doing three quarters and try that for a month and see how it goes.

693
00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:04.770
Joshua Hayden: Okay, ya know, let's, let's do that. I would be on board with that. That'd be great.

694
00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:16.980
Katrina Groves: And speaking of, okay, so let me go back here. What do you do, what other coping skills. Do you have a sides of Suboxone

695
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:22.350
Katrina Groves: What other coping skills do you reach into when you're stressed.

696
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:25.800
Joshua Hayden: Babe in I Bay and

697
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:31.050
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, he used to be smoking cigarettes. But now I have a

698
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:33.600
Katrina Groves: Nicotine or

699
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:39.930
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, it's, it's the lowest nicotine level that I can get, but it still contains nicotine.

700
00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:44.190
Katrina Groves: And you also use marijuana still at night. Is that correct,

701
00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:47.310
Joshua Hayden: Um, yeah, it's

702
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:53.250
Joshua Hayden: It's a little very low doses and it's not an every night.

703
00:57:54.750 --> 00:58:03.810
Joshua Hayden: Occurrence and actually I've been trying to not be use that on, but it's super high CBD low THC.

704
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:07.200
Joshua Hayden: And I think it's probably been

705
00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:14.910
Joshua Hayden: Probably close to a month that I haven't, haven't taken anything so

706
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.730
Katrina Groves: And why is that well.

707
00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:23.160
Joshua Hayden: First off it's expensive and Second off, I just

708
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.930
Joshua Hayden: Want to try and

709
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.860
Joshua Hayden: People are like, Oh, it's life's problems, you know, and

710
00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:34.710
Joshua Hayden: I just want to try and

711
00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:36.420
Joshua Hayden: I guess.

712
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.430
Joshua Hayden: Deal with it like normal people do.

713
00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.610
Joshua Hayden: For the most part, you know, and not not

714
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:52.350
Joshua Hayden: Think I'm like relying on something, I guess, I don't know. No, that's a personal thing that

715
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.650
Joshua Hayden: Trying to deal with.

716
00:58:56.550 --> 00:59:01.800
Katrina Groves: You're not drinking alcohol. Right. No. Not anymore though you did have trouble with that in the past.

717
00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:04.080
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, yeah. But yeah, that's been

718
00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:11.610
Joshua Hayden: Ever since I've read join this the boxing Suboxone program. I haven't had any alcohol. Great. And

719
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:15.480
Katrina Groves: I know you have more coping skills than just other substances.

720
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:21.540
Joshua Hayden: I use. I use my pacing. I use my pacing and wandering, um, to

721
00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:26.340
Joshua Hayden: To cope and do stuff, are you

722
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:33.750
Joshua Hayden: Running us. No, no, we haven't we go on walks, you know, with the with the new baby.

723
00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:34.830
Katrina Groves: Obese yes

724
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:40.380
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, she's yeah hopefully we'll get back into that but

725
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:49.560
Katrina Groves: Life is ok so I have to explain for right hurt that you are a grandpa and dad on the same week was it I mean

726
00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.460
Joshua Hayden: Yeah yeah

727
00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:53.670
Joshua Hayden: It was two weeks apart or two weeks apart. Yeah.

728
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:57.690
Katrina Groves: And your daughter still living with you. Yes.

729
00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:00.150
Joshua Hayden: I'm actually she

730
01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.840
Joshua Hayden: That's another thing she went home yesterday.

731
01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:08.820
Katrina Groves: Oh, where's home for her.

732
01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.440
Joshua Hayden: With her friends her boyfriend.

733
01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:14.880
Katrina Groves: The mother and the baby.

734
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.020
Joshua Hayden: Father of the baby.

735
01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.220
Katrina Groves: Because you guys had a falling out, or what happened.

736
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.230
Joshua Hayden: No, no, it was

737
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.890
Joshua Hayden: Her choice completely and it

738
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:52.500
Joshua Hayden: I think her thought process is I think she personally I think she lacks the motivation to be like, You know what, like if we do stay apart. I'll have to get a job, you know, do all this stuff and I think she kind of lacks that motivation to do that sort of stuff, you know, and so

739
01:00:53.670 --> 01:01:05.880
Joshua Hayden: You know, my wife and I were like you can stay with us, you know, but at the same time, you need to, you know, go down to hug you know and start making these next steps and

740
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:06.390
Katrina Groves: Run up

741
01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:14.910
Joshua Hayden: It's easier for her, just to go, you know what, I'll go live with him, and I'll deal with all the BS rather than

742
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:22.680
Joshua Hayden: Dealing with going and getting our now you know. It's hard. It's hard.

743
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.450
Joshua Hayden: So, especially when you know the reason that

744
01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:31.980
Joshua Hayden: The main motivation for me to get sober, you know, as the

745
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:39.450
Joshua Hayden: For her, you know what I mean. And just like even with my wife, you know, because like

746
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:47.010
Joshua Hayden: She had a lot going on to all all the different changes that we made our lives better her life. And now it's like watching her just

747
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.690
Joshua Hayden: Crumble. You know, it's sad. It's hard.

748
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.310
Katrina Groves: So is she crumbling or she just trying to find her own way. As a teenager.

749
01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:02.010
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, I don't know, you know, the things that he's done though.

750
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:14.190
Joshua Hayden: Just any other woman would have left them. You know what I mean, like, it's, it's hard. It's hard. Yeah, she's got her

751
01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:19.230
Katrina Groves: Own way, I guess so. Did I hear you say that. That was the main reason you got

752
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:23.970
Katrina Groves: Clean was for her. And do you feel like that's in jeopardy now.

753
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.230
Joshua Hayden: No, no, there's, you know, there's the added stresses, but there isn't that

754
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:37.500
Joshua Hayden: I'm not worried about falling off the wagon or anything like that, you know, it's just

755
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.270
Katrina Groves: And other reasons to stay sober.

756
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:48.000
Joshua Hayden: Aside yeah yeah yeah I have more kids now. You know, I have my life right have a house and all that stuff, you know,

757
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.530
Katrina Groves: Tell me about your job.

01:02:54.390 --> 01:03:01.350
Joshua Hayden: Yeah. New Dawn. Yeah. Yeah. And, um, it has its moments, you know, like every job but

760
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:09.210
Joshua Hayden: It's, you know, it's going okay and I ended up turning in

761
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:20.490
Joshua Hayden: My resignation go why liquors, and just, I had to take a break. You know, from doing that and

762
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:36.690
Joshua Hayden: I knew when I did that, that my brother would kind of step out of a role with my mom taking care of her. So I've taken over that role again. So, you know, we've just set up really good

763
01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:49.200
Joshua Hayden: Boundaries as far as Monday, Wednesday, Friday, you know, I spent two hours over there, take care of her take her your shopping whatever she needs to do and

764
01:03:51.660 --> 01:04:01.560
Joshua Hayden: Yeah. Beyond that, it needs to wait. You know, I'm not gonna drop everything to go go pick something up off the floor, you know, or whatever it is.

765
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.360
Joshua Hayden: Oh,

766
01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.220
Katrina Groves: I just about your mom again, you know,

767
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.650
Katrina Groves: Why do you think

768
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:17.520
Katrina Groves: She would kick you out of the house, you know at that age. Was she aware of the abuse with your dad. I mean,

769
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.870
Joshua Hayden: Yeah I know Steve. She's falling. Now she yeah she knew

770
01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.400
Katrina Groves: Her about that for her not doing what she as a mom.

771
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.950
Joshua Hayden: It's. It is hard because

772
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:37.410
Joshua Hayden: She is one of those people that live in the past. And so it's constant

773
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:40.020
Joshua Hayden: Stories of

774
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:55.800
Joshua Hayden: how everything was horrible. And then we moved away from that and everything was great, you know, and it's like deep down I know that it wasn't great you know and but I would never say anything to her face because

775
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:01.050
Joshua Hayden: That would just run everything you know it would destroy her, you know,

776
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:07.950
Joshua Hayden: And it's, it's hard to bite my tongue, but I do it and

777
01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:15.900
Joshua Hayden: I just do better for my kids, you know, I learned from the whole situation and

778
01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:20.220
Joshua Hayden: That's what I took away from it, you know, and

779
01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:33.180
Joshua Hayden: Um, you know, the things that I was pulling though to, like, I probably not necessarily these days, you can do that. But back then, you are able to do that and

780
01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:42.930
Joshua Hayden: I probably would have done the same thing. If I was the, you know, had a little shit had kid running around not listening. Not going to school. You know what I mean, like,

781
01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:46.200
Katrina Groves: You got a different perspective. Now that you're a bad too.

782
01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:52.920
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, yeah. It says different times and I was completely different person back then.

783
01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:56.550

797
01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:08.550
Joshua Hayden: At the end it was cancer is that he was battling. I don't know what type of was because I only started

798
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:19.260
Joshua Hayden: Speaking to him again. I'm probably like two months before he passed away was the first time that I had

799
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.450
Joshua Hayden: Talked to him and

800
01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.310
Joshua Hayden: 30 years you know it was. Yeah.

801
01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:33.360

802
01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.640
Joshua Hayden: Yeah. You know, I think.

803
01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:37.140

804
01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.270

805
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.870
Joshua Hayden: The main

806
01:07:43.980 --> 01:08:04.830
Joshua Hayden: sounds horrible. The main reason that I contacted him was because towards the end, he was trying to contact me and um he wanted forgiveness, you know, for what he had done and I was just like, you know what, like if this makes it easier on him and

807
01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:11.610
Joshua Hayden: Helps us situation for him. I'll do it. You know, like, I'm not gonna hold on, like,

808
01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:18.990
Joshua Hayden: I knew what he did, he did and wasn't right. But at the same time, like I wasn't gonna

809
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:24.690
Joshua Hayden: Hold on to it and use it against them, you know, and so

810
01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:38.190
Joshua Hayden: Like yeah, you know, and I think there was a lot of with his, his family and sisters and my aunts and stuff. There was closure there too, because

811
01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:51.120
Joshua Hayden: When my mom and him contact divorce. We were completely cut off from that side of the family, you know, we had no contact whatsoever and

812
01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.910

813
01:08:55.260 --> 01:09:04.530

Katrina Groves: Yes. All right. You're almost 40 dudes. So you got to get one and I

908
01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:49.800
Joshua Hayden: Know, I know.

909
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:51.960
Joshua Hayden: This March.

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:54.210
Joshua Hayden: March. Oh my god.

911
01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:59.280
Katrina Groves: All right, how about muscle, muscle pain you're talking about back pain.

912
01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.030
Katrina Groves: Is that just another when you're lifting

913
01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:10.260
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, yeah. It's, um, I think what started my back pain was

914
01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.030
Joshua Hayden: When I was young, I jumped off of Slam bridge.

915
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:34.770
Joshua Hayden: And when I when I landed in the water. I was like in a kind of in a sitting position, you know, and I was bruised really really bad and never was checked out by the doctor or anything. And so I know for a fact that that had to do something to my back, you know, and

916
01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.350
Joshua Hayden: I went to

917
01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:43.350
Joshua Hayden: A physical therapy and I'm

918
01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:46.800
Joshua Hayden: The chiropractor.

919
01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:47.550
Joshua Hayden: For it.

920
01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:53.310
Joshua Hayden: And physical therapy helped me because I was doing a lot of stretching and they taught me stuff over there.

921
01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:58.380
Joshua Hayden: The chiropractic really didn't help me at all.

922
01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:07.530
Joshua Hayden: I just, yeah. He only did two things, and was like, oh, there you go. You know, every single time I saw him, I was like, what

923
01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:15.840
Joshua Hayden: Mm hmm. So, um, yeah, with his tracking and just trying to pay attention to.

924
01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:22.980
Joshua Hayden: What I'm doing and what I'm lifting, you know, seems to help, but there's always that underlying

925
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:33.930
Joshua Hayden: pain in my back. You know, like I just have dealt with it. I know it won't go away. And that's the way it is, you know,

926
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:37.560
Katrina Groves: I'm going down your butt cheeks are down your legs or into your feet.

927
01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.570
Joshua Hayden: No, no.

928
01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:45.690
Katrina Groves: Good any surgeries in the past. I forgot to ask you that.

929
01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:51.540
Joshua Hayden: Um, the only surgery that I had was when I had a new, more thorax.

930
01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.080
Well, that's

931
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:54.720
Katrina Groves: What was the cause of that.

932
01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:58.950
Joshua Hayden: It was spontaneous. They don't don't know why.

933
01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.780
Katrina Groves: So they put a chest tube in

934
01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.910
Joshua Hayden: A couple chest tubes.

935
01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:03.570
And

936
01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:08.550
Joshua Hayden: Yeah, it was very interesting. So

937
01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.610
Katrina Groves: You never had a tonsils out

938
01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:22.320
Joshua Hayden: A pen. Oh, yes, yes, no, I had my tonsils and adenoids removed when I was, oh gosh, maybe four or five I think

939
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:25.650
Joshua Hayden: I was, yeah. Sorry about that.

940
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:28.410
Katrina Groves: Any other hospitalization. Do you remember

941
01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.130

942
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:36.210
Katrina Groves: And you've never had a seizure or fainting spells.

943
01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:44.490
Joshua Hayden: Um, I have had. I have passed out. But, um,

944
01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:52.980
Joshua Hayden: That was because my mom told me because of my blood sugar levels, she always had me take a glucose tablets.

945
01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.080
Joshua Hayden: Hmm, which

946
01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:01.650
Joshua Hayden: I know when I start to feel just like kind of off to eat something.

947
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:02.430
Katrina Groves: Mm hmm.

948
01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:03.660
Joshua Hayden: You know I'm

Joshua Hayden: And I'm not working as much. I'm able to like have you know, lunch, and dinner, and it really hasn't been an issue as of lately. That's really good because

952
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:35.100
Katrina Groves: When you have family history of diabetes. Right.

953
01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.510
Joshua Hayden: Yeah yeah

954
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:46.950
Katrina Groves: If you learn now to do what you're doing the protein and the regular eating that's going to keep you from getting diabetes. The worst thing you can do is eat sugar and carbs, that's just going to make

955
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:47.580
Joshua Hayden: You feel

956
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:50.400
Katrina Groves: Tired and you're going to get diabetes earlier so

957
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:52.950
Glad you're eating healthy

958
01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:01.080
Katrina Groves: All right. Um, let's see. That's review systems we're getting getting down here.

01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:22.560
Katrina Groves: Oh so bright heart has sent you a

962
01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:25.950

963
01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:34.380

01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:56.280
Katrina Groves: I'll put a note on here. It usually when you start with bright heart. They're going to want to order a bunch of lab work and I would suggest

969
01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:12.900
Katrina Groves: That they have sent people to Sutter but don't go to Sutter you have a primary doctor at the clinic, Dr. Pearson have been facts, all the lab work to the clinic and they just do a routine check liver, kidneys, HIV, which you probably don't need but

970
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:18.540
Katrina Groves: Hepatitis panel just all the routine stuff that I did on you, five years ago.

971
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:22.710
Joshua Hayden: Okay, so make an appointment with Dr. Pearson for labs.

972
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:28.050
Katrina Groves: Now you don't even have to do that right heart will send over the labs to the clinic so

973
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:37.710
Katrina Groves: You may get a call. I'm going to make sure by the end of this session today that I will have them send lab work over to the clinic.

974
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:39.150

Joshua Hayden: No.

979
01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.270
Joshua Hayden: No, so I don't go to the clinic anymore.

980
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:52.320
Katrina Groves: Now you can

981
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:53.340
Joshua Hayden: It's all good.

982
01:22:53.430 --> 01:23:01.950

983
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:13.830

984
01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:18.960
Katrina Groves: This is what I've been told from other clients and then you kind of make sure it's it's

985
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:21.180
Katrina Groves: It's clean

And 11

1195
01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.280
Katrina Groves: And that led to

1196
01:41:14.130 --> 01:41:17.640
Cassandra Paul: My first deal was when I was 13

1197
01:41:20.490 --> 01:41:21.570

01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.910
Cassandra Paul: In

1199
01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.120
The press that

1200
01:41:36.210 --> 01:41:36.930

01:41:59.220 --> 01:41:59.850
Katrina Groves: Say something.

01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:15.810
Katrina Groves: So last thing I heard was pot age 15 and then I didn't hear anything after that.

1208
01:42:16.890 --> 01:42:17.580
Cassandra Paul: And

1209
01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:24.540
Cassandra Paul: Maybe I'll call with mostly my thing through high school and

1210
01:42:25.710 --> 01:42:26.190
Cassandra Paul: Pot.

1211
01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.230
Cassandra Paul: I really wasn't

1212
01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:34.140
Cassandra Paul: In the pills, unless I would get them from a doctor. I'm

1213
01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:38.940
Cassandra Paul: And then

1214
01:42:41.370 --> 01:42:42.120

Cassandra Paul: Like in between my pregnancies and stuff.

1217
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:55.230
Cassandra Paul: Um, I would quit drinking and quit doing everything when I was pregnant, but

1218
01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:00.270
Cassandra Paul: Except for the only thing I would do is smoke pot.

1219
01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:08.250
Cassandra Paul: Except for my first child. I quit smoking.

1220
01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:14.910
Cassandra Paul: I quit smoking pot. I was really, really hard. But I did, um,

1221
01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:19.620

02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:01.470

02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:47.040
And

1466
02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:55.800
Katrina Groves: Have you thought about doing, how, how much income do you have now because I couldn't find when you started with us.

02:01:56.430 --> 02:01:59.160
Cassandra Paul: I'm 221 days to

02:01:59.160 --> 02:01:59.460
Cassandra Paul: It.

1469
02:01:59.790 --> 02:02:02.520
Katrina Groves: But I mean, I'm with the Suboxone group.

1470
02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:07.980
Cassandra Paul: Oh, since November of 2014

1471
02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:13.050
Katrina Groves: And did you have relapses on opioids throughout that time.

1472
02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:14.640
Cassandra Paul: Well, I remember I took

1473
02:02:15.810 --> 02:02:18.870
Cassandra Paul: One pill in December of 2016

1474
02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:19.800
Wow.

1475
02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:24.450
Cassandra Paul: So I don't know if you call that a relapse.

1476
02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:26.010
Katrina Groves: I don't think I would count that.

1477
02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:28.260
Cassandra Paul: I want to

1478
02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:33.480
Cassandra Paul: A slip or whatever. But yeah, that was the only build that I taken

1479
02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:35.640
Katrina Groves: Yeah, that's really good.

1480
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:42.270
Katrina Groves: So five years, over five years.

1481
02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:44.160
Cassandra Paul: Yeah, okay.

1482
02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:47.130
Katrina Groves: Do you think this box on is

1483
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:53.880
Cassandra Paul: Obviously helpful. Yes, very helpful. Do you see yourself being on

1484
02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:54.240
That

1485
02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:58.980
Katrina Groves: Rest of your life or do you think about tapering sometimes

1486
02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:07.350
Cassandra Paul: And I think I would use it, probably for a while longer.

1487
02:03:08.670 --> 02:03:09.030
Cassandra Paul: Okay.

1488
02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:12.240
Katrina Groves: Then we talked about the sub blockade, the shot.

1489
02:03:13.590 --> 02:03:15.000
Katrina Groves: That lasts for like a month.

1490
02:03:16.590 --> 02:03:18.990
Cassandra Paul: Yeah we did talk about that. I don't

1491
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.940
Cassandra Paul: I don't know.

1492
02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.000
Katrina Groves: What are your concerns about it.

1493
02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:28.020
Cassandra Paul: Um, the side effects.

1494
02:03:29.730 --> 02:03:30.180
Katrina Groves: Of

1495
02:03:32.010 --> 02:03:36.090
Cassandra Paul: What have you heard about the side effects. What I've heard on the commercials.

1496
02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:49.350
Katrina Groves: So I haven't seen the commercials, but it's pretty much Suboxone it's the same stuff. It's just it hurts a little when you get the shot in your belly, kind of like a demo shot.

1497
02:03:50.010 --> 02:03:58.620
Katrina Groves: Okay, so it's no different than what you're taking. They just have to put that on there because you know lawyers have to do something, I guess.

1498
02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:03.150
Katrina Groves: It might be a something to think about.

1499
02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:11.910
Katrina Groves: Because it's stable, you don't have a lot of ups and downs in the dosing with your Suboxone

1500
02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:19.170
Katrina Groves: And we're using it a lot of peon Oregon, it's working well. So

1501
02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:21.240
Cassandra Paul: Option. I don't

1502
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:23.220
Katrina Groves: Need to change it right now, but

1503
02:04:26.130 --> 02:04:39.240
Katrina Groves: It actually ends up being stronger in the long run, which is why I was thinking about for you because it instead of dipping and having all those peaks and troughs. It's nice and strong and it works for longer than a month.

1504
02:04:40.290 --> 02:04:40.680
Cassandra Paul: Okay.

1505
02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:56.700
Katrina Groves: Alright, so any questions for me on the bright heart and have they they sent you anything to get your labs done at the clinic. Did you say

1506
02:04:57.450 --> 02:04:58.500
Cassandra Paul: Not that I know of.

1507
02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:10.650
Katrina Groves: So since you have a problem. You're supposed to have a premier provider at the clinic, I'm going to have the facts. The lab work over and that's just like what we did when you started the program, they're going to do an HIV tests are going to do a

1508
02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:23.610
Katrina Groves: Hepatitis blood sugar all that. So, okay, will fax it you can get it done at the clinic. If you prefer to go to Sutter, you could always do that and said,

1509
02:05:25.110 --> 02:05:25.470
Cassandra Paul: Okay.

1510
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:34.740
Katrina Groves: I mean, I just wonder what your connection with the clinic is right now, since you you don't go to group anymore with Tony, you kind of just don't do that anymore.

1511
02:05:35.670 --> 02:05:37.290
Cassandra Paul: Yeah, no, not really.

1512
02:05:38.610 --> 02:05:38.940
Cassandra Paul: Right.

1513
02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:46.830
Katrina Groves: I just think it's a little bit cheaper to do at the at dawn community health center.

1514
02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:52.350
Cassandra Paul: Okay, well if it's cheaper than just did there is no gas.

1515
02:05:53.520 --> 02:06:01.590
Katrina Groves: And have they they're going to send you a drugs green test in the mail. I don't know if you want it mailed to your clean and sober house they actually

1516
02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:07.230
Katrina Groves: Try bright heart has you get this little container and then you'll call them up.

1517
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:08.100
Cassandra Paul: And

1518
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:14.190
Katrina Groves: You've got your urine. They'll actually have you open it, go to the bathroom, come back out and you look at it together.

1519
02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:17.880
Katrina Groves: Just kind of a standard thing.

1520
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:23.580
Katrina Groves: I'm excited that you're not going to have marijuana in your system. That's pretty awesome. Yeah.

1521
02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:24.420
Cassandra Paul: It'll be clean.

1522
02:06:28.530 --> 02:06:34.470
Katrina Groves: Alright so I'm glad. Actually, I saw your prescription come by and I thought you needed it. But you've got it for another month

1523
02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:41.670
Katrina Groves: So I'll see you unless you have any other questions for me.

1524
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:58.980
Katrina Groves: So that the group is going to be 545 to 645 on Monday with Rebecca, I believe, Trisha scheduled to be in that group. I don't know if that's a problem. Are you guys know

1525
02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:02.970
Katrina Groves: Is Rebecca. Rebecca as the new counselor.

1526
02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:07.020
Katrina Groves: That know that Trisha will be there.

1527
02:07:08.250 --> 02:07:09.690
Katrina Groves: Some people you might know from group.

1528
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:10.920
Okay.

1529
02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:18.510
Katrina Groves: So let me put you down. Try to get in to try to call around 530

1530
02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:20.190
Cassandra Paul: Because they have to do the intake.

1531
