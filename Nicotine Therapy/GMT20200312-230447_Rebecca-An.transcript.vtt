Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We haven't

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.260

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:32.550
Matt Huss III: To before we listed. It has to be completely empty. So we're having an estate sale because we're not moving any furniture or anything.

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.240
Matt Huss III: So we're trying to get rid of everything. Um, so it's been nuts, trying to pack.

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.480
Matt Huss III: Things and

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.540
Matt Huss III: Get everything set up for. Have you ever had an estate sale.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No. But I've been to one. So I totally get it.

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.600
Matt Huss III: It's, it's unbelievable what

15
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.350
Matt Huss III: What you have to do to set it up for one. It's crazy.

16
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.620
Yeah.

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is. It's a lot of work.

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.740
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah. I actually

19
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.720
Matt Huss III: Missed

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.340
Matt Huss III: A paper that was due because of how much work.

21
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.450
Matt Huss III: This whole thing is

22
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.150
Matt Huss III: Oh, wow. Yeah.

23
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not good.

24
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.020
No, no.

25
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you make it up or did you just take a loss.

26
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:42.990
Matt Huss III: I am going to write it tonight, um, after I get off the phone with you. I'm going to start and write it and hopefully he accepts it but

27
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.440
Matt Huss III: At the beginning of class. He says he doesn't accept late papers so

28
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.050
Matt Huss III: I guess we'll see and

29
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How have things been going, besides being busy with an estate sale and

30
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, how has everything else been going

31
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.800
Matt Huss III: Okay. Um, I went on a date last night.

32
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.870
Matt Huss III: Wait, yeah.

33
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.940
Matt Huss III: And, um, it was, it was good. It was fun.

34
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:30.060
Matt Huss III: And I was, I was a nervous wreck my anxiety was like through the roof. But I think she's a lot older than her profile says, and her pictures.

35
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.650
Matt Huss III: So once I saw our icon. I was like I calm down. I'm like, I whatever I just have, you know,

36
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.230
Matt Huss III: Hang out, you know,

37
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.970
Matt Huss III: Talk and

38
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.830
Matt Huss III: Be friends.

39
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you have fun.

40
00:02:46.050 --> 00:03:02.340
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah yeah it's a good time. We went to this place called the salt yard, um, which is pretty cool because they have like these basketball games and foosball and all these different kinds of little games. So it was it was good time.

41
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. Are you planning on meeting up with her again.

42
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:21.780
Matt Huss III: I know she wants to, but I don't. I mean I have to make it clear to her that if we do, it's going to be just as friends. You know, which I kind of feel bad about but

43
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.820
Matt Huss III: I'm that's kind of her fault for misleading.

44
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you say that she's older like how much older. Do you think VEGGIE IS

45
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.420
Matt Huss III: A good amount, you know,

46
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.970
Matt Huss III: Yeah, like to tool. I mean, definitely.

47
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:56.910
Matt Huss III: Like her pictures and she said she's 36 and I'm 33 and I was like, Oh, I was okay with that. And our picture she was. I'm like, Okay, I've never dated actually anyone older than me ever

48
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.430
Matt Huss III: But I want to now because I actually want to be with somebody who is

49
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.620
Matt Huss III: You know actually challenges me and who I can actually talk to and

50
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.390
Matt Huss III: You know, not just some dumb little girl, you know, um, but anyways. Um,

51
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:35.910
Matt Huss III: She. She looked like she was probably in her 40s and, you know, and it just, I just, you know, I feel bad. I was I was attracted to her in her pictures. But when I saw our then I wasn't any more.

52
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Bad

53
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you happen to mention or asked her how

54
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.480
Matt Huss III: I did and she, she says.

55
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.230
Matt Huss III: She's she

56
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.190
Matt Huss III: Like kept the story. She's 36 and stuff. And I'm like, I almost asked how old the pictures were

57
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.830
Matt Huss III: But I didn't want to like offender, you know,

58
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.480
Well, yes.

59
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you had a good time and you put yourself out there.

60
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.360
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

61
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you got to give yourself credit for that. Right. Yeah, definitely. It's not always going to work.

62
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.760
Matt Huss III: I just know definitely

63
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.180
Matt Huss III: For the first for being the first time you know it's actually probably better that it happened that way.

64
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.830
Matt Huss III: You know, so

65
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:39.240
Matt Huss III: I wasn't under any pressure, you know, the whole time. It was just, you know, I was just able to be me and you know, have a good time.

66
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.340
Matt Huss III: Good, yeah.

67
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. And, you know, especially getting ready to move

68
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.970
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah

69
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you got to think about that, too. It's not definitely not the time to spark up any kind of

70
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No relationship that would make it tough.

71
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.670
Matt Huss III: Definitely, definitely not. And yeah, and really the only reason I'm still doing it is just for

72
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:19.410
Matt Huss III: Practice and to have some kind of social interaction or some kind of something that's not you know school or reading, writing, or

73
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.980
Matt Huss III: Working in the house, you know,

74
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so, which is good. So how's everything going with your roommate.

75
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.020
Matt Huss III: Good, actually. Well, I was good because

76
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.630
Matt Huss III: You know,

77
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:49.050
Matt Huss III: It's just been constantly packing, you know, and cleaning and, you know, and we've had, we have

78
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.990
Matt Huss III: We've been having a kid over, um, who is unemployed.

79
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.170
Matt Huss III: But it is you know does side jobs here and there.

80
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.280
Matt Huss III: You know, so we we have this kid over and then then we have this guy who actually does estate sales for living.

81
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.900
Matt Huss III: And he comes and helps us set up and stuff and

82
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.970
Matt Huss III: But yeah, things have been good, but probably because you know that's

83
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.790
Matt Huss III: Always been doing

84
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

85
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He focusing on the same thing. You guys have the same goals right now.

86
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.430
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah

87
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So do you guys have a place in Florida that you're going to

88
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.090
Matt Huss III: Well, my, my mom.

89
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:44.910
Matt Huss III: You know who who my mom when I moved to Florida. My mom and stepdad actually followed me down like a year or two later.

90
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.770
Matt Huss III: I mean, I'm

91
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.800
Matt Huss III: So,

92
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:58.050
Matt Huss III: And well, and they ended up getting divorced. And so her and her boyfriend have a house.

93
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.020
Matt Huss III: Where my daughter's living right now.

94
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.100
Matt Huss III: Actually like I

95
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.210
Matt Huss III: Think I mentioned that

96
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.630
Yeah.

97
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:18.150
Matt Huss III: And there's two extra bedrooms. So me and my dad are done it stay there until we find a place for me him and my daughter.

98
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.150
Matt Huss III: Or

99
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:29.940
Matt Huss III: I'm hopefully maybe I can figure out something where it could be just medium my water, but we'll see.

100
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:38.430
Matt Huss III: Maybe not it that probably won't happen you know right off the bat. But eventually, you know,

101
00:08:40.650 --> 00:09:03.510
Matt Huss III: At least. Yeah, at least I'll be living with my daughter again and be able to see my son every week or every other weekend, like I was again. So yeah, that'll be really nice. And I'm all, I'm already I'm already set up for school in Jacksonville, which will, where will be living is like

102
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:14.670
Matt Huss III: 30 minutes like 20 to 30 minutes to 40 minutes to Jacksonville. I don't know where the university is

103
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:24.990
Matt Huss III: Actually, um, but it won't be. It's not that far. It's probably basically the same as what we tried now to you and F. So,

104
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.000
Matt Huss III: Um,

105
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's good that's already set up in place and

106
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.360
Matt Huss III: Oh. Oh, and I did, I did actually bring up

107
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:41.490
Matt Huss III: The fact that I need to buy a vehicle you know as soon as I get Florida.

108
00:09:42.750 --> 00:10:01.470
Matt Huss III: Because he's not going to be going to school, like I am anymore. This is his last semester know the reason I didn't need a vehicle right away is because we happened to be able to get our class schedules the same time.

109
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.600
Matt Huss III: So I just go with him and

110
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.400
Matt Huss III: Go back and then the wall. I had to take the bus home. The other day, but it's, yeah.

111
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.980
Matt Huss III: So, but once we get to Florida. I need to

112
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.090
Matt Huss III: To have a vehicle as soon as we get really yeah

113
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.680
Matt Huss III: So, so we did talk about that a little bit.

114
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:49.770
Matt Huss III: And the government took my tax refund again $2,000 this time. Well, it I let my mom claim my daughter. This time, as you know, because she's, she's been living there for about a year now and I've been here for about a year now and I only claim myself so

115
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.710
Matt Huss III: You know, I figured that would help her since she's been taking care of her.

116
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:03.030
Matt Huss III: But still, that the government was going to give me $2,000 back because of like

117
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.310
Matt Huss III: Look at how little income, I may and

118
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.070
Matt Huss III: I don't know.

119
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But going to school and

120
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:21.120
Matt Huss III: They yeah they ended up just like last last time last year they ended up taking more than $5,000 from me.

121
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Allows it

122
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:29.040
Matt Huss III: Ain't my daughter and I was getting $5,000 back last year and they took it off.

123
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.260
Matt Huss III: And it was because of student loans.

124
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:44.280
Matt Huss III: And they went into default because I wasn't able to pay for them when I was out of school like I was back in school. By the time

125
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.680
Matt Huss III: They took my taxes so

126
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:57.090
Matt Huss III: I don't understand why they took it again this year because I've been in school for a year.

127
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:05.310
Matt Huss III: Now, right. So I, you know, which means I'm not, I don't have to pay student loans, while I'm still in school.

128
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

129
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:17.160
Matt Huss III: You know, they might be accumulating interest, but I don't actually have to pay monthly and they still took all my entire tax refund.

130
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do you owe back child support for your son.

131
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.380
Matt Huss III: Yes, but

132
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:35.850
Matt Huss III: That's hasn't been an issue. I was paying it for a long time. When I first got here and I was

133
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.650
Matt Huss III: Working and you know before I relapsed again.

134
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.200
Matt Huss III: Uh, but then

135
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:55.920
Matt Huss III: I wasn't able to and I talked to her and she's, she's pretty cool about that. I mean, she's not

136
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.440
Matt Huss III: cool about it, she's angry about it but

137
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.140
Matt Huss III: She kind of

138
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:10.080
Matt Huss III: She at least understands enough not to go to court and say,

139
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:22.440
Matt Huss III: You know, I haven't gone out support so and and I and they actually sent me a letter saying why they took the money and it was for student loans.

140
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.320
Matt Huss III: So I know what student loans.

141
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.870
Matt Huss III: Just crazy

142
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you gonna call them and dispute it.

143
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:49.080
Matt Huss III: Yeah. Well, yeah, but last time I did that it was, same thing. I tried to dispute it saying I'm in school. What the hell, and they're like, well, you can send a bunch of proof saying you actually need the money. And I'm like, okay, so I sent them a lease.

144
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:58.230
Matt Huss III: And a things saying that I was going to be evicted. If I didn't have the money, you know,

145
00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.160
Matt Huss III: Because a lot of that.

146
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:05.640
Matt Huss III: Money was supposed to be supposed to go to rent and everything.

147
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:13.020
Matt Huss III: You know, I gave them my I gave him a ton of proof that

148
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.180
Matt Huss III: Saying it was I needed the money and nothing ever came of it.

149
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:31.080
Matt Huss III: I called them. And I'm like, look, I send you this proof. What happened, she's like, Oh, it's too late now. I'm like, well, I sent you it like a month ago. Why the hell would you know

150
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.240
Matt Huss III: It was a nightmare and it's

151
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.460
Matt Huss III: You know,

152
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: IRS is a nightmare. Yes, it is.

153
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.030
Matt Huss III: Actually, it's not even them. It's, um, the

154
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:56.040
Matt Huss III: The company that has taken over my student loans company called Navi and

155
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.910
Matt Huss III: Yeah, yeah. You've heard of them.

156
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, yeah.

157
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.310
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

158
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.390
Matt Huss III: They're. They're horrible, horrible.

159
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you call them.

160
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.120
Yeah.

161
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:10.620
Yeah.

162
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.840
Matt Huss III: They don't care.

163
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they don't care. They want their money, that's for sure. But

164
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.390
Matt Huss III: To know them anything now that I'm back in school.

165
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.020
Matt Huss III: You know,

166
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So did you claim the $5,000 that you paid towards your student loans on your taxes for this year.

167
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.070
Matt Huss III: No, I totally did not think about that.

168
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:52.260
Matt Huss III: Even even if I did, they probably they would have taken the 2000 anyway because I, oh, I still owe 30 $40,000. You know, I don't know how much it is, it's like it's in between 20 and 40 somewhere around there.

169
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:53.700
Wow.

170
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they're my carrier, too.

171
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.010
Matt Huss III: Yeah. So are they

172
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:06.750
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I mean, and the fact that I'm going to school to become a teacher means that I'm basically going to be

173
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.670
Matt Huss III: Poor and paying off student loans for the rest of my life.

174
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:17.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it's my understanding that they're coming out with new programs that after you have

175
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:31.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A certain amount of time at that job that you're able to, like, and you're making payments on your student loans after a certain amount of time to wipe away the work. The rest of it.

176
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if I'm not mistaken, and I teach her is one of the

177
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Careers that you can do that with

178
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have to check into that but

179
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.220
Matt Huss III: That's that's

180
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:50.490
Matt Huss III: One of the biggest reasons why I'm such a huge supporter of

181
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.210
Matt Huss III: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

182
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why

183
00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.300
Matt Huss III: Because they want to wipe away. Everyone student loan debts.

184
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh God, please do.

185
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.580
Matt Huss III: But no, I didn't buy in is going to be the nominee, so

186
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.760
Matt Huss III: I Joe Biden.

187
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.460
Matt Huss III: Obama's Vice President.

188
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:23.940
Matt Huss III: Oh, he's going to end up getting the Democratic nominee against Trump for 2020 elections so doesn't matter. It's not gonna happen.

189
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:25.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

190
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:26.430
Students

191
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't keep up with

192
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.610
The politics.

193
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.890
Matt Huss III: Well, I do.

194
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:41.010
Matt Huss III: I go through phases I where I'm like, completely obsessed and I watch every day. But then it gets

195
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:55.350
Matt Huss III: It pisses me off so bad, where I'll listen to it in the morning, and I'll be in a bad mood, the entire day. So I'll go through phases where I'll stop and not pay any attention at all.

196
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:06.930
Matt Huss III: But with the elections coming up are you know paying attention, just because they all move to Canada. If Trump is

197
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.150
Matt Huss III: In office again.

198
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

199
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:23.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know what's gonna happen there definitely any, uh, how you, how have you been handling the stress around this.

200
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Virus that's going on.

201
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.340
Matt Huss III: It hasn't

202
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.140
Matt Huss III: Worried I haven't even been thinking about it. Honestly, I'm

203
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.440
Good.

204
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.590
Matt Huss III: Because you know yeah I don't want it, but

205
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.200
Matt Huss III: You know, it's

206
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.950
Matt Huss III: It's even if I get it. It's not gonna be, it's gonna be like

207
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.220
Matt Huss III: I'm not gonna die or

208
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.700
Matt Huss III: Be hospitalized or anything from it. You know, so I'm not too worried

209
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:08.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good. I've been getting mixed remarks on it worse. You know, it's really stressing some people out and other people are like, yeah.

210
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.270
Yeah.

211
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

212
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.150
Matt Huss III: And then the much so, where there's only like six cases.

213
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.770
Matt Huss III: I'm moving to somewhere where there's like hundreds of cases. I know.

214
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.760
Matt Huss III: People have died actually from it already, where I'm going.

215
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:26.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely.

216
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:33.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that it is just kind of like you just gotta wash your hands and make sure that you're careful and

217
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

218
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:35.610
Matt Huss III: That's what

219
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.230
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I've been trying to wash my hands as much as possible, but

220
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.390
Matt Huss III: That's, yeah, that's about it.

221
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:52.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So how's everything else been going on, you've been doing okay anxieties been okay you've just been you seem to be in a really good space right now.

222
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.050
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah yeah

223
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.340
Matt Huss III: I've been working all day. So that's probably why.

224
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:16.860
Matt Huss III: It's very hard for me to do any kind of physical activity because I mean even getting dressed like putting my shoes on bending over once my lower back feels like there's a knife in my spine.

225
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:32.910
Matt Huss III: For some don't know why, but it's been like that ever since I quit using and, you know, so any kind of physical labor. After five minutes. My back is in so much pain. It's unbelievable.

226
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.890
Matt Huss III: But if I'm forced to do it.

227
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:44.700
Matt Huss III: It's like exercising. It's like my it's I'm getting at least some exercise.

228
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.950
Matt Huss III: Yeah, rather than sitting, you know, in front of a computer or book.

229
00:20:52.170 --> 00:21:01.350
Matt Huss III: So I. It does. It does a lot of good for my mental state. Good, yeah.

230
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you ever had your back checked out.

231
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:18.510
Matt Huss III: Um, no. Not yet. Um, when I was in, you know, remember when you're when you're a kid in my middle school or something or high school. I don't remember was and they check you for scoliosis.

232
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:18.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

233
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:37.710
Matt Huss III: Well, they told me my spine was fine until it got to the very bottom. It goes like this and then like it makes a little s at the very bottom. So they said it wasn't much to work. It wasn't really anything to worry about flood. I think because of how badly. I've treated my body.

234
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:45.300
Matt Huss III: My whole life. I'm that now it's become an issue.

235
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:46.710
Matt Huss III: So,

236
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.640
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that's one of my things on my to do list.

237
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:59.730
Matt Huss III: Which has become fairly long what but I haven't been able to do any of it because of the house.

238
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:00.510
Right.

239
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:08.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It would be easier for you to haven't checked out there or to wait till you got to Florida and

240
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:21.210
Matt Huss III: It'd be better here the Medicaid is like 1000 times better here. It covers so much more. And like, like the Medicaid in Florida does not cover therapy.

241
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:28.470
Matt Huss III: Like it does here. It doesn't cover dental like it does here so much stuff.

242
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:35.220
Matt Huss III: So much better here. So I've been trying to get to the

243
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.750
Matt Huss III: The health department at you and. Mm.

244
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:40.470
Hmm.

245
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:47.430
Matt Huss III: To get checked out to get you know this. Get a primary care doctor and you get it checked out, but

246
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.040
Matt Huss III: I mean, it's

247
00:22:51.630 --> 00:23:00.930
Matt Huss III: He won't let me. He won't stay at you and me an extra hour to because we got to get home and do the house, so it's

248
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:15.570
Matt Huss III: You know, but I'm, I'm hoping tomorrow I'll be able to stay a little late after class. Even if I take the bus again. That's what I'll do.

249
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:22.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, just to get checked out. I mean, if you've got that great a medical right now and you're not going to have it when you hit to Florida.

250
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I want to be able to have some kind of diagnosis.

251
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of issues in your back. You know what I mean.

252
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:36.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. You know what that what's going on. And when you get to Florida, whatever doctor that you get in Florida will

253
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He'll. He'll he won't have to go through all the testing and all that stuff.

254
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

255
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:56.490
Matt Huss III: Um, yeah, I was kind of ignoring it thinking maybe it was just a recovery thing you know that you know my muscles in my body are just kind of

256
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.750
Matt Huss III: You know, recovering rebuilding itself.

257
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:08.400
Matt Huss III: But the pain is so bad. And it and I get it from the like.

258
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:17.370
Matt Huss III: Bending over two or three times, literally, and I've and there's like a knife in my back. So

259
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.420
Matt Huss III: I've decided recently to get it checked some

260
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:22.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

261
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get a checking try to you know get that piece under your belt before you make your move.

262
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And right you know nowadays you know they don't give pain meds.

263
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They get, you know, that is alternative stuff that they do.

264
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.860
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I couldn't accept

265
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:50.550
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I couldn't go to one of those pain management places that would destroy my

266
00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.690
Matt Huss III: Well, I mean,

267
00:24:55.770 --> 00:25:17.520
Matt Huss III: My addiction says, yeah, go to one of those places. So you're prescribed the, you know, an opiate the rest of your life, you know, but I don't you know I don't like the person I am, even if I have access to them legally and, you know, for free. The rest of my life. It's still changes my personality.

268
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure. And they don't do payments anymore.

269
00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:28.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They do alternative things even pain management Center's pain management doctors

270
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and I know here in

271
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: California, that's

272
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:38.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's not even an option that's not even considered it's about finding

273
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:47.820
Matt Huss III: California is very progressive and good state delivered and you know out here. It's flooded with

274
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:56.370
Matt Huss III: It's actually math nowadays, everybody's everybody's hooked on methamphetamines

275
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.530
Matt Huss III: But anyways,

276
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.470
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

277
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.610
Matt Huss III: Yeah, it's bad in Florida to. Yeah.

278
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long do you have

279
00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.070
Matt Huss III: A I don't keep track

280
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.830
Matt Huss III: But it's eight months to a year.

281
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:24.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's probably and you're on how many milligrams of Suboxone are you want

282
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.990
Matt Huss III: Each one is for

283
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.880
Matt Huss III: 8080 so

284
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.380
Matt Huss III: God

285
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.510
Matt Huss III: Can do math right now.

286
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.560
Matt Huss III: Then

287
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.260
Matt Huss III: Okay three, three films a day.

288
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:56.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. And the reason why I asked is, because it's definitely a medication that they use for pain management, too.

289
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, it just, I'm curious.

290
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you

291
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.920
Matt Huss III: Not held my back.

292
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, if you're still having you know that much issue. So, um,

293
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. What it would

294
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.740
Be like without them.

295
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I encourage you to get it checked out and see what's going on, you know,

296
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do the best that he can to try to make it happen before you leave. So you're covered

297
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you don't have to worry about it.

298
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. I would

299
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then what are you going to do about

300
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting connected with this box and Dr. In and

301
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.470
Matt Huss III: I, I was, I was hoping to just

302
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.310
Matt Huss III: Stay with this program. Um, and

303
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.700
Matt Huss III: I know the doctor that I have now.

304
00:27:51.720 --> 00:28:00.780
Matt Huss III: I know he he is not able to prescribe in Florida, but he did say to check with the

305
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.500
Matt Huss III: Admissions the administrative people

306
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

307
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:14.280
Matt Huss III: To see if it's possible, but I don't know if it is because I remember when I was the first time I was on Suboxone

308
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:35.880
Matt Huss III: I was not made to do therapy or groups, I would just go to a doctor's office, he would prescribe me a month's worth of Suboxone and then that's it. I would just see him once a month and get my Suboxone

309
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.670
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so I hope it's not like that. Still, but

310
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:51.750
Matt Huss III: You know, if it is, then I'll just have to find hope maybe maybe me and you can continue. Can you, are you able to

311
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.940
Matt Huss III: Do therapy with people in Florida.

312
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:03.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I actually am I am certified in California and Washington and an Oregon.

313
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:15.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are the States that I'm certified in I was trying to go and see an impulse if let me look really fast and see if I can see where we're at with

314
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Contracts as far as that goes.

315
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I found a place that I can look

316
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For the states to see

317
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You

318
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:41.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See

319
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know they're working diligently on getting us certified in several different states. So, yeah.

320
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.020
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I'm surprised they haven't done it for every state this this program is awesome.

321
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, we're in the process, we don't have it yet.

322
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.230
Matt Huss III: For Florida.

323
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but it's definitely

324
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the works.

325
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:21.810
Matt Huss III: And do you have any idea of what that means. As far as a timeframe.

326
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't, I don't know how long they've been in the process of it.

327
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:28.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But it

328
00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:35.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It looks like they, you know, have actually got 1234 different insurance companies that they're working with

329
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, right now with the state. So I'm hoping that it doesn't

330
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:48.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: take too long. But just remember, you know, you want to make sure that you have that in place when you get there. So you want to

331
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Find somebody

332
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.620
Matt Huss III: That's, that's, yeah, that's the issue. I'm

333
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.960
Matt Huss III: I was worried about that. If you guys weren't able to see me in Florida that

334
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.010
Matt Huss III: You know, because you only prescribe they only prescribed me a week's worth of

335
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:20.160
Matt Huss III: Medication that you know that doesn't. And it's hard to see. I don't know how long it's going to take to first to see a doctor Suboxone doctor

336
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.470
Matt Huss III: For the first time,

337
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:28.230
Matt Huss III: And that stride, the medication because I know most

338
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.310
Matt Huss III: Of the program. I was in before you guys

339
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.170
Matt Huss III: They had to see me like

340
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:43.410
Matt Huss III: Two or three times before they would actually give me Suboxone so I was a wreck. By the time I finally got it, but

341
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:45.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You go, you're moving to Jacksonville.

342
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:56.400
Matt Huss III: Right, just south of Jacksonville St. Augustine. Okay. Well, the whatever apartment we get might be in like

343
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.060
Matt Huss III: Southern Jacksonville. So, but

344
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:01.950
Matt Huss III: I don't know.

345
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know right now.

346
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.980
Matt Huss III: Right away, it's going to be St. Augustine.

347
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:14.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, well, there's Suboxone clinics down there so

348
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.530
Matt Huss III: Oh, there's clinics now.

349
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:25.230
Matt Huss III: Yeah, because there wasn't. When I first was when I was on it years ago it was just, it was just a doctor and I had to go see

350
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.900
Matt Huss III: Okay, so that's good.

351
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.300
Matt Huss III: The problem is I really hope the Medicaid covers it down there.

352
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.830
Matt Huss III: Because I remember it being very expensive. When I was on it.

353
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:46.200
Matt Huss III: Back then, it was, it was so expensive to buy the because it was before generics came out.

354
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.210
Matt Huss III: Yeah, um,

355
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:55.200
Matt Huss III: And it was crazy expensive to buy a month's worth of Suboxone yeah

356
00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I'm hoping you know that you're right.

357
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Come on.

358
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: See, go back

359
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's one in Jacksonville.

360
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There's one in Orlando.

361
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.420
Matt Huss III: Was too far.

362
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

363
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: North Florida.

364
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

365
00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:32.070
Matt Huss III: Now, it would have to be like Jacksonville.

366
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:50.460
Matt Huss III: Because they're good. If it's a clinic, they're going to make me come in probably once or twice a week. Well, I'm going to want to go at least once a week to see a therapist if they don't make me. I'm going to go once a week. So it has to be, you know, plaque a

367
00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.810
Matt Huss III: Jacksonville, or, you know,

368
00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:04.020
Matt Huss III: A palm coast south. I'm thinking, you know, north, south, that's as far as I would be able to go

369
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: North I've tried to look this one.

370
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.620
Matt Huss III: Jacksonville's gotta have one

371
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Jacksonville does have one

372
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:17.970
Matt Huss III: I got

373
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:30.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just, I got a look. I have to download an Adobe player or something in order to open it. But Jacksonville Suboxone Dr. Jackson bills doctor Suboxone dr.com

374
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.220
Matt Huss III: Oh,

375
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it wants me to update my latest

376
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Player or something. Yeah.

377
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.300
Yeah.

378
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:46.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

379
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:53.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's okay. Um, but check into it and see, you know, but try to get that is set in place before

380
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, before you

381
00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do the move, so that you're not

382
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.680
Matt Huss III: Plan on it.

383
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:12.870
Matt Huss III: Does yeah yeah if I if I don't have it. The first thing I'm going to do is try to is relapse. The ad just out of pure sickness, you know,

384
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure, yeah.

385
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.140
Matt Huss III: Hopefully I don't you know but

386
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.640
Matt Huss III: Yeah, depending on how organ is

387
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:30.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When and talk to your doctor that's prescribing for you with through us about giving you enough to last for a couple weeks or a month.

388
00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:31.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I was

389
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.390
Matt Huss III: I was planning on doing that too.

390
00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:39.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good that we keep yourself secure and safe down there. Yeah, no.

391
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.200
Matt Huss III: That's what I was, I was hoping he'd give me a month at least

392
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:50.550
Matt Huss III: To just to be sure to make sure that I, you know, get in to see a doctor.

393
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:57.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, if you call ahead of time and ask them what the wait time is to get in to see the doctor.

394
00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.580
Matt Huss III: Yeah, that yeah that's I'll do that too. Yeah.

395
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And get an appointment.

396
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.670
Matt Huss III: Yeah, you said, think for a minute before I even leave. Yeah.

397
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep. Couple months ahead of time. And that way, it's in place.

398
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:14.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then the doctor, you know, when you tell the doctor that I've already got an appointment, but it's not until

399
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your time

400
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Then he knows that.

401
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:19.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you're trying to

402
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Transfer services and progress and stay sober.

403
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.080
Matt Huss III: That's true.

404
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely something to think about. Yeah.

405
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.270
Matt Huss III: Definitely, I will

406
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How do you think everything's going with your with school

407
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:47.250
Matt Huss III: I'm not as well as I would like it to be, because I'm so used to it being so easy.

408
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:57.390
Matt Huss III: And getting just straight A's without even trying that. Now all of a sudden, I'm in classes that are meant for grad students basically

409
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.670
Matt Huss III: Mm hmm. I'm in like 500 classes, instead of 200 classes.

410
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:12.510
Matt Huss III: And it's, yeah, it's, it's difficult for me to accept the fact that I'm not

411
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.540
Matt Huss III: I might not get straight A's.

412
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:25.590
Matt Huss III: The first time ever, you know, and that might be, you know, arrogant or egotistical or my ego, you know, but still it's

413
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:50.970
Matt Huss III: It's gonna be tough to deal with that. Um, and, and the fact that there's so much work that I don't have the time that I usually do to put into each paper or project. So none of them come out as good as I'm, I'm a real perfectionist when it comes to anything that I right

414
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:57.960
Matt Huss III: Yeah, so when I have to hand something in that I'm not happy with. It's just it drives me crazy.

415
00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.480
Matt Huss III: It really yeah really gets to me.

416
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, getting to the point where you realize that these get degrees.

417
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:07.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

418
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.490
Yeah.

419
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.500
Matt Huss III: When you're applying for a job.

420
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.760
Matt Huss III: He say say you have masters and you're applying for a

421
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:32.160
Matt Huss III: Teaching job at us. You can't teach at a university but with a master's I think you can teach it like community colleges state colleges or even or even at a high school

422
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:39.420
Matt Huss III: They just look at the fact that you have a degree, not your grades or GPA, do they

423
00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, and

424
00:38:43.560 --> 00:39:02.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think that they do. I just think that it's certain like credentialing agencies want in an open transcript and even a transcript just gives them the grades, the classes you know how many units you got out of each class and the grades in the class.

425
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:07.800
Matt Huss III: I want, hopefully. Hopefully it doesn't show how many times I've withdrawn.

426
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:09.570
Matt Huss III: drop out.

427
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:20.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It actually doesn't. I don't transcript doesn't show any of that. It just shows the classes that you completed the amount of credits you got for the classes and good grades.

428
00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:27.030
Matt Huss III: That they're going to be like, why did it take you 15 different schools to get

429
00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:30.480
Matt Huss III: Degree.

430
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because I just wasn't happy until I found the right one.

431
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:35.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

432
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:48.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's really it, you know, you do have to kind of go through a few until you find the one that you feel the most comfortable in. And the, the, you know, get into the pace of the work. So you're alone.

433
00:39:50.400 --> 00:40:01.230
Matt Huss III: You and m is actually the perfect school for me for what I want to do, because every other university in the country. They all

434
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:15.420
Matt Huss III: Focus on analytical philosophy and which is American philosophy, basically, but I hate American philosophy analytic philosophy I

435
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.830
Matt Huss III: Am way more educated in and

436
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.370
Matt Huss III: Read, read,

437
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.830
Matt Huss III: Well, read

438
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:35.400
Matt Huss III: I guess is the word in European continental philosophy and

439
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:40.140
Matt Huss III: when m is actually the only university basically in the country that

440
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:54.330
Matt Huss III: Focuses on continental and European philosophy, instead of American analytical philosophy. So, um, that's one

441
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.080
Matt Huss III: Thing that I'm not

442
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.310
Matt Huss III: Happy about moving but

443
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:04.830
Matt Huss III: We'll see.

444
00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How much longer do you got before you graduate.

445
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.700
Matt Huss III: A while I got like

446
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.040
Matt Huss III: I'm

447
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:28.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now you froze.

448
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:30.960
Matt Huss III: There.

449
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:32.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, I'm here.

450
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.420
Matt Huss III: Okay. Yeah, you were frozen. I thought maybe it was you.

451
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.240
Matt Huss III: Okay, let me try.

452
00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.170
Matt Huss III: Okay, is that okay um

453
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.860
Matt Huss III: What else

454
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.420
Matt Huss III: You did you ask me something.

455
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before I said, How much longer do

456
00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:54.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have

457
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:55.020
Oh, yeah.

458
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.420
Matt Huss III: I got about a year from my bachelor's and my master's is going to take another you know

459
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:17.460
Matt Huss III: Two or three years and my PhD will take two to four years, you know, depending on and that's like if I do everything that's like, if I take five courses a semester.

460
00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:18.210
Matt Huss III: And

461
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:36.240
Matt Huss III: Do everything perfectly which won't happen you know so and I'm actually a double major because literally somebody has to die to become you know to get a philosophy teaching job.

462
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.120
Matt Huss III: So double majoring in literature English as well.

463
00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:42.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you need

464
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:50.910
Matt Huss III: I to keep my career options open. Like if I can't find a philosophy teaching job.

465
00:42:52.410 --> 00:43:03.120
Matt Huss III: I could find English or literature teaching job and worst case scenario I can teach English at a high school until something opens up, you know,

466
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but

467
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:15.480
Matt Huss III: That's still yeah yeah with everything I have in my life. I can only take three classes at a time, Max.

468
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:25.260
Matt Huss III: So you know that every degree is going to take twice as long as it should.

469
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:27.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can't you

470
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:29.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do it online.

471
00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.400
Matt Huss III: I yes but

472
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.750
Matt Huss III: Um,

473
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:46.140
Matt Huss III: I think I tried once one time and I withdrew like right away and I just I just know I am not disciplined enough

474
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.290
Matt Huss III: For I procrastinate too much.

475
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:49.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Uh huh.

476
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.510
Matt Huss III: For an online course.

477
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.610
Matt Huss III: And I, and I enjoy

478
00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:02.370
Matt Huss III: And I would go nuts. If I was in the house 24 seven, you know, the school gives me a reason to

479
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.440
Matt Huss III: Get out and

480
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.020
Matt Huss III: You know,

481
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:18.990
Matt Huss III: So I really enjoy classes, you know, and the lectures and being able to ask questions and just and discussions, a lot of philosophy courses.

482
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:24.240
Matt Huss III: At the higher levels are much more discussion.

483
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, me.

484
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:32.490
Matt Huss III: The students, then they are like the lower level classes which are just lecture.

485
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:38.430
Matt Huss III: So yeah, so I don't want to do the online thing.

486
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah definitely takes a lot of self discipline as

487
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.630
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah and I and which I yeah I don't have

488
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:51.960
Matt Huss III: It's gotten better since I've been getting it is getting better.

489
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:57.600
Matt Huss III: The longer I'm clean, the better it gets. But

490
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.980
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I still wouldn't trust myself with that.

491
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:14.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, um, it's not for everybody. Not everybody can do it because it is tough. And you do have to be very disciplined.

492
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely and procrastination does not

493
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:29.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Work it just does not work. It just adds another level of stress. That is just not okay you know

494
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:40.110
Matt Huss III: Oh, this is actually pretty funny. One of my courses this year. It's like the only course I've ever had to deal with this before actually uses

495
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.340
Matt Huss III: Something called you and M learn

496
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is

497
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.940
Matt Huss III: Like where you submit your papers online.

498
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:55.020
Matt Huss III: And you're all your notes are online and stuff like that and

499
00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:04.080
Matt Huss III: I submitted just a picture for her one of my essays instead of actual essay

500
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:05.820
Matt Huss III: So,

501
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.160
Matt Huss III: He came to me. He's like,

502
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.170
Matt Huss III: Why

503
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.860
Matt Huss III: So I

504
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:15.960
Matt Huss III: Deal with that.

505
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:17.880
Matt Huss III: But

506
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they don't want pictures. They want the actual paper.

507
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:21.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Upload it

508
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, get it in there.

509
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.620
Matt Huss III: That won't change it. Once I submitted it, and I floated it

510
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.630
Matt Huss III: It wouldn't let me think so.

511
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.660
Matt Huss III: Look ended up getting a picture.

512
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:35.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my gosh.

513
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What did you do, did you wind up hand delivering it into him or

514
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.940
Matt Huss III: Um no I am he. Let me email it in

515
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.250
Matt Huss III: To him so

516
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:49.080
Matt Huss III: You know, okay.

517
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:54.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, yeah, definitely the picture would mark.

518
00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:03.510
Matt Huss III: It was a dumb picture to we're probably would have liked to see their face.

519
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:06.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my cup.

520
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.110

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Are you planning on going on any more dates.

535
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.480
Matt Huss III: This I talked to this one girl and she said maybe Saturday.

536
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.980
Matt Huss III: So we'll see if she sticks with that.

537
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.280
Matt Huss III: But she's like

538
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:42.120
Matt Huss III: It's very strange like. She'll. She'll disappear, but then all of a sudden text me. I don't know what her after like only though, so we'll see.

539
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:50.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think it's pretty. I think it's good that you're, you know, getting out and you're dating. You know what I mean I'm putting yourself out there a little bit.

540
00:48:50.940 --> 00:49:07.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that you need that. You know what I mean. You need those things, those connections and so despite being nervous and hit your anxiety being raised, you're still doing, you know what I mean, you're still doing it, which is awesome. I just want to tell you

541
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:21.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, because you got a life to live, you know, outside of your addiction outside of recovery. You know what I mean, you've got outside of school. You know what I mean, you've got all these things that

542
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:29.550
Matt Huss III: You know, so I feel like, Yeah, I feel like I'm in my own little prison, you know, without bars.

543
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:30.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

544
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:46.740
Matt Huss III: You know, it's like school home and you know therapy and group and pharmacy and you know that's you know my desk, my, my desk. My work desk.

545
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.720
Matt Huss III: School for just for classes, not for any other reason.

546
00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:55.680
Matt Huss III: And then

547
00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:10.800
Matt Huss III: I I lay down in bed like my whole life. I've always laid down in bed like an hour or so before going to bed to watch TV or better. Relax. Sure.

548
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.620
Matt Huss III: Since I've gotten clean

549
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:21.270
Matt Huss III: Um, I basically fall asleep. As soon as I hit the pillow. So I don't do that even anymore.

550
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:33.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you think about it, you know, your life is really busy right now you're very active and your body. The minute he hits the bed is like no

551
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're done. Yeah.

552
00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:39.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely. So you're going to possibly

553
00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:44.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go out on another date, you're going to continue the the

554
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: getting the house ready and you're going to do two papers.

555
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: By the end of spring break.

556
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.440
Matt Huss III: Oh, and I tried

557
00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.540
Matt Huss III: I'm eating today, like in the middle of the day.

558
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:07.620
Matt Huss III: And again I as soon as and it was very there was no carbs.

559
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:20.220
Matt Huss III: And like literally five minutes after five minutes after I hated I like didn't want to do anything. I was done for what

560
00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.190
Matt Huss III: It was ice cream.

561
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:30.000
Matt Huss III: Yeah so wasn't healthy, but still, um,

562
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:37.800
Matt Huss III: It's, it's crazy i every time I eat something, it's I cannot do anything afterwards.

563
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:39.270
Try

564
00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Fruits and vegetables.

565
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:49.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, try blueberries are really good. They have a lot of antioxidants in it, strawberries, grapes, you know,

566
00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:57.450
Matt Huss III: Yeah yeah he creates a lot. I love strawberries and peaches and watermelon and

567
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:08.760
Matt Huss III: Blueberries. But no matter where you are, they're so expensive and New Mexico. The fruit is terrible.

568
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:14.550
Matt Huss III: Is it out here in here. Yeah, out here in New Mexico. It is also bad

569
00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:17.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about like a

570
00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like a shake or a not shake. But like a protein shake or

571
00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.620
Matt Huss III: Drop down

572
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the

573
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:35.280
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I've tried those and they work really well. But again, they're just way too expensive because my food stamps won't cover them.

574
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:40.230
Matt Huss III: My food stamps covers the fruit but

575
00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.340
Matt Huss III: It's gone in a week, you know, and

576
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:50.550
Matt Huss III: They don't cover the shakes and the shakes are like five, six bucks apiece.

577
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:52.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What about if you got like

578
00:52:53.310 --> 00:53:03.360
Matt Huss III: It's, it's, like it's they wonder why America has an obesity problem and it's because it's you know it's expensive to eat healthy.

579
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:07.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Healthy. Yeah, it really, really, it is. You're right. And I know it.

580
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But there's frozen fruit too.

581
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:11.640
Matt Huss III: Yeah.

582
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can buy a bag of frozen fruit mix frozen fruit.

583
00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:17.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And put it pop it in your blender.

584
00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.280
Matt Huss III: Yeah. Oh, that's, that's an idea.

585
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:27.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And make your own make your own. You know what I mean. And that way, you're still getting the the nutrition.

586
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:29.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know what I mean.

587
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's not costing you an arm and a leg your food stamps will buy it.

588
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:43.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But next time you go to the grocery store look in the. Now I know that I can buy it here. I don't know about New Mexico. I'm sure that you can but

589
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:44.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Look and see

590
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If it's something that's

591
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know I'm available like they'll have frozen. Blueberries and strawberries mixed berries big

592
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

593
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:55.260
Mixed together.

594
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:56.700
Matt Huss III: Do you

595
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:01.170
Matt Huss III: Like do you add milk in it or anything or

596
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.440
Matt Huss III: Do you just put the food in and mix it up.

597
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:07.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Either or you can actually make like

598
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:15.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ice cream like that, by the way, by mixing it up in the blender and then putting it back in the freezer. Then you got yourself fried ice cream and it's totally healthy. You know what I mean.

599
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:23.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But with to drink a shake. You want to put maybe a little bit of milk in there to kind of

600
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:24.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can own

601
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:29.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A little bit of water. I'm sure a little bit of milk would taste better, a little bit of water would be okay to

602
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.900
Matt Huss III: I'm sorry to ask you, I can look this up and figure it out.

603
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:42.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, it's okay, it's alright. Because you want to do things healthy that are within your budget. Right. And that's the hard part. It is, it is very expensive.

604
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:52.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To try to eat healthy. It just is. I don't know why it's easier to go through the Taco Bell and get $1 taco than what it is to, you know, go get an orange or

605
00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.240
Matt Huss III: Yeah, I mean,

606
00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:00.360
Matt Huss III: I've been eating waffles and cereal, you know, and

607
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:07.290
Matt Huss III: Yeah, just because I can't afford anything else but

608
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:20.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just check into it, check and see if it's something that it's doable for you. If it's not, then we'll evaluate it. And another way. But, you know, you want to just try to get some of that some healthy into and how are you drinking water.

609
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.150
Matt Huss III: I'm not

610
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:28.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

611
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:30.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's another piece of it to

612
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, the more water. Water you put in your body. The more you know we're made of water so

613
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:41.070
Matt Huss III: And I, and it would get rid of these headaches and I'm constantly getting too because of it.

614
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:43.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You drink lots of caffeine.

615
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:47.430
Matt Huss III: Yeah, oh yeah, very, very, yeah. Lot of caffeine.

616
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:51.630
Matt Huss III: I mean, so the five hours on top of soda. Yeah.

617
00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:57.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so you got to give your body and they take away the moisture. Right.

618
00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:59.970
Matt Huss III: Oh, it does.

619
00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:03.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you want to do is, yeah.

620
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.560
Matt Huss III: Because it's weird because

621
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.310
Matt Huss III: Caffeine actually helps my headaches.

622
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:18.840
Matt Huss III: Like when I went to the hospital for a migraine. It was so bad, one time and all they did was hooked me up to a

623
00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:26.880
Matt Huss III: What do they call they put a needle in my arm and hook me up to a bag of

624
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:34.200
Matt Huss III: Caffeine basically it was just the water and caffeine in my head had a

625
00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:45.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: major headache. Go away. And that's part of the cycle of caffeine is like the more that you drink it. You start drinking it on daily basis.

626
00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then your body needs it.

627
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:50.130
Matt Huss III: Oh yeah, I'm totally addicted to caffeine, that's for sure.

628
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:50.760
You know,

629
00:56:52.110 --> 00:57:06.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you replace one one soda with a bottle of water and the next week, replace two cans of soda with a bottle of water. You know what I mean. But just like slowly wean yourself down a little bit. You copy is fine in moderation, but

630
00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:07.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

631
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:10.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely I learned that the hard way with Red Bull.

632
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:13.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, without

633
00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:14.940
Matt Huss III: If I, if I don't have

634
00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:30.780
Matt Huss III: enough caffeine. Um, yeah, it'll give me within a within if I don't have enough caffeine within a certain amount of time, I'll get a headache, no matter what. Yeah, the total addiction to it.

635
00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.170
Yeah.

636
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I got it kind of weighing yourself down a little bit, add more water.

637
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.470
Matt Huss III: You know, and I mean a little bit at a time.

638
00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that should help with that.

639
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:46.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's how I personally quit drink. I don't drink soda anymore. I used to. I used to be a Dr. Pepper. Fool, fool.

640
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:47.610
Matt Huss III: I, you know,

641
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:53.850
Matt Huss III: I stopped for a long time, actually, and

642
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:56.400
Matt Huss III: I'm, um,

643
00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:05.820
Matt Huss III: And I and and I had one soda. I couldn't, I couldn't go anymore. I needed one and it tastes.

644
00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.110
Matt Huss III: So good. That was it.

645
00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.180
Matt Huss III: That

646
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's exactly what happened. And yeah, try to add some water into your diet to, you know,

647
00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Help, help as well help alleviate those headaches, a little bit.

648
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So next week I'm going to hear because you're going to be here next week. Right.

649
