2
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.120
Michael Bryans: Hi.

3
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.120
Dr. Ogawa: Hi, how are you

4
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.110
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, okay, okay, good. Okay, well, nice to meet you.

5
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.600
Dr. Ogawa: Call from right heart. And so if this is your first appointment right with a provider.

6
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.860
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, welcome. And so, um, tell me about yourself. Tell me why you're here.

7
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.660
Michael Bryans: To get clean

8
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.550
Dr. Ogawa: Sounds good.

9
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.360
Yeah.

10
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.850
Michael Bryans: Pretty good reason. Right.

11
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.950
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, for sure.

12
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.410
Dr. Ogawa: Um, I guess. Tell me, like, is there some reason that you decided you wanted to get clean

13
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.450
Dr. Ogawa: At this particular time.

14
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:38.220
Michael Bryans: I wanted to be clean before I am like I've never gotten in trouble and like been forced to do it. I just, I went to a methadone clinic, but it was hard with my hours at work and this seemed like a more feasible option actually be successful.

15
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.600
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. For most people, it does end up being a lot easier because you don't have to go to the clinic every day.

16
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.660
Dr. Ogawa: Medicine anymore. Yeah.

17
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.470
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. And have you ever what what do you know about buprenorphine.

18
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.080
Dr. Ogawa: Suboxone ending

19
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.930
Michael Bryans: That when I went to the clinic.

20
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.410
Michael Bryans: The lady who initially set me up was a nurse and she said Suboxone she thought worked a lot better.

21
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.260
Michael Bryans: That the way it works is it only blocks half the receptors.

22
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:28.350
Michael Bryans: I kind of forget at this point. It was a long time ago, but she spoke about it highly it's just with my insurance. It was just the first thing I found, honestly, I was like, okay, whatever it's better than nothing.

23
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:38.910
Michael Bryans: Yeah, the hours were hard and then with the coven thing going on. Like it was it was even worse. I just, I couldn't get there on time.

24
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.320
Michael Bryans: Or I couldn't get to work on.

25
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.400
Michael Bryans: Time. If I wanted to go

26
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.460
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, sure. Um, yeah, so that's pretty that's true for a lot of people. Everybody's a little different but

27
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.530
Dr. Ogawa: Suboxone can work a lot

28
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.980
Dr. Ogawa: Better just because people tolerate it better and you know it's easier to access

29
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.680
Dr. Ogawa: It, we do call it a partial agonist because it

30
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.230
Dr. Ogawa: Is the same receptors. Yeah, same receptors as

31
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.820
Dr. Ogawa: You know what your brain feels like as the receptors for Herrmann pain medicines, things like that.

32
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.740
Dr. Ogawa: And they bind actually really strongly to those receptors so that other things can't really use them.

33
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:39.480
Dr. Ogawa: But it kind of blocks the part where you tend to get the worst side effects from them. So not you don't end up nodding off. Like methadone and

34
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.340
Dr. Ogawa: lower risk.

35
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.600
Dr. Ogawa: Of yeah respiratory problems stopping breathing.

36
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.600
Dr. Ogawa: People tend to do a lot better with that.

37
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.520
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah.

38
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.290
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. Have you ever done something like it before.

39
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:07.680
Michael Bryans: Um, before I did heroin. I was going to a pain clinic for my back and at the end he gave me a buprenorphine patch.

40
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.880
Michael Bryans: And it wasn't working. I put on two of them.

41
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.050
Dr. Ogawa: And then he wrote

42
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.140
Michael Bryans: A program. He didn't like set me up at all. And that's actually why I went to heroin is because I went from having something to nothing.

43
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.100
And it was

44
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.050
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, so it didn't work for pain, but you didn't have any side effects. It sounds like

45
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.740
Um,

46
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.900
Michael Bryans: Yeah.

47
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.470
Michael Bryans: Years ago.

48
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:45.900
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. Okay. Sounds good. And so, okay, well, let me ask you a couple more questions. So what is it that you're trying to get clean from

49
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.440
Dr. Ogawa: Heroin heroin and how do you use your house.

50
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.810
Michael Bryans: No.

51
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.540
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, do you ever use it any other way.

52
00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.570
Michael Bryans: No, I've never slammed it or anything like that. I'm not scared of needles, but I'm scared of using them like that.

53
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.000
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, um, do you use any other substances.

54
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.530
Dr. Ogawa: Smoking

55
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.090
Michael Bryans: Cigarettes.

56
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.920
Michael Bryans: I smoke cigarettes. I don't drink, though.

57
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.950
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, how many cigarettes a day do you smoke.

58
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.200
Michael Bryans: Like five

59
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.940
Dr. Ogawa: Okay.

60
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.260
Dr. Ogawa: And maybe at some point we can work on that to

61
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.000
Michael Bryans: Get a prescription for Chantix I'd be down. I had it once and it worked. Amazing.

62
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.070
Michael Bryans: But I never description.

63
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:41.640
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, I think that's definitely an option in the future we'll probably start with the heroin part. But yeah, I think we can definitely do change in the future.

64
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.220
Dr. Ogawa: All right, and how much heroin, do you usually use in a day.

65
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.340
Michael Bryans: Well, we have to have to hold gram a day.

66
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.200
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. And have you needed to use more and more overtime.

67
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.850
Michael Bryans: Oh yeah, when I first did it, it was like barely any and then it slowly ramped up

68
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.920
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, and and

69
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.370
Dr. Ogawa: When was the last time you use

70
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.690
Michael Bryans: This morning

71
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.580
I'd be saying

72
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.620
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, how long can you usually go until you start feeling

73
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.510
Michael Bryans: Like eight hours.

74
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.240
Dr. Ogawa: And then how do you start feeling

75
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.680
Sweaty

76
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.880
Michael Bryans: Certain pain in my hips and back.

77
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.490
Michael Bryans: really anxious

78
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.540
Michael Bryans: Just feel like total crap.

79
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.050
Dr. Ogawa: How long can usually go for until you have to use again.

80
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.130
Michael Bryans: Usually I try to get some before I get to that point.

81
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.580
Dr. Ogawa: So like less than eight hours. That sounds like

82
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.290
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah okay um and

83
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.250
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. Because, so how we start you on it and do have to go through withdrawals.

84
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.450
Michael Bryans: I know I

85
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.350
Dr. Ogawa: Started

86
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.830
Michael Bryans: I know if you do it before that you'll get really sick.

87
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:20.790
Dr. Ogawa: Exactly. Yeah. And so you are going to probably feel pretty bad. Unfortunately, when you do start. But the good news is that when you start the medication, we should start feeling better.

88
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.230
Michael Bryans: Cool, cool.

89
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.480
Dr. Ogawa: And so you just have to be ready for that. Sorry, just like okay

90
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.560
Michael Bryans: No worries.

91
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.340
Michael Bryans: I know it's gonna be rough. But it's all for the best.

92
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.200
Dr. Ogawa: Yes. Yeah. And once you can get through the hardest part which is like the first day or two, then you should start feeling better and better.

93
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:47.580
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. Yes. You have to be ready and all right. Have you ever had an overdose.

94
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.950
Dr. Ogawa: Nope. Nope. Good. Good. And have you ever heard of, nor can

Michael Bryans: I know, nor can is, yes, I went to him to school a long time ago.

96
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.060
Dr. Ogawa: Oh really. OK, so maybe even used it.

97
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.920
Michael Bryans: I didn't have to use it.

98
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.800
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, good. Do you have some

99
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.530
Michael Bryans: My girlfriend actually does.

100
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.020
Dr. Ogawa: Perfect. Does she know how to use it.

101
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.300
Michael Bryans: No.

102
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.250
Michael Bryans: All over YouTube it

103
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.260
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. Um, well, I was gonna offer prescribing some for you. Do you need another tour, you

104
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.170
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, absolutely. And

105
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.850
Dr. Ogawa: And hopefully you never have to

106
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.720
Dr. Ogawa: Use it.

107
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.010
Dr. Ogawa: It'd be great if you can let your girlfriend know to that.

108
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.540
Dr. Ogawa: You have another one available because if you need it. She's going to use it on you.

109
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.710
Dr. Ogawa: Will probably give you the nasal spray version.

110
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:55.530
Dr. Ogawa: For the other thing is, sometimes people will accidentally get into your medication. And then, so you'll have to use it on

111
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:04.980
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, yeah. So, um, you know, and we never know. People morphine tends to have less side effects and other things that you never know.

112
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.770
Dr. Ogawa: Just have it around. Okay.

113
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.610
Sure.

Michael Bryans: Like seasonal allergies.

156
00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.480
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, and

157
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:06.300
Dr. Ogawa: Be I doubt that this will happen. Since charities in here. Let's be careful because that combination can make you a little too drowsy sometimes

158
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.310
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. And have you ever had any surgeries.

159
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.050
Michael Bryans: collarbone ones, but no surgeries.

160
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.450
Dr. Ogawa: And just healed over time.

161
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.010
Michael Bryans: Yeah, pull it back.

162
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:30.120
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. All right, how about any other medical problems that that I need to know about.

163
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.610
Dr. Ogawa: Real okay

164
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.780
Dr. Ogawa: Very healthy

165
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.450
Dr. Ogawa: Good and

166
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:56.220
Dr. Ogawa: I think most of the questions I have for you. And so if it's if it's heroin that you're using, we usually say going to take about 12 hours from your last use for it to get completely out of your system.

167
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.120
Dr. Ogawa: Everybody's a little bit different but that's generally about

168
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:14.220
Dr. Ogawa: Timeframe and you should start having withdrawal symptoms. A lot of fun. And that's actually what we want in order to know that it's time for you to take that locks on

169
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.790
Dr. Ogawa: Oxygen peep in our feet are the same thing, but

170
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.790
Michael Bryans: A friend who took it too early and got sicker than

171
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.590
Dr. Ogawa: Exactly, yeah.

172
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:29.250
Dr. Ogawa: Exactly. Because the medicine. If you still have heroin in you. It's going to kick care when off.

173
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.350
Dr. Ogawa: Their brains. Yeah.

174
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.450
Dr. Ogawa: Exactly. So we don't want that. So I would try to wait.

175
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.050
Michael Bryans: At least

176
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.220
Dr. Ogawa: 12 hours.

177
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:46.140
Dr. Ogawa: You should have at least like three of those withdrawal symptoms that you usually have, if not more.

178
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.490
Dr. Ogawa: The longer you wait, the better it's going to be

179
00:13:51.930 --> 00:14:04.350
Dr. Ogawa: So I'm also going to have, I don't know, maybe can or RJ and send you just a copy of the sheet of paper sheet where it goes through step by step instructions with you.

180
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.960
Dr. Ogawa: Just in case.

181
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:22.530
Dr. Ogawa: You're but what we're gonna do is, I'm going to say if you're interested. And I'm going to send the Suboxone tablets to the pharmacy and simply might not be tablets, depending on what whatever your insurance. We're going to cover

182
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.400
Michael Bryans: Works. Yeah.

183
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:28.560
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, yeah, it's all the same, but they're going to be eight milligrams

184
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:34.320
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. And then, but I don't know what your dose is going to be, it might just be for

185
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.050
Dr. Ogawa: Now, you know, cut them in half.

186
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.000
Dr. Ogawa: Start

187
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:49.920
Dr. Ogawa: So the first time you know it's been about 12 hours you're going through withdrawals. Take the four milligrams, which is half

188
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:50.790
Michael Bryans: Right.

189
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:51.840
This is

190
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:58.110
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, all of them are going to be almost all and under the tongue.

191
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:04.290
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, so how sublingual and you want to just leave it there for me, it's probably like two minutes.

192
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.990
Dr. Ogawa: Until it just dissolves and

193
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.600
Dr. Ogawa: It's gonna work the best that way.

194
00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:10.380
Michael Bryans: Okay.

195
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.620
Dr. Ogawa: If you swallow it. It's not going to work very well and

196
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:15.720
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, yeah.

197
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.050
Dr. Ogawa: Is it

198
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.280
Michael Bryans: Possible to do sub solve just because I have a coupon for it. So I'll

199
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.720
Michael Bryans: See, you know, the V sub solver.

200
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:25.800
Michael Bryans: Oh, yeah.

201
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.500
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, because we're

202
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.310
Michael Bryans: All for that.

203
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:40.380
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, and I can try it. I think the dosing for that might be a little slightly different. So I might be eight and might be like 9.5 or something like that.

204
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.710
Dr. Ogawa: It would be the same concept is

205
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.270
Dr. Ogawa: Still there in half.

206
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.050
Dr. Ogawa: Like that and

207
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:54.510
Michael Bryans: Then is it possible to write me for like a B 12 vitamin thing.

208
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.330
Dr. Ogawa: Oh yeah, what is that for

209
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.670
Michael Bryans: Be 12 just vitamins TV healthy, Phil. It's probably helpful at the same time.

210
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.380
Dr. Ogawa: I can try and yeah and

211
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.980
Dr. Ogawa: It just, it's more about it. I'm not sure if your insurance will cover it, but I can

212
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.370
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, good, good, good.

213
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.660
Dr. Ogawa: So yeah, we can start with so

214
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:31.230
Dr. Ogawa: And then so you're going to see how that has this kind of feel like

215
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:39.030
Dr. Ogawa: And you should be feeling better, you shouldn't be feeling worse if you feel worse. It's too early.

216
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.490
Dr. Ogawa: And that might be enough for you to feel good for the rest of the day.

217
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:51.450
Dr. Ogawa: But you can wait one or 123 hours to see how you feel.

218
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.930
Dr. Ogawa: And if you're still feeling withdraws after those 123 hours then take the other half.

219
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.630
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, that'll make eight milligrams Gretchen as your dose.

220
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:12.150
Dr. Ogawa: And then you do it again and 123 hours if you're feeling great. Just stay at that eight milligrams, that whole top or film.

221
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.780
Dr. Ogawa: But if not, you can take another half

222
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.300
Dr. Ogawa: And then that'll be

223
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:27.990
Dr. Ogawa: 12 or if it's absolved might be a little bit less by and and then that will be your total dose of the day.

224
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:35.310
Michael Bryans: Um, is there any way to write something for sleeping, because I know when I've gone through before I can't sleep.

225
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.940
Michael Bryans: Yeah, that's probably the worst part for me, honestly.

226
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:40.170
Is yeah yeah

227
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.440
Dr. Ogawa: What have you used in the past.

228
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.260
Michael Bryans: I've had a prescription for Seroquel

229
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.340
Michael Bryans: Ambien

230
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.550
Michael Bryans: Prescriptions for like Xanax and stuff that made me super tired exactly for that.

231
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:14.010
Michael Bryans: The circle Ambien work pretty good for sleeping. I'm not sure how well they work like at that time. Like, I love the other

232
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.090
Suggestion

233
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:26.820
Dr. Ogawa: And i. So, the ones that you mentioned, I, I actually wouldn't recommend that I can write for something like either Gabba punter or no.

234
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:35.940
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. That also will make you drowsy sounds kind of nice because it can also help with pain, too.

235
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.570
Michael Bryans: Yeah, I tried that and I got a Carson like like 20 years ago.

236
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.460
Michael Bryans: And they gave me that it didn't work.

237
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.230
Michael Bryans: Non narcotic but

238
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.100
Michael Bryans: I use it later on and it makes you super tired and

239
00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:01.860
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, and so I can do that. And you can take it when you're trying to sleep and then every eight hours if you need to.

240
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.700
Dr. Ogawa: But the thing is,

241
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:15.120
Dr. Ogawa: When you're doing this you might want to do it so that you're withdrawing out of time. You're going to be trying to sleep. Anyway, so you don't have to be up the whole day was John's

242
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.610
Michael Bryans: Yeah, of course, you can be home.

243
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.200
Michael Bryans: Okay, yeah.

244
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:26.580
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, which is you don't have to, but most people try to like do their last use at night before they go to bed.

245
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.470
Michael Bryans: And so in the morning to do

246
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.230
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, so a lot of times already passed.

247
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.900
Dr. Ogawa: And any other symptoms that you're worried about or

248
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.180
Michael Bryans: Just things it from. It's pretty awful. I remember but

249
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.210
Michael Bryans: I think that's just something to deal with.

250
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:54.090
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, and I can give you something called Clonidine that can help with that anxiety from withdraw. If you want to do that.

251
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.310
Michael Bryans: And you can take

252
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.690
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah yeah

253
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.920
Dr. Ogawa: That one.

254
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.880
Dr. Ogawa: Line McHugh little drowsy, too, but more

255
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.010
Dr. Ogawa: Elaine, drop your blood pressure.

256
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.200
Michael Bryans: So just be careful if you feel

257
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.490
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, perfect.

258
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.390
Dr. Ogawa: So if you feel that Devi don't take it anymore. Okay.

259
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:26.670
Dr. Ogawa: Gotcha. And you can take both of these as needed for the withdraws. And then also, like, you know, I'm giving you these medications, but they're all kind of temporary

260
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:36.270
Dr. Ogawa: To write one speaker ways I heroin all those emotions are still going to be there. Even though we're taking care of your like physical withdraw.

261
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:45.390
Dr. Ogawa: Right, so I would recommend doing therapy to or counseling to kind of take care of that part or like you're craving.

262
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.080
Dr. Ogawa: Stuff.

263
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.790
Dr. Ogawa: Do you already have therapy somehow or somewhere.

264
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.930
Michael Bryans: Um no I haven't done therapy or

265
00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.850
Dr. Ogawa: Would it be okay if I requested that through Braveheart

266
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.970
Michael Bryans: Joe Yeah, is it mandatory.

267
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:09.810
Dr. Ogawa: And I don't think so. But I think it's highly, highly recommended to keep getting refills.

268
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.340
Michael Bryans: Okay.

269
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:18.060
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, I mean, you can see how it goes. All right.

270
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:28.050
Dr. Ogawa: And so that first day of trying Suboxone quell that one and a half is going to be your maximum

271
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.060
Dr. Ogawa: But then the next day you can kind of

272
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:38.400
Dr. Ogawa: See how it goes. Again, and add another half if you want to see what your, your daily dose is going to end up

273
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.890
Dr. Ogawa: Okay, okay.

274
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.050
Dr. Ogawa: Do you have any questions.

275
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.220
Michael Bryans: No, ma'am.

276
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.990
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah, it seems like you kind of already knew a lot about what's going to happen.

277
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.570
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah. And yeah, so we just wanted to make sure we're all on the same page.

278
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.500
Dr. Ogawa: South and the box.

279
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.410
Dr. Ogawa: Or saw the gabapentin Clonidine vitamins and our can

280
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.720
Dr. Ogawa: Yeah that should hold you and

281
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.520
Dr. Ogawa: So in that. Do you have a day that you think you're going to do it.

282
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.680
Dr. Ogawa: Start

283
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:23.550
Dr. Ogawa: Oh,

284
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.150
Dr. Ogawa: Did you hear that last part. Sorry.

285
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.200
Michael Bryans: I didn't know

286
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.850
Michael Bryans: That you said I was so much knowledgeable, what, what's going to happen.

287
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:43.410
Dr. Ogawa: Oh, OK. OK. Yes. After that, I was just running over the meds again about what I was going to send off.

288
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.170
Dr. Ogawa: And then

289
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:52.740
Dr. Ogawa: I was trying to figure out, do you have a day that you want to start doing this.

290
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.360
Um,

291
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:56.970

Michael Bryans: I'm ready.

296
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:15.030
Dr. Ogawa: Okay. Um, I would say go to the pharmacy today, Ben, so that you can make sure you have your medicines tomorrow.

297
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.460
Dr. Ogawa: Because sometimes there's like just mixed up about the medications and

298
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.510
Dr. Ogawa: Insurance and stuff.

299
