59
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.700
Richelle Direny: We know better, it's not good to know because because of the fact that we have a lot of hurricanes, you

63
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.820
Richelle Direny: But then, but with the beach. You get a lot of storms, like, so we're getting ready to enter into hurricane season. So what happens is

64
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.250
Richelle Direny: hurricane season, you're the first one that have to leave your house until you send you a higher chance of you getting um

65
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:44.250

66
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.090

74
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.940
Richelle Direny: There is one hurricane that it hit Florida but more it seemed like as a cat one or maybe a cat to

75
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.140
Wes Smith: Was attached

Richelle Direny: To it came up the coast and then it more hit like north of me. So, but they got a lot like of like the feeder bands which was pretty

77
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.910
Richelle Direny: Until they got a lot more flooding and like the places that got damaged were the ones that are like right next to the beach, like my

78
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.420
Order.

79
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.970

83
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.930

84
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:13.620
Wes Smith: So southwest, Ohio. Like, literally, if you look at the map of Ohio and you look like towards the chart like okay there's Indiana and the very bottom of India's the top

85
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.080
Wes Smith: Right where meets the middle like right we're all three of them touch. Okay.

86
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.110
Richelle Direny: I'm in so so with where I am in in South Florida. Yes.

87
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.560
Richelle Direny: What so you have Miami.

88
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:47.670
Richelle Direny: Like you have the key holder. You have the keys, then you have Miami sell the keys and not about. So the keys is like the end the end of the United States, as you know, it is the complete end of United States is the keys and then you have Miami coming up into Miami and each

89
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.380
Richelle Direny: County.

90
00:06:49.650 --> 00:07:07.110
Richelle Direny: So let Miami is like Dade County and that's where she was then you have Broward County, then you have pony. So like I'm in Palm Beach County and then you're going further up into the state. So I am I'm south, but I'm not as far south as onstage.

91
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.730
Wes Smith: Like, Well, you heard about that.

92
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:19.320
Wes Smith: Back in 2018 this kid, I used to rap music good rapper a good kid really smart x x x seven you got shot and killed in Deer Park.

93
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.790
Richelle Direny: All of that stuff. What you hear about

94
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:33.120
Richelle Direny: A lot of that is in Miami. So you remember how Jay Z had came up with like this theme song. Oh yeah, New York, so like

95
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.930
Wes Smith: New York

96
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.300
Richelle Direny: Yes, but then like when he calls out the different cities or states. One of them was Miami, Florida.

97
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:49.140
Richelle Direny: A lot of entertainers live in Miami. A lot of people have their second home in Miami. So a lot of people. So it's kind of like a little New York

98
00:07:49.470 --> 00:08:04.230
Richelle Direny: So one of the reasons why I don't care. I personally cannot stand Miami, it's because it's it's it's somewhat mirrors New York where he's like a lot of one way streets very, very busy, you almost need to learn. No, a second language Spanish to beat

99
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.700
Wes Smith: Tracks. A lot of idiots.

100
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.540
Richelle Direny: So yeah, so I don't care for it because and again

101
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.620
Wes Smith: Everybody video

102
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.440
Wes Smith: Not everybody it's done there, but I mean it attracts a lot of the people that

103
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.130
Richelle Direny: You have a lot of remember it's close. We're very close to

104
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:27.510
Richelle Direny: Cuba, when you go down to like the keys yard. When we thank you so you have a lot of central you hear like in Florida, where you have like a lot of

105
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:39.540
Richelle Direny: People who are escaping from the Spanish countries they come to Florida because speaking part of the United States. They could come. So in Miami you house, a lot of, um,

106
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.230
Wes Smith: Well, don't

107
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.130
Wes Smith: Don't you remember

108
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:48.420
Wes Smith: Don't you remember that what you're saying what you're saying, I'm not talking about the Scarface movie if you know what fictional part

109
00:08:48.840 --> 00:09:00.810
Wes Smith: But I feel like there is that couldn't real like back and said, like right and beginning of the movie. It shows you know Scarface the guy Scarface how he his beginnings. Were they trying to green card and America.

110
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:12.480
Wes Smith: And it says issuance of like footage of, like, people like real life footage getting shipped, you know, refugees that Castro cast it out and he was

111
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:24.630
Wes Smith: They had the house them right underneath the interstates and highways and shit and Miami and it was intense. And that's what it was saying. But I don't know if that was a fictional like

112
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.630
Richelle Direny: realistic fiction. A lot of that stuff happens you'll find that more in Miami, like I said, it's, it's

113
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.350
Richelle Direny: Almost like

114
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:39.420
Richelle Direny: A hub of certain things Miami is one. It's a forward looking, Miami. It's one of them. So, you know, you

115
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:50.670
Richelle Direny: Don't know if you've ever heard years ago because you have so much immigrants in Miami, like Spanish. And I think there was one year they were doing something with the government.

116
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.570
Wes Smith: Modeling something

117
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:53.670
Richelle Direny: Hmm.

118
00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.150
Wes Smith: This whole country's made it. We will, we are in like white people or

119
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.160
Richelle Direny: You don't like sort of your family. Like if you look in your lineage. Yes. Yeah, like

120
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.200
Wes Smith: Everybody. Yeah.

121
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.890
Richelle Direny: You're all your great great grand mother or father somebody isn't

122
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.090
Wes Smith: The only yeah the Native Americans. That's the only one.

123
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.460
Richelle Direny: True. That's true. Yeah, but

124
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:34.260
Richelle Direny: They shut down Miami, because like they were they wanted to. There was a period where they wanted to get rid of all of the illegal immigrants in Miami and it became a such an issue because then, like all of Miami was gone. Like all of Miami like everybody was working there and

125
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:34.740
Like

126
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.790
Richelle Direny: So they have to stop it, because all of your workers were these illegal immigrants that

127
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:53.250
Richelle Direny: Have how by me operated so they had to stop it because they recognize how important and so they had to like the business owners and everybody has everybody had to come make a stop to it because

128
00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:01.350
Richelle Direny: The problem is you find that immigrants, they would they're willing to do a whole lot more than your Americans because

129
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.010
Richelle Direny: Hey, you're not paying me and oh my God, listen. Oh my God, yes.

130
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.150
Wes Smith: Especially Mexican that stereotype but it's the truth. They love

131
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.250
Richelle Direny: To what you were a fuse.

132
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.080
Wes Smith: That you want and

133
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.570
Wes Smith: They were, they would rather beat you over the head and make you give them a job than to just beat over the head and rob you

134
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.470

Richelle Direny: Ever he plays for Miami.

145
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.220
Wes Smith: Yeah, look, I swear, but

146
00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.780
Richelle Direny: He's still

147
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.350
Richelle Direny: I don't, you know what, it's funny. I don't really

148
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:12.300
Richelle Direny: We don't really watch it. We used to be begin to or my husband needs to be very big into football, big fan of Miami Dolphins, and the heats and the

149
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:19.920
Wes Smith: Dude, the heat when they played the Chicago Bulls Derrick Rose with the NDP I hated

150
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.440
Richelle Direny: People are gone. And so it's just kind of like a whole so you know

151
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.870
Wes Smith: I think I but you know the XX.

152
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:38.370
Wes Smith: Xx kid. He was very smart kid, man. And he, like, don't let you know he wasn't he don't want. Is it because a lot of people will let the word rapper.

153
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.400
Wes Smith: They automatically think went over there, the troublemakers. The thugs or this or that they get high.

154
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:59.550
Wes Smith: Okay, yeah, long prod you get high. But a lot of them don't do as much as they say they just say that just to make yourself look cool and clown, but I'm ex was wanted. He was up. I think you probably heard of the next xx

Richelle Direny: When he when when x ecstasy or whatever his name was. But when he passed. Like, I mean, that's all they're going to talk about on the news. So a lot of people you hear about because of what happened.

157
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:27.390
Wes Smith: With stalking you know like they were a he was just bought a thing in Deer Park or they get my dear so Park. I think that sounds familiar by there. It was nice.

158
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:36.960

179
00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:06.150
Wes Smith: An app is probably from the weed back in the day when I smoked all the time that attribute right there, like notice you start noticing Man Thanks slipping my mind here. Now you know i mean

180
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.120
Wes Smith: So that's one thing I always look back

181
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:16.200
Wes Smith: Whenever you get off drugs. It's like, does it tells you up mentally or physically the emotional everything

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.850
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. So, so one of the things that I want to own cuz I know

189
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.050

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.890
Wes Smith: Yeah because think about it.

199
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:26.370
Wes Smith: What it is, because it's only for seven days. And that's mean you met before the next one.

200
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.360
Wes Smith: Our next group so

201
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:35.370
Wes Smith: Yeah, right. All right. Because I remember God showed me right, the day before. Stacy died. God had show I'd had a visit her

202
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:46.170
Wes Smith: And God showed me this is why we took these weekly survey band things. And I was like, wow. Now that you say that show me that she showed me on her computer screen.

203
00:17:47.130 --> 00:18:04.740
Wes Smith: You know, like each question, you know, from zero to this or whatever, it would show in a bar graph, it would she translated it to a bar graph, you know, I mean like took the logistics of it and made it into a bar graph time over so much you know mean under me

204
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:18.690
Wes Smith: And I was like, Wow, that's pretty cool. How they, you know, I mean, how that showed me and I was like she was like, seems like you're doing better you are doing good. And that was right before I gotten that down slope because it was a day before she

205
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:31.470
Wes Smith: Will not. It was the day before she technically died, but I was like three days without, you know me, not knowing and I was looking for and calling all. So you mean like I didn't think that. But

206
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:43.320
Wes Smith: Yeah, that's why I was like, I remember, I remember she was telling me you're doing good year. And I just got put on two weeks script week before she alas, seeing. And I remember I was doing good.

207
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.160
Wes Smith: smashing it really enjoy

208
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.710
Richelle Direny: Your day you're you're in a better place now.

209
00:18:49.830 --> 00:19:02.070
Wes Smith: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, mentally, physically, emotionally, yes. Supposed to at my new girlfriend, she's very good person and she's a good, a good loving soulmates like my Sony

210
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:14.550
Wes Smith: That's where I sat her I I really do think that I mean because there's a lot of people that I've seen couples. I just can't get along, blah, blah, blah. That's not

211
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:23.910
Wes Smith: And it's just like I know everybody has their disagreements and arguments, but it's the one people that you know ain't gonna last long one. That's

212
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:38.400
Wes Smith: You know, hating on each other every day. Opposition. Opposition that, you know, and not like she just she gives me a good show. And she makes me feel good about myself, Maya and I felt like

213
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:55.170
Wes Smith: I became wise. I've had my trials and tribulations with love and thinking I'm in love and all and not not love. It's just, I'm used to it, or I'm used to them. No, I really, I really feel like what I put in. I get. I get back tenfold.

214
00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:57.960
Wes Smith: Why

215
00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.130
Wes Smith: And that's a good

216
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:07.170
Wes Smith: Thing I mean like, don't, don't you think that that sounds like a good logic, really, it's like it's like don't love somebody, because

217
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:19.170
Wes Smith: You know something certain suit superficial reasons but love them, how they make you feel about yourself. No, I mean, cuz you gotta love yourself love anybody you know i mean

218
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.790
Wes Smith: For like she makes me care about myself. Well, I don't know. It's hard to explain.

219
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.460
Wes Smith: I'm some angel and I'm, you know, taking every step right yeah i mean but

220
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:36.060
Wes Smith: She gives me a certain confidence and not a false sense a real sense

221
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.220
Wes Smith: Many more reasons you know i mean

222
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:58.290
Wes Smith: I gotta say like sometimes I think and I don't want to say, I'm not saying this in a way to be me, shape or form or disrespectful to the, you know, to Stacey or anything, but like, and there's a reason for everything. Now, I think, you know, I mean, like maybe

223
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:00.930
Wes Smith: You get where I'm going with that.

224
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.490
Wes Smith: Not saying that that was what the this the biggest greet

225
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:11.190
Richelle Direny: Me, put it like this. That was a season in your life that was a season in your life that you went through.

226
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.660
Richelle Direny: And it's something that's something that can be learned from that season.

227
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:27.090
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. Um, and that's just kind of how you look at it and everything that you've experienced in life. Everything that you go through in life. It's a season you take from you take from it what you you can

228
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.350
Richelle Direny: Um,

229
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.090
Richelle Direny: You know you don't want to necessarily you you learn from it and

230
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.950
Richelle Direny: I'm sure at the time, you probably felt like she was your soulmate at the

231
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.860
Wes Smith: End. She was close.

232
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.740
Wes Smith: Very close to that Stacy was at that time.

233
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:55.260
Richelle Direny: You know she you felt you were in love with her, you couldn't see you. Are you guys had a thing going, whether or not you guys, whether you're not, you didn't, whatever that situation, whatever it was.

234
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.510
Richelle Direny: He filled a purpose.

235
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.720
Richelle Direny: Or, you know, some type of meaning or something that you needed to learn from

236
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:09.960
Wes Smith: One time, though she sent me a text. I remember after she's done I read it over and over and over. And she was like, look.

237
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:14.220
Wes Smith: Because I'm the type of guy when my girl tells me you know I love you no matter what it's like

238
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:23.970
Wes Smith: I feel like you say that because then one day you think we won't work out. I love you, you know, I mean, like, you know, I mean I think like that. And I remember she was like, look at a text.

239
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.520
Wes Smith: If this don't work or something because we, you know, I mean, we had a couple of talks before about

240
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:37.650
Wes Smith: Because she told me the doctor was like all you know they did one surgery heart surgery and they told her she went will make like a 30% chance of making it that

241
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:48.360
Wes Smith: She did. She pulled through it's crazy should be the odd and then you know i mean she was telling me a couple weeks and us for starting so she's like yeah, they said that they wouldn't want to

242
00:22:48.930 --> 00:23:00.210
Wes Smith: Be so quick to this next one, Baba. I'm sitting over red flags are popping up my head, I'm like, wait a minute. We're also going to ask you, what do you get from that Linda doctor tells you that like

243
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.870
Wes Smith: I was just going to tell you, like they just don't want to do they know. This next one's gonna kill you like something a

244
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.490
Wes Smith: Chance smaller chance of pulling through than the last time.

245
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.020
Wes Smith: You know, the next heart surgery.

246
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.000
Wes Smith: They were supposed to do another

247
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:30.270
Wes Smith: No. See, that's what that's what I said. That's what they were saying. I never seen the very the autopsy itself.

248
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:37.050
Wes Smith: But when I like I said when I did find out. She was two months pregnant. A couple months after she died.

249
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:43.800
Wes Smith: And I found out that autopsy said that she had seven different drugs in our system. I said, now here's where I think you're a lie.

250
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:56.760
Wes Smith: I told him right to their face. You are a liar, sir, that girl did not have seven different types of drugs in her system know she did not. She had Suboxone in her system. She had

251
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:11.250
Wes Smith: No, no, no, no. She did not have seven different types. She might have. She didn't even smoke weed. You know what I mean. So that's why I know for a fact that that person was lying about that, you know, I mean, it was like

252
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:21.960
Wes Smith: This overdose. This what because a girl that that had, you know, when you have heart surgery and you know she was fine. She didn't have, like, you know, ventilators, nothing like shouldn't have to have

253
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:41.850
Wes Smith: Take bunch of medications you know she's young still and she looks, you know, bounced out from it but it. But still, when you have a heart surgery. It takes effect on your lungs and shouldn't have breathing breathing problems. No, but when we were she was like it was cold that winner.

254
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:55.470
Wes Smith: We were staying with a friend. We didn't have a fully go a place to go at that time. And I remember she because me and my mom and my mom's landlord got into it.

255
00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:56.940
Wes Smith: She

256
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:07.020
Wes Smith: We were, you know, lean back and forth when when she left that day we was somewhere we was good, you know, I mean, it's like, why are you not coming inside. Why would you just sit in the car.

257
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:16.890
Wes Smith: You're cool with these people. What is going on, like, I mean like I would literally had to physically put my hands on her to pick her up and pour out of that to get her out of it, or that I could

258
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:27.000
Wes Smith: I can't force her to do, some don't want to do you know I can come out and give her food and different things, but that was a day before she left and never seen it.

259
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:44.220
Wes Smith: But you know me. It was like she had them lung problems and being exposed to the cold being on the call, even though that core had heat, you know, I mean it didn't matter if she ever, it would hurt her bad or bad and exposure to cold alone.

260
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.750
Wes Smith: And I, and I told people that I said I'm gonna tell you right now, I want to see this.

261
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:55.920
Wes Smith: I really do. I still do. Because I want a lot. Look at everybody in the face and say, man, this is what happens when a girl that's in Nicole.

262
00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:06.930
Wes Smith: That fucking just basically has made in certain little you know statements before when she was mad that she just felt like growing up in a ball in a cold spot and dime, you know,

263
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:16.740
Wes Smith: You know I'm saying. So these people try to say seven different other drugs and overdose come she don't do heroin. She never wanted heroin.

264
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:24.270
Wes Smith: She had Suboxone and that's what she was content with smoke weed. That's what I'm trying to think, what other drugs can be in her system.

265
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:37.290
Wes Smith: Nothing, nothing. These people are liars. This whole town's a lot, you know, I mean they was telling people around here that I slit her throat I stole $20 from somebody I was bought. What the hey

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.710
Richelle Direny: You know what, you know what, sometimes you have to if you know your truth that's why

268
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.480
Wes Smith: I know, I know. And that's what

269
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.410
Wes Smith: That's exactly what I

270
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:58.680
Richelle Direny: was watching. I was what I don't usually watch this one show what I've heard people talk about it. It's like on this on Facebook.

271
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.690
Richelle Direny: And it's called

272
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.800
Richelle Direny: It's called the red table with

273
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.010
Richelle Direny: Will Smith wife agenda, pink, it's

274

Wes Smith: Girlfriend

276
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.340
Richelle Direny: A weapon, so

277
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.620
Richelle Direny: Let's see, that's the thing. You see how you say it's two pucks ex girlfriend.

278
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.410
Wes Smith: No, yeah, I see, I see. Yeah, yeah.

279
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:29.370
Richelle Direny: It's funny because you know in watching it. There was a lot of allegations that was being said about them, but just about

280
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:37.050
Richelle Direny: What Jay was just everything she was just talking about everything. It was both of them that was sitting there talking

281
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.340
Wes Smith: Or will in her

282
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:44.850
Richelle Direny: Yeah, they were talking about their lives. I'm just kind of alluding to earlier relating to what you're saying that, you know,

283
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:57.900
Richelle Direny: Your truth and you can't worry about everybody else and what everybody because you know your truth. And if you allow if you're trying to contest, something that someone is saying that you know is aligned

284
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:05.280
Richelle Direny: With it makes it look like you're you're trying to hide the truth or you're trying to you're trying to defend

285
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:14.760
Richelle Direny: Something with, you know, your truth. So you just have not been people are going to say whatever they want and and I only made that exists, and I only bring that up because I remember it was

286
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:22.980
Richelle Direny: In listening to them. I know there was a lot of allegations that they were going to get a divorce. There was one in the media talks about, they were swingers

287
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:23.970
Richelle Direny: That's what I

288
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.200
Wes Smith: knew they would. Yep.

289
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.740
Richelle Direny: Fingers. Um, and she said, then I

290
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.490
Wes Smith: Kind of believe that

291
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:40.800
Richelle Direny: But that's the thing. So when they were talking about their lives. She did this interview and he was invited to talk. And she said, and so actually talks about their truth and kind of

292
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:48.240
Richelle Direny: You know, when they got to that point in their relationship there was the season in their relationship where it was just like, things were going downhill, or what have you.

293
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:56.550
Richelle Direny: And they, she said you know how they worked it out or how they work through it and how it renewed their relationship and they learned unconditional love.

294
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.870
Richelle Direny: And that at the end, they said, Okay, well let's address a lot of these things that are said in the media because so many things.

295
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:11.580
Richelle Direny: They said that we were never going to get a divorce. She said, I don't know where people gotten that from that they weren't they had chosen

296
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:19.530
Richelle Direny: That they were going through, they were they were both facing their individual truths and a lot of it was him facing His truth in just

297
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:31.590
Richelle Direny: Overall, who he was as a person who he was as a husband, he was just facing and they were never going through a situation where they thought about getting a divorce or they the conversation even came up about them getting a divorce.

298
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.260
Richelle Direny: But in the December one huh

299
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.180
Wes Smith: What are they surviving

300
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.580
Richelle Direny: They said they but they said in the tabloids they made that up. They said that they were never swingers

301
00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.510
Richelle Direny: They said that

302
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:56.790
Richelle Direny: They said that she and then she said, that's a very specific life. And there's a lot that goes on to answer that, like she was like they were never swingers. Um, basically it's just been them to and then when it came on to to

303
00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.070
Richelle Direny: To do to POC thing.

304
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.570
Richelle Direny: Apparently they knew each other, her into pot knew each other from high school.

305
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.770
Wes Smith: Yeah.

306
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.000
Richelle Direny: Yeah, they've known each other from high school. And if they've been like really good friends like they've been best friends. They've always been there for each other.

307
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:19.770
Richelle Direny: So it's kind of like if you and I, we grew up together and we're like tight like this. People are going to think because of that closeness.

308
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:27.330
Richelle Direny: We had something going no matter what you say that. And so he will talk about his intimidation towards that.

309
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:33.270
Wes Smith: He never understood said that to me was saying that in this press run for babbling three

310
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:47.940
Richelle Direny: He said that he never understood that relationship on, he was like he was very intimidated. He never really went up to two o'clock in the beginning, but that was just in even after Tupac died she talks, he talks about

311
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.380
Wes Smith: Ryan will see as a guy. Yeah, I would hate to see my girl Britain crying.

312
00:30:52.620 --> 00:31:00.720
Richelle Direny: Because they were so close. They were so close their friendship was so tight because tool pockets, who got her into

313
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:06.630
Wes Smith: Where the yeah he was in that school for arts. Yeah. And it was for like the kids school

314
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:21.480
Richelle Direny: Because they were so he said like wherever I go, and whatever I do. You're going to be there with me because like they were that close. And he said, and Will Smith said when he done, she cried for 45 days straight and there was nothing he can do and you don't

315
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:22.740
Wes Smith: There that would hurt.

316
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:23.880
Wes Smith: No wonder he was

317
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:31.950
Richelle Direny: Coming down but then he's a because of the relationship that they had. But then, you know, and hearing him talk, but then you can see

318
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:44.670
Richelle Direny: The genuineness in their relationship and their love for each other and where they are today after 20 some odd years of marriage and I'm you know in watching the interview, but I'm just, I'm just sharing that for you.

319
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:52.890
Richelle Direny: Right, as individuals, we all should learn something, just from that, you know, information, regardless if you agree with

320
00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:06.120
Richelle Direny: Bear whatever they do, and all of that, but just hearing that piece, it just speaks to us as humans don't understand that as long as you know your truth, it doesn't matter what I say.

321
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.350
Richelle Direny: Or I alluded to.

322
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.120
Richelle Direny: It's your truth if you know that you know one

323
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:22.200
Richelle Direny: If the quarantine if they after they on the coroner's office if they said that she had seven different drugs in her system. If you knew that you had

324
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:36.900
Richelle Direny: Your for two, three weeks. And this all she did was this, like, I don't understand. Where did you guys get that seven other drinks, because I know we were with each other all the time. And this is all she did so right other drugs. If people

325
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:42.720
Richelle Direny: That you're the one that gave her let's say they said that you gave her that final those if it

326
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.250
Wes Smith: Right, right.

327
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:44.760
Right. See

328
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:55.830
Richelle Direny: That she overdosed on and they said, well, you were the one that into you know you didn't do it. You know, you were no I didn't. But then everybody and I get how it gets to you.

329
00:32:56.190 --> 00:33:08.910
Richelle Direny: Because you're you have 10 people saying the same things in there in your ear. And what does that do you feel the need to defend yourself Nash innately you feel the need to defend yourself.

330
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:20.760
Wes Smith: And you have taken the, the Father, the variables of, like, you know, there's your love. That's, that's your love. That's your that's your person, it just dawned on you and then like take also the variables like

331
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:28.140
Wes Smith: You know these people know nothing about it, nor do they give a fuck. And then, and then it's like

332
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:41.580
Wes Smith: The bottom where I got the info from about the autopsy and it was the same person that told me you know she was pregnant, she was two months pregnant, and I believe that 100% I really truly believe that 100% 100

333
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:57.150
Wes Smith: Now, and that's what I'm thinking to myself like I go through it. I'm like, I wouldn't. Okay. They would line about that because when I called him on it. They were quick to like jump off subject, not thinking back about it. But when they told me that is St cuz you know I mean yeah he's like

334
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:58.260
Wes Smith: Because it's

335
00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.570
Richelle Direny: all said and done, I think about how

336
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:08.970
Wes Smith: He told me was a very reliable source. Let me just say this, they would, they could get to that access to those, those, those public

337
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.450
Richelle Direny: But then, okay, so this is the other question.

338
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:23.670
Richelle Direny: To you and and i think in you is taking it and applying it to other aspects of your life because the thing is, when you look at your journey to sobriety.

339
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:41.040
Richelle Direny: You're not just looking at all the things you've done, you're not reflecting just on all the things that you've done in the past. That means you use what you're looking at were, what about those situations that triggered you to lose control or to feel that need

340
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.910
Richelle Direny: Right.

341
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.550
Wes Smith: We left that. Yeah, right.

342
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.510
Richelle Direny: And so in this situation. Here it is. OK, I can be a reliable source.

343
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.120
Wes Smith: And I'm telling you that reliable source.

344
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.590
Richelle Direny: Nobody in here when I'm

345
00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:08.070
Richelle Direny: Not here when I'm going if I'm a relay you see me as a reliable source because you know but and I'm going to tell you something about someone who has been who is passed on. What does that information going to do for you today.

346
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.220
Wes Smith: It ain't gonna

347
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.750
Richelle Direny: What would that information do for you today. Knowing that at this point you're working on healing.

348
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.740
Wes Smith: Right.

349
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.200
Wes Smith: I'll tell will always bring me down.

350
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:29.130
Richelle Direny: He was three months pregnant with Joe baby or if they say, you know, yeah, she was three months pregnant but friend, it was your baby. It was somebody else's but

351
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:29.970
Richelle Direny: What am I

352
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.800
Richelle Direny: Going to do for you today.

353
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.500

Wes Smith: Well, well, I'm not really I'm not getting to know mentally what

358
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.710
Richelle Direny: That's what I'm saying. Like it that you're you're on a journey.

373
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.630
Richelle Direny: There. Yeah, I'm just giving you an example as

374
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:08.520
Wes Smith: Medical

375
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.980
Wes Smith: Yeah, that wouldn't do nothing but just tell me back into that old you know i mean it would it would have like a

376
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:29.820
Wes Smith: Fat a creep effect in the back of the mind, you know, I mean, yeah, so you're right because focus in on that would eventually have, like, it's like a relapse of emotion you know i mean like that emotion that

377
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.510
Richelle Direny: Kind of weird.

378
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.000
Wes Smith: Weird bird breeds contempt. Right.

379
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.080
Richelle Direny: Exactly. So he. Okay, even if it is, um,

380
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:54.990
Wes Smith: It didn't bother me. It really don't. It was just like me. And he was talking and I was just using an example. And I'm sorry I don't want you to think that that is getting that. Because it ain't you know i mean like

381
00:37:55.110 --> 00:38:02.400
Richelle Direny: No, no, and nothing that i'm saying is suggesting that it's getting at you. It's just using it as an example. It's

382
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:09.510
Richelle Direny: How do I learn to cope with things that make

383
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:15.300
Richelle Direny: My way and then you look and how you do that is you learn from

384
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:24.960
Richelle Direny: All these from past things but then you're identifying triggers and housing when you're being a trigger. What are triggers for

385
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:32.580
Richelle Direny: You and that's what you're learning to identify like what are some of your triggers like one of your goals. What you said last time we spoke

386
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:42.030
Richelle Direny: Is that you want to be able to, you want to live this life in this journey of sobriety. But and wanting in doing that. You want to be able to identify

387
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:58.500
Richelle Direny: What are those triggers that makes you go backwards. That keeps making you fall backwards. What are those triggers. So like in identifying that goal. Like, what are some triggers that you can identify today. Like, what are some things that you can identify now.

388
00:38:59.580 --> 00:38:59.910
Richelle Direny: I can have

389
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.510
Wes Smith: Certain triggers can be

390
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:13.740
Wes Smith: Can be can be Danny Kaye can come down to a shape of something, sometimes, like, but that's only on drug whites.

391
00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.090
Wes Smith: Some triggers can be

392
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.200
Wes Smith: Like an argument with a close one.

393
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.300
Wes Smith: But not, it's not a strong trigger. I don't think

394
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:36.750
Wes Smith: And I feel like that's a good thing because now I used to see that as a big one. And I'm getting a little bit better but I'm

395
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:43.740
Wes Smith: Put on the spot. I hate and I always do that. I always I always have all of the questions. It's hard to get it out of my head is

396
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:50.670
Richelle Direny: It's something to think about. This is what I want you to do. I want you to think about it, just thinking, you know, if you feel like it's something that you can't answer today.

397
00:39:51.180 --> 00:40:03.810
Richelle Direny: I want you to think about it. I want you to think about whenever you're identifiable goals is you want to be able to identify what are you want to, what are your triggers.

398
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:14.220
Richelle Direny: Um you while you want to remain on this journey of serenity in order to be successful at your journey.

399
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.390
Wes Smith: burgers. Yeah.

400
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.140
Richelle Direny: So we

401
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:22.800
Wes Smith: Be able to avoid them. Yeah, see, like, a few of the triggers, I can say, all right, I'm

402
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:30.660
Wes Smith: Smoking like cigarettes sometimes can be a trigger to smoke weed. But that's an old one.

403
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:45.750
Wes Smith: Let me go through certain ones go into a certain house if if even if I'm not going there for that reason or going near that house wherever I went, you know, to buy drugs probably could be a trigger.

404
00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.740
Wes Smith: Another type of trigger to be

405
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.130
Wes Smith: The toxicity in the wrong people.

406
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.530
Richelle Direny: People, people, places and situations.

407
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.100
Wes Smith: Yep. Now like I know people, places, things. Yeah.

408
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:04.950
Richelle Direny: It sounds like it's more people, places and situations.

409
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.450
Wes Smith: Yeah, and then emotional

410
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:15.600
Richelle Direny: And emotional tree. It could be emotional. It could be, um, so you you've identified the people, places and situations. So maybe

411
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:33.900
Richelle Direny: The next time that we meet, we can now build upon a goal for each of those people places in situations. It's that at some point it's coming to that place where you say that there's some people's people that you need to walk away from because

412
00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.520
Wes Smith: Maybe like 10 are wary of it.

413
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.010
Wes Smith: Where you yeah okay where we make

414
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:38.880
So,

415
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.350
Wes Smith: Mounted

416
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:47.970
Richelle Direny: Yes, you're gonna you're going to format and you're going to structure it and you're going to identify to learn you people

417
00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:58.230
Richelle Direny: I am someone who comes into your life and I'm seasonal and I, meaning that I'm I'm only supposed to be in your life for a season.

418
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.210
Richelle Direny: And then right but then oftentimes what we do with these people, they

419
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.310
Wes Smith: Were I've heard that before.

420
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.200
Richelle Direny: You keep them in your life.

421
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:21.840
Richelle Direny: And you you think that their roots in your life like roots that hold a poetry, but I was never supposed to be a route. I'm just for the season and I'm on my business, but instead of letting me go, you find a way to help to hold on.

422
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:32.010
Richelle Direny: Right, holding on while I'm rotting away. You're always you're also running away with me because I was never meant to stay in your life long term.

423
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:44.340
Richelle Direny: I was wrong before season so cool. It's learning how to identify those people in your life that are triggers that need that you need to let go.

424
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:44.610
Richelle Direny: Yep.

425
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:48.720
Wes Smith: It's the. Well, I'll tell you this, also a big trigger

426
00:42:49.980 --> 00:43:01.110
Wes Smith: You know, my brother and like I said he was still getting high. But it still is. And I've heard, but I haven't seen folks on the phone point one, two weeks ago, first time a long time since then.

427
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.280
Richelle Direny: But he's your brother.

428
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.800
Richelle Direny: Can you review rather

429
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.110
Wes Smith: Yeah, he's like, he's not really

430
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.780
Richelle Direny: If he or biological brother, whether it not, it came from your mom or your dad is your biological brother.

431
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:20.070
Wes Smith: No, no, he's, he is my I call my brother matter what because he has looked out for me more than

432
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:30.000
Wes Smith: My family has at times. He is a brother, because no matter what. I still remember that one person before the drugs have

433
00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:37.230
Wes Smith: Like I said, that's, that's my people he knows he always says that I'm his brother, I say he's my brother.

434
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:37.770
People

435
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.690
Wes Smith: That

436
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:43.050
Wes Smith: You know, I mean, everybody notices that Smurfs 1415

437
00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:48.360
Richelle Direny: Everywhere in your life. Do you think that he's a good influence in your life.

438
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.250
Wes Smith: Not a good influence, but I think he's a good person. That's just a lot deeper than

439
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:54.600
Richelle Direny: He lost it.

440
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:56.790
Richelle Direny: But then

441
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.980
Richelle Direny: So me so really

442
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:06.390
Wes Smith: He is not because he, you know, I mean, like I said, as a trigger to be around that you know me.

443
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.890
Richelle Direny: And realistically speaking. Are you going to

444
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.960
Richelle Direny: Say, he's somebody that needs to I need to move out of

445
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.810
Wes Smith: Sense, like I've been doing. Yeah, yeah.

446
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:19.560
Richelle Direny: Now,

447
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:38.370
Wes Smith: He's also written things like you know I mean with my girlfriend like he's tried to get with her multiple times. I tell me I mean like back in the day, even back when blues first yet he's he's tricky on that situation. He's tricking a good difference which I received

448
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:40.890
Wes Smith: And

449
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:54.030
Wes Smith: You know me. And when he was a rounding. I mean, he was not. It's just like you look at me as like some dude. It's just you know i mean you know how to explain. I'm looking at me as your brother, no more like

450
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:55.200
Richelle Direny: Know, look.

451
00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:07.860
Wes Smith: You turn every situation around like to make you look like the angel and me look like I'm just some person who's mad and angry and disgruntled everything. Nah, man. Oh, you're disrespectful and I know at least I was taught respect grown up.

452
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.940
Richelle Direny: Do you love him enough to walk away from the relationship

453
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.230
Wes Smith: I can't hear you. If you're speaking

454
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:25.170
Wes Smith: Oh, sorry I'm pinky was on the mic. But no, I have been distancing myself from him already

455
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:29.670
Richelle Direny: What I'm asking you. Do you love him enough to walk away completely from the relationship

456
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.070
Wes Smith: I couldn't. I'm not gonna lie I couldn't walk away completely.

457
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.650
Richelle Direny: Okay, so then you have to realistically say

458
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.050
Wes Smith: Realistically, I'll loving my distance

459
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:53.340
Richelle Direny: But this is the question. You said that you don't you don't want to walk away fully because you guys have been together for a long time, but where you are in your journey to sobriety. You're trying to rebuild your life.

460
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:58.620
Richelle Direny: Do you, what do you love him enough to take a break, until you get on solid ground.

461
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:06.330
Wes Smith: That's, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, 11 from a distance, until I get me right to the point where a triggering shit, you know, I mean like

462
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:16.680
Wes Smith: But I'm sure like all drug addict said, I've seen coke. We recuperative drug addicts not drug some more say, you know, you just get older and wiser, yo.

463
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:34.260
Wes Smith: You'll always have that trigger, but it'll get so whittled down to nothing. You know, I mean to wear a point where when you get past this. You're on with this shit for a few years. You got it. You're going you know i mean 10 years later see that trigger the first time.

464
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:44.640
Wes Smith: And it will be so much of a window to easy thought to just pass. Yeah, I mean, like it's nothing. It can control know it can run it corrupts no

465
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:58.620
Wes Smith: No temptation is sprung from it. Like, like it's just and I see what that is and I can do it. I can do it. It just takes more greater restraint mentally thought it thinking about it.

466
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:09.990
Wes Smith: Literally, like they say if you can wrap your head around anything. You got it. If you can wrap your head around any situation, you think, and you got it. You use your mind and

467
00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:20.880
Wes Smith: Don't want to come to the pain or that this or that situation, the physical part facilities in you got in the bag hurdle and

468
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.450
Wes Smith: I tried to apply logic.

469
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:45.210
Wes Smith: And you should get. And I really do. And it takes really greater strength and a greater will and i want i will power to be a tip top because I remember there was a 14 year old me that didn't fuck with drugs, excuse my language and didn't like you if you did do drills and

470
00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:55.470
Wes Smith: Worked out who ran job boxed every other day after school and was doing this and you know I was doing good.

471
00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:57.270
Wes Smith: So,

472
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:08.730
Richelle Direny: What I want you to do. I want you to think about and you know as a reminder, and we kind of share the reminder in in our group on Thursday.

473
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:24.480
Richelle Direny: Is that, think about in terms of goals you would like to work on. And what does that mean to you, you know, your goal is to be able to take a deeper look at people, places and situations that are triggers for you.

474
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.780
Richelle Direny: Okay, I don't want

475
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:29.160
Richelle Direny: I don't want section.

476
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:30.090
Wes Smith: Again, we're

477
00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:31.050
Richelle Direny: Not

478
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:32.550
Wes Smith: Have a more detailed

479
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.050
Wes Smith: Some

480
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:40.470
Richelle Direny: Of your triggers. Because what you want to in terms of your relapse prevention. Your goal is, is that you want to identify

481
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:56.160
Richelle Direny: Triggers and you're saying right now people, places and circumstances are your triggers. But then we have to take a deeper look and understanding what does that mean, and what does that look like for you as it's related to your triggers and building

482
00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:05.550
Wes Smith: On your relapse prevention. Right, right. If you know i'm not pathetically to see if there was a person like he was asking drop work.

483
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.320
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and that's

484
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:15.480
Wes Smith: What I mean, so then that's a way for me to say okay if I know I'm anticipating I know that this is going to be my answer.

485
00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:20.100
Wes Smith: I got to anticipate how to, you know, safeguard you know

486
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:32.760
Richelle Direny: It's like evil were talking about earlier when I gave you the example of this clip I was watching with Jada Pinkett Smith, that could be a trigger that true because it here. It is that people are making

487
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.210
Wes Smith: These wall.

488
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.460
Wes Smith: Or the meat is

489
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:36.510
Richelle Direny: Uh huh.

490
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:42.600
Wes Smith: Are you talking about like Jada Pinkett with like a trigger with to park or was it like a trigger with

491
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:43.920
Richelle Direny: No, no, no, it's like

492
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.100
Richelle Direny: Well overall conversation that we were having earlier.

493
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.120
Is that we

494
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:55.770
Richelle Direny: Have when people say things that are untrue and you feel the need to defend yourself.

495
00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:01.950
Richelle Direny: And in defending yourself it wears you out because you're so busy fighting with people.

496
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:13.950
Richelle Direny: On trying to get them to believe what your truth, instead of their own truth and that would in itself. When you get yourself worked up that could be a trigger. Because now you've you've worked with yourself.

497
00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.060
Wes Smith: Trying to defend your

498
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:26.460
Wes Smith: Your right. And, um, let's see. I am the type, though I am the type that I have more times in my life analyst analytically speaking

499
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:43.440
Wes Smith: If you was the margin that up. I have probably 70% of all my life. I have been 75% that if something was said that was not true and I ended. Really, ain't I would I would hear it.

500
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:52.320
Wes Smith: And I would get mad and still try to defend myself and people like whoa, stop making yourself look guilty and it's like, I know I am, but I still it pisses me off.

501
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:56.850
Richelle Direny: Because because your expectation is that you want them to believe your truth.

502
00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.600
Richelle Direny: Will be with me. You're gonna believe what they want to believe

503
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:09.810
Wes Smith: One time told me back and they say fuck what they think. I see that you're a good guy and you're like, it's not true. Something young. I remember one time he's telling me like

504
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:15.840
Wes Smith: It was because of you know me, my dog, it took. I remember he's telling me. He's like, man. Stop trying to prove people shit.

505
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:27.720
Wes Smith: Because I can tell already just by how you're passionate and how you like gleam in your eye when you talk about he's like that. Yeah, yeah, I can tell you just one of those people that make yourself look guilty by getting mad.

506
00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.790
Richelle Direny: Mad you're making yourself look so much more guilty when you're good, you're not. But he's

507
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:33.990
Wes Smith: Not, you know,

508
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:42.360
Richelle Direny: Because we are we're creatures expectations, we expect things from people. We have these expectations without

509
00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.020
Realizing

510
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:55.800
Richelle Direny: If you you know if you're able to pick apart to understand what is it about people, places and circumstances that

511
00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:57.000
Richelle Direny: Are triggers be

512
00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:01.050
Richelle Direny: Taking a deeper look at that, then we can

513
00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:19.530
Richelle Direny: Work to create your relapse prevention plan. Because remember, here it is that you're saying that you in this person has been friends for a long time, maybe in this period in your life, maybe in order for you guys to

514
00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:35.910
Richelle Direny: In order for you guys to to to start and change or begin to change. You need to be separated me and together. We'll never you maybe both of you will never get on this journey of sobriety, but being a parent. Maybe you're able to get on this journey of sobriety.

515
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.640
Wes Smith: The you're talking about. That's an

516
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.720
Wes Smith: You're pretending to my brother in that situation.

517
00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:44.640
Richelle Direny: So you

518
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.910
Wes Smith: Have to be on his journey of sobriety on his own.

519
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:55.440
Richelle Direny: And you can't be involved because maybe both of your trigger to each other and both of you. It's like, okay, my friend, I would you

520
00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:56.430
Richelle Direny: Know you want to

521
00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:03.870
Wes Smith: You could ask my girlfriend for row. I haven't seen him in a couple months and I tried to avoiding I really do like

522
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.010
Wes Smith: I think

523
