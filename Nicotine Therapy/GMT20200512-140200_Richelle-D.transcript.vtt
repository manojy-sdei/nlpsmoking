59
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.000
Richelle Direny: It was the wife. It was the Bluetooth that was causing it.

60
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.980
Richelle Direny: So how are you. Yeah, you're back home.

61
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.380

65
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.050
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. If you when you were talking to them. And there was a delay, then it could be your connection.

66
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.670
Maybe, yeah.

67
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:59.730
Richelle Direny: Because even with your connection. Sometimes you see your you like you freeze up for a second. So it could be your connection. But let's see.

68
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.410
Rhonda S: Okay.

69
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.170
Richelle Direny: Let me pull your information.

70
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:39.510
Richelle Direny: I want to see if we had last time we spoke. If we talk about your goals and things we're going to work on.

71
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:04.200
Richelle Direny: Okay. The last time we spoke. Did you ever get the chance to speak with the doctor. I remember we were talking about the

72
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:15.570
Richelle Direny: One of your goal is, you were talking about maybe coming off of the Suboxone later. But then I said that if a lot of it is if it's to manage pain.

73
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:29.370
Richelle Direny: You know it's you have to get the evaluation and then you said that with the back pain, you would have to have surgery and you didn't because of the kind of surgery, you didn't want to do that surgery.

74
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.170
Rhonda S: Yeah.

75
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:48.660
Rhonda S: Yeah, and I was up all night last night with my back hurt and you heard all day yesterday. I mean, I was in a lot of pain hurt really bad and not until bad as much this morning, but it is hurting and and there ain't much I can do about it.

76
00:08:52.620 --> 00:09:03.150
Richelle Direny: So you just try to pretty much get through it. So what are some things that you do to try to manage the pain outside of the outside of the medication that

77
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.660
I'm

78
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:17.370
Rhonda S: Laying down or either you trying to walk in and stuff. But that's not it wasn't happen. Nothing was happening at all may not take the Gabba painting for the pain and it was a happen either

79
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:27.330
Rhonda S: I'll just deal with. I didn't go. I didn't actually get to go to sleep till probably about 430 this morning it was hurting so bad.

80
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:36.570
Richelle Direny: Now you said that you weren't where you open about and lifting things. What were you doing, maybe you you were doing some strange stuff throughout the day.

81
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:47.220
Rhonda S: When I know I wasn't doing anything. He just started hurting, and I was driving when it started hurting. And then when I got home where

82
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.740
Richelle Direny: Were you sitting. You said you're

83
00:09:53.790 --> 00:10:01.500
Rhonda S: In for a little while. And that's probably what triggered a lot say when I was sitting for so long.

84
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.470
Richelle Direny: You were sitting for some time.

85
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:12.750
Rhonda S: Yeah. And if I sit for a while. It does. It does seem to bring it on. So that's probably what triggered it.

86
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.570
Richelle Direny: Okay. Were you late on a long ride where you wherever you were going

87
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.390

Rhonda S: I still when you go somewhere, I had to drive a ways to get there. No.

92
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.100
Richelle Direny: Okay.

93
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.500
Richelle Direny: And then what about the arm.

94
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:58.620
Richelle Direny: You know, Did you do anything else besides like to do lift anything where you're doing anything that was would be considered to be pretty strenuous

95
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:05.070
Rhonda S: Now, now, I wasn't doing anything. I was just driving just shooting.

96
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:14.640
Richelle Direny: Okay, now what are some other things that you do to help to, um, to manage your pain outside of

137
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.480
Richelle Direny: Okay, and what about I know one of the things that we talked about was the fact that you had

138
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:51.000
Richelle Direny: Because of, you know, just missing your husband and, you know, thinking about him a lot. We're talks about the different things, the recommendations of the different things you can do to help you get through it. Do you find that since he had went over to your son. You don't feel

139
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.180
Richelle Direny: In undated with the memories and the thoughts of your husband, since you went over.

140

Rhonda S: Yeah, yeah. I still a lot better and better.

141
00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:09.060

142
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.270
Rhonda S: Yeah yeah

143
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.400
Rhonda S: I think it was

144
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.800
Richelle Direny: So maybe you know what i would definitely

145
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:45.090
Richelle Direny: Would recommend that you do is look into maybe every now and again going over to your son and spending some time like having maybe a weekly visits or every other week you go for a visit.

146
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:52.410
Richelle Direny: Yeah. And then I know it's a little bit harder because of the coronavirus and everything, but

147
00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.500
Richelle Direny: You were the one that chose to come back home or

148
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.450
Rhonda S: It was me.

149
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.660

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.370
Rhonda S: I didn't bother me, but

218
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.450
Rhonda S: And trying. Mm hmm. That helps a lot.

219
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.750
Rhonda S: Because you get stuck, it keeps everything out.

220
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.510
Richelle Direny: Gets it all out.

221
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.730
So the moment. Yeah.

222
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:34.860
Richelle Direny: Because you said you guys were together for a long time for a couple of decades. You were together, though it was rough.

223
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:41.190
Richelle Direny: There were some of them was really rough was really challenging, um,

224
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:41.850

225
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:51.870
Richelle Direny: Well, it's time that you guys were together, up until him being sick and having to go through that whole process of him being sick and up until his passing

226
00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:01.950
Richelle Direny: So before that moment for that passing moment for that passing emotion. It's just allowing um

227
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:18.090
Richelle Direny: It's just that just to be able to cry to release it it's it's a build up of pressure, if you will, is thinking about that emotion. It's like that. It's a building up of that pressure and it's just releasing

228
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.050
Rhonda S: Yeah.

229
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:30.900

231
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:50.490
Richelle Direny: The crying spells that you have will eventually slow down a little bit, you'll find that you're not crying as much, you find that you're coping a little bit better. I'm thinking about just the happy memories.

232
00:23:52.260 --> 00:24:09.300
Richelle Direny: And in finding fillers for your day for the days that the times where you feel most loneliness is finding fillers each day. Like I said one of them could be going and spending time with your, your son in the grandkids.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:20.550
Richelle Direny: That's a sense of, you know, just feeling a purpose being fulfilled spending time with your grandkids and join those moments.

234
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:33.240
Richelle Direny: Of time with your son whenever he comes home from work or whatever it is. He shows that he still cares, because he calls to check on you all the time and he has like that open door policy for you to come, whenever

235
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.430

331
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:57.180

332
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:09.270
Richelle Direny: And I think taking you from that environment that you were in was helpful for you to put you in a different environment and just have a different atmosphere different vibe, but different or everything around you.

333
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:17.280
