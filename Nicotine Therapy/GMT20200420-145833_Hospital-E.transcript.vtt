64
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.400
Brandon Fenley: Yeah, so we've locked everything because of her habit so

65
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.010
Joan Kandel: Haha

66
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.540
Brandon Fenley: No back of my

67
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.880
Joan Kandel: She's committed to staying clean

68
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.320
Joan Kandel: I see.

69
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.370
Brandon Fenley: Oh yeah yes she's very committed to clean, clean, clean,

70
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.190
Joan Kandel: Is she on Suboxone

71
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.040
Brandon Fenley: knows he's actually in prison right now she's did it cold turkey.

72
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.230
Joan Kandel: But you can you can get the same kind of drugs and jail.

73
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.440
Brandon Fenley: Faster, you can on the streets. So, yeah.

74
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:52.620
Joan Kandel: It's kind of crazy. Right. Right. Yeah. So some some some jails and prisons are are are doing the right thing and having people be on Suboxone there, but some aren't. So that's why I wondered if maybe she was

75
00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.710
Brandon Fenley: Oh yeah, not the prison that she didn't you they will do that like Albuquerque Albuquerque. The NBC there they give you methadone, but

76
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.250
Brandon Fenley: I don't want

77
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.140
Brandon Fenley: To go home because right

78
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.280
Brandon Fenley: I heard that's harder to kick when you're trying to get off of it.

79
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.680
Brandon Fenley: You know what I mean. So

80
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.390
Joan Kandel: Uh huh.

81
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.730
Brandon Fenley: Well, I don't know. I

82
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.630
Joan Kandel: Think Suboxone box is a great choice. Yes.

83
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:31.680
Joan Kandel: I think I it sounds good. I mean, it's especially if you're in a place that doesn't have a methadone clinic, you have to go to a methadone clinic every day. And so that would be pretty much impossible for you.

84
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.910
Brandon Fenley: Yes, ma'am.

85
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.970
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's a good medication, but it's a it's only good if you can get it.

86
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:50.880
Brandon Fenley: Yes, and there's nobody who's no nothing to close the closest methadone clinic is in or Suboxone clinic is in Roswell. And that's, like, two hours live for me.

87
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.690
Joan Kandel: Or 80 miles.

88
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.860
Joan Kandel: That's pretty far.

89
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.470
Brandon Fenley: Yeah and there's people here that go there every day.

90
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.330
Joan Kandel: Oh, wow. Yeah, that's tough.

91
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.810
Brandon Fenley: Gosh, good job, Brandon. I'm gonna

92
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.990
Joan Kandel: Right, yeah, it's hard to, it's hard to hold down a job and do that every day.

93
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.190
Brandon Fenley: You smell.

94
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:19.260
Joan Kandel: I'm Brandon, I'm going to turn off my video because my internet is so slow. So you're just going to see a picture of me, but it's me.

95
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.460

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.920
Joan Kandel: OK, there's my

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.770
Joan Kandel: It's the same person.

99
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.510
Joan Kandel: Okay.

100
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.590
Brandon Fenley: So, um,

101
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.500
Joan Kandel: Have you been, have you been on Suboxone before

102
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:47.730
Brandon Fenley: Yes, ma'am. I was on. I was actually on it for two years. And that was the best

103
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.890
Brandon Fenley: Two years of my life actually

104
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.420
Joan Kandel: Oh well. Well, good. So you have some good experience on it and you know that

105
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.400
Joan Kandel: How, how it can help you be stable. Why did you stop taking it.

Brandon Fenley: Was reason why I stopped, um,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.030
Brandon Fenley: Is because um

109
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:19.530
Brandon Fenley: But this is back in 2008, I believe, and

110
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:30.720
Brandon Fenley: I guess I wasn't on Medicaid was when I was living in Arizona, and I had to pay out of pocket, and it was like $200 every visit and I couldn't afford it.

111
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.990
Brandon Fenley: Okay, and actually relapse.

112
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.400

Joan Kandel: Yes. Okay.

317
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.960
Joan Kandel: All right, so they had to go in and do surgery on that.

318
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.120
Brandon Fenley: Yes. And then my other surgery is I got my tonsils and adenoids out when I was

319
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.870
Brandon Fenley: About seven, six years old.

320
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.740
Okay.

321
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.360
Joan Kandel: All right.

322
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.230
Joan Kandel: Very good.

323
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:15.930
Joan Kandel: Um,

324
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.490
Joan Kandel: How tall are you, and how much do you weigh

325
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:26.490
Brandon Fenley: I am six foot two, and I weigh about 260

326
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:29.850
Joan Kandel: Okay.

327
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.260
Joan Kandel: And you don't happen to know what your blood pressure is do you

328
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:35.940
Brandon Fenley: Know, I don't

329
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.170
Joan Kandel: Know, probably haven't had that checked in a while. Huh.

330
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.410
Brandon Fenley: No thing I would do it.

331
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.450
Joan Kandel: Okay.

332
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.970
Joan Kandel: All right, so what's the

333
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:08.250
Joan Kandel: Way, when you were stable on Suboxone before for two years. Do you remember what your dose was

334
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.940
Brandon Fenley: I was doing

335
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.240
Brandon Fenley: He was prescribing me

336
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.690
Brandon Fenley: For a milligrams a day.

337
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:22.410
Joan Kandel: Oh, wow.

338
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.240
Joan Kandel: That's a bit of a high dose. We don't usually need to prescribe that high.

339
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.860
Brandon Fenley: Or maybe it's three is, I think it was three. I'm sorry.

340
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:44.340
Joan Kandel: Yeah, they even that's a little bit on the high side. Yeah, most people do most people do really well on either one or two a day will kind of get a sense of how you do

341
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.840
Joan Kandel: Yeah, has been a long time since you took any Suboxone but two years.

342
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.330
Brandon Fenley: Yeah, it's been, I can get them on the streets to and

343
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:55.830
Joan Kandel: Have you

344
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:08.790
Brandon Fenley: Yeah, I have before. It's been about a year, but I can find them on the streets, they're expensive. Um, but I know that generic version. I'm

345
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.740
Brandon Fenley: The generic version of Suboxone, it does not. It doesn't work as well as the Suboxone

346
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.670
Brandon Fenley: Brand. You know what I mean. I don't know why.

347
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.070
Brandon Fenley: Or whatever, but it's just

348
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:28.290
Brandon Fenley: The, the real, the real brand works way better.

349
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:39.870
Joan Kandel: Some people have told me that. Yeah. And some people do find on the generic but some people really feel it for them it doesn't work as well.

350
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.250
Why you know

351
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.780
Joan Kandel: I don't know. It's very strange. I think it's strange.

352
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.690
Joan Kandel: Do you know if your insurance will cover the brand brand name.

353
00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.610
Brandon Fenley: I don't know.

354
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:13.410
Joan Kandel: Okay, well, what we'll do. Brandon is I will write for Suboxone the brand and I'll put a note on there for the pharmacists that

355
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.700
Joan Kandel: That they should prescribe the brand name if it's covered by your insurance.

356
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.120
Joan Kandel: But if it's but if it's not, I don't want you to have to go without it, because

357
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.870
Joan Kandel: When the generic is better than nothing right now.

358
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.100
Brandon Fenley: Yes, ma'am.

359
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:33.660
Joan Kandel: So sound. Okay.

360
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.310
Brandon Fenley: Yes, ma'am. That's fine.

361
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:41.970
Joan Kandel: Okay, good. So hopefully they'll do that and I'm, what I'm gonna do is

362
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:54.330
Joan Kandel: I'm going to start you on 16 milligrams, which is to a day and see how you do it, you're certainly going to feel a lot better than you feel right now.

363
00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:00.510
Joan Kandel: And and for most people. That's, that's enough of a dose to feel stable.

364
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.020
Joan Kandel: And and we'll talk about it.

365
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.440
Joan Kandel: At group and see how your how you're doing on that dose.

366
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:16.710
Joan Kandel: Now my groups are on Tuesdays, or in the evening at 6pm. Does that work for you.

367
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.550
Joan Kandel: Does that prefer

368
00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.410
Brandon Fenley: Oh yeah, I work

369
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.700
Joan Kandel: When

370
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.890
Brandon Fenley: I work Wednesday through Sunday or Wednesday through Saturday. So, that's perfect.

371
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:41.670
Joan Kandel: That is perfect. Oh, good. Oh, great. Okay, so what I'm going to do is prescribe you enough for today and tomorrow at 16 milligrams a day and then tomorrow in the evening you let me know how that's going

372
00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:55.200
Joan Kandel: And and also let me know if they were able to fill the brand name for you because then what we do is we have group every week, once a week. And that's when I prescribed your minute so I usually prescribe a week at a time.

373
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.170
Joan Kandel: And we go from group to group.

374
00:26:59.220 --> 00:26:59.730
Brandon Fenley: Yeah.

375
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.820
Brandon Fenley: Yeah now works for me.

376
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.820
Joan Kandel: And then do I on so um yeah

377
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.810
Brandon Fenley: That. So, um, I try to talk to you. Do you

378
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:19.530
Brandon Fenley: Send it to the, the farmers or the pharmacist and Walmart here in Clovis or

379
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.530
Joan Kandel: To wherever you wherever you wanted us to

380
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.020
Joan Kandel: Yes, to send it. Did you tell the intake person that it was Walmart.

381
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.020
Brandon Fenley: Yes, ma'am. It was that, yeah, I was at Walmart.

382
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.010
Perfect.

383
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:46.020
Joan Kandel: Perfect, that's where I'm going to send it then. So the other thing that I'm going to prescribe. So I'm going to prescribe you four of those strips so to her for today and to her for tomorrow.

384
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:59.700
Joan Kandel: And like I say, just to reiterate, I'm going to ask them to give you the Suboxone brand. Hopefully it's covered and hopefully they can do that, but I'm going to tell them that it's not covered them to give you the generic so that you at least have it.

385
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.980
Joan Kandel: Yes. And I'm going to give you four of those two for today to for tomorrow.

386
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:16.560
Joan Kandel: And then the, the other thing I'm going to prescribe is a is an art can just because I think everybody should carry that around with them.

387
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.320
Brandon Fenley: Just I actually have a walk, but it was odd.

388

391
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.730
Brandon Fenley: Okay, now I'll take the Narcan too so

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.790
Brandon Fenley: Life is pretty cool.

395
00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.920

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:31.620
Joan Kandel: They'll have you do as a self survey just about how you're doing and how things are going for you. And that takes a little bit of time and sometimes they get backed up.

425

Joan Kandel: Ah,

434
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:34.290
Joan Kandel: OK, so that'll be something that when you're in group, you need to have your headphones in and have nobody around.

435
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.210
Brandon Fenley: But just for confidentiality.
