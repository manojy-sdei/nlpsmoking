00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.099
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello.

2
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's check on audio and video my audio lining up with video, video, audio, video, lining up

3
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you sound good, too. All right. How you doing,

4
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.890
Ramon: Good, how are you

5
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good. I'm going to open up a note for us. So I have somewhere to scribble, there was a real close call like I am, it could have just as easily not been available. What happened with the confirmation initially

6
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.210
Ramon: Oh my phone. My phone's off today. I gotta wait till I get off work to pay the bills.

7
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.820
Ramon: receive messages, but I can't send me

8
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Explains it

9
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: See

10
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, I know you are or you were I'm assuming it's the same

11
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Eager to taper aware yet with your notes.

12
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.460
Ramon: Are still a tu

13
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Tu, Tu

14
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Tu, Tu strips is

15
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Milligrams

16
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. Well, that's a whole lot lower than 24 minutes

17
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.620
Ramon: Yeah, for sure.

18
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was that because I think you kind of went from one dose to the next. And was there a big withdrawal for you or no.

19
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.320
Ramon: No, not at all. Okay, good.

20
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, good, good, good, good.

21
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And how's your sweetheart doing it as I know there's a lot going on that will, you know,

22
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: She's really good.

23
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.150
Ramon: She's doing this. She's down to I think like that half of subtext. She switched from the scripts to the sub tasks.

24
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

25
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.980
Ramon: It sounds like a half she's done for mobile apps.

26
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you guys have a heart to heart about your, your belief system, your preferences about substance use and having a baby moving forward.

27
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.910
Ramon: Yeah. She says she's gonna try

28
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's

29
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.330
Ramon: Enough for you as long as she tries. I mean,

30
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, see where we're at with our goals for 11 now we should probably be on. I'm about I want help with addiction to heroin. That's one of the big ones for you.

31
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little check in on that goal. I want her help with addiction to heroin, so we can mention that you're at

32
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: A milligrams

33
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Frequently are

34
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: In column cravings, but their thoughts or a notion

35
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Or a reminding of reminiscing of using how often are they coming. Are they once a week 10 times a day, or once a month, like how frequent

36
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.100
Ramon: Say,

37
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.350
Ramon: Like three times a day probably

38
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Any pattern around that like

39
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's the pattern.

40
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.300
Ramon: What it is is I work my tires.

41
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.460
Ramon: And

42
00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.240
Ramon: When I used to do heroin. He showed up. So when I'm lumping these tires my veins start up not in my arms, because my muscles are working

43
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. And

44
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.800
Ramon: It just like triggers for me. I don't know quite what it is, but it does

45
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.720
Ramon: So I try to keep a sweater on but starting to get hot and take it off here. So,

46
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really cool that you're able to identify that you get a sense of not only seeing it. But is it also is there a feeling to it to

47
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

48
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it

49
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel

50
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Lifting something heavy. Is this the tire right that are heavy

51
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.820
Yeah.

52
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you actually feel the veins or is it muscles that you're feeling, what do you

53
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.850
Ramon: What does it feel, I feel my muscles.

54
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.320
Ramon: Lifting tires. It's like, like I said, take off my sweater and I started looking at my arms.

55
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.370
Ramon: See how big my muscles are

56
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:26.310
Ramon: And then I have like old scar tissue right there. And now that I've been working at sober for nine months is kind of like my veins bigger there to never been before, because I know

57
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

58
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's

59
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: If we pull those right we pull those two apart. We have the addict inside is like, Oh, perfect.

60
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.660
Ramon: Yeah.

61
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.190
Ramon: Yeah.

62
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.010
Ramon: Yeah, exactly.

63
00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got to stay in in the fight we stay in the conversation, the internal dialogue. So now I'm wondering after that initial Oh sweet. Look at that sweet vein. Right. Dang, right. So as soon as you have that

64
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you add it with more thoughts.

65
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.740
Ramon: Yeah, for a second, but lately I've been doing a little trick you told me where those mines and take some fill it.

66
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.080
Ramon: Start

67
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.150
Ramon: Having that I'll do that right away. It works pretty good.

68
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what you do. I think I heard you say is right, if it's if it's visual you cut out that input with the eyes closed, you grab Water Bottle Coffee bottle screwdriver wrench something

69
00:06:49.740 --> 00:07:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you get into a different neural network that's the science part, but in the dialogue, the inner dialogue. It's gotta include shut the F up

70
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I still don't know whether you're being nice nice nice to the addict inside. I still don't know if you're drawing a firm boundary with that voice inside. Remember, we've done that role that role was in there.

71
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:27.840
Ramon: I'm really close. Like I could say, I've been thinking about it and everything lately I'm really close to drawing that firm line to where like I could feel it coming.

72
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.880
Ramon: Around the corner.

73
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.330
Ramon: I'm not quite there yet, but I could feel it go

74
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as you said that you know what I thought about

75
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought about the argument back being are you effing kidding me, you're gonna kill my kid, like, that's how I found it just now, like you, you're going to kill my kid like I got that anger, you're going to mess with my family.

76
00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you understand that.

77
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.420
Yeah.

78
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, you're not there, but I can find it. I found it on my own. But that's me.

79
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: With this with this baby coming with this family with this ideal with this vision with this dream you've wanted this and now it's coming. And this addict is like focusing on that vein, I mean really.

80
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Your priorities are whack.

81
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.070
Ramon: Yeah.

82
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, that's the conversation like

83
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You really don't get me you don't get me. I'm all about long term happy you're all about short term. Hi, you're going to last in 20 minutes

84
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to be

85
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably lying to go in my doctor starting to talk about making up excuses. I'm going to start hustling I'm money's going to be diverted over here.

86
00:08:54.510 --> 00:09:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: All my all all these other things come back in. That's what the attic wants you to do. It doesn't care about family doesn't care about your baby.

87
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Not at all. Can you imagine talking to a friend like that and keeping that friend in your life.

88
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:13.710
Ramon: Yeah.

89
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not quite ready to have that conversation not quite ready but you can feel it coming right and the maybe the more that that clarity of this this life more sobriety family baby more it becomes clear and clear that this is coming to fruition.

90
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're going to be like

91
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Flipping the bird.

92
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't give it you'll literally as soon as you see it walking towards the door you'll slam the door in its face.

93
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And we have to do that mentally. We've got to be able to do that. Otherwise, we keep feeding it and we romanticize it

94
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it was this, it was that we sit there more and more in that in that neural network of all the things

95
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But clam got a slam it

96
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Off we go. You grab something five senses, which see which field, which are here to taste what you smell.

97
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Call my girl, Assistant, a cute picture.

98
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you, you love me. Good.

99
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, yeah. What, what, what do we get. Okay. So what caught water names. What are we thinking, you know, you get into this other neural network, you get into that thinking, get away from that one. Shut up. You're almost there. You told me you're getting close.

100
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know, I'm going to be like

101
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.300
Ramon: Yeah.

102
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: How's work done.

103
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.630
Ramon: Oh man, there's a little problem. I guess because

104
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:08.310
Ramon: For some reason the shop managers all in his feelings about something. Who knows what I honestly don't know.

105
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:19.170
Ramon: And he made up a lie to my boss and he told my boss that he doesn't want me working in a shop because he's tired of second checking my work.

106
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:33.660
Ramon: double checking my work, which is a lie, cuz he's pulled me off of, like, doing my own personal job to help him like a go do the tractor trailer. Hey finished this trailer over here, you know,

107
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:49.740
Ramon: It shouldn't season. He's got some kind of feeling about something and I quite don't know what it is. I might put a pin on one or two things. But even so, he still lineup. So I asked my boss today.

108
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.080
Ramon: And I said, hey,

109
00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:07.440
Ramon: I said, So is he able to send me home being that I don't work in a shop. I guess he, my boss and my boss, pretty much told me because I haven't been here that long that I'm like the one that gets sent home.

110
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.840
Ramon: Pretty much. And that shouldn't be how work is done.

111
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So where does that come from. It shouldn't be seniority.

112
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:25.740
Ramon: This

113
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:38.430
Ramon: If he doesn't me working in a shop and my boss does and I'm working in there. He'll go home, or tell my boss sent him home where I'm going home and my boss or wanting to stay so bad that he will send me home before

114
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.490
Ramon: Or if Ruben was like, hey, I'm going to quit. If you don't fire this do

115
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You fire.

116
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.060
Ramon: Before he left and click it shouldn't be like that.

117
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're right. No, I see it. I see it. I'm sorry.

118
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I see it now. Okay. Yeah.

119
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:11.760
Ramon: No, I can share them be able to tell me nothing. Because I don't, I'm not a sharp worker. I'm a bumper only boss, I should have is my boss. That's an office. You know what I mean. But that's not how it works. And that's fucked up. Okay.

120
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So it should be one way, but it's not. It's messed up, but it is

121
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

122
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

123
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It is as soon as you walk out. It's going to be like that.

124
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So now it's going to be how Ramon

125
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Lives with that how he navigates that he copes with that how he deals with that the meaning he makes out of it. If you and I just for today, play with the different meaning of it.

126
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

127
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I want to understand. You're, you're really adept which means really good at something, picking up on what people are kind of

128
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: What their mood is and what's up. You know, you're good at reading FX. That's our face.

129
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You have some suspicions about boss's boss's boss, I get lost. If I don't have names. Who's the person that's Catching Feelings with that person's name.

130
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Reuben. Okay, so what do you think you've got it. You've got two ideas about what Reuben is jealous. Maybe, I don't know. What is it, what's up with Reuben.

131
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:37.650
Ramon: Well, mostly. The other day I went on a backlog that cause where we go get tires load them up and bring them back to the shop.

132
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:46.740
Ramon: Whether or not I knew if he knew about it. I showed up to the shop late at like three o'clock. And they're like, oh, where you been

133
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:58.200
Ramon: And I didn't tell him I just told them chillin and working because none of your business. So the next day he tried to make some kind of joke like or reminders of finishes work.

134
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:10.170
Ramon: Then I was like, you got to, got life. I always finished my stuff. What are you talking about, and I think he kind of got in his feelings, because I didn't let him talk about like that.

135
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:17.940
Ramon: And the other day, he didn't. I went on a backhaul. He probably thought I was hiding and chillin this that of helping them in the shop.

136
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:34.530
Ramon: So now he's, he told my boss, which is Danny, he says, hey, I don't want him working in shock because I'm tired. Second, checking his work, which is a, like a straight up like

137
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we can we deconstruct this one I think this might be useful. You open to it.

138
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:42.150
Ramon: Yeah.

139
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's come at it from a slightly different angle.

140
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture.

141
00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if I can do this.

142
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Pauline was out and about.

143
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: doing her thing.

144
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever it was her life. She's an adult.

145
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And you asked her.

146
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And she says,

147
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Live in my life. I'm an adult, doing my thing. How would you feel

148
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to overanalyze just first response. How would you feel

149
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.050
Ramon: Okay, I guess.

150
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.180
Ramon: Yeah.

151
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.190
Ramon: I don't know. Okay.

152
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:52.530
Ramon: The from her out. Be a weird answer because she doesn't answer like that if I answer like that it'd be okay because I, that's what I do. I do that to everybody you this

153
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You're looking to

154
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.690
Ramon: Answer like that.

155
00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You're looking to closely at it. Come back, come back. Let this work for you a little you're looking so close, come back a little bit, let this analogy work for you. Okay, let's see if you can let it work.

156
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If your person your person right person you care about.

157
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Gives you an answer that leaves you like this.

158
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You were suspecting you were Miss trusting. Let's say just work with me here. Let this analogy work. I know we can pick it apart. But then we won't have an entire

159
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:37.500
Ramon: Year, you're gonna have to use somebody else because I don't love her, but I could give to folks about Reuben, you're gonna have to use somebody else.

160
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.620
Ramon: I'm not going to use the woman I love with somebody, I

161
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:52.440
Ramon: Dislike in the same analogy, it doesn't work because I don't have the same feelings for him that I do for her whether I'm letting it go or trying to pretend or whatever my feelings aren't there.

162
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.470
Ramon: To what I'm saying.

163
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have any problems seeing what you're saying, but you won't try this on. You are so persistent in not making learning this work.

164
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:13.230
Ramon: Because either. I don't love him, you're using the woman I love as somebody I dislike that you can't compare it to

165
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I doing with this analogy.

166
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:24.000
Ramon: You're using Pauline, the woman I love are coming home chillin all day and using the same analogy, like I was thinking, what

167
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:33.960
Ramon: If Rubin came in and I asked him, Hey, where you been, and he's like, OH CHILLIN are cool, whatever. Same thing. I wouldn't give a fuck. OK, cool.

168
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:43.620
Ramon: It was chilling work. That's what he said. Pauline and Reuben or two different people. You can use my girlfriend and the woman I love in this situation doesn't work.

169
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.760
Ramon: No.

170
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, it doesn't work.

171
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.210
Ramon: Because I love her.

172
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:50.400
Okay.

173
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't understand. It's an analogy. It's not a real thing you

174
00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.200
Ramon: But

175
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.950
Ramon: But what it doesn't work.

176
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, neither just

177
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.930
Ramon: Wanted to work. You want it to work and it won't work. It doesn't work.

178
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You try it.

179
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:17.910
Ramon: My girlfriend coming in after a long day doing whatever she was doing at her saying that would never happen. So

180
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What is my clinical intent.

181
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:29.070
Ramon: To pretend my girlfriend came in and did that. How would I feel if she did that to me.

182
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:29.970
Like

183
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You're wrong.

184
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.020
Ramon: What is it

185
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.710
Ramon: Let's try it out. Let's try it out. What is it,

186
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.350
Ramon: Let's try it out. Let's try it out. What do you want me to try. Oh, come on.

187
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You're funny. That will never happen. See what you don't see is, I know the game. We're in

188
00:19:53.340 --> 00:20:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I was gonna say before I even did this and I said, a little bit of it. Give this a chance. And I had this really long pause, because I was thinking

189
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, I hope he doesn't get offended. I hope he doesn't. And I even said, a little bit of to try not to over analyze it, try to just get your first response and we could have moved. But now we're talking about the analogy, and now it's moved before we were talking about words and

190
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

191
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to drop that

192
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't quite see that this whole thing this whole thing nice talking to you is in service to you this whole my whole effort. My showing up here.

193
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:36.840
Ramon: For to what

194
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.550
Ramon: You want me to let things work. That doesn't work for me.

195
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:53.130
Ramon: And then you want me to try to accept that try to make it work. That does not work for me using my girlfriend in place with somebody, I do not like does not work for, I'm sorry.

196
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: You're wrong, you're wrong.

197
00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It is what is happening right now.

198
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.170
Ramon: But

199
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.180
Ramon: Ever since I've been doing this therapy.

200
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: When

201
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.760
Ramon: You had me do these little

202
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.710
Ramon: Exercises, and you want me to

203
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.780
Ramon: Do certain way.

204
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.070
Wait.

205
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait.

206
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Try to name. What's going on between you and I see if you can do it. What is happening right now that could be happening, also in other pockets of your life, what am I doing it can also parallel because that's what fair, it is, it happens in here, what also happens out there.

207
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.980
Ramon: I guess trying to control how I actor think I don't know.

208
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What line. Let's sit there and see how true that is

209
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.390
Ramon: It's really true. Yeah.

210
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: someone's trying to control me. Are you feeling that and you do not like it.

211
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.030
Ramon: Yeah, more or less, I guess.

212
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The next useful.

213
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That all of this.

214
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All of it.

215
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all in service to you. So we take that feeling control whether it was a Pauline are going in here doesn't matter it's I'm trying to communicate and teach something. And so I think we got there, how we get there. I'm not hung up on on it.

216
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on to this feeling control. Let's say that's the useful piece here today.

217
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to Ruben for a second. I'm going to clear my errors on

218
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: The missing piece. I was taking a little bit of notes.

219
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm using probably the wrong word. I'm going to say that Hall. Is that the right term of what you were doing all okay

220
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So it looks like this.

221
00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: No one knows what he's doing.

222
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:04.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what you're doing. This is you, in my left hand Ramon knows what he's doing.

223
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.570
Ramon: A remote boss Danny knows what he's doing. So does everybody in the office.

224
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but Reuben doesn't

225
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Hang on to it.

226
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:15.510
Okay.

227
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: If Ruben is me.

228
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

229
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it similar like

230
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm not telling Ruben

231
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I was I was doing a bad call but there's something about Reuben.

232
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You aren't going to give him anything

233
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It's none of his business.

234
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But that was a piece of missing information. We gave him the benefit of the doubt the most generous of assumption. You don't have to love them.

235
00:23:52.020 --> 00:24:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But we're going to be working with him right if we just said, well, maybe he doesn't know kind of care. I know what I was up to. Oh, I was doing backhaul

236
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice how you deliberately think I could be wrong didn't tell him where you were. You said

237
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I was working all day, I was, you know, I think of something like that. You kind of held that piece, the detail of it, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, because it's none of his effin business. I know what I'm doing. You're not my boss and I don't know you.

238
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but do you know if that were true.

239
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: All of this next step and then the next step. The next step. If all it was just as easy to just say, oh, I was doing a bad call I thought everybody already knew.

240
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And that could be it. There are a lot of different ways it could have played out. But I think you really dislike Rubin.

241
00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:03.210
Ramon: Well, it's because he uses his little power, that He has an abuser because he shop manager.

242
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:15.150
Ramon: And I really want him to be put in his place to let him know that he's not my manager. I don't work in the shop, my title is a lumber. I worked outside and trailer

243
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:25.530
Ramon: So whether I helped them in the shop or not is my decision. I do not have to help them. And I've been told that by my own boss. I don't have to help them.

244
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:34.110
Ramon: I chose to help them and they got used to sort of that went on the back on. I wasn't in there helping him. He's probably all sad about it.

245
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:45.210
Ramon: But he needs to be put in this place already and my boss is too nice to let him know hey leave Ramon alone. You're not his boss.

246
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:56.190
Ramon: So now I have to talk to the main boss, I gotta get the corporate number and call corporate and talk to my boss and let him know what's going on because I honestly don't think it's right at all.

247
00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:05.820
Ramon: Ruben should not be able to tell me whether or not I have to go home. I have a family to take care of, because he's in his feelings that shouldn't be right.

248
00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It shouldn't be right. It shouldn't be right. It shouldn't be right. I don't all about aside, it happened. That's the difference between it actually happened.

249
00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You withheld information because you want to prove a point to Ruben you want him put in his place. And somehow you with holding that little we're only taking a tight. Don't go too far away from it just right there. I don't want to tell them screw him right

250
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't answer to him.

251
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: If you really want the power then is nothing but a thing. I'll just tell them

252
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can go up the chain of command as you did and say I don't quite understand the hierarchy here. I watched this thing happened where I had to be like home.

253
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they don't want someone else to leave. I don't quite understand the dynamics in the workplace. What, what is my course of action. Here you see it like

254
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You actually you, you do have the power you have the power of your response.

255
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You have the power of not given a flying be about Rubin has this information doesn't have this information, you

256
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:39.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have to be the one to put them in his place. There's if if I am busy. If we are busy trying to get all these people in place. We're going to be a full time job trying to get people in their place.

257
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you truly is in your. It sounds like he's actually could get in the way of you actually earning a living, so I can see why you want to bring it up the chain.

258
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:49.710
Ramon: Exactly.

259
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Messing with your money and I can see that.

260
00:27:53.310 --> 00:28:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That part I get. And so what you took action. You went up, you get you're going to call, you're going to go up the chain whatever's happening here at this mid level management isn't working.

261
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not addressing it. You

262
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Might not and I get that the only part therapist is interested in is right here. You already know how to move things up the chain you know already know self advocacy. It's in this this piece because it also happened here.

263
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want that feeling of someone trying to control me. I think it plays out here, and I think it may play out elsewhere and you're missing opportunities, I think.

264
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Be at peace.

265
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: There might have been a perceived threat. Maybe when there was none.

266
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because notice how intense it got in here with even us

267
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know my good intention.

268
00:28:53.130 --> 00:29:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have any other I'm not up to anything else, whatever's in your ways and my way. I'm on your side 110

269
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But even me. I can feel threatening. I'm not calling you scared. I'm saying, like, that's why we got poof, I got upset with me. I was coming at you and almost like I was coming at the woman you love like get off the topic. It was a perception of threat if you can have control over that.

270
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It, you can catch it in its early phase.

271
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't care.

272
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You can let go the power of it, it loses its power.

273
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: When you just go out, let me, let me see what this let me see what this lady's off to let me see what she's doing with this cool. Look at me. I really don't like her talking about Pauline, what I really don't like that at all. Let me look at that. Let me see what's coming up for me.

274
00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And we and we stay with that. So giving your therapist, that's me a chance to say what's coming up. This is a big reaction.

275
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's big.

276
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And and letting therapists do therapy.

277
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. You've been patient. You've been letting me talk. What's going on for you over there.

278
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.130
Ramon: No.

279
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:24.690

Ramon: I'm just

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:10.530
Ramon: Me.

296
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.040
Yeah.

297
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What about feelings of excitement and curiosity.

298
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about other parts of your life. Maybe I kind of brought in some fatigue in some of our conversation. But what about the light and the bright to new exciting about those things you're looking forward to

299
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What

300
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm asking you about them.

301
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.140
Ramon: Sure, so

302
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What, tell me more about the fatigue.

303
00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The I'm tired.

304
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.890
Ramon: I guess sorta

305
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.250
Ramon: Thinking, the

306
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.990
Ramon: I don't know the mental stress, I guess.

307
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Said, put it on me. I want to be the breadwinner but you you have a lot of pressure, you know, to be a provider, and I know you've asked for it. And I know that's your value system.

308
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But it is a lot of pressure.

309
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you got this dodo bird Reuben right is messing with it.

310
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And your mind is going around it around and thinking and thinking about it, what's up with this guy wants his next move. I want to get ahead of it. Is that where it's going.

311
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.480
Ramon: Is really what I just want to slap them in this place where yeah

312
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I've heard. I've heard these phrases before from my folks.

313
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it, it sets that power differential that worked in custody. You know, like, okay, we now we know and sometimes y'all even become best not saying you guys are the best friends, but sometimes it happens that now there's like this new respect somehow that was the order of things.

314
00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, it'll play out like that.

315
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm afraid you want someone

316
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:45.870
Who

317
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:48.090
Ramon: Have done it.

318
00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.260
Yeah.

319
00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:55.020
Ramon: More, more every day. It's last week.

320
00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What would happen

321
00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: If you straight up.

322
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: stopped caring about what he thinks of you. What if you completely isolated that when he didn't care anymore.

323
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.670
Ramon: Even if I did it.

324
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.070
Ramon: it'll still work with it'll still affect my working like

325
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:31.830
Ramon: Cuz, even if I didn't care what he thought, whatever. And I'm minding my own business. Let's just say I was chilling out there by the trailer

326
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:38.100
Ramon: It would find a reason to give me settle because he dislikes that I don't care.

327
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.180
Ramon: You see what I'm saying.

328
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.530
Ramon: So I need to be able to take that power of him.

329
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:56.400
Ramon: Being able to send me home or tell me what to do. I need to get that. That way I could walk around and not really care what he thinks.

330
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can see why you have that as your solution.

331
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you also believe that there might be other solutions, not just that one.

332
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.240
Ramon: I honestly don't think there is

333
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:22.140
Ramon: Because I've tried, I tried talking to the main boss here and he still like, Oh, well. You're the new guy. And I've been here over nine months now. I was there a year.

334
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:28.080
Ramon: So come on with that new guy shit.

335
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We should have a magic wand. I wish I could

336
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: sell you on an idea of tactical empathy of the magic that it can create

337
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Said, you've tried everything so

338
00:36:53.910 --> 00:37:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Work at the chain of command that might just work, you know, maybe there's a pattern. Maybe he does this to all the new folks that come in.

339
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:12.540
Ramon: Those night. That's the only reason I know this is because he's told me stories and others people's told me stories about stuff, just like this, where he gets mad, and he's like, it's me are

340
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

341
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.110
Ramon: So, yeah.

342
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:17.130
Okay.

343
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

344
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they may have a record of it. And so then maybe they'll, they'll intervene. I hope they do.

345
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's

346
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.360

357
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think about that.

358
00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:51.900
Ramon: Yeah.

359
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.360
Ramon: Yeah yeah that'll work.

360
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it.

361
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And this text challenge. Do you think that by then maybe we'll be back to being able to confirm appointments via text.

362
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.260
Ramon: Yeah, no, I'm getting an echo today.

363
00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

364
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:21.630
Ramon: It's just cuz last week I before I got paid. I had a switch, they could count because I filled out this scam thing.

365
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.820
Ramon: So for the last five months.

366
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:39.300
Ramon: They've been taking $2 out of my bank account every month. So I had to go switch my bank account and close my old one and my direct deposit got sent to my old bank account. So I had to wait till today to get my paycheck that I was supposed to get on Friday.

367
00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.820
Ramon: So I wasn't able to pay my bills but it'll all be paid today.

368
00:39:47.490 --> 00:40:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a quick if we can little process kind of run through a couple of snapshots. Maybe almost seeing like a film strip with little, little flashes of different things that happened today just give yourself a little bit of time to let it sort of move through

369
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: A sense of what you're coming away with, it's important to you.

370
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We had backlighting so I couldn't see you for these last probably 60 seconds.

371
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you hear my invitation.

372
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.340
Ramon: Yeah, I was doing it actually

373
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice

374
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.850
Ramon: I noticed I was walking on eggshells all day at work.

375
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You think I had an impact on on our interaction to

376
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.780
Ramon: Oh yeah, definitely.

377
00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Powerful stuff right we bring in relationships.

378
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And how did you see

379
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: eggshells, and then another snapshot of what happened and then another snapshot and now this one. And how are we now,

380
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.650
Ramon: What do you mean

381
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you on eggshells now.

382
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.440
Ramon: Oh no, I'm good.

383
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Are we now.

384
00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.190
Ramon: We're, we're good.

385
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So we had this, we had this, we had this and now we're good.

386
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.240
Ramon: And so I walk out this door here.

387
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I did here with me, you can do if you want to with someone else.

388
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever you did it made it possible to feel good again in here, you can do that if you want to be around someone else as well because I'm imagining. You don't want to be on eggshells, it's an unpleasant feeling

389
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:26.550
Ramon: Yeah.

390
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want you can think about, what did you do to make possible that we're good.

391
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's maybe the part as you kind of move throughout the day, or you're kind of doing kind of tasks that we can allow your mind to drift and process.

392
00:42:47.580 --> 00:43:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What did I do in there. I didn't hang up. I didn't walk out. What did I do I stay here and we ended up kind of being good kind of look at what you did and then see if that's a skill that you could apply to people that kind of irritated, a little bit or do this thing like you

393
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We are trying to control you.

394
00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Identify what you did.

395
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:13.470

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.680

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So I guess if you can hear me. I'll just one last invitation. If you want just pay attention to what you did to make possible for us to be good as we ended here today. OK.

400
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.800
Ramon: I will go out there, take the butter right now, actually.

401
00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

402
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.170
Ramon: I don't know what I did.

403
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't know your your your least half of this interaction or

404
00:43:56.730 --> 00:44:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I mean I did some stuff. And I know what I did you use to take a peek of what you didn't see what you come up with

405
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.230
Ramon: The right

406
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Group. Bye bye.
