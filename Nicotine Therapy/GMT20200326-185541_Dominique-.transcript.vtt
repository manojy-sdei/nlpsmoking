00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.049
Dominique Pozo: Hi.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.509
Dianna Jaramillo: Hi, Dominic, how are you

3
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.450
Dominique Pozo: Good. Hey, sorry, I didn't see I was doing other work and

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.559
Dianna Jaramillo: This was

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.700
Dominique Pozo: Minimized and I

6
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.009
Dominique Pozo: Thought it would. I would hear a ding when you came back.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.980
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh yeah, oh no problem at all. I'm just here.

8
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.230
Dominique Pozo: Oh, good. Oh, so

9
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.980
Dianna Jaramillo: How's it going, I'm

10
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.750
Dianna Jaramillo: Interesting things have been interesting. That's for sure.

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.680
Dianna Jaramillo: To say

12
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.430
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, it's just been weird everything. Everything feels kind of weird with all this stuff that's going on and everything, you know, getting shut down and

13
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.630
Dianna Jaramillo: It just feels weird. It's a weird vibe out there.

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.840
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Have you been out there much or

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.430
Dianna Jaramillo: Um, no. Not too much. Not really. We went did

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.550
Dianna Jaramillo: A couple of things yesterday, but I'm not really in town or anything like that.

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.360
Dianna Jaramillo: But people seem to still be going all over these, they're still going to

18
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.210
Dianna Jaramillo: The stores and, you know, still going out. So I mean, even with this.

19
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.600
Dianna Jaramillo: Thing, they, they called for, what's it called,

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.190
Dianna Jaramillo: The home where everybody's supposed to stay at home.

21
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.460
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, kind of like a quarantine. Just keep yourself at home.

22
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, yeah. But people are still out in about, you know, so I don't know it's probably not smart when people do that, but

23
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.510
Dominique Pozo: No surprise.

24
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.930
Dianna Jaramillo: Yet you know there's a lot of people still catching it. So, oh,

25
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.790
Dominique Pozo: Totally, yeah i know i think it's i think it's wise to just honor the

26
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.950
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you know what the government's asking for just at least for another few

27
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.070
Dianna Jaramillo: Weeks. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I agree.

28
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:57.510
Dianna Jaramillo: So, but other than that, you know, it's just been kind of rough. You know, it's no in there's like no income at all right now and

29
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.100
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, and

30
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.980
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, just being home and like that that's just sort of how it's been

31
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.680
Dianna Jaramillo: And, um,

32
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.670
Dianna Jaramillo: What else, I don't know. That's, that's pretty much all that's been going on just been home you know

33
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.580
Dominique Pozo: You. I think in group you alluded to a lot of anxiety or something. It seemed like

34
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.880
Dominique Pozo: Really heightened does this it's, I mean, it seems really

35
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.010
Dianna Jaramillo: Related yeah I don't know if it has anything to do with

36
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:38.370
Dianna Jaramillo: All this other stuff this virus and all this stuff. I think it has more to do with like no money and not knowing you know how

37
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:52.020
Dianna Jaramillo: How we're going to support ourselves and pay rent and like my phone, you know, um, I only have access to my phone right now because I called the company straight talk

38
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.640
Dianna Jaramillo: And I told them.

39
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.310
Dianna Jaramillo: That I can't get to the store and

40
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.550
Dianna Jaramillo: So I can, you know, get a phone card.

41
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.300
Dianna Jaramillo: So they ended up giving me five free days of service.

42
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.410
Dominique Pozo: Oh, good to know.

43
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:13.680
Dianna Jaramillo: So, at least that's something you know, but I'm, I'm, or it's already like three days to two days in so my phone will be often another

44
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.210
Dianna Jaramillo: Days, but they said

45
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.340
Dianna Jaramillo: Call back if if things get worse. You know, they said, Call back and hopefully they'll be able to help me again.

46
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.170
Dianna Jaramillo: But that's scary to not

47
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Just to not even have access to a phone and you know communication and knowing, knowing what's going on.

48
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.300
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, this is your link to connection with people.

49
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.110
Yeah.

50
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.640
Dominique Pozo: You know, I know the last time we spoke, you were considering asking your dad to spend some time with you.

51
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.570
Dominique Pozo: That ever happened.

52
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.390
Dianna Jaramillo: No, things got worse there too.

53
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.280
Dominique Pozo: Oh, no.

54
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.910
What happened.

55
00:03:49.170 --> 00:04:03.750
Dianna Jaramillo: We were talking all like normal, like, cool, like we always do. Every. I don't know. Few days or once a week or whatever we were talk text, not even really talk. Um, and

56
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:13.200
Dianna Jaramillo: Um, I actually asked him to help me with my phone so I could get a phone card. And I asked for his help. And, um,

57
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.740
Dianna Jaramillo: And he just kind of blew me off.

58
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:29.400
Dianna Jaramillo: He didn't. He didn't really say yes or no. And so I waited a couple days and I texted him again. I asked him for help and I mean I haven't asked my dad for help.

59
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.260
Dianna Jaramillo: At all in a whole year.

60
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.920
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, and I

61
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.770
Dianna Jaramillo: I even for all the years that I was working. I never once asked my dad for help or anything like that.

62
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.920
Dianna Jaramillo: And now he's refusing I guess just refusing because he never even texted me back. The last time I texted him.

63
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:58.500
Dianna Jaramillo: And asked him for help and and that that just blows my mind like even my boyfriend was saying like he's he's known some messed up parents, you know, like people that are just messed up to their kids, but nobody ever like my parents.

64
00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Mm hmm.

65
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.060
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, and that that is frickin hurtful.

66
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.990
Dominique Pozo: That is like

67
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.070
Dianna Jaramillo: I never really, I guess, realized that because

68
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.460
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't really have anything to compare it to. You know, like the way my parents are with me.

69
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:25.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Until now, like now I see it because I see how like my boyfriend is with his parents and how they treat him and my parents aren't like that anywhere near that.

70
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.070
Dianna Jaramillo: With me

71
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.170
Dianna Jaramillo: His parents treat me better than my parents do

72
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.450
Dianna Jaramillo: Gosh, thank God for that I'm really thankful for them.

73
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.320
Uh huh.

74
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.210
Dominique Pozo: I mean, what I

75
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.660
Dominique Pozo: I'm I'm hearing that you like you're making yourself vulnerable with your dad and you're opening

76
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.910
Dominique Pozo: yourself up. And when we do that yourself up to the possibility of being hurt and it's what's happening.

77
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.830
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And I was actually even thinking of maybe like

78
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.460
Dianna Jaramillo: texting him something and saying something like, I don't know really what but

79
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.590
Like

80
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.510
Dianna Jaramillo: Seeing something, you know, like this is how you treat your own blood, you know,

81
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:18.990
Dianna Jaramillo: Here your daughter, your only daughter and I just, I don't know. It's like, I feel they feel kind of confrontational about it because it's

82
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:26.010
Dianna Jaramillo: It's just bull. It's bullshit. It's bullshit. The way that he's doing this to me because I haven't asked him for help. Like I said for years.

83
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:40.500
Dianna Jaramillo: And he can help me. He's got the he's he's well off, and he could totally help me in a heartbeat and and i think probably to his stupid wife has something to do with this to could I remember telling us

84
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:53.400
Dianna Jaramillo: A little bit about that situation where she's just she's never really liked me and you know she's she painter is is the control of his neck. You know, like she tells him where to turn his head.

85
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.260
Dianna Jaramillo: Well, I just have

86
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.430
Dominique Pozo: Always been towards

87
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:13.800
Dianna Jaramillo: Towards what yeah well towards their family because they have two sons together, you know, and so I think like that's that's her focus. That's all she cares about. She doesn't give a shit that he had, you know, that he has me and had me in his life anyway.

88
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.120
Dianna Jaramillo: You know that just sucks it sucks.

89
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.540
Dominique Pozo: I mean, from from what I'm hearing at the heart of it all you want connection with your dad.

90
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:39.630
Dominique Pozo: And when I hear you say that you want us you're feeling. I don't remember confrontational. And I think those are totally valid feelings and I'm not sure if it's going to

91
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:49.860
Dominique Pozo: Create the kind of connection you want. I think it will create connection because he might respond with his own confrontational reaction.

92
00:07:50.340 --> 00:08:04.200
Dominique Pozo: Yet to get the actual kind of connection you want. I'm wondering, does it feel too vulnerable to to let him know that you know this is hurtful. You're confused. You don't understand. You wanted some clarity around why

93
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.210
Dianna Jaramillo: Well, I kind of already did that. A few weeks ago when

94
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.200
Dianna Jaramillo: I was talking to him and

95
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:24.510
Dianna Jaramillo: And he was being really cold with me. And the thing is, is like my God is not a really warm lovey W kind of person is. It is. He's, he's just very like

96
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:40.050
Dianna Jaramillo: even keel and kind of, you know, quiet and internal, you know, kind of person, but with me my whole entire life. He's, he's always been loving with me.

97
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.140
Dianna Jaramillo: He was never like that with any of my siblings or

98
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:54.870
Dianna Jaramillo: Or even like my mom. He was never like that he's always been really good to me. He we used to be really close. And if I needed help. He was right there, no matter what. And no matter what I was involved in, he would always helped me

99
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:06.660
Dianna Jaramillo: And anyway, so a few weeks ago when I was talking to him and he was just being really cold with me and it was bothering me. So I did exactly that I did just that. And

100
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:17.070
Dianna Jaramillo: And I tried to talk to him and and say, I told him I don't know what's going on. But, you know, with you or why I feel like you're

101
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:26.970
Dianna Jaramillo: Being cold with me or you know you're kind of blowing the offer, whatever, but it's it's not it doesn't feel fair and I and I even told him, I have a feeling my mom.

102
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.710
Dianna Jaramillo: might have something to do with this because she's probably talking about about me.

103
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:43.110
Dianna Jaramillo: To my dad just because she doesn't like me or doesn't want anything to do with me. I have a feeling she was telling him on probably on drugs or I'm doing this, or I'm doing that, you know, just because me and her aren't living together.

104
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:55.500
Dianna Jaramillo: She thinks I'm out there just running wild and, you know, play, play doing drugs. And I think that's probably what she was telling him. So I told him that. So I don't know what my mom's telling you, but I, I hope that

105
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:03.330
Dianna Jaramillo: You will at least talk to me and asked me, because I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm not doing drugs. I'm not, you know, doing anything.

106
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:12.630
Dianna Jaramillo: Horrible like what you might be hearing. And so I just told him, I want you to know that. And after I said that he kind of lightened up and

107
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:24.780
Dianna Jaramillo: Then he was being a little, a little bit more cool with me, like, like what I was used to, you know, from my dad. But then now all of a sudden, a few weeks later I asked him for help and

108
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.290
Dianna Jaramillo: And nothing. It's like he just totally

109
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:39.960
Dianna Jaramillo: turned everything off. It's really weird. So that's why, like, I don't want to keep on like, not so much. It's kind of like kissing ass. I feel like I have to kiss his ass to get his

110
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:54.210
Dianna Jaramillo: To get any attention or love from him, you know, and I don't want, I don't want to have to be begging anybody for their love ya know, whatever. I don't want to do that. And I already did that. I did that a few weeks ago.

111
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.870
Dianna Jaramillo: So that's why I feel like now I feel like I need to just say it and just

112
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:09.270
Dianna Jaramillo: Be straight up. And again, like my dad's not a confrontational person if I say something if I text him something like what I just said. I doubt he would even respond at all. I thought he would even

113
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.870
Dianna Jaramillo: Say anything. I don't even know. But I know it wouldn't be you know something I don't want to be hateful. I mean,

114
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:24.180
Dominique Pozo: I just want to my concern. My concern is that you're feeling it seems to me you're feeling hurt, angry, maybe some resentment.

115
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:36.900
Dominique Pozo: And and that you're going to just be left with this. That's my only concern. So I'm just thinking, you know, how can you move through this in a way where you're not left just feeling bad and and

116
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.940
Dianna Jaramillo: With nothing. Nothing.

117
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.470
Dominique Pozo: Right. How about, do you want to do some art around it. I i really i

118
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.450
Dominique Pozo: believe so much in art and I

119
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.050
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

120
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.250
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean you're late work.

121
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.960
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. And I'm gonna invite you to do it with your non dominant hand.

122
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.840
Dominique Pozo: Okay, that really taps a

123
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.130
Dominique Pozo: Part of the brain that

124
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.750
Dominique Pozo: We don't typically use

125
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.190
Dominique Pozo: And so new information can come through when we use our Non dominant hand.

126
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.440
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay. Yeah, definitely.

127
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.030
Dominique Pozo: So I think

128
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.320
Dominique Pozo: So the directive.

129
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:19.500
Dominique Pozo: That I'm going to give you is what would be the best way you could take care of yourself through this. It hurts. It's disappointing.

130
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:31.950
Dominique Pozo: It's confusing, all these things that what would be really the best way, the most nurturing way to take care of Diana with your dad may or may not ever do this, he may or may not ever come around. But how can you

131
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:47.730
Dominique Pozo: Take best care. And you can either start writing with your non dominant hand, or you can draw an image if you close your eyes and you imagine the best care, you could give yourself, given the situation. So you can do both. It could be writing and drawing

132
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.440
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

133
00:12:50.070 --> 00:13:04.560
Dominique Pozo: Okay, because at this point. What I'm really wanting to encourage is that it's so hard. It's so hard, but that at this point you become your, your own mother and your own father because if they're not showing up for you. We cannot control.

134
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:15.780
Dominique Pozo: Another human and and it's really, it does. It's not really the highest wish. I get that. But you know if this is what you're working with. And what would that look like to be your own best mother and father

135
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay.

136
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.450
Dominique Pozo: For yourself yet.

137
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.910
Dominique Pozo: It's your boyfriend watching TV over there.

138
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.480
Dominique Pozo: I can. Okay. I was just wondering if it's distracting for you. Is it okay for you.

139
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:19.140
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh no, it's fine. Yeah, it's fine for me, we're kind of in a in a studio type situation. So there's not a whole lot of room.

140
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:19.560
Dianna Jaramillo: No.

141
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:26.310
Dominique Pozo: It's all good. And make sure that you have, you feel like you've got enough space to really process on on your

142
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:26.730
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

143
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.200
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

144
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.430
Dominique Pozo: Totally. Okay.

145
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.230
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, take your time really

146
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:43.410
Dominique Pozo: Really be with this. And even when you think you're done just give yourself another baby. Close your eyes and see if there's anything else that wants to come through. Okay.

147
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.350
Dominique Pozo: And notice to as you do this, just notice your body and

148
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.240
Dominique Pozo: And any little

149
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:10.050
Dominique Pozo: Sensations or anything that that comes from your body because our body holds so many messages to

150
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.910
Dominique Pozo: So really linking

151
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:18.810
Dominique Pozo: Like that creative process with the somatic process all of it. There's so much more information than just in our head.

152
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.520
Dominique Pozo: That we can

153
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.130
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay, okay.

154
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.260
Dominique Pozo: What what came through for you.

155
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.320
Dianna Jaramillo: So they sort of

156
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.780
Dianna Jaramillo: Started drying.

157
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.400
Dianna Jaramillo: Line between in the middle of the paper like

158
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:13.830
Dianna Jaramillo: Like a break.

159
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.110
Dianna Jaramillo: Take a break on grass.

160
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.850
Dianna Jaramillo: And then two little lines on the outside like a broken tie

161
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:23.550
Dianna Jaramillo: Like snapped in the middle.

162
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:32.520
Dianna Jaramillo: And then on that, on that side on one side, they put parents and parents and then on the other side of myself.

163
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:41.790
Dianna Jaramillo: And on my parents site. It's a little broken heart and then on my site. It's a whole heart and I put I'm whole all on my own.

164
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.600
Dianna Jaramillo: And I, my parents side CAN'T CHANGE ANYONE.

165
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.580
Dianna Jaramillo: Marty's Victor them blood

166
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.330
Dianna Jaramillo: It's, it's, I did it all with my Non dominant hand. So it's hard to read book.

167
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.900
Dominique Pozo: Yes. Okay. What does that mean to you. Mothers thicker than blood

168
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:06.510
Dianna Jaramillo: That, you know, basically, I get treated better by people. I have no blood relation with

169
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:14.010
Dianna Jaramillo: People that that I don't even know very well. Treat me better than my own blood.

170
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:14.820
Hmm.

171
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.320
Dominique Pozo: So what is that mud. I've just never, I don't think I've ever heard or

172
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.970
Dominique Pozo: What is the mud represent. Is that what does it mean

173
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:30.000
Dianna Jaramillo: Just, I don't, I don't know. I guess I really never thought about that either just

174
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.970
Dianna Jaramillo: It's just not blood, it's, it's just

175
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:45.810
Dominique Pozo: I okay well maybe I'm maybe what I'm hearing is there's more substance in the mud than in your blood relations.

176
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.460
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes. Yeah, exactly.

177
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.090
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

178
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:55.920
Dominique Pozo: You know what's really cool too. I'm thinking of this is leading me to think of where lotuses come from, you know, the beautiful lotus flowers.

179
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:07.860
Dominique Pozo: grow so much. So it's like hey you're creating a new reality for yourself and maybe your boyfriend and his family and whatever other friendships, you have this is your new family and

180
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:17.070
Dominique Pozo: You know, you're it. It seems to me to. It's all about reciprocity in a circle of giving and receiving and giving and receiving

181
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.630
Dominique Pozo: And really choosing

182
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.390
Dominique Pozo: Where you do that so that you don't keep hurting yourself.

183
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:34.650
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, yeah. Yes, definitely. Because even in the case of other other people. Any other people that are that do treat me better and show me more love than my own

184
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.750
Dianna Jaramillo: Family my own blowed even in that case, it's like still

185
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.930
Dianna Jaramillo: I have so much gratitude.

186
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.330
Dianna Jaramillo: For that, but like

187
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.250
Dianna Jaramillo: It's still hard to like I still feel myself holding back

188
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.300
Dominique Pozo: Totally

189
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.310
Dianna Jaramillo: A lot. Yeah, because

190
00:19:53.460 --> 00:20:03.990
Dianna Jaramillo: Because of that, like, because that's not you know it's different with your own family. People are different with their own family when you have family members that that take care of you and that love you and

191
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.020
Dianna Jaramillo: You know that you have a decent relationship with like there's a different kind of connection there. That's a different kind of

192
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.180
Dianna Jaramillo: Relationship.

193
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.510
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, then somebody who is not part of that family.

194
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:23.310
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, even, even if there is a good relationship there so I i do kill myself, kind of, you know, like

195
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.060
Dianna Jaramillo: I guess I don't know, like, not really. I don't know about so much holding back but Lake

196
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.790
Dianna Jaramillo: Lake just alone. You know, like I just go freaking alone.

197
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.110
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

198
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Because of this,

199
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:53.130
Dominique Pozo: I think what and I and it's definitely coming up is just the grief, you know, and not and I don't want to set aside the grief that sure you may have great people in your life. And that's a really painful. It really hurts you know

200
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.490
Yeah.

201
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.210
Dominique Pozo: So I'm wondering to

202
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:09.180
Dominique Pozo: How can you honor this grief and maybe on a daily basis, you know, maybe, maybe making like a little altar. Have you ever made an altar for something

203
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.130
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah

204
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:22.260
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, maybe making an altar, so that that part knows it's not forgotten and that you're, you're going to keep stroking that part of you that hurts and I from

205
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:39.210
Dominique Pozo: Well, I've never experienced what you're experiencing, so I can't say that it will pass, although with deep grief. I think if we keep stroking intending to it at least it the wound isn't so we're all the time. You know what I mean, like, yeah.

206
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.140
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean it. Yeah.

207
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.670
Dominique Pozo: It's gonna be there. It's not going to go away. No matter how much love and

208
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:45.900
Dianna Jaramillo: Kindness.

209
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.400
Dominique Pozo: Received from other people.

210
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.810
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, exactly.

211
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.210
Dianna Jaramillo: Exactly what what would. That's a good idea.

212
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:59.100
Dominique Pozo: What would an altar look like like can you think of objects or even drawing out the altar just imagining it in your mind. You know what we

213
00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.400
Yeah.

214
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.400
Dianna Jaramillo: That's a good idea. Um,

215
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.300
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know. I don't really know. I think

216
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.210
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know. I would have to put some thought into it. I think, you know, and just

217
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.350
Dianna Jaramillo: Makes us something meaningful.

218
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.090
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

219
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.310
Dianna Jaramillo: Something up you know

220
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:28.470
Dominique Pozo: Something that's coming to my mind is really considering objects that are symbols for tenderness and strength.

221
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.550
Dominique Pozo: No, because seems like this is the most tender thing.

222
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.540
Dominique Pozo: And it's calling on you to like call on your strength.

223
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:43.080
Dominique Pozo: As well. So what do you, what could be some symbols of tenderness and strength.

224
00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.390
Dianna Jaramillo: There's a lot of them. I can't really think of one. I know there's a lot of them.

225
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:11.610
Dominique Pozo: And I'm really speaking to you because you're an artist, and I know you know we work in the realm of symbol that's

226
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.340
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely.

227
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:19.020
Dominique Pozo: Have you on the paper with your non dominant hand write the word tender.

228
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.920
Dominique Pozo: And then write the word strength and just see what what comes in.

229
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:31.770
Dominique Pozo: Don't even think about it. Just let it come, no matter how disconnected, it may seem, you know, from the actual thing just see what comes through.

230
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:25.770
Very well.

231
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.230
Be that my private transport.

232
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.250
Dianna Jaramillo: I really can't think of anything for

233
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:45.390
Like

234
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.030
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know.

235
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.830
Dianna Jaramillo: It's weird. I don't know. I

236
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.310
Dianna Jaramillo: Guess I just haven't felt felt that in so long. You know,

237
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.890
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, I just can't really

238
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:17.970
Dominique Pozo: Take a moment and think back to the last time you did feel it what what was going on for you. Where, where were you in your life, what did what was the reality. You were in the last time you felt strong

239
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.510
Dianna Jaramillo: Independence, I guess, like I was

240
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:29.910
Doing

241
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.650
Dianna Jaramillo: I was doing things trying to help other people

242
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.450
Dianna Jaramillo: Uh huh. And

243
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.220
Dianna Jaramillo: I felt good about that. Keynote.

244
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.450
Dianna Jaramillo: Knowing probably most of the people.

245
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.720
Dianna Jaramillo: Or putting very much effort into it. I still felt really good about what I was doing.

246
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.090
Dominique Pozo: Happiness or not made me so

247
00:25:55.020 --> 00:26:01.380
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that's, that's a huge thing for me. I mean it. It was it always was my whole life. You know, it's

248
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:09.450
Dianna Jaramillo: I've always I feel like it's just natural for me to be that person to be

249
00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.970
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, giving and generous and and

250
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.130
Dianna Jaramillo: More, more, I don't know, kind

251
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.000
Dianna Jaramillo: That strength, you know, in a big way is

252
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:36.870
Dominique Pozo: Kindness. Okay, there's one, there's something. And what I hear, too, is when you're able to offer and, you know, share, share your gifts that that is what gives you strength.

253
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.300
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna put up

254
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.830
Dominique Pozo: And focusing it sounds to me like focusing your energy.

255
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.730
Dominique Pozo: In the acts of

256
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.070
Dominique Pozo: In acts of service is a big one.

257
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.230
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah

258
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.590
Dominique Pozo: And I can see why you know at this time.

259
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:07.110
Dominique Pozo: If you're not able to do that. There's a lot of time and space to let your mind go to the pain and the disappointment and all that.

260
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.800
Dianna Jaramillo: But yeah

261
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:16.470
Dominique Pozo: Definitely I imagine that you know once you do start engaging more you're going to be full with other things. It's like

262
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:17.910
Dominique Pozo: All the

263
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.500
Dominique Pozo: Issues with your mom and dad will still be there, but they're not going to be in the forefront because you're gonna be

264
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.040
Dianna Jaramillo: Like

265
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:23.880
You know,

266
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:35.520
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that's true, that's true. I didn't really think about that. But yeah, I guess it. It's definitely on my mind a lot more because they just have so much time to just think about it and

267
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.120
Dianna Jaramillo: Just, I don't know. It just, it makes me feel it made me feel weak and

268
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.670
Dianna Jaramillo: Just stupid to have to ask my dad for for any help, and

269
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.410
Dominique Pozo: To

270
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:57.240
Dianna Jaramillo: Be treated that way. Yeah, it just makes so much sense that it would bother me so much more because

271
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.570
Dianna Jaramillo: There's that's what that's what I have. That's what I have to focus on, you know, like that's it's just

272
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.770
Dianna Jaramillo: There's so much time, if that makes a lot of sense.

273
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:20.820
Dominique Pozo: So take a moment and let's if you if you're willing to close your eyes and just go back to that time in your life. I'm sure there were many, but just one time, whatever. When you most recently connected with

274
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:29.310
Dominique Pozo: When you were helping others you are showing up. You even though maybe they weren't helping themselves as much as

275
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:43.140
Dominique Pozo: You know, you were offering you are still giving and really let yourself go back to that time see yourself see yourself moving through the world going from this place to the next having those interactions and exchanges.

276
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.890
Dominique Pozo: And really if you can feel into your body and remember what that felt like

277
00:28:52.080 --> 00:29:02.220
Dominique Pozo: And just notice you know where, where do you notice the sensations or the that fullness and that strength aware in your body. Do you feel that

278
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.580
Dianna Jaramillo: In my chest, for sure.

279
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.750
Dominique Pozo: So really focus on that focus on that feeling in the chest, the sensation.

280
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.390
Dominique Pozo: The quality of it.

281
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.370
Dominique Pozo: It seems to me that your strength is in that that heart space.

282
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.360
Mm hmm.

283
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.150
Dominique Pozo: You know, there's a lot of

284
00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:33.720
Dominique Pozo: Abundance there in your heart.

285
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.300
Dianna Jaramillo: It really is. Yeah.

286
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.810
Dominique Pozo: I really, I see it. I feel it and I'm hearing it from you.

287
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.410
Dominique Pozo: So just be with that for a few more breaths.

288
00:29:51.840 --> 00:30:00.510
Dominique Pozo: Really inhaling and filling that space with some fresh breath. It's like you're like you're breathing into the fire. You know, if you've ever started a fire.

289
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:10.230
Dominique Pozo: It takes when it takes breath and wind to keep it stoked. So as you inhale, just imagine that you're bringing in a good wind into your heart.

290
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.560
Dominique Pozo: And you're really like growing that fire.

291
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.610
Dominique Pozo: And just if you're able to sense that that warmth from your heart center.

292
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.530
Dominique Pozo: Just let it spread a little more

293
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:44.550
Dominique Pozo: With it with the next inhale, just imagine that it's just spreading a little more through your being.

294
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.900
Dominique Pozo: And this is all within you.

295
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.600
Dominique Pozo: Know it's all

296
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:05.790
Dominique Pozo: within you and just if you're willing to keep your eyes closed. This poem is coming to my mind that I want to read to you.

297
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.260
Dominique Pozo: Just stick with that heart space.

298
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:31.530
Dominique Pozo: There's this poet named Tucker, he'll Gibran

299
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:33.870
Dominique Pozo: And he wrote

300
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:35.760
Dominique Pozo: This book.

301
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:48.510
Dominique Pozo: Called the prophet and in it he talks about many things. And on one of the chapters. It's on children and I'm just going to read this to that that

302
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.070
Dominique Pozo: Inner Child that's in you and

303
00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:03.960
Dominique Pozo: Just take take it as you wish. This is part of the book that says your children and your children are not your children.

304
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.150
Dominique Pozo: They are the sons and daughters of life's longing for itself.

305
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.410
Dominique Pozo: They come through you, but not from you.

306
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:19.080
Dominique Pozo: And though they are with you. They do not belong to you.

307
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.500
Dominique Pozo: They have their own thoughts.

308
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.370
Dominique Pozo: You may house their bodies, but not their souls.

309
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:34.590
Dominique Pozo: For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.

310
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.030
Dominique Pozo: You may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you

311
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.550
Dominique Pozo: You are the bows, from which your children as living arrows are sent for.

312
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.240
Dominique Pozo: The Archer seeks the mark upon the path of the infinite

313
00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:04.260
Dominique Pozo: And he bends you with his might and his arrows may go swift and far let your bending in the archers hand be for gladness.

314
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:11.730
Dominique Pozo: For ease, even as he loves the arrows that flies, he also loves the bow that is stable.

315
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:33.330
Dominique Pozo: So I think I just wanted that came to my mind because I'm just thinking, you know, you're you came through your parents and you are your own life spark your own gift and I'm really touching into that as I witness you connecting with your heart space. It's like that's yours, you know,

316
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:38.880
Dianna Jaramillo: Wow.

317
00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.520
Dianna Jaramillo: Wow, that was Wow, that was really perfect

318
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:53.580
Dominique Pozo: Perfect.

319
00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:01.200
Dianna Jaramillo: Feel like that's like the perfect thing to hear right now in this

320
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.750
Dianna Jaramillo: Situation, it's

321
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.290
Dianna Jaramillo: It's it gets like a reminder

322
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:15.300
Dianna Jaramillo: Reminder that I that's exactly what I drew on my picture that I'm

323
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.130
Dianna Jaramillo: On my own, my own entity i'm i'm not

324
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.600
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm not them.

325
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.000
Dianna Jaramillo: And I would never

326
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.400
Dianna Jaramillo: Ever treat

327
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.620
Dianna Jaramillo: Anybody like they've cheated me. Yeah.

328
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.620
Dianna Jaramillo: Even though they are my blood.

329
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.900
Dianna Jaramillo: That was good. Thank you. That was really good.

330
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:54.360
Dominique Pozo: You're welcome. Yeah, I

331
00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.360
Dominique Pozo: I always loved that. And

332
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.480
Dominique Pozo: I think unfortunately my father share that with me when I was really young.

333
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:08.070
Dominique Pozo: And after reading that I was like oh I'm my own person. I love you guys see

334
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.310
Dianna Jaramillo: I could see that I would have probably done the same. Exactly.

335
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.180
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

336
00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:20.520
Dominique Pozo: And I love them. I love them yet from on these messages were instilled that

337
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.110
Dominique Pozo: I just came here to them.

338
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:23.340
You know, and right

339
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.790
Dominique Pozo: There's this process called individuation insight in psychological terms. Have you heard of that.

340
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.200
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes, yes.

341
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.890
Dominique Pozo: Yes.

342
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:40.860
Dominique Pozo: So it's that process when we we individually wait for my parents, we finally recognize I am my own person and you know it's

343
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:45.420
Dominique Pozo: And it's an ongoing process, it doesn't it doesn't just happen. And then we're done. I think it's a

344
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.510
Dianna Jaramillo: Continual racist right and

345
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.110
Dianna Jaramillo: Give me one second. I'm just plugging in my phone.

346
00:35:53.970 --> 00:36:01.290
Dianna Jaramillo: So that that even right there. I, I don't think I ever really got to go through that.

347
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.460
Dianna Jaramillo: I really don't. I

348
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.100
Dianna Jaramillo: I think like the way I was raised.

349
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.190
Dianna Jaramillo: With my dad.

350
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:16.680
Dianna Jaramillo: More so, because he gave me the freedom to just be whatever I was going to be to do whatever I was going to do. He gave me

351
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:32.430
Dianna Jaramillo: He gave me that the way I think was, it was more normal, but with my mom. It wasn't like that. It was like, you know, and that's that's my mother, a mother and a daughter, that's like, I think that really honestly I think it really messed me up.

352
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.030
Doing

353
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:42.420
Dianna Jaramillo: She held on so tight. You know, when I was young when I was little, and she just held on so tight and like just wanted to control

354
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:42.990
Dominique Pozo: You know,

355
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.930
Dianna Jaramillo: Me and didn't give me the freedom to

356
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:58.020
Dianna Jaramillo: Learn who I was and to figure out, you know what I wanted. And what I liked and she just always wanted control and if it wasn't in her absolute

357
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:03.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Under her power and control. Then I was like nothing to her.

358
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.860
Dianna Jaramillo: That's, that's, that's exactly what's going on. Again, now, but that's that's the

359
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.390
Dianna Jaramillo: That has repeated itself, since I was a kid, and then it's happening again. No, especially with my mom, you know, but

360
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:22.590
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, we're very that's a very significant dysfunction on her end, you know,

361
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.210
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Yeah, definitely.

362
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:24.600
Yeah.

363
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:35.400
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, like, I mean, I think I told you a little bit before that, when you know she, her mother was even worse than her. I mean, her mother had seven daughters.

364
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:46.800
Dianna Jaramillo: And had no idea what she was doing, she was a teenager. She was 19 by the time she had seven daughters and all she did was beat them all she did was beat up and she beat the shit out of them.

365
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:55.200
Dianna Jaramillo: Every day somebody's got a beating for their whole upbringing, you know, so it was just nothing but violence.

366
00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:03.600
Dianna Jaramillo: From her own mother's so like, how is she supposed to know how to be a decent mother and I understand that and i i i take that

367
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:13.440
Dianna Jaramillo: In consideration. I mean, I know how she grew up. I know what happened with her. So, I mean, how could she possibly know she did the best she could I understand that.

368
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:15.870
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, so

369
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.080
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't hold it against her like that at all.

370
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:31.200
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering when you're ready, and I think you're still tending so much to the your own her around what's happening. But I, it seems to me like it could be really powerful.

371
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:40.050
Dominique Pozo: To create an altar for both your mother and father to, you know, have one for your grief and one for each of them and remembering these things because

372
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:52.350
Dominique Pozo: They're coming from places of wounding and hurt and your dad. I don't know what goes on with his life. But that's a whole other dysfunction that had, you know, isn't isn't you and

373
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.500
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it's like, Gosh, that must be really hard for him to be

374
00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.030
Dominique Pozo: Right controlled

375
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.490
Dominique Pozo: Basically controlled by another human

376
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.610
Dominique Pozo: Or allowing himself to be controlled. He's allowing

377
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:02.910
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

378
00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:04.800
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, he is. Exactly.

379
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.980
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think these altars, they keep coming to my mind like you know it's

380
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.430
Dominique Pozo: without putting any religion. I'm definitely not

381
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.830
Dominique Pozo: Wanting to see a religious thing, it's just

382
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.200
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it's acknowledging, you know, it's about

383
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.880
Dianna Jaramillo: Acknowledgement right. Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a great idea. I'm gonna

384
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.000
Dianna Jaramillo: Definitely start working on that.

385
00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.370
Dianna Jaramillo: And whatever whatever that may be.

386
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:29.910
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

387
00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.510
Dominique Pozo: And what it is, really, it's, it's shifting

388
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:39.060
Dominique Pozo: All it is is shifting your perspective, a few degrees, you know,

389
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.200
Dominique Pozo: It's like we have all these

390
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:53.190
Dominique Pozo: choices on how we look at situations. And if we're looking at a certain way and we're suffering. It's like God something here is not working. What if I shift my perspective, this way and look through this lens, then what happens

391
00:39:53.730 --> 00:40:10.050
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, yeah. Yeah, it's all about shifting perspective. And that's exactly what I need to work on, because I've had this focus just the way it is. It's just been like this.

392
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:11.730
Dianna Jaramillo: Straight

393
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:19.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Just the way it is for so long now. Yeah, well, this whole last year, you know, mainly with with

394
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:32.670
Dianna Jaramillo: The issues with my mom. It's been this whole entire last year and now things are coming up with my dad and it is, it's totally about shifting perspective and that that you just read to me from the prophet. I remember the prophet, I read that when I was really young.

395
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:41.370
Dianna Jaramillo: Uh huh. Yeah. And I didn't, I didn't fully understand it, but I felt like it was important. I remember feeling like this is this is special, like this is

396
00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:42.720
Dominique Pozo: Important. Yeah, yeah.

397
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:49.980
Dianna Jaramillo: But that, again, it's, it's like a really good reminder of my own.

398
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.130
Dianna Jaramillo: Individuality in my own my just my own self. And, you know, to

399
00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.480
Dianna Jaramillo: If, if necessary. If somebody

400
00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:04.350
Dianna Jaramillo: If, if, if the relationship just feels hurtful.

401
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.920
Dianna Jaramillo: Most of the time, not get whether it's blood or not.

402
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.530
Dianna Jaramillo: The healthiest thing.

403
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:27.600
Dianna Jaramillo: Is to separate myself. I think separate myself from that situation and focus on what I can do what I can do for for my individuality and not be so focused on, why don't they love me. Why don't they care.

404
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.820
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah yeah

405
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:39.540
Dianna Jaramillo: Because it's not up to me it's not there. Again, they're their own people and you can't change how anybody thinks about anything or anyone

406
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:55.080
Dianna Jaramillo: And there I can fix them. I can't change them. I can't make them love me the way I wish they did, you know, so it's it's like just I felt like acceptance is going to be a huge thing because I don't think it'll change. Yeah.

407
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:56.850
Dianna Jaramillo: And I work

408
00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.630
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, I'll definitely work on it but it won't reach

409
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:11.070
Dominique Pozo: And it's a practice. I mean, I know I can just speak for myself. It's a continual commitment to myself to make that choice.

410
00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.330
Dominique Pozo: You know that shoes.

411
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:12.630
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes.

412
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:25.170
Dominique Pozo: The relationships that do feel nurturing and not the ones that are re wounding because we all have it. We all have this pattern of and really what it is is that wound wants to heal.

413
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:33.660
Dominique Pozo: So we attract, you know, the thing that keeps poking it so that we can see it until finally, it's like that poking hurts.

414
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.220
Dominique Pozo: I don't want to keep party.

415
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.080
Dianna Jaramillo: Email. Right. Yeah, exactly.

416
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.300
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes. Yeah, exactly.

417
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:43.560
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

418
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.600
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that, that, that feels good, even just to say because I

419
00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:57.180
Dianna Jaramillo: I feel like I've been so focused on trying to change it in, you know, whether it's like trying to

420
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:04.920
Dianna Jaramillo: Coerce my dad or my mom to love me, or trying to convince them that I'm okay.

421
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.950
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't need to do that. I don't need to do that. I'm okay.

422
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:09.960
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, and

423
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:22.470
Dianna Jaramillo: And yeah, it's, it is, it kind of is what it is. And it's just going to be what it's going to be whether it changes or not you know i i can't say I'm not a fortune teller at all.

424
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:30.780
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't have a crystal ball or anything like that. But, you know, maybe it will maybe it will in the future and things will be better. I sure hope so.

425
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.070
Dianna Jaramillo: I really do. But for now, it is it is what it is.

426
00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:51.090
Dominique Pozo: Well, there's also this theory that's a systems theory, whether it's a family system or a system out in the natural world part of the ecosystem. When one thing shifts inevitably there. Everything else has impacted

427
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:58.350
Dominique Pozo: So by you truly, truly making a shift, whatever that looks like it's going to be felt in your family system.

428
00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:07.170
Dominique Pozo: Even if they don't hear it from you. They don't maybe time may go by. It might be a slow shift, but something will inevitably shift.

429
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.400
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, yeah, yeah. And I know that I know that very, very well.

430
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.170
Dianna Jaramillo: I totally, totally believe that I was thinking that as I was talking

431
00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.890
Dianna Jaramillo: And that exact thing you know whether whether they

432
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:25.980
Dianna Jaramillo: Know it or not, like, it will it will be felt and hopefully eventually it'll be seen and

433
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.870
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, I was. I was thinking about exact same thing as I was talking

434
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:32.970
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

435
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:39.330
Dianna Jaramillo: That's really true. That is true when wanting changes, lots of other things change because of that one thing

436
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.930
Dominique Pozo: Yeah i mean it's it's so evident, I

437
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.710
Dianna Jaramillo: I really

438
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:53.880
Dominique Pozo: Turn to the natural world, often for those metaphors, because there are clickable. But yeah, simply one little tweak in the system, it's it's felt throughout and

439
00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:02.340
Dominique Pozo: So let's take a moment to reconnect just check into that heart space, see what's going on there.

440
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.510
Dominique Pozo: And just notice

441
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:29.700
Dominique Pozo: And if you can I again. And this time, you can use your dominant hand. So you can just really

442
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.440
Dominique Pozo: Get the ideas or the images out

443
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.810
Dominique Pozo: Quickly, well not quickly but fluidly

444
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:43.110
Dominique Pozo: Justin, what do you see in there. What, what do you sense what what's in that space and just really get it down on paper, so you

445
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.250
Dominique Pozo: can remind yourself.

446
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.190
Dianna Jaramillo: I draw a heart with

447
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:39.480
Dianna Jaramillo: Fire and Flames

448
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:46.530
Dianna Jaramillo: That's a powerful symbol. I think to me in the way

449
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.880
Dianna Jaramillo: You were talking about that when I was just bringing

450
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.720
Dianna Jaramillo: That really touched on strength.

451
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.030
Dianna Jaramillo: To me.

452
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:06.810
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and I think what we witness, sometimes with fires that it does not destroy the things that

453
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.860
Dominique Pozo: Are most you know an

454
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.600
Dominique Pozo: Indestructible you know like a

455
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Firewall, they

456
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:13.770
Dominique Pozo: Will

457
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.490
Dominique Pozo: Go through an area and then whatever is left that's strength so

458
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:24.150
Dianna Jaramillo: And also refinance it refines everything and it can make everything

459
00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.430
Dianna Jaramillo: better and healthier.

460
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.750
Dianna Jaramillo: More beautiful

461
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:29.370
Dianna Jaramillo: after it's done too.

462
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:34.020
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, there's a regeneration that happens with fire.

463
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:34.920
Yeah.

464
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:41.610
Dianna Jaramillo: Y'all could diamonds couldn't be made. And, you know, all that good stuff couldn't happen without fire.

465
00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:43.230
Dominique Pozo: Totally, totally

466
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:49.650
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that might be something you consider putting on your altar as a little candle to that reminder of that flame.

467
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.030
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, yes. Yep.

468
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:54.690

480
00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.230
Dominique Pozo: And a psycho therapist and

481
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.310
Dominique Pozo: We would look

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.040
Dominique Pozo: At astrology through the lens through the lens of astrology for character.

483
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.800
