00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.590
Martin’s iPhone: You if their job done as far as leaky roof.

290
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.040
Martin’s iPhone: Fixing that everything's still good suck.

291
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.480
Must be good. And they say,

292
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.160
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, they

293
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:15.150
Magalie Marcellus: Call me and I'm hoping that's a good trait to have because a lot of people and know you always need something to be done in a house so

294
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.600
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

295
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.590
Martin’s iPhone: I was one years old. But I can still climb a ladder like 20 year old so

296
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:28.680
Martin’s iPhone: I might not carry two bundles shingles all day but you know I can keep up with the rest of it.

297
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.000
Uh huh.

298
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.400
Magalie Marcellus: And it sounds like something that you like doing us always

299
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:36.360
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

300
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.880
Martin’s iPhone: I'm weird. In that sense that I like roofing

301
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:43.830
Magalie Marcellus: Climbing

302
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:44.880
Oh, yeah.

303
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.530
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I respect the heights. But I'm always on the edge of my life.

304
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.190
And

305
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.640
Martin’s iPhone: Twice my entire life. So

306
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.800
Magalie Marcellus: We only, why not

307
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.230
Martin’s iPhone: Be scary. The way the art set up sometimes I

308
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.670
Martin’s iPhone: Go right. What is a

309
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.640
Magalie Marcellus: Baseline reason quiet safety.

310
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.910
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, well, it only hurts when you hit the ground so

311
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.110
Magalie Marcellus: The way I look at it.

312
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.620
Martin’s iPhone: hit the ground to

313
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:23.880
Martin’s iPhone: Ground

314
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.950
Magalie Marcellus: Again, whatever you need to do to keep yourself safe.

315
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.970
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I'm starting to get a little bit more

316
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.120
Martin’s iPhone: A little wiser in my old age.

317
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.310
Martin’s iPhone: I you

318
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.020
Martin’s iPhone: Know my limits, a little bit more sometimes to set the scaffolding up

319
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.500
Martin’s iPhone: On places where I used to not you know

320
00:24:53.730 --> 00:25:00.900
Martin’s iPhone: I'm a lot more wary about other people working around me if I have somebody up there. I'm constantly telling them how to do it the right way.

321
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.520
Magalie Marcellus: Make sure that they don't have

322
00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:16.440
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, and you know, of course, they shouldn't hurt us off a lot of the time, I don't. Most, most of the time. I don't have own Warner apartments twice, and I've been doing this since I was 19 but I do set up the staging

323
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.950
Martin’s iPhone: And I've had some slips and I've had some false

324
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.270
Martin’s iPhone: Nothing serious enough to put me in the hospital. We get a couple of them.

325
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:29.070
Martin’s iPhone: I got an injured but just been lucky the grace of God, not

326
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:31.290
Martin’s iPhone: Well,

327
00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.200
Martin’s iPhone: Is nobody here with me.

328
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:43.170
Magalie Marcellus: SPC window that way to call it the cod actually pan. That's one of the house.

329
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.100
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, it's a 2006 Chevy AJ jar.

330
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.230
Martin’s iPhone: It's

331
00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:51.420
Magalie Marcellus: Still

332
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.500
Martin’s iPhone: Have a lot of

333
00:25:53.190 --> 00:26:06.240
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I gotta put the tie rods on it. I'm just buying a little bit at a time. I put new tires on it last week and the week before I bought a set of US tires and then a set of new slash use tires. They were put on

334
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:25.710
Martin’s iPhone: There have all their tread, but they were war for a little bit on another vehicle, but I got a discount on $50 apiece. So lockdown. And the other tires. I got for 60 for the pair and do the job for now until I get the money to get a really nice set but

335
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:36.960
Martin’s iPhone: There's still a lot of work to do on the car. It's 144,000 miles on it now and it's starting to show you know like I put new shocks on the back.

336
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.410
Martin’s iPhone: New brakes and rotors on the front.

337
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.460
Martin’s iPhone: New Law joint new ambitions.

338
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.270
Magalie Marcellus: Is a Java boy. Yeah.

339
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.320
Martin’s iPhone: She's gonna work but

340
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.180
Martin’s iPhone: It needs to transmission mount up front.

341
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.940
Martin’s iPhone: And I got the Tyrone ends. I just haven't put them on yet.

342
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.300
Martin’s iPhone: I ordered the entire road ends there.

343
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:05.760
Martin’s iPhone: A little bit more expensive. So I'm just doing a little bit of time, then it needs strips in the front close springs in the back.

344
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:17.250
Martin’s iPhone: I'm gonna have to get new strips for the guesting some time because they're getting pretty rusty. I want to run new brake lines. I'm going to have this car for a couple years. And so you

345
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.160
Magalie Marcellus: Don't have caught and the house maintenance.

346
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.130
Martin’s iPhone: Well, I have to do the car stuff. I don't

347
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.900
Martin’s iPhone: Like it i mean

348
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.380
Martin’s iPhone: I like being a lake taking things apart, but I don't like

349
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:33.870
Magalie Marcellus: But, but in play together. Okay. Okay. But, but, you know, a lot of Bath cries so

350
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:44.220
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, yeah. I've been fortunate enough to be able to get through it and what i don't know i a YouTube or I asked people, so

351
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.270
Martin’s iPhone: After the fire last saw my tools so

352
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:55.050
Martin’s iPhone: Now, I finally got the garage kind of sort of flow again not fold, but enough to where I can you know

353
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.230
Martin’s iPhone: Start to get things done again and

354
00:27:59.040 --> 00:27:59.370
Martin’s iPhone: Getting

355
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:00.480
Magalie Marcellus: Some tools together.

356
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.560
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, got a table saw in the back your now two of them actually and

357
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:12.180
Martin’s iPhone: Jack and a bunch of the tools are in the car and then all kinds of stuff on the shelves again play would. So, I mean,

358
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.640
Martin’s iPhone: Sometimes not alive. BUT IT'S A START.

359
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.550
Martin’s iPhone: To get it going again.

360
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.470
Magalie Marcellus: And I do you do any

361
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.860
Magalie Marcellus: Any color pairs. Why do people I just wait so

362
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.890
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, no, I tried to just do it for myself.

363
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.440
Martin’s iPhone: If it's something that needs to be done and I don't have any work to do that, I'll do it.

364
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.140
Martin’s iPhone: I can't try to keep down the brake lines and break some

365
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.790
Martin’s iPhone: Small things like tie rods and ball joints.

366
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.060
Martin’s iPhone: No major motor work.

367
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.670
Martin’s iPhone: I could do some of it like I can

368
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:58.590
Martin’s iPhone: Probably replace the head on the car and you know I can do tune ups and change older meters. I just don't like going through all that, you know, and

369
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.060
Martin’s iPhone: I can't wait. So

370
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.370
Martin’s iPhone: Maybe it's worth where I can take it to something

371
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.410
Martin’s iPhone: I have a warning saying on the cars.

372
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.670
Martin’s iPhone: When I take it in the keep it for three or four days. I can't do that.

373
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.200
Magalie Marcellus: They laugh accent so

374
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:15.270
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, once we get the truck. Then I'll take it in. And anything that I need done on it.

375
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.580
Martin’s iPhone: Or put it on.

376
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.270
Magalie Marcellus: Right. Right. Okay. Still, still have another class and get around.

377
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.990
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, and I think the car company really tries to keep the car broken not fixed. If you know they can't wait.

378
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.460
Magalie Marcellus: When you say that

379
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:30.600
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, they, they want it.

380
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:36.480
Martin’s iPhone: They don't want it back. They want to make sure I didn't get the money me getting repossessed.

381
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.190
Magalie Marcellus: Keep working with it.

382
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.090
Magalie Marcellus: And, you know, they'll sell it again.

383
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:42.840
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah.

384
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:43.680
Magalie Marcellus: Oh yeah, somebody

385
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:47.490
Martin’s iPhone: They'll either sewed or option it, but I'll still get that bill for, you know,

386
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.030
Magalie Marcellus: Full well yeah because you have to still continue paying on it. Yeah.

387
00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:55.050
Martin’s iPhone: I signed my life away when they sign this card for a three year contract.

388
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.770
Martin’s iPhone: Pain down to 8000 right now and it's not worth it will never be worth that

389
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.780
Martin’s iPhone: That's why I'm trying to, you know, Paris. Oh.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:17.070
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

395
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:24.240
Martin’s iPhone: I got it at 120 2000 miles so but 20,000 miles.

396
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.840
Magalie Marcellus: Now is it I thought like a year.

397
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:29.370
Was that

398
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.030

400
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.360
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I think it's been about a year.

401
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.420
Martin’s iPhone: I think in another month, it'll be about a year.

402
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:45.990
Martin’s iPhone: So, I mean, I'm paying 10 10,000 or so for it within dress. Everything's about 10,000

403
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:53.040
Martin’s iPhone: Too much one but i mean it's it's MSRP is probably like

404
00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.950
Martin’s iPhone: 2500 or something right now. It's not very healthy. But if I

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:09.450
Magalie Marcellus: Station way, especially if you can do some of those work. So why pain. Yeah, someone that's always beneficial.

407
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:10.830
If

408
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.620
Magalie Marcellus: Anything else you've been used and go once a week. Correct.

411
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.190
Martin’s iPhone: Even if I can go every other week. I'm just going every week. It's just makes it easier for me to remember

412
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:28.050
Martin’s iPhone: I got a schedule now.

413
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.330
Martin’s iPhone: I tried doing the phone scheduling things. So then I just start writing everything down.

414
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.750
Magalie Marcellus: I know you're saying to keep a manual schedule.

415
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.700
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I got that right. I have a schedule for a year or two, but

416
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:47.040
Martin’s iPhone: Like two books now that I use for that, but I actually have wall schedule. Now, which

417
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:47.940
Yeah.

418
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:49.710

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.730
Magalie Marcellus: Let me say you say you have a wall calendar so

421
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:58.530
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, the wall calendar. It's a racer board I bought that

422
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:00.090
Martin’s iPhone: And then

423
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.080

424
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:11.220
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I always have my you know group eight o'clock group thing Rick wrote out in my, in my paper here, but I actually didn't use it this time I use the wall ones.

425
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.600
Uh huh.

426
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.730
Martin’s iPhone: Any, any work I do. I keep talking with people on

427
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:25.260
Magalie Marcellus: So, you know, when things are scheduled and what kind of job you did, yeah.

428
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:29.010
Martin’s iPhone: And I've been trying to figure out what I'm going to do with my spare time.

429
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:44.220
Martin’s iPhone: Between the camper. And I started like trying to figure out, like inventions and things that make things easier for people that don't have electricity or don't want electricity or have no access on your property.

430
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.550
Martin’s iPhone: Design in a garage door opener that

431
00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:48.150
Is

432
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.560
Magalie Marcellus: Non legacy solar kind of thing.

433
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:58.050
Martin’s iPhone: Actually can be driven by pneumatic shocks you ride up on

434
00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.050
Martin’s iPhone: Four minutes pushes down and then I'll close your

435
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:03.630
Martin’s iPhone: System.

436
00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.050
Magalie Marcellus: I go see on Shocked, shocked at some point.

437
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.370
Magalie Marcellus: I don't know, maybe

438
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.480
Martin’s iPhone: He got it on paper.

439
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:10.740
Martin’s iPhone: I just

440
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:17.160
Martin’s iPhone: Actually, I think I have that notebook in the car. But yeah, it looks really good.

441
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.620
Martin’s iPhone: Now I just have to put together a working prototype.

442
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.730
Magalie Marcellus: And then I haven't tested and tested and all that.

443
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.260
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, they have like an automatic gate opener for for

444
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:38.520
Martin’s iPhone: Gates and things like that that you can, you know, you go over a platform and it works. This one.

445
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.660
Martin’s iPhone: will work with any size vehicle any size door so I mean even up to the size of a semi could get in

446
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:54.780
Martin’s iPhone: And it's all done without electricity, and it's going to, it's got to be reliable. It's got to be safe. It's got to be cost effective.

447
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.010
Magalie Marcellus: When I'm

448
00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.260
Martin’s iPhone: Bored to be able to put together separate

449
00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.570
Magalie Marcellus: Why, why do that.

450
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.430
Magalie Marcellus: Why I gave you that I did. Oh.

451
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:10.290
Martin’s iPhone: I was just thinking about it when we had to fire. I was worried. Yeah, the fire might have been caused by the electricity on the

452
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:13.770
Martin’s iPhone: On my little motor on the

453
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.600
Magalie Marcellus: Garage, guys. Yeah.

454
00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.760
Martin’s iPhone: Oh boy, you know,

455
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:25.740
Martin’s iPhone: Man, you know, if I was a way to put it. I didn't want to get. We've got a garage door out there, but I don't want to electric motor because you always make funny noises

456
00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:35.760
Martin’s iPhone: I just feel like, you know, there's an easier way to do, there's a way to do this without that. So I started thinking, right, one down one night and

457
00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:47.400
Martin’s iPhone: Just kept going with it. So it's just one idea, but maybe. Oh, maybe I'll be able to patent, if anything, I'll have one working garage door opener for me.

458
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.890
Magalie Marcellus: At least for you to start

459
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.650
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, but you know there's a lot of it.

460
00:34:53.130 --> 00:35:00.810
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, like there's a lot of places that they put their property together. And one of the first things, they'll do is the book The framework. Make sure the roof is on

461
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:07.950
Martin’s iPhone: And everything and they might not have electric they might not have plumbing. Yeah. And, but they want to store their equipment in their tools in the building.

462
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.760
Martin’s iPhone: And especially if they're in there if they're

463
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:15.990
Martin’s iPhone: Older or if there's just no access to electricity there or

464
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:18.480
Martin’s iPhone: If they don't want that.

465
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.650
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh.

466
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:30.720
Martin’s iPhone: This would be a way to safely be able to do it without somebody just riding up on platform and getting in app taboo and unlock mess mechanism, it's, it's going to be more than just

467
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:38.340
Martin’s iPhone: Just, you know, you write up on it and opens. It's got to have a little system for safety, you know,

468
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.830
Magalie Marcellus: I can unlock and all that. Yeah.

469
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.600
Martin’s iPhone: So I'm still working on that part. But once I build a prototype and start that

470
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.820
Martin’s iPhone: Then I can read everything else.

471
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:53.880
Martin’s iPhone: And thankfully I could get like something battery operated like a Bluetooth wireless system.

472
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.730
Martin’s iPhone: That's solar powered, you know,

473
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:57.420
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh.

474
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:03.540
Martin’s iPhone: I'm trying to keep the electricity out of the house. So if anything happens, then it doesn't have a

475
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.970
Magalie Marcellus: Lot of you have other options right

476
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:21.240
Magalie Marcellus: Because, like, like, like I said, when there's, um, even though sometimes on them, you override. But then the system. There's no way to lock it unless you're going to use some kind of key because once there's no electricity, then the mode. I wouldn't worry. Yeah.

477
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:31.140
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And this way I get I thought about doing like a keypad system. Now you have to type in six six different keys that will

478
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:44.670
Martin’s iPhone: Or combination lock system that will finally unlock unlock a door that you can open from your car door and then switches switch that will allow that pressure to come down things is

479
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.750
Martin’s iPhone: It's going to be

480
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.520
Martin’s iPhone: Complex there, but I've

481
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.470
Magalie Marcellus: Been thinking about it. So,

482
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.690
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, that's something that occupy your free time.

483
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.080
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I have to get like 16 shocks and

484
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.840
Martin’s iPhone: hydraulic system setup and, you know, like a lot of little things that

485
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.620
Magalie Marcellus: Will make

486
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:09.240
Martin’s iPhone: Work and still be able to be safe and reliable when the cold weather in the hot weather.

487
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:09.660
Magalie Marcellus: App some

488
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.430
Martin’s iPhone: Kids can't get into it. There's no way to malfunction. If they spend that

489
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.270
Martin’s iPhone: Much time trying to get into it, then they're going to get into the house. Either way, so

490
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:24.810
Magalie Marcellus: Regardless, right now, finally, yeah. But at least you know like you say, what's important is being safe and reliable.

491
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.620
Yes.

492
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.090
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, this way, you're probably last

493
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.290
Martin’s iPhone: You know 510 years without any maintenance. If I knew

494
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:36.960
Martin’s iPhone: That's the big selling point

495
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.660
Martin’s iPhone: If I get enough for right now, I just wanted to

496
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.580
Martin’s iPhone: Work for me. And I thought, well,

497
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:43.530
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah.

498
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:53.220
Magalie Marcellus: Absolutely, yeah. Yeah. And you guys use a call on that, Ohio. It's everything is it besides electricity you use gas as well core

499
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.710
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, yeah, we use natural gas, there's

500
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.020
Magalie Marcellus: A and

501
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:05.010
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah I run. I mean, this House runs on natural gas, but we have electric to for

502
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:13.350
Martin’s iPhone: You like the hot water heaters electric we don't run everything on on gas. The gas prices fluctuate so much around here. So,

503
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:25.410
Martin’s iPhone: And this property doesn't have the natural gas line for free, like growing up on my grandma's farm. We had an unlimited supply of gas and we never really had to worry about. Yeah.

504
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:26.310
Magalie Marcellus: Really

505
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:37.080
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, the world came, can the oil tanks. Always have natural get well. Not always, but most of the time they have natural gas line and the gas companies whenever they bid years ago.

506
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.550
Martin’s iPhone: You always got free gas for your property as long as you give them the rest and

507
00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:43.350
Magalie Marcellus: When you add

508
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.240
Martin’s iPhone: Cheese and stuff from it but

509
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:59.760
Martin’s iPhone: Oh, everything changed. The last last 20 years because now where everybody's fracking and everybody's trying to get the gas and it's pretty much now everybody's tapped in so

510
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:09.990
Martin’s iPhone: They don't offer the same amounts. Some places offered more some offer less some did contracts that kind of wizard weaseled you added things, you know, and

511
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.060
Martin’s iPhone: I know one one farm.

512
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:22.590
Martin’s iPhone: In Kimball that the guy got like pretty much $5 million worth of royalties from the sky, sky.

513
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.270
Martin’s iPhone: And so

514
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.280
Martin’s iPhone: A chain company. Yeah.

515
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:39.720
Martin’s iPhone: I mean it's big business. He's got three or four wives out there. If there's big, big supply and meet you, you get a lot of money, they buy you right up. But they get those mineral rights from that point on.

516
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.670
Martin’s iPhone: And, you know,

517
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:54.120
Martin’s iPhone: Your property value. If you don't own the property value does not go up anymore. You know, I mean, pretty much, you know, if you don't have mineral rights is it's take 10 grand per acre off, you know,

518
00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:56.880
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

519
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.800
Martin’s iPhone: Because you can't you can only

520
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.700
Martin’s iPhone: Have so much you know if if they own the rights to the minerals

521
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:12.570
Martin’s iPhone: The only thing that's good for is either farmland, or for building and now there's, you know, with the zoning laws and things like that, you're going to do so much voting so

522
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:26.310
Martin’s iPhone: You know by you might never get anywhere from 2000 to $12,000 an acre maybe more different places. But, you know, if you don't have the mineral rights drops way down like to around 2000 an acre.

523
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.040
Magalie Marcellus: Plot out those friends.

524
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.940
Martin’s iPhone: They should buy like 60 acres or something at a time and maybe stepping

525
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.110
Magalie Marcellus: Out loud to know that.

526
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:38.880
Martin’s iPhone: Yes, now

527
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:42.750
Martin’s iPhone: I'm not speaking from experience in speaking from what other people

528
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.310
Magalie Marcellus: Are wanting now to hide.

529
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.640
Magalie Marcellus: And I know all is a

530
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.100
Magalie Marcellus: Big business and also

531
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:50.520
Magalie Marcellus: Yes.

532
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.610
Martin’s iPhone: I mean it has to be able to keep us warm saw

533
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.320
Magalie Marcellus: You're gonna have to use those.

534
00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.380
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, they don't really use coal much around here anymore.

535
00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:01.890
Martin’s iPhone: Some places they use cold but

536
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.530
Martin’s iPhone: Pretty much natural gas or

537
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.230
Martin’s iPhone: fireplaces or electric

538
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:16.140
Magalie Marcellus: Any, any plan the next comment, two weeks, but

539
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:18.300
Magalie Marcellus: We need to address.

540
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.210
Magalie Marcellus: On my calendar.

541
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.630
Martin’s iPhone: Um, no, it's good to see if maybe we could

542
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.620
Martin’s iPhone: Do it like an hour earlier, maybe even two hours earlier for now.

543
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:30.360
Magalie Marcellus: I'm

544
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.060
Martin’s iPhone: Sorry.

545
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.180
Martin’s iPhone: I'm going to claim we still there.

546
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:37.890
Martin’s iPhone: Okay.

547
00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:38.910
Martin’s iPhone: The show's

548
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:43.350
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so you want me then eight o'clock.

549
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.250
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, like like seven or eight

550
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:48.390
Martin’s iPhone: Or so that's

551
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:57.180
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. Oh, I have to take a look at my account. Again, let's see where I can be know

552
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:58.920
Martin’s iPhone: If you have to do it.

553
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.060
Magalie Marcellus: But I have. Yeah.

554
00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.130
Martin’s iPhone: Okay, if you have

555
00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.370
Martin’s iPhone: Any I'm not gonna yeah

556
00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.030
Martin’s iPhone: I just have been a little earlier in. Oh.

557
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:10.740
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, I know.

558
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.900
Magalie Marcellus: For me, yeah.

559
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.390
Magalie Marcellus: So this needs to get there.

560
00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:24.720
Magalie Marcellus: But yeah, I'll have to take a look at my calendar and see and see if I have a seven open, they can picture in

561
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:39.840
Magalie Marcellus: A color resume, because you have government chooses. So yeah, you know. So yeah, I'll probably have to see because I'm I had somebody at seven and things change frequently so if

562
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:40.590
Magalie Marcellus: If you

563
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.390
Magalie Marcellus: Can do would if there's there's an optional Debbie okay for you if

564
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.710
Magalie Marcellus: You're seven

565
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:49.500
Martin’s iPhone: Me.

566
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.690
Martin’s iPhone: For a while just

567
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.530
Martin’s iPhone: Be ready

568
00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.840
Martin’s iPhone: You know, I mean, I'm not gonna complain too much. I just

569
00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.060
Martin’s iPhone: drank it, about an hour earlier would be

570
00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.580
Martin’s iPhone: Better time is by nine o'clock. I'm trying to

571
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:05.760
Martin’s iPhone: kind of settle down. Yeah, and also at nine o'clock you sometimes have to pick brace up from school.

572
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.240
Martin’s iPhone: Basketball around nine o'clock so

573
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.380
Okay.

574
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:19.680
Magalie Marcellus: All right then. So I'll keep that in mind. So I'll send you once I take a look at my calendar and I'll send you a time but it'd be for

575
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.510
Magalie Marcellus: Two weeks from now. Okay.

576
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:22.410
Martin’s iPhone: All right.

577
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.790
Magalie Marcellus: Thank you, sir. I was

578
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:28.200
Magalie Marcellus: Glad, everything is working out and just keep up with the good work. Okay.

579
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.820
Martin’s iPhone: Thank you. You have a

580
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:30.390
Magalie Marcellus: Good night.
