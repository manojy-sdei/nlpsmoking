29
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.960
I'm

30
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.920
Cricket Icon: It just, it just doesn't make sense to me because

31
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.760
Cricket Icon: On in February around the end of February when this one. This Kovac had

32
00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:04.020
Cricket Icon: Had had barely hit in the little kiss on the beginning of February, my hours had ended up dropping

33
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:26.370
Cricket Icon: Okay, so I wasn't able to to pay my rent for people to to pay my rent at that time. So I went in with the manager, face to face, and I found an organization to do that was willing on pain. My April and marches rent. So I'm so from what the order form from what the organization told me

34
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.880
Cricket Icon: She told me golden speak to your manager tell her that you have an organization that's going to pay your February and marches rent.

35
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:46.740
Cricket Icon: And I told us. So in March. On March 1 if you could just easily me a know on my door of how much I oh and then I have an appointment with her March. Wow. On

36
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:56.610
Cricket Icon: March 12 with the with with the organization that's going to pay my rent and she said, okay, that's fine. I'll go ahead and do that for you. And then

37
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:08.430
Cricket Icon: It comes to find out I had told my my coordinator from sectioning I had because she wanted it, they, they wanted to come do

38
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:19.200
Cricket Icon: Another inspection here which the apartment that I'm living in now. They falling apart and the manager literally told the maintenance to not to not do no no work in the apartment.

39
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:28.860
Cricket Icon: So I have sliding doors in my kids rooms that literally fall down almost smash the baby a couple of times I don't let him in a room anymore.

40
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.910
Cricket Icon: I mean, it's just, it's just really bad. I need to get out of this apartment, but um but anyway so so she she agreed on.

41
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:48.990
Cricket Icon: On that conversation I had with her and then once I had told my coordinator Karen from from the housing authority that that I was thinking of moving out of here.

42
00:04:49.800 --> 00:05:05.070
Cricket Icon: Just due to just a lot that I have been through, and the manager just never put any attention to me. Um, I, I, you know, kind of felt discriminated and just like just like like

43
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:18.270
Cricket Icon: Like if like, like if she didn't like if she doesn't see me as a as a human being, like she she just treats me completely different compared to how she treats everybody else so

44
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:36.540
Cricket Icon: So anyway, so. So okay, so I told my coordinator that and I'm not too sure if Karen went and told the manager here um well i i well from from what Russell told me, I'm sorry, I must press dying. He took a deep breath.

45
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.450
Cricket Icon: Okay, so

46
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.750
Cricket Icon: Okay, so

47
00:05:50.910 --> 00:06:02.070
Cricket Icon: I believe that Karen had told her that I was thinking of moving out of here and I think she took that personal and she

48
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:14.460
Cricket Icon: She went and took me to court, one day before on May 11 she went and she took this to court and on the 12th. I went and I got how

49
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:23.370
Cricket Icon: For for my rent to get paid and her name was milena from from the, from the, from the organization. Her name was Melinda.

50
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:34.890
Cricket Icon: And Melinda had called the manager here and I told her. Okay, I'm gonna pay rosov February and marches RENT. AND THE LATE. The late fees and and

51
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.580
Cricket Icon: Plus five months on top of that to get her ahead, you know, to help her out like me to help help her get ahead.

52
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:51.960
Cricket Icon: And putting putting I told her no i'm i'm on I'm not accepting no payments from her right now at this time until we bought a core and and

53
00:06:52.950 --> 00:07:02.250
Cricket Icon: I had no idea. At that point you would take me to court. So when when when when will then came out man told me, Rosa. I'm so sorry to to let you know this.

54
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:11.850
Cricket Icon: I don't know if you have heard this before, but I just been finished the principal Kadena and she told me that she's not taking no payments on that she's taking you to court.

55
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:21.300
Cricket Icon: And I was like, why it was a big surprise to me. It's almost like I spoke to her about this. I thought she understood me, you know, so, um,

56
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:31.530
Cricket Icon: So yeah, so we went to court, the first time. And, of course, is a little bit 19th going on. So, so the judge said I can't just throw her and her kids out

57
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.790
Cricket Icon: You know, because of this rent that that you're seeing that that that she owes which she got paid off.

58
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:51.210
Cricket Icon: Like in full. I got it all paid off every single dollar so there's no there's no reason for them to evict me. Either way, I don't want to stay here. I really got another apartment, um,

59
00:07:51.750 --> 00:08:08.220
Cricket Icon: So yeah, so that's so that's where I stand right now. I go, I go to court. Now, again, on, on the 19th and I ended up getting a attorney through legal aid to help me with this case. So, so, yeah. So, so the attorneys going to try to

60
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:15.840
Cricket Icon: Try to take the the eviction off the table because he's trying to get me evicted. And I don't know for what she

61
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:33.030
Cricket Icon: She says that that that it's not personal, that it's not her that it's the owners that want me out which don't make sense because I bet. I've been consistent on my rent and everything for the past nine years until these two months and then she she

62
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:41.610
Cricket Icon: finds out that that that i i was thinking a movie now and then, before that I had told her. I'm

63
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.710
Cricket Icon: You know, cutting off. I'm so now my son turned five and

64
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:54.120
Cricket Icon: You had told me that that when my son had turned five that you would move me into a three bedroom.

65
00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:04.350
Cricket Icon: When, when you had first started working here. I said, so I'm going to want to move into three bedroom and she told me, I'm not moving in. I'm not moving you into a three bedroom and she starts laughing

66
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:15.360
Cricket Icon: And I was like, What do you mean, like, why not like, what, what have I done like why why are you saying it in that way. Like, like if I've done something wrong.

67
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:25.080
Cricket Icon: I she made me feel so bad to where I literally apologize to her and I told her, putting off. I don't know why you're treating me this way.

68
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:39.930
Cricket Icon: Or I don't know why you're doing this to me. But if I ever did anything or said anything to offend you in any way, which I know I haven't because I I have, I have a lot of respect for you. You know, I'm

69
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.740
Cricket Icon: I'm not that type of person to disrespect anybody

70
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:54.990
Cricket Icon: Even if they disrespect me I'm not that person to like be resentful. I'm just a forgiving person. So I asked her, you know, if I didn't think tell it to her to or anything like that. If you could forgive me.

71
00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:00.510
Cricket Icon: And she said, yeah, yes. And also, yeah we're good, you know. We're on, we're on good terms so

72
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:23.520
Cricket Icon: It. So it seems like ever since I asked her about that three bedroom like not even not even a week later, is when I had told Karen on about about putting the house, the house that I'm leaving on on hold for the for the inspection, because I was thinking of moving out and then

73
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:37.800
Cricket Icon: I'm sure the word got to quoting on and then I know she just decided to take me to court. But I'm not worried about it because I got it all paid off. I got the full amount paid off that that the judge had

74
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.060
Cricket Icon: Had had a. How do you see it.

75
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.860
What the judge ordered

76
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:54.060
Cricket Icon: Ordered we requested that that needed to be paid, which was $595

77
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.460
Cricket Icon: So I thought that paid off. So that's what the phone call was about now.

78
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:11.670
Cricket Icon: That's why I was a with you is because she had called me. She asked me about the situation I pretty much explained everything that I told you just you know a little bit more

79
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.260
Cricket Icon: And oh, she she just told me to go and get a

80
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:26.220
Cricket Icon: What is it called it, my gosh, I'm not to call her back and get it a ledger that for me to go to just manager and just get a ledger just

81
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:36.240
Cricket Icon: Stating that that I paid off everything she said, and bring it to me and we'll, we'll proceed from there. So, so that's that's where I'm at right now so

82
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.950
Cricket Icon: I'm waiting for them to open now at 10 so that I can go and get that letter.

83
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:54.510
Cricket Icon: And go and take it to Montreal at the other apartments at the piece of a dead. That's where, that's up with a I couldn't find a three bedroom, which really, you know, really, really suck. Excuse my French. But really suck on

84
00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:03.360
Cricket Icon: My. I mean, I was really looking forward to a three bedroom. So my daughter didn't have her to see. So I can have my privacy. So my two boys can share a room.

85
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:14.610
Cricket Icon: But I mean, all the plan was a two bedroom and just long as I have a roof over my kids house. That's all that matters to me. So I just took the two bedroom because nowhere else has a three bedroom, I have

86
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.690
Cricket Icon: All the parts.

87
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:30.420
Cricket Icon: Santa Fe and no Ross has a two or three bedroom, I have been tried to find a house and I I can't find anybody that that wants to accept Section eight, which I don't understand, because it's a guaranteed payment in the government, you know, and

88
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:41.340
Cricket Icon: So yeah, so that that's pretty much where I stand right now. So, um, so yeah, so that's that's where I stand right now and I'm just trying to just

89
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:50.220
Cricket Icon: Get everything in order so I could just get out of, out of these apartments, because it's just, just not a good place to raise your kids.

90
00:12:50.850 --> 00:13:13.440
Cricket Icon: The people, she had moved across for me before was the worst because it's like a it's an apartment that she rents to like link people from life link, and I don't judge nobody to each their own, but on the person that she had moved. Moved in had had drug problems. And then, of course,

91
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:23.430
Cricket Icon: He was, he was a type of person that let people take like take advantage of him bad. So by the time by the time we knew it.

92
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:37.830
Cricket Icon: Like about 40 people are living with him in that one bedroom right across from me. So every time we would walk out myself and my kids I would find full needles of, you know,

93
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:51.210
Cricket Icon: Of drawing like literally in the park out by noodles and park all over, like all over and literally where my kids could just pick them up not knowing what they what they are and poke themselves, and I called in.

94
00:13:51.660 --> 00:14:02.100
Cricket Icon: Saying to her so many times, telling her, please. You need to move either me or them because I have kids and I'm finding this you know this this stuff around

95
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:11.430
Cricket Icon: And it's dangerous to my children and I just, I don't know how to go about it. You're the only one that could do something about it and all. She would tell me, is it or somebody

96
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.750
Cricket Icon: There's nothing I can do about it. You're just gonna have to deal with it. That's all she would tell me

97
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:24.750
Cricket Icon: That's, that's what that's what tells me. That's what showed me that she just doesn't care about my about mine and my children's well being at all.

98
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:36.390
Cricket Icon: Because she just didn't care that that there was 40 people partying on you know that are the right way. I walk out my door. I can see them. They were partying and

99
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:45.420
Cricket Icon: Uh, you know, doing, you know, drugs and stuff like that and spray painting in the house.

100
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:54.870
Cricket Icon: You know, they would open the door and there would be like 30 people all passed out. You could tell that that they were on you know their, their choice of a drug or whatever.

101
00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:07.860
Cricket Icon: Like I said I wasn't judging, but it was just awful for my kids to see and to quote in like like white Lake why mom Why are all those people laying there. Make that they look like they're dead and

102
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:18.900
Cricket Icon: Done. It's, it's their, their questions that I'm not wanting to answer. So, of course, you know, I would just say they're just taking enough that they're just tired. They're just sleep, you know,

103
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:31.560
Cricket Icon: Um, but yeah. So, so the manager man here. I just feel just has no consideration in mine or my kids well being and she just trying to do everything to make my life miserable. She's

104
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:40.620
Cricket Icon: Ever since it's like I said she took over these apartments for years ago there was another manager before her. Her name was Ted ass off and

105
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:54.180
Cricket Icon: I used to live in apartment to 15 which was downstairs, and she was a really good manager. She updated you when your rent. Like if if it changed you know to pay your rent.

106
00:15:54.540 --> 00:16:04.740
Cricket Icon: Except draws you know she updated it so you know we were able to keep up. She was always in the office or she always has somebody there an office so that we're able to get our rent to them, etc.

107
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:14.340
Cricket Icon: This manager does she doesn't do that. Like right now, if you were to call Tuscany. It's saying that that that that their phones disconnected and I've been trying to get in touch with her.

108
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:36.540
Cricket Icon: All through all of April, I even go to the office and it's always closed. I can't get ahold of her to discuss with her on the court. The court situation to make sure that April was paid because the organization. Mullin, she paid April's April's read for me.

109
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:48.000

Cricket Icon: So, so this. So yeah, so this is this is where I stand. I just, um, I kind of, I'm kind of like between

114
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:12.930
Cricket Icon: A rock and a hard place right now so I let me like like I tell you, I'm just trying to stay positive and just, just keep my faith in God.

115
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:21.000
Cricket Icon: And it all in his hands and and just let things work the way they're supposed to, you know, so

121
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.820
Cricket Icon: Coding on she doesn't give me no credit no credit at all for for getting

122
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:29.610
Cricket Icon: You know all the rent paid off that that that she asked up plus I paid all of all of the court fees that she went and paid to take me to core. I had to pay that back. So I read back on $600. I mean, it was 597 so almost $600 just for

123
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just for our kind

124
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.870
Cricket Icon: Of brand. So

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:40.920
Cricket Icon: Wow. So yeah, so that's that's where I stand right now that's, that's my life right now so that that's what I'm dealing with so on.

126
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:53.970
Cricket Icon: I'm just waiting to 10 till 10 to go and get that that that just saved her from her so I could take it to my audio so that she could proceed with with me getting the apartment.

127
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.290
Cricket Icon: So, that was me approved so that I could move in.

128
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:12.690
Cricket Icon: May 19 she said I couldn't move in. But that's the day that I go to court. So like I said, I'm gonna try to get my attorney to wall. My I already spoke to my attorney. She said she's not going to try. She says she's going to

129
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:23.430
Cricket Icon: Put any emotion to get the eviction off the table and to just put and to just go by, by me just putting in my 30 day notice, which

130
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:39.870
Cricket Icon: I put in before I go to her now to get the legislator, I'm going to write that letter out. Um, so I had God I had got advice from Karen on how how to start off that letter and I kind of forgot, and how she told me, but

131
00:19:40.380 --> 00:20:00.750
Cricket Icon: I'm not too sure if you're familiar with that. But this is this is what what what I understand what I'm supposed to write I or somebody out of metal on would like to vacate in my address Miguel Travis throat apartment to zero for you know Santa Fe, New Mexico. A 7505

132
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:14.400
Cricket Icon: Do too. I don't know what to put due to I guess I'm just going to put do to me wanting, wanting to make a change. I guess does

133
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.090
Cricket Icon: Does it

134
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:22.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Add more, you can put like meeting more space or needing a three bedroom or you know what I mean. You can put it

135
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.130
Cricket Icon: See

136
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:37.590
Cricket Icon: I had a boring. I'm in a two bedroom now and I'm moving into a two bedroom. So, so to her Show theme needed more space. She's moving to exactly what she was in

137
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:48.840
Cricket Icon: So I don't know how to end that why I want to move out. I'm thinking of just putting because I don't want to offend her. Like I said, I don't want her to try to make things worse on me.

138
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.340
Cricket Icon: Right, I mean,

139
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.080
Cricket Icon: If I were because honestly, I would honestly want to put the truth.

140
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.220
Because

141
00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.040
Cricket Icon: I want to move to

142
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:14.970
Cricket Icon: A different apartments for better management maintenance and a safer place to raise my kids. That would be my truly honest answer why want to move out. But if I put that I don't want to offend her and then she ends up

143
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:23.010
Cricket Icon: Doing something out of, out of hatred to to ruin things for me getting this apartment. And then on the on the street.

144
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

145
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:38.490
Cricket Icon: So, well, yeah. So I think, I think I'm just going to end it in that way. JUST JUST DO TO ME, I'M WANTING TO, YOU KNOW, JUST JUST TRY JUST TRY.

146
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:52.770
Cricket Icon: Just try out a new apartment complex or something like that and see and see all my kids like it different, you know, school district and stuff like that. Just being that I've been here eight years and

147
00:21:53.550 --> 00:22:07.110
Cricket Icon: You know, I've had been had the the the best experience and for the past four years. I won't say specifically because of her but on ever since she took over. I had not had

148
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.150
Cricket Icon: A good

149
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:22.080
Cricket Icon: I just haven't had like nothing fixed in the house. I've had a hard time getting a hold of her. And when I do get a hold of her. She never asked him to talk to me or

150
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:30.750
Cricket Icon: Like when my when my door when when my house got robbed after she had people doing you know their stuff across for me.

151
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:38.580
Cricket Icon: For two, two and a half years. They live there. She didn't move them out for nothing. It took the police to finally get called

152
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:47.340
Cricket Icon: For quoting on to go and finally victim. That's what it took for my phone calls, didn't matter. She didn't need victim at all.

153
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:58.320
Cricket Icon: So I dealt with it I dealt with it. And my kids have to deal with it. And it was, it was really, really, I just, I just had a really, really bad experience these past four years that she has been a manager.

154
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:08.610
Cricket Icon: And if you are a team and go on the website and read the comments you will you will read a lot of the comments of the same stuff on saying and

155
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:16.320
Cricket Icon: This is dumb. I've said before I even read those comments so obviously I'm not the only one that is getting put through this

156
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.110
Cricket Icon: She picks. She picks and choose

157
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:38.670
Cricket Icon: Who she wants to move into her three bedrooms and from that that's that's how she says it my three bedrooms. I'm not going to move you into one of my three bedroom than she laughs It's like like wow really like why I've been a loyal.

158
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:54.930
Cricket Icon: Tenant for the past eight years I've. Why would you know moving into the bedroom. But whatever, it's over with. I'm just going to put in my 30 day notice I'm going to get that that that that just later that letter just stating that I don't owe anything and

159
00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.080
Cricket Icon: And that's it, and just move out here.

160
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good, good. Yeah, good.

161
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:04.710

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, OK.

173
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:41.640
Cricket Icon: Ok I wanted so so yesterday I had missed i i know i think i have to speak with Antoinette.

174
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:48.960
Cricket Icon: Or I'm not too sure if you're able to do this for me, but okay so yesterday I miss group at four.

175
00:25:49.410 --> 00:26:00.960
Cricket Icon: Do to this apartment situation. So I was I was with all three my kids. Plus, I was taking care of to my niece's so I had all five of the kids with me. I was on the road.

176
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.890
Cricket Icon: And I was going to take them to a park. I was about to get on group.

177
00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:18.510
Cricket Icon: Checking out for. And then I got a phone call from the apartment complex stating a you you guys can even call them, is it Dr. Joanne Kendall would like to call them and confirm it that at that time.

178
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:26.580
Cricket Icon: I was there. Anyway, they, they called me and they said, also we need you to come in right right now to fill out this paperwork.

179
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:45.480
Cricket Icon: She said, because if you don't come and sign up, put your signature on on the people work that that that I have to send to Karen, which is the sun Pacific housing by today. She said somebody else can come in and do it and end up taking the apartment. So it was really important

180
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:55.320
Cricket Icon: So at that point, I just told all the kids get back in the van. And I, I didn't even think to still try to get on on the virtual fit, but I was driving

181
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.280
You know, so

182
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:17.760
Cricket Icon: I just I just ended up getting distracted. I mean, I'm not, I'm not very i'm not i'm trying to sugarcoat or anything. I'm just being straight up honest with you guys I I'm wanting to stay consistent with this. So I tried to get in to dr candles on six o'clock meeting.

183
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:18.540
On six

184
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:30.510
Cricket Icon: Um, yeah, and I go home at six about 603 I called the virtual clinic and I told him exactly what I told you the story that I got distracted. I'm sorry if they could please

185
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.360
Cricket Icon: Give me the number I had a really did my survey, they can just give me the number to Dr. Kendall and

186
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:47.460
Cricket Icon: Dr Kindles group. So I could attend this six o'clock group. Anyways, so by the time I got to the virtual clinic I had already spoke to, like, six like six different people. We keep getting

187
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:58.200
Cricket Icon: We kept on getting disconnected or they would hang up on me or just something would happen. So by the time I spoke to the last guy he finally gave me the number

188
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:16.440
Cricket Icon: Four for the group, but it was already. It was already 658 so when I tried to get in. Dr. Kendall, I had had denied me from the group because it was already over. So my, my question is, is there any way that that you could get me into

189
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:32.190
Cricket Icon: Into a group today. I know, I know, shared groups on Wednesdays as well. I just really need to make up this group, because I don't want to see her next weekend and she takes me back to my week I just went back to my two weeks, you know,

Cricket Icon: And she and she knows that I that I that I tried to go in because she she she obviously saw me trying to get into groups. And then, and then she she rejected me so obviously she saw my name there. She saw me trying to

195
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do is too late.

196
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:12.390
