00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.429
Gwenevere Abriel: Jay,

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.029
Gwenevere Abriel: Justin is his real name.

3
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.050
Jay: Morning.

4
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you made it.

5
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.140
Jay: Everybody's blowing me up now.

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh really,

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.750
Jay: Seems like every time I come to group. People want to start calling me and messaging me

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a way. So what, here's what will happen, typically

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Your sometimes what happens is the audio in here will turn off or the video will turn off if people try to reach you. Can you put your phone on Do Not Disturb because it'll, it'll throw everything off.

10
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: If you know how to do that. I always forget how to do it, personally, but I know I like it when I do remember

11
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool.

12
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.370
Jay: I might have to get up and start hitting the work in about 15 minutes, is that cool.

13
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It is absolutely not. So, this will be a no show

14
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.950
Jay: This will be a no show

15
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.620
Jay: I'll still be on the phone with you.

16
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.580
Know,

17
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Jay,

18
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: This is therapy. This is not checking this is not, this is not

19
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This is sit down.

20
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at what's going on that has kept the addictive behavior moving forward. This is not counseling. This is not a woman who's going to tell you how to live your life. This is therapy can't do it on the fly. Can't do it.

21
00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this may not be what you were expecting. This is actual therapy through tele health and it can happen. You can get somewhere else, you can feel something different, you're thinking can change, but you're going to have to be present for it.

22
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It may not be what you were thinking, maybe it was you were thinking, maybe it was just check in with another person. I could see your texts. You were like confused about what was going on. This is therapy.

23
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.700
Jay: Okay, yeah.

24
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Different really different.

25
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've been in in programs before so I know you know the idea where you sit with someone you talk

26
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe even have experiential exercises and I don't know what interventions and techniques you you've been offered, but I'm excited. This

27
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This program. I've been able to do. I mean, it's hard. I can't do too much because you aren't like right here. I can't do some of my, my little things that I have you guys hold in your hands. I can't do that. But I can do a lot of the techniques.

28
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But it does require undivided attention. We can't have it divided attention. We're going to all both of us do a crummy job.

29
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what's it like to hear that you're actually going to be getting therapy.

30
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.210
Jay: I don't know that I've ever had it before.

31
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Cool. Well, this is, this is going to be exciting them. So one of the first things is understanding the difference

32
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So I've been doing this for over 20 years and

33
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people think, oh yeah, I got a counselor and they're telling me to do this and telling me to do that. I can't tell you how to live your life I want

34
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's none of my business. All I can do is I can share some ideas. We can do some experiential exercises. But ultimately, it's going to come down to

35
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether you want to do behavioral experiments to see if you like, who you are better if you feel proud of yourself.

36
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If relationships start to improve if communication starts to improve if you kind of like who you are in the moments of your day.

37
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If once you were having intruding thoughts from the past that you didn't like. And maybe you were angry or maybe it seemed like you were too angry over little things, and all of a sudden you're like, Wait a minute.

38
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nothing but a thing. And I'm not upset. Maybe this therapy thing. Maybe it's got some validity. That's the goal for you to feel better and not have to be reaching for

39
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The substances. I'm not going to get in. You're not going to hear me telling you. Hey, quit marijuana. You're not going to hear me that, but you're going to know through working with me that the overarching philosophy my bias, if you will, is that you're enough

40
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't born needing to have weed. You weren't born meeting to have fentanyl in burka sets you have your own ability inside of you.

41
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To heal itself to feel good but likely given some of the story you told me when I first met you. You've been robbed.

42
00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Of some opportunities of appropriate healthy developmental milestones and you have had to compensate deeply for missed opportunities.

43
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am very sorry for that. And I remember listening to your stories and there was no time for me to sort of hold that with you hold that space and let you know how sorry

44
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I am that you had to have so much time right in those in those those schools, those kind of settings. They're not very nurturing it's it's rare when we run across someone who, you know, really sees us and loves us and cares about us.

45
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just a number. We're just writing for not really known

46
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So this may feel really different in here.

47
00:05:46.020 --> 00:06:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But give yourself a chance. The first 30 days, it might feel kind of forced like show for this stupid thing. That's okay. I have faith. I'll hold the faith for us that you'll recognize yourself in here, you'll say, got a glimpse. I'm excited.

48
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I can have access to happy like the rest of the world looks like everybody looks like like that. How did they do it.

49
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we can create that space together.

50
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the first things I'm going to ask is,

51
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.510
That

52
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You find a place and it doesn't mean it all has to happen today maybe it'll take a week or two weeks or something. But, see if you can find a place in this setting where you are now in your home.

53
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Find some stack of books on a toaster. I don't care where you put me but you want to put me down so that you and I can have what would be sort of this social medicine where we could look at each other, I'd I because I

54
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to be moving. Oh, nice. Thank you. That's really cool. Very cool. All right. Yeah. All right.

55
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been thinking about you and wondering

56
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, what are his current expectations. What does he really want from this program. I'm wondering if it's

57
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Changing

58
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: As you're sitting in group or if maybe the context of your life is still so unsettled, and so on, supportive that you can't quite dive into really embracing what recovery is

59
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe you're feeling cynical like this is just like any other program. They don't really give a shit. And I'm just trying to make money and then wondering what you've been thinking about

60
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:42.900
Jay: I like the program. It's the only one that I was able to find to help me get on Suboxone and that single handedly has helped me

61
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.300
Jay: They will bring the heroin in the middle.

62
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pretty cool stuff isn't it, that buprenorphine.

63
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.490
Jay: When

64
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.580
Jay: I got up in November. I spent all of November, December in January, trying to find the program and I couldn't

65
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Really yeah Sometimes I'm hearing people that they're able to find them because it is challenging because this is this piece where you have to actually take a look at behavior.

66
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What what is my, what am I, beliefs, where is my thinking not productive like it's asked a lot of people. It's not just taking another pill, where I was taking this other pill.

67
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's starting to really do some healing and it is asking a lot. So I would just invite you to

68
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Have just enough of an open mind for it, at least during these 30 days to kind of get to know me and you get to see whether this is something you can do.

69
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just show up for the appointments. It is month weekly group and individual therapy for 30 days it's intense, not gonna lie.

70
00:08:48.270 --> 00:09:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think you're gonna like it. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE YOURSELF IN HERE. Like, oh yeah, I am this good guy. I am I like it. Okay, I'm not here to make funny. I'm not here to insult you. We're going to focus on the things that you want to focus on. Okay.

71
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's start there. First of all, let me tell you.

72
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You just took in a lot of new information with with grace. You really did.

73
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, that was new. It's like I got 15 minutes I gotta get to work. You know, you're my way and you just heard.

74
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I gotta be here for 45 minutes

75
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you handled that really elegantly. Thank you for that. Um,

76
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So that said, let's go take a peek. Let's go see what when we first met, what you identify are some of the things that you wanted to work on, because maybe they're different because when I first meet people. They're like, hey yeah just getting my subs get on. I remember, I remember

77
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a sense of humor. I know what's up.

78
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so let me just get in there for just a second.

79
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.280
Second here.

80
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know it's just and rights not GA. Okay, so I gotta try and keep remembering that because in the record. It's not J.

81
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm.

82
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:26.940
Like it so far about it. W. Well, I don't like that either.

83
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.760
Got here.

84
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.450
What just Justin.

85
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.260

Gwenevere Abriel: What's your last name is William center some

87
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.800
Williams.

88
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll take that and see what happens.

89
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:51.690
They'll do

90
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.580
Jay: This

91
00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And this this accent that you have what, where's that come from that like a new mexico accent.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.480
Jay: Thank you.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.670
Jay: Treatment for it, you get

115
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.930
Jay: I got to see a specialist next month on April.

116
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've got some people that are

117
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing there you have an allergy and allergic reaction that's a side effect of smoking way too much is the nausea, vomiting, yeah.

118
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.930
Jay: We helped my stomach.

119
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, what's today. Today is the fourth

120
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.330
Jay: Is it

121
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow. Merry Christmas.

122
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yes. Years. Moving right along right day okay let me see.

123
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we've got

124
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, say, he said to me, I want to keep my anxiety in check.

125
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to stay sober and this isn't this looks like a fraction of the thought and the right yeah I don't know what that means so that we get a transcriptionist and she may have taken a piece of what you said. Let's see if we can fix that. So stay sober and

126
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:32.820
Jay: Good. Right.

127
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And do the right thing. Okay.

128
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

129
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing we need thing. Alright, so what is the thing we're talking about just

130
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.770
Jay: You know, when nobody's looking, I need to stop thinking I can get high and

131
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.790
Jay: Yeah, you know, try to get high under my peels nose or

132
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.860
Jay: Criminal thinking, wow.

133
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you guys could have been in custody. Some of you did some groups and you might notice in group all phrase something a particular way. It will be very similar to

134
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The criminal logic thinking. So I believe I've been listening to something else that spend a decent amount of time and custody and

135
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what you just said that criminal thinking, I call it something else you'll hear it in group. I call it the voice of addiction.

136
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll pull apart that because it doesn't say it's just a slick just a seductive just as conniving and smarter than me. So you're going to get right.

137
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the problem. Right. It is smart really smart. He will find a way around that drug screen, it will find a way around, they'll come up with lots of excuses to really smart. And that's the tricky bit but that's over here.

138
00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's you the authentic self. So you're going to end group and throughout you'll hear me say, Now recently how loud has that voice then

139
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Hasn't been the dominant voice. It's making your decisions for you about who to talk to, who to show your feelings to buy, whether you're going to eat right do right you know

140
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:32.250
Gwenevere Abriel: High itself. Something omit something lie, steal this is right, you might call it. So now in here. You'll be thinking, okay, so she's talking about like the attic. But then there's you

141
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to talk to you.

142
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there'll be times when I may not hear you. I might be hearing when I think is the guy that's kind of slick, it's going to run. He's going to run a test the limits with me to be like, you know, I gotta be out in 14

143
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But

144
00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I am going to be keeping my arrow for you. The one that might risk vulnerability

145
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, over time, you might see I'm trustworthy that you can show that underbelly stuff. The

146
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: stuff for you don't have to be tough, you don't. You don't have to front.

147
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'll earn that and I know that takes time and I'm open to it. Okay.

148
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, let me see how much you've already addressed, what I would call that first line of defense around a recovery program. Let's just touch very quickly on

149
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you mentioned you're already kind of trying to stay under the radar with your PO and working a bit of a game. You know, I got a time. And how long does it stay in my system and about your kind of crunching the numbers.

150
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And

151
00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you

152
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: changed any of the people.

153
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're hanging with any of the connects. I didn't know if you were more of a dealer or consumer. Are you still selling and hoping. Oh, I don't, I can sell, but I won't have to use it.

154
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, okay, so how about on the cell phone.

155
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people leave town like they just leave Clovis, I gotta go.

156
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people change their number. Some people texts there connects or Texans they don't even contact me.

157
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't glass me with Lizzie, you got a new supply something just lose my number because I'm going to take it. I'm going to be pissed and like you don't give a crap about me.

158
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So lose my number and they block the ones all the people change numbers all the time, at least for blocking those numbers. So where do you fall in that protecting your recovery. Where do you fall

159
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.190
Jay: I just let people know upfront that I could get high. And I just, I don't trust people. It's hard for me to trust people so

160
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.980
Jay: It's not hard for me to avoid them. It's just I get that thought in my head and

161
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.590
Jay: No, I want to go get high. I get that. It is OK. OK.

162
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine. Okay, and we're going to, we will spend time on writing that down. And it's, it's, it's, I got you.

163
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is early, it's still really, really, really early recovery for you. So we're talking about you were able to tell some people, there's some people that you didn't tell where you keeping that door open. Just a little

164
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.020
Jay: I I don't talk to. I haven't talked to him since I've been out. So I just think it best to leave it on

165
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but the doors open because didn't change your phone number or you

166
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't

167
00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You did change it over. Okay. Is there number in that cell phone. No. Okay, so that's a good thing. That's a good one. You should be getting fewer people contacting you randomly where you're going to have to challenge yourself with temptation. That's great.

168
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

169
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So how often do you get

170
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: texts from people that are trying to offer you.

171
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.750
Jay: Oh, I got one. Just last night.

172
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of that guy gets remember

173
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.330
Jay: Facebook Messenger.

174
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

175
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.970
Jay: Yeah, it wasn't on the phone. It was on messenger. I got everybody on there.

176
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.310
Okay, so

177
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.420
Jay: That's just one of those spots where I told him I'm not using no more.

178
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe doing a little bit of protection in there too. And maybe we can do, if you wanted to just to see how it felt. Do a little sabbatical from Facebook for a while.

179
00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes that influence coming from there isn't the greatest anyway we can kind of change the relationship we have with with that social media.

180
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're being candid with me and saying that it's coming in right it's going to, it comes from all kinds of places because like I said, they're very smart.

181
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: They want they want money right

182
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a business plan. Yeah.

183
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.690
You're a customer.

184
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the edge. Right. So let's talk about in real time, day to day for you will just take, let's just take a little bit that you've been awake today. Just take the hours that you've had consciousness won't even talk about dream life.

185
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

186
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Been awake.

187
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How many times has it crossed your mind.

188
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.440
Jay: Once or twice. Okay.

189
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember as soon as you're conscious, sometimes you know we're conscious and our eyes aren't even open

190
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't happen that fast.

191
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.680
Jay: Yeah.

192
00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Soon as the way to remember what the thought was

193
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.630
Jay: Oh, no.

194
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you don't. Okay.

195
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.150
Jay: It wasn't that

196
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but if you remember that it happens that fast. As soon as you wake up.

197
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.570
Jay: Yeah, okay.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.220
Yeah, okay.

201
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But you did something else. You had to remember something

202
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you remember

203
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.620
Jay: That I need to stay clean

204
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And that need

Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so that P O is actually a positive thing for you that that threat is keeping you on point, even as early as in the morning. So, so he's an asset actually having that that there is a positive thing.

Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I asked you before. If you happen to have a picture of his business card.

246
00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to kind of check in and see, is it getting to the point where you're having any thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself. Is it getting that bad.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.480
Jay: Have you said voluntary. Okay.

271
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, whereas in health

272
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.170
Jay: Mental health resources.

273
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:54.900
Okay.

274
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed that that document indicates an I. O. P.

275
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not in an IoT right now you are in

276
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:09.870
Jay: Doing. Yeah.

277
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did that level of care already

278
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Alright, so this is sort of the lower level. But if you're also saying the somehow which baffles me

279
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't get therapy didn't get therapy. What did they do just talking to you about brain science and what, what did you learn from it.

280
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.890
Jay: Basically they tell me all my problems and I'm supposed to be okay with it. That's how I feel about it.

281
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:50.220
Jay: They're quick to throw medications or something to fix it, but they're not quick to try to help you figure out alternative routes to acting by interacting

282
00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:59.400
Jay: Yeah, you know what I mean, you know, help me remember that stuff. It just give me meds and China Medicaid. Okay.

283
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So put me back on a shelf and let's let's get into it. Then I feel like, and then I want you to at least walk away today with the one

284
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Skill. That is because you just mentioned the word

285
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: mentioned the word violence. But even if you hadn't. This is the number one skill that when people leave treatment or you'll hear him a group, they'll say,

286
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: First I did this and I go, I can't believe that it works so well or the like, yeah, I forgot about all that other fancy stuff. You told me

287
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I do this one thing

288
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to teach it to you right now.

289
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me kind of look at your position when I may ask you at some point to I'm unfortunate I'm standing. So I have sort of this really open sort of

290
00:30:55.770 --> 00:31:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Rib cage and and I can do it really easy. But when we actually do the rehearsal of this skill I might ask you to lean back a little bit. But for now, I'm just going to do some education. Okay.

291
00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to talk about the neat thing that sciences able to explain that philosophy and a lot of religions even have been doing for centuries.

292
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: They've been breathing.

293
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been breathing, but you may not have been doing

294
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What the parasympathetic nervous system is set up to do for you.

295
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have two systems, right, we have the sympathetic that's fight that when you don't have to think about. I need to knock this guy out or I need to need to pull my arms up to protect my core you do it unconsciously like that she's BAM that's fight or flight I fam. Well, it's fight.

296
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Or its flight but those thoughts. The sympathetic nervous system and it's going to act automatically and it's kept you alive. I'm sure in many cases.

297
00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it's in her personal we get defensive. Same thing, angry, it has kept you alive. It is kept you safe. And I don't want that to leave. I want that to always be there and it will because didn't go anywhere. Okay, keeps us safe on the downside is that all of the blood

298
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Goes to our large muscle groups.

299
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:35.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Our thighs are biceps, your triceps. Because if we're gonna fight we needed their hands get cold and guess what blood is not appear in our executive functioning in the frontal lobe right up here. The one that thinks things through.

300
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't need to be there. You don't need to be analyzing the possible outcome of giving this man black I would be. You don't need to you, you're just in self preservation. So we don't need the blood there.

301
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But that isn't it because now you're not in custody and if you're starting to change the people you're hanging out with we don't

302
00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't really need that we need a more refined response to a perceived threat and typically are threats are now in her personal, most of them right. You just like you you you coming at me right

303
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that, okay.

304
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not much of a solid game. I just, but I try

305
00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But I get it though I've because a lot of the people I'm working with, you know, years and years of incarceration just

306
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: 20 years. Sometimes, I mean, you guys are like, how do you expect me live in the community one new skill at a time. That's how okay

307
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is a great one. I love it, I do it all the time, all my clients do it and you get to have it too. So first, I'm giving you the science and I will, I will get to it here, I promise.

308
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. What I'm going to be asking you to do is I'm going to call it the bagel break this is here's the science behind this. You don't have to believe it. You can think it's hocus pocus. And it's still going to work. Okay.

309
00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm the Vegas nerve is. It's called the wandering nerve because it attaches to our facial, facial muscles to our eyes to this little loose bone in our ear.

310
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Larynx fairing heart, lungs, gut and all those guts below our diet from, you know, the diaphragm cuts your body in the middle. Right. Okay. Really important. That's the big piece.

311
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So what happens when and I'll be teaching how to do it. I'll be teaching you belly breathing.

312
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Called lots of different names, but I like the word belly, because you'll remember that the belly is the most important part. So,

313
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens is when we do this particular kind of breathing. It's smashes that diaphragm down. And remember, I was telling me that that Vegas nerve is wrapped around the the spleen, the kidney.

314
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's liver it's it's wrapped around it like so when I breathe this belly breath down like this.

315
00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It sends a signal a fair. Currently, which means up to the brain and the brain is like this. What are you coming at me, you know, we're in a threat response. I'll fail. I'm being abandoned I'm being rejected all threat response unconscious, but we're going to

316
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We might verbally be aggressive or we might respond on ethics. So this, this is happening up here at the top. We're in threat response we are

317
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably angry underneath that we're afraid, but let's just go with anger, we're probably aware of anger. But guess what happens with the bagel break the signal comes up this way.

318
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Think it's in complete contradiction to this thought which is I'm in danger is in contradiction. This one that breath. You know what, it just said.

319
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: If we're breathing into our belly likes out. Everything's fine.

320
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Because nobody breeze like we're about to get in a fight. You can't, right, you're not gonna be like

321
00:35:59.100 --> 00:35:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you're gonna be

322
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Up here, short and tight right

323
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's so cool. It's incomplete opposite to the threat response. So guess what we keep doing it. We keep doing this belly breathing, which I'm going to teach shortly. And then guess what the brands like

324
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I guess there's really no one here with a knife, a gun. There's no lion no pair of bear. There's really actually no danger. It's just, I'm perceiving threat. No, wait, my body's. Okay. Oh, wait a minute. There is no threat. Oh my gosh, I'm in a relaxed body.

325
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what we want. You get to have control over that mind of yours that just automatically runs just instantaneously to this perceived threat. We can now.

326
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: With our own body. We can regulate and that's exciting.

327
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to teach you a very structured way to do it. If you forget all of the structure. Let's say you forget the four count.

328
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing in for four seconds and holding for four seconds and exhaling out for four seconds and holding for four seconds. Let's say you forget all about that.

329
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you remember is

330
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.640
See if I can see

331
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch, watch my shoulders. I'm going to do it the old way.

332
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: See my shoulders go up. That's the way you do it now Nomar not when we're doing belly breathing, not when you want to do the big ol break and say, Okay, I need to chill.

333
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to. I need to really be thinking this through what you're going to end up doing. And I'm just going to tell you this one piece that we're going to teach the whole thing is I'm going to see my hands go out and in.

334
00:37:54.810 --> 00:38:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: When I inhale, I'm literally as if expanding a balloon. It's so weird to breathe in.

335
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And pop up that balloon, which means my stomach's going to expand. I'm actually breathing in through my nose.

336
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And the air South staying up at the top, it's going down low, which expands, my stomach out my hands come out a little. They don't come out much and it might feel really awkward and bizarre because we don't do it very often, unless you're like a yogi or something.

337
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: But the shoulders. Don't move. That's how you're going to know shoulders and are going to move. So just for now just do the first piece I want you to put your hands on your stomach. First, get all the air out. Just get it all out.

338
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then in through the nose, and I want you to put all that air of the bottom of the long and your stomach is going to push out because you will have filled it with their did you feel how weird it feels kind of like, awkward. Am I right.

339
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah not natural. Don't forget to inhale keep we're not doing their says, I'm just using that part. Don't forget to breathe.

340
00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But I wanted you because some people. That's where we spend like 1020 times because it's so foreign and bizarre. We have to kind of work that but you look like you got it like you saw the hands go out

341
00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And I noticed that your shoulders aren't going up and down. So that says to me, you're getting it.

342
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's exciting. So I noticed that she sat back a little bit. That's fantastic. I'm just going to run through different different for now. Keep it, you can do the hands on the belly.

343
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You can put down your size for a second. But I just want to run through a couple of things you could do the ever want to call it the lazy boy, it's just a lazy boy couch traipse

344
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.190
Jay: Always do

345
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, that's great for you. So you're going to be there. Anyway, look what it does, it expands that rib cage makes it all possible. That's a great way to get that error going down in there. Another one is Superman.

346
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Right hands around your sides and another one is you tuck your hands under your size. So that's going to get, get that rib cage open. So lots of different ways to kind of remind okay I'm doing this with intention.

347
00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to really open up this this rib cage and get some room in there to get that error, not just at the top because that keeps reinforcing. Oh yeah, we gotta breathe, nice and short fast because we're in trouble.

348
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Check this body. So we want to send a contradictory message saying we're okay. We're in a relaxed body, everything's okay there's no danger, no perceived threat. Okay.

349
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the instruction. So we got that breathing. I think you, you're going to be able to do that. So here's the full instruction just instruction, you decide to go along, that's up to you. All I'm doing is just teaching

350
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So you see my little screen. Right. It's kind of convenient for me. So it's going to be mindfully, which means we can feel the cool air or warm air coming in.

351
00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:38.970
Jay: Through our you

352
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Know maybe the wiggle on her nose hair or something. So we're going to be paying attention to it. It'll be an inhale through the nose for for it'll be for, for, for, for every performer.

353
00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we'll hold for 321 and then we'll sell out

354
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll hold 321

355
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.860
Hold 321

356
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, see. So I don't think this is going to be difficult for you. I think you're taking instruction, really, really well. So we're going to go through it a few times together. You literally were doing it as I was instructing for the first time.

357
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this is going to be readily available to you for you. Remember, you can do it on the wrong count. You could even inhale the whole time through your nose.

358
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You could inhale the whole time through your mouth, your shoulders could either be moving, but the one thing you can't compromise on is what

359
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Bam. That's why I'm not calling it box breathing anymore because I was because here's the box.

360
00:41:52.500 --> 00:42:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not calling a diet for mounting breathing calling a belly breathing, because maybe now everyone will remember that little Buddha belly has got to happen that balloon.

361
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because that's, that's when I know that long. It is expanding at the bottom. So we're going to do a few together. But first I want to, I want you to feel in real time, the efficacy of it.

362
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now I want you to pull into what's called a working memory right now you're probably focused on me, you're maybe a little curious and

363
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And your focus right here in this moment new information is coming out to you, but just for a second. I want you to pull up into a memory.

364
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Not 100% distressing. Just a little one, one that's a little like upsetting not 100% maybe at a 50% if it were zero to 101 one that kind of pisses you off or scares you or makes you sad. Just a little one. Do you have it in your mind right now.

365
00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and does your body know that you're having that thought. Is it reacting where

366
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.640
Jay: My back. Oh, you're back. Okay.

367
00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. We'll take care of that back. Make sure you're paying attention to it. So, stretch it out, sit, sit. A place where you're really honoring now. Okay. Yes.

368
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Register. That's the soma, you're going to hear me out times a lot of talk about where you feeling it in the body. What's the somatic response. You're going to hear me using those words because I care about body.

369
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the mind, the soul whole deal. I care about. It's all we're all connected. So I'm

370
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Told that they're right. You, you have this image of something negative in your mind and your body registered it right away.

371
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and now let's do this. Breathing together. So let's get all your air out. I'm going to watch you get it all out while you're out good. And now let's inhale through your nose for four seconds.

372
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale

373
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.490
Hold 321 inhale.

374
00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale it all out.

375
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it out for 321 inhale in.

376
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold it for 321 exhale all that out nice fat belly.

377
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 inhale through the nose.

378
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 feel it come out of your mouth.

379
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 in health, the nose, big belly.

380
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Or 321 excellent all outside xxx out, you know, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap hold 321 in half.

381
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 exhale

382
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Really even make that one even five seconds really let it out.

383
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, good, good, good, good, and hold it for 321 inhale.

384
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: big belly.

385
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's hold it there for 321 excellent all out letters, you can

386
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it out.

387
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to do the next one in Hell on your own.

388
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And then counting inside your head.

389
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale. And this time, close your eyes and just do it on your own. You don't need my, there we go. You got it.

390
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.100
You're ready, let it all out.

391
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget to hold that air out with no air and the lung for a few seconds. Even if you can do it for two. That's just great.

392
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And last one. Good. And let's come back to this moment where we're interacting in the telehealth here. No one asked you what was that like for you. What did you notice about your mind and how's your back.

393
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.000
Jay: I noticed it took my mind away from it.

394
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

395
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It took your mind away from it the it is what

396
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:14.010
Jay: Brought

397
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You back and that image memory. I asked you to think of something distressing.

398
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, did this take your total concentration to do

399
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This. It's hard. It's hard to do. So there's two things you just found in found down in real time and I didn't explain it up front. You did two things you did to biological things

400
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That you don't have to believe in psychology and psychobabble you'll have to believe in it.

401
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Vegas nerve ACTIVATED BECAUSE YOU DID THE BELLY breath. And this is actually did kind of three things.

402
00:47:54.510 --> 00:48:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them is it. You did something new, the brain loves new, it's like, Oh, I never seen that before. It wants to

403
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Completely zero in on you get a new game, you get a new person, you got a new movie and like I'm you're totally fixated on it brain loves that stuff, and you did something where you were learning something new. We're literally trying to get it right.

404
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And it took all of your focus

405
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it took your focus off of this other because it's a neural network. This stuff that's around back ache and whatever that image was that you pulled up and you didn't even share it with me. I didn't tell you to

406
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Spill the beans, like, tell me a dramatic story now didn't have to. You took care of yourself right then.

407
00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You brought it up into your working memory and instead of focusing on that neural network and has some association with back thing. You went

408
00:48:51.780 --> 00:49:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And you focus on something new and you were not in the same neural network in your brain. And you weren't thinking you weren't aware of this stuff. You did two things you worked

409
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Top down intervention which is cognitive down which by distracting, your brain and doing something new and difficult and you really did it with great fidelity, you really tried to do it exactly as you're instructing which takes concentration not willy nilly.

410
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And you did an intervention which is called bottom up, which means reducing the body to tell the brain to do something.

411
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You have access to that for the rest of your life you have access to it. The second that consciousness hits you in the morning and I invite you to do it if you can put 20 seconds between an automatic action. Fantastic. It's a win. Okay, between you having a stimulus.

412
00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And response if we can get a little bit of time in their great that breathing can give that to you.

413
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone pisses you off. You do this breathing. I'm going to remember consequence.

414
00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm going to remember this fancy way that when you're taught me and group about how to talk to someone. I'm remember that fancy things she taught can't remember it when I'm popping off on someone writes can

415
00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You got a skill that I wish all of you had when you were children. I wish you had it when you were adolescence. I wish you had it your whole life, but it's yours now.

416
00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I recommend you do it when you wake up sometime throughout the day, at least three times a day, right before you go to bed.

417
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason I want you to do it is because the more you do it, the more tissue because that's what's going on. It's actual tissue growth in your brain.

418
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting more neural connections in there and you might remember it because practice.

419
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Right means you might actually remember doing it under a stressful situation. Oh, I don't want to smoke. Oh, I don't want to do this other thing I want to feel good. How do I take care of myself. I'm gonna do this breathing. Okay, let's let's

420
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: shift gears for a second and focus on scheduling. Our next appointment. Okay.

421
00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:05.820
Okay.

422
00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just timing me just take a look

423

Okay.

440
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I sometimes I forget because I'm human. I'm I've been doing this for these reminders for about a year and it works best for everybody seems to help people stay on on task, but it's not a requirement. I just do it because it seems to work for everybody.
