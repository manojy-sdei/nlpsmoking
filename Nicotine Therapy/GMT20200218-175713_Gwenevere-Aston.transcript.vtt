00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's check on sound because I haven't heard anything yet.

2
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Check, check.

3
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Not yet. Maybe it's me though. Let me see if there's something I'm doing. Nope.

4
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.120
Check, check, check.

5
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.430
Check, check, check, check.

6
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes just muting I'm turning a mute on and off can snap. Yep. I got it. I can hear you. And you can hear me okay

7
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.350
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I can hear me. I couldn't hear you for a moment there. But now I can hear you.

8
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to open up a note.

9
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.690
And I'll just take a second.

10
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So you got a new job. Ah. That is cool. Is this, like, then

11
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it didn't work out.

12
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.120
No.

13
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It is. Is it a big disappointment or a little one.

14
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.550
Saraniah Aston: It's a little one, actually.

15
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.420
Okay.

16
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I've been practicing your name. So I think I got it.

17
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Sarah Nia

18
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.870
Saraniah Aston: Perfect, yeah.

19
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: See, I told you I was gonna try

20
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so it was a little disappointment.

21
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: How does this impact, sort of, is it

22
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Affecting sort of being able to pay bills. Is it kind of significant in that way, or how does it affect you.

23
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.530
Saraniah Aston: Know, it was more significant and just

24
00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:04.560
Saraniah Aston: You know my life was I was going to do something new and important but vice president of the program here.

25
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.880
Saraniah Aston: Is a complete I found out sleazeball and

26
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.040
Saraniah Aston: Oh, it was only interested

27
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.500
Saraniah Aston: In other things.

28
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So he was

29
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: A sleazeball kind of good that you caught that early. I mean this right before you put all your eggs in this basket.

30
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.160
Saraniah Aston: Yeah. Right. Great thing. Yeah.

31
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost like you avoided something that could have been much, much worse.

32
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.740
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

33
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Is he the one that initially interviewed you.

34
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.280
Saraniah Aston: Yeah. Well, yeah.

35
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: There wasn't was their awareness that was kind of like something was off about him. When you first met him, didn't seem like there was some clothes.

36
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.830
Saraniah Aston: Know when I first met him.

37
00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:05.610
Saraniah Aston: He was very like positive and kind and empathetic and just he seemed like the real sweetheart, and then

38
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.250
Saraniah Aston: He just wanted to video chat and go over some things with me and it just turned into a complete a man

39
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Was he crossing a boundary. Was he being like

40
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Sexual creepy.

41
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.560
Oh, he's

42
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: A dirtbag.

43
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: sleazeball i don't think your term.

44
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Okay, well I'm disappointed with you. That's, that's too bad. And you said it was something new and important.

45
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.910
Saraniah Aston: Well, yeah.

46
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What was the job opportunity that you were looking forward to

47
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.200
Saraniah Aston: It was adolescent outreach for

48
00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:00.000
Saraniah Aston: The community or they don't have a really good outreach program for lessons here except for one

49
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.210
Saraniah Aston: Which I discovered through their local thrift store which

50
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:15.180
Saraniah Aston: They have all they have here is a thrift store called it's actually called the swag shop and that's where they

51
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.960
Saraniah Aston: They do all the pre go to our lesson.

52
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.950
Saraniah Aston: Outreach and they have meetings there that you know teams go there.

53
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.710
Saraniah Aston: And there's art therapy and stuff like that. And I was

54
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.440
Saraniah Aston: Interested in therapy and that's basically what it was going to be like yeah

55
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you feel like some of your life experiences really help you understand people maybe more so than other people that have kind of had had an easy

56
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.250
Saraniah Aston: Absolutely.

57
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.230
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

58
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you've taken something negative, and turn it into a way to connect deeply with people. Right.

59
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.480
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that's what I tried to I want this.

60
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And how did you know how did you come across art therapy as something like have you been able to do that yourself.

61
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.190
From them sippy and

62
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.750
Saraniah Aston: I'm mostly through school and

63
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.830
Saraniah Aston: That's about it.

64
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.910
Saraniah Aston: And when I was every time that I had been

65
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:44.370
Saraniah Aston: hospitalized or anything like that. Um, I had always jumped right into it. My interest it were in art therapy. Yeah.

66
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

67
00:05:50.100 --> 00:06:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if we can embark on a reset. You know how we kind of had a disconnect when we first started, can we do. Can we do a reset.

68
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.270
Or

69
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. So I'm a firm believer in them. I think that by naming what a problem was, or if there was a miscommunication or something by naming it

70
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of the potency and intensity can go away.

71
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.970
Saraniah Aston: And

72
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just say

73
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a chance and you have it right now if you want to, to share any concerns that you have about working with me.

74
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Or working with any therapist or maybe something you want to do specifically and you could even include a discussion around art therapy like that might be even something you want to do with me anything.

75
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you weren't given that chance when when I have to do these these assessments of which are the same exact one for everyone.

76
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's not personal. It's, it's like everyone gets these

77
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.200
Questions.

78
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't have a chance to process what those questions felt like, and maybe there was this sense of it was intrusive and triggering for you.

79
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to create that space where you can kind of talk about whatever concerns are and I promise you, you're not going to get back any kind of you know how you mentioned. Oh, you're not mad at me on the text that I am I don't get mad at my clients. That's that just doesn't happen. Okay.

80
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you guys are coming in here with so much vulnerability

81
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I just I just, that's not going to happen here. I want you to feel safe and I think being able to talk about your concerns might help invest in that safety.

82
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.120
Saraniah Aston: I just, I felt like a bunch of

83
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.140
Saraniah Aston: Personal things were

84
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.100
Saraniah Aston: Asked, and I felt corner and

85
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.890
Saraniah Aston: I felt uncomfortable and the next day I couldn't get a bed.

86
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:09.270
Saraniah Aston: Because I can go into a place of depending on what we're going to bring up or bring out

87
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.080
Yeah.

88
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.410
Saraniah Aston: shame, guilt,

89
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.000
Saraniah Aston: You know, self lack of self worth.

90
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.420
Saraniah Aston: All kinds of things can just kind of pop out. And so that's what happened and

91
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:31.620
Saraniah Aston: And it concerned me and I'm you know I'm used to, you know, questions maybe in like a

92
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.320
Saraniah Aston: Maybe like a questionnaire form, but I'm not used to the

93
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.800
Saraniah Aston: The invasive.

94
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.540
Saraniah Aston: Right, a

95
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Person asking those questions.

96
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So a person asking those questions feels more invasive to have a human right to because I was asking them out loud.

97
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.460
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

98
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I get it.

99
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact what ended up happening was, because that that sense of invasiveness then the next day, maybe some shame came up and some

100
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: deficits of self worth, maybe, and then you were wiped out for the day.

101
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:22.110
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I was just done. I just couldn't. Yeah, it was, it was, but the next day I was ok ok I'm

102
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're reaching out to me through text was very smart.

103
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you did that because it looks like we caught it fairly quickly. For some people they they see me right or what I represent, which means more vulnerability

104
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I such a threat that you could have thrown your hands up and walked away from the program altogether. But you hung in there and you texted and you know what I mean, at least you you had that. And I'm really, I'm impressed that you did that. That was really cool.

105
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So what this is doing for me, if I may, I share a little feedback about how it's informing our work and moving forward.

106
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.350
Saraniah Aston: Sure, yeah.

107
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: No it what it's saying to me, or how I'm absorbing this is

108
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of preparation is going to be maybe welcomes like let's make sure our resources are really developed

109
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: A grounding techniques, all the mindfulness stuff. I don't know what resources and coping skills you're already bring to the table. So I'm excited to learn about those

110
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But really making sure they're solidified before if you so decide to do some reprocessing have some some history so that it's no longer intruding

111
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Into your life, whether it's through nightmares or unwanted thoughts are negative self appraisal, but that indeed we spend just a generous amount of time making sure this year you feel grounded and resource. Before we go there.

112
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.400
Saraniah Aston: Does that seem like a reasonable first. Okay.

113
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.110
Saraniah Aston: Absolutely.

114
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and it doesn't sound like with that what that that bio psychosocial that that I did with you.

115
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no checking in.

116
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: With with what you already have. Yeah. So, but it's useful for me, too, because maybe what I can do, if we were even we had even less time because we were crunched with a half hour and you know

117
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: There were a lot of

118
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That one.

119
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't hurt for me to to remember, maybe I can make that a first thing inquiry, hey if negative things come up. Do you have a resource. Do you have a safe place that you can go to sort of in your imagination.

120
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So that you don't dissociate or act out in other people act out. They don't associate, they might act out. So, but it's good. I appreciate the feedback really useful. Thank you.

121
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.060
Saraniah Aston: You know, I just, I guess I'm just, I'm

122
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.350
Saraniah Aston: I am in a place where

123
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.620
Saraniah Aston: I'm finally in

124
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.720
Saraniah Aston: Sorry, sweetie.

125
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.520
Saraniah Aston: I'm in

126
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:16.140
Saraniah Aston: The most control over my life I have been, I think, ever. And I've worked really hard.

127
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.970
Saraniah Aston: And I'm scared, cuz I don't wanna

128
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.060
Saraniah Aston: I don't want to like go backwards. Oh, that makes perfect.

129
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense, you and I don't know you, for very long. But the fact that you

130
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Are here today that you're in this in this work trying to get better, right, trying to heal. That's a real testament to how hard you have been working at this. People don't give themselves enough credit every day is hard.

131
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, they're like, oh, well, there aren't these like accomplishment markers that we compare ourselves to our culture. No, no, no. You need to be giving yourself credit for getting out of bed someday is

132
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, really, truly.

133
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hear you.

134
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:11.790
Saraniah Aston: I'm really hard on myself sometimes. Really, I am I expect sometimes just too much for myself.

135
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And it also sounds like you can see in real time that you are giving yourself some credit for how hard earned this successes that

136
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And so the message to me right is a little i don't i don't want to go backwards. I don't, I don't want that that I can't get out of bed, kind of thing. I just got the message.

137
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.600
Saraniah Aston: It's like it's almost like I can't afford it anymore.

138
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.190
Saraniah Aston: To go backwards. Okay, that makes sense.

139
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I can tell you, well, you know what, why don't you tell me when you were doing some of the psychotherapy that you've you've had in your treatment in the past.

140
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard a little bit about art therapy, which is kind of nice because right it's that intensity of contact with communication.

141
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And the, the potential rejection abandonment criticism threat. All of that stuff is sort of mitigated when we're turning our attention to a drawing to a painting, you know, we can we can buffer. It's kind of nice.

142
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.670
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

143
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.560
Saraniah Aston: Which we can definitely

144
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:31.080
Saraniah Aston: And that's something I do now, like, you know, when I if I do end up freaking out and whatever way it might be. I'll just

145
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.030
Saraniah Aston: I'll just bust out some collage materials and go at it.

146
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: About how long does it take for the distress to go down after you've started the collage work.

147
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.350
Saraniah Aston: Of flowers. Okay.

148
00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So you keep do you use like magazines and different cloth and different things around you kind of keep them handy.

149
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.450
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, there are St. Louis, surrounded by them right now yeah club.

150
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.110
Saraniah Aston: Like vintage

151
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:18.060
Saraniah Aston: Vintage images from old like medical textbooks, stuff like that. I've always been fascinated with medical textbooks.

152
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.150
Saraniah Aston: Not textbooks, but you know images and

153
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:27.540
Saraniah Aston: I like

154
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:40.260
Saraniah Aston: And yeah, regular just magazines. I no matter what. It's happening. I'm always putting stuff out of magazines, just in case I want just to add to the pile of clippings.

155
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like it. So it's an ongoing right you're like I imagined I might want to use this piece something catches your eye, like I'm gonna clip that one out there.

156
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:58.740
Saraniah Aston: Right. Yeah. And I lay everything out and it like a puzzle. And so I put everything together like a puzzle piece. Everything is like a puzzle piece. Hmm.

157
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, just to do something a little different. What would it be like, would it feel invasive or almost a little bit of a stretch, but also a curiosity. If

158
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of talking maybe you brought one of your cautious and you can help me understand a little bit of you by showing it to me without feel a little bit safer and more comfortable.

159
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.630
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I can do that.

160
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like that.

161
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What you have around you that you got handy.

162
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:44.220
Saraniah Aston: Well, right now I don't have anything. Everything is packed I'm moving two weeks. So everything since I just moved up here I have a storage unit. And we're sending

163
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:54.060
Saraniah Aston: Out here soon just bit about money. But right now I really don't have much show except for a box of clicking

164
00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, I got an idea of where to go after that. So I'll just, I'll take a look at what's in there.

165
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:01.500
Saraniah Aston: OK.

166
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.210
Saraniah Aston: Boxes

167
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.980
Saraniah Aston: Boxes

168
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.510
Saraniah Aston: Pick her and

169
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.350
Saraniah Aston: He

170
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.690
Saraniah Aston: Sings Laurel I got

171
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.880
Saraniah Aston: That

172
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.610
Saraniah Aston: I got, I wanted to do something a little political so I've got

173
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.340
Saraniah Aston: I've got

174
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.450
Saraniah Aston: I've got

175
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.270
Saraniah Aston: A little Pinot lady.

176
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.020
Saraniah Aston: I got a bunch of trees here, which is a tree.

177
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you already have, like, when a background of your mind already have a couple of themes that you're already like you mentioned a political one. You already got one I'll brewing back there.

178
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:26.520
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, it's fairly political but I'm also like I'm going to just like throw a bunch of flowers on it to make it, make it

179
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.970
Saraniah Aston: Beautiful. They like kind of like

180
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:46.020
Saraniah Aston: I like to go to a place that is perhaps maybe a little uncomfortable, but to find the beauty in that in things that necessarily aren't so positive or

181
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:57.960
Saraniah Aston: Comfortable and then finding beauty in it somehow. And somehow shorten that so that's, I have a

182
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:08.310
Saraniah Aston: My phone is sitting on right now. I have a big wooden box that is completely prepared for collage. I just hadn't started yet.

183
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so much and what you just said, I'm just sort of sitting with the the power and impact of of right taking taking something that at first blast at that first body slashes like a verse of and anyone else would say, well, that's awful.

184
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.860
Saraniah Aston: You know, and you

185
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Have this special skill to be able to search deeply and and find a way to see its beauty and and that's a real gift that's a real gift that's that's a powerful thing. You have

186
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.520
Saraniah Aston: Well, I'll show it to you. Maybe I'll start today.

187
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it might be a nice segue into a little bit of imagery, can I test the waters with you and see how it goes.

188
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.110
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, sure.

189
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.640
Saraniah Aston: Let's give them my push. Anyways, for we started

190
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Recently, and this these are positive images, just to give you a heads up. I'm not going to be going to to our shadow side the dark side here. I'll just be going to the positive stuff.

191
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And the goal of it is really to have this this experience of feeling safe right feeling like I'm enough. Right.

192
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:24.870
Saraniah Aston: Those are very

193
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Positive things to go towards and what I'd like you to do is cultivate with me three figures, it'll be images of three different real or imagined. I'm not particular honestly just see if you can catch the uncensored truth for you.

194
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: First one.

195
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think of a real or imagined nurturing figure and try to catch those images that first come to your mind who comes to mind.

196
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.380
Saraniah Aston: A nurse.

197
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.430
Nurse.

198
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.400
Anyone else

199
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.790
Saraniah Aston: I had an image of the Virgin Mary, for some reason.

200
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:19.860
Saraniah Aston: That that's what came to my well. And then Dr. Ruth just popped in my head. For some reason, but that's that's what I got.

201
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

202
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.750
Saraniah Aston: I used to listen to

203
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: California

204
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.940
Saraniah Aston: It's funny. She's, she's amazing. She's is really, you know, I

205
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't know that.

206
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.590
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, everyone made sure to tell me that once I got there she is.

207
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have that we've got this sense of

208
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Of nurturing and nurturing oftentimes is that these individuals, the qualities of a nurse the Virgin Mary, and Dr. Ruth want your development and growth. They want you to be your whole self.

209
00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to sort of have that full potential realized and nurture now for you when you think of a nurturer. Is there a statement that comes with it is there, touch, is there a thought. Is there an image in some way like something that really represents that quality.

210
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:25.680
Saraniah Aston: I guess it's an image of not necessarily mother and child, but as of nurture and child.

211
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.360
Saraniah Aston: Like it's almost like a kind of like a

212
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:37.620
Saraniah Aston: Biblical image of, you know, sort of see holding a child or something like that.

213
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, since st holding

214
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.140
Yeah.

215
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to make note of this and I'll probably be referring to it at times in our work together without the okay

216
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.790
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, thank you. You mentioned again it'll probably be surprising to me that I ever said it.

217
00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right, okay.

218
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we can we can find out if it has that same sort of visceral and emotional response. And let me check in with what it is today. So give yourself permission. My eyes are closed to just so you know i'm not staring out to you.

219
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're comfortable with it just

220
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Really being present with the quality of a saint.

221
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding a child and

222
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Check and see if

223
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you the child are you witnessing this child being held. Notice if there's the awareness of a nurse.

224
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they interacting

225
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.350
Saraniah Aston: His mouth very, um,

226
00:23:43.080 --> 00:24:01.140
Saraniah Aston: I would say i'm i'm a little bit of both. But more and more, so the child. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, throughout my life I've gotten the greatest comfort and then like love from nurses

227
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.860
Saraniah Aston: And I've always connected with

228
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:16.890
Saraniah Aston: Nurses, like for example, one of my, I think it was a UCLA. I had one of the nurses at nighttime who would come around and do the checks.

229
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:34.710
Saraniah Aston: She told me on my day that I was on the did. I was just charging most you hope that she would never seen again, which was here, but as I understood. She told me, I'll never forget you, because every time I come in your feet are outside of the blanket and their process.

230
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.120
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

231
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:57.210
Saraniah Aston: So I don't know, I always have a special connection with nurses and I love. I don't know, I feel like nurses can just be so under priests whoa underappreciated. Isn't that the truth is,

232
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: They do so much. Oh.

233
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: They're really

234
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:15.240
Saraniah Aston: Put up with so much in the it has the bite their tongue when they see things that they don't agree with and things aren't easy and it's really strong lot of strings, I would imagine.

235
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sometimes when I've looked at their position and then I'll see you know you'll see this nurse doing everything and then you know the physician will we walk in for five minutes.

236
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And gone. I'm like, wait a minute, who's the real hero here.

237
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:44.940
Saraniah Aston: Yeah and there's can't really like seeing her own praises, you know, she just she works hard or he does their job and

238
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.480
Saraniah Aston: It's not like she can, like, show off of that, it's like it's silence.

239
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.500
Saraniah Aston: And it's just strong

240
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.720
Saraniah Aston: I love her.

241
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about when you when you're present with this this experience of the quality of Dr. Ruth. Let me in a little bit more about what comes up for you around that.

242
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.570
Saraniah Aston: I just think that she she's

243
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.780
Saraniah Aston: Just extremely

244
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:23.670
Saraniah Aston: Transparent open

245
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.850
Saraniah Aston: Strong

246
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.110
Saraniah Aston: Strong, strong willed and

247
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.190
Saraniah Aston: She's a straight shooter.

248
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.890
Saraniah Aston: And she's fighting

249
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.380
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, she's, she's current. Well, no, she's not always calling but

250
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:54.000
Saraniah Aston: I don't know, I guess, um, how forward. She is especially coming from her timing I just really admire it

251
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And Virgin Mary is that sort of still part of this team because we're building a team right now of resources. So I want you to have everything that brings this sort of nurturing space. What about the Virgin.

252
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Mary. Is that still part of the imagery

253
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:23.880
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, it's image and it's more like something that I that I want to kind of show in

254
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.530
Saraniah Aston: One of my inequality. Well, in this collage that I really wanted you Preston at just do it and clippings for forever.

255
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.250
Saraniah Aston: Is

256
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.630
Saraniah Aston: I do see like an image of at least someone who looks like.

257
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.780
Saraniah Aston: The Virgin Mary, you know, with her head.

258
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.290
Saraniah Aston: older child or something like that.

259
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.110
Saraniah Aston: So it could be something that I'll actually use

260
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any more images that come to mind for nurturing figure, there's a

261
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Risk that kind of get it.

262
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.050
Saraniah Aston: I think for now.

263
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We can always add to it.

264
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm keeping this

265
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm keeping an eye on this. There's this place in this note that it's under this plan section where it'll move from note to note, so I don't have to re type, it'll be the right there for us. So I love that part.

266
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's check out another figure, see what comes to mind.

267
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: When you summon up images either real or imagined of a protective figure

268
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: real or imagined.

269
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be from a movie, TV book or maybe you registered a glimpse of it in your real life. You may have caught up. This is a protective figure I feel safe here.

270
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It may have been just a glimpse

271
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.560
Saraniah Aston: Well, it's not a person

272
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.800
Saraniah Aston: Um, it's

273
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.590
Saraniah Aston: It's called the Iron Dome, and it is a

274
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:34.500
Saraniah Aston: If it detects rockets that are being sent over to text them in the air and intercepts them in there is really crazy technology and

275
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.230
Saraniah Aston: If, if it weren't around

276
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.110
Saraniah Aston: Up the places where it

277
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.340
Saraniah Aston: Would just be pretty much destroyed.

278
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.100
Saraniah Aston: So,

279
00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.230
Saraniah Aston: The image of that big piece of machinery.

280
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.660

282
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That when I brought up this protective figure this big piece of machinery, it came to mind right and

283
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.630
Saraniah Aston: It's called the

284
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.760
Saraniah Aston: Bill. Mm hmm.

285
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And as soon as that imagery is brought to your, your conscious awareness and you're spending time revisiting

286
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: The impact that it has to be present with that quality.

287
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel when you hold that image in your mind.

291
00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:04.800
Saraniah Aston: See, when I asked a question for that protector. My mind automatically for surveys and goes to a place of

292
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.810
Saraniah Aston: The opposite the opposite.

293
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.660
Saraniah Aston: Of non protection.

294
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, isn't that something so even saying protection, a fear response happens. Am I hearing that right

295
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.480

00:31:47.160 --> 00:32:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Be present with that one really get into it. I want you to use imagination to picture being held right the touch how warm, you feel maybe the colors that you get to see is it silver, gold is it bright out is it sunny.

Saraniah Aston: She's almost like a saint to me.

366
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

367
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:38.610
Saraniah Aston: Jeff problems. She wasn't necessarily the healthiest proceed drink like a fish.

368
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.090
Saraniah Aston: Now, was that, but

369
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.190
Saraniah Aston: She was amazing.

370
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:55.650
Saraniah Aston: And then she ended up just walking with a cane or one of her feet with her one foot was

371
00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:07.380
Saraniah Aston: One leg just didn't work anymore. So she will walk with a cane these beautiful traditional Mexican dresses and skirts.

372
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And now let's do this. Let's see if we can bring

373
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: The nurturing figures and freedom.

374
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: kalo or Kala Kala

375
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:29.250
Kala

376
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring free to come and you're nurturing figures and let your imagination, bring them all together interacting and see where your mind cools on that creative resource building

377
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Quality just letting them.

378
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Interact

379
00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: How they might interact together.

380
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:04.140
Saraniah Aston: I guess I think Frieda would would definitely be a child as well. Okay.

381
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.400
Saraniah Aston: You know, and very similar

382
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.650
Saraniah Aston: Way.

383
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To the child like you have a child.

384
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.040
In your

385
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.200
Life.

386
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:35.520
Saraniah Aston: I guess I just see. I see her it, I see it into takeaways. Like, she's like a pillar of

387
00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:41.940
Saraniah Aston: Strength and then she's also definitely a vulnerable little girl.

388
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.680
Saraniah Aston: So those and then

389
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.500
Saraniah Aston: Well, the images of the

390
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.880
Saraniah Aston: Stranger holding the child and then free to

391
00:40:59.160 --> 00:40:59.700
Saraniah Aston: Know,

392
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I don't know. Okay.

393
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What about these other pieces, see if they can, they can sort of be around in this space as well. I'm not Dr. Ruth wonder what she might do.

394
00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:22.710
Saraniah Aston: Oh, she would probably hanging out with Fiona and a bottle of tequila.

395
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: adult version.

396
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:30.450
Saraniah Aston: Version.

397
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:38.190
Saraniah Aston: Fredo is very open like that too. So I mentioned maybe too long.

398
00:41:48.600 --> 00:42:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And anything else come up. So you picturing free to look sounds like it was a little easier to picture free to with as an adult interacting with Dr. Ruth, there's this almost camaraderie, they can they can kind of be strong and they're both very candid and strong. Right.

399
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:09.030
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

400
00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You can see that pretty fluidly

401
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:20.910
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I see them being more real with each other, kind of behind the scenes of what they would show to the rest of the world. Yeah.

402
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you feel right now. See if you can identify and label the emotion, you're feeling right now.

403
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Created. Okay.

404
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is when you're in this sense of creative

405
00:42:50.790 --> 00:43:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, again, I'm still trying to check. So I'm just registering a little body scans and the work I do a lot of it is checking in with how your body's doing okay.

406
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're feeling creative use your body relaxed. Is it distress. Is there a gut a chest a jaw a foot an arm. Is there anything that's tense or noticeably relax. Like what's the message coming from the body. You're in Korea.

407
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:22.710
Very

408
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.280
Saraniah Aston: Out putting of energy.

409
00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.280
Saraniah Aston: Yes, calm and relax because I feel you. Just I

410
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.160
Saraniah Aston: When I'm able to reach that spot.

411
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:50.610
Saraniah Aston: Which isn't easy for me all the time to reach that spot where I'm able to get creative and feel inspired like I do. Now, I guess, talking about those things kind of bravado, but um

412
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:52.980
Saraniah Aston: But

413
00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.450
Saraniah Aston: I forgot what the question.

414
00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great. You were invited to do do a scan, in a sense, there was an awareness. Well, yeah.

415
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And then just see how the body was doing you recognize that it was calm recognized it was relaxed.

416
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.240
Saraniah Aston: The buyer is definitely calm, relaxed, whoever extremely

417
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.880
Saraniah Aston: Tons of an audience.

418
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:30.300
Saraniah Aston: I'm just like, hyper and inside almost to a point where you wouldn't be able to get anything done.

419
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if I couldn't be channeled

420
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. Okay, I get it.

421
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.790
Absolutely.

422
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it a sense of, do you know how to harness that energy

423
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.240
Saraniah Aston: I'm

424
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.560
Saraniah Aston: Not really. I'm I'm learning now.

425
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:03.720
Saraniah Aston: I think that talking about opening up my brain a little bit and my mind a little bit

426
00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:09.780
Saraniah Aston: And being asked to think

427
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:17.280
Saraniah Aston: Well, I actually do try and think, so I get answers and that way I

428
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:29.670
Saraniah Aston: I'm like, ah, I do have that in my head. So then I get inspired that I get a little excited and then just like everybody out of my way. It's time to create something

429
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely, and I want you to know.

430
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That vitality that you have inside of you is utterly welcome here. And there's no way you can do therapy wrong. You can't possibly do anything wrong. You understand if the inspiration.

431
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.240
Saraniah Aston: Is my

432
00:45:54.660 --> 00:46:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to take a hold of this right now and you want to start to grab paste and and and and you want to get something where you you can

433
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: harness it at the moment.

434
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:07.980
Saraniah Aston: I want. Yeah, I'm

435
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.650
Saraniah Aston: I'm going to do that as soon as we're done actually

436
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic. That's fantastic.

437
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.370
Saraniah Aston: I mean I got clippings here and I've got everything I need. So

438
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.760
Saraniah Aston: I'm feeling inspired. I might as well go for it.

439
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.520
Saraniah Aston: Sometimes I'm a little afraid.

440
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:45.960
Saraniah Aston: To do it yeah I'm afraid of, of being my own like kind of failure or not finishing something starting something that I won't finish because of just a cycle of the same thing, fear of

441
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.330
Saraniah Aston: Not

442
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.080
Saraniah Aston: Having that passion or that passion, just kind of

443
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.610
Saraniah Aston: Being kind of taken away from me.

444
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:02.970
Yeah.

445
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there that is that half finished project to remind you, it was taken away.

446
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't want to start it and then here we are again.

447
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:12.990
Yeah.

448
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you, I got you.

449
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And so maybe that's the key, at least in part, as we continue to sort of unpack what gets in the way of how you want to be and who you want to be, you know, what gets in the way. We have a lot of learning to do or I do anyway. You may know exactly what's going on, but I don't

450
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm inviting and saying if if it means that you go with it if it means that you, you just say, Okay, I just caught a glimpse of complete acceptance. I caught it. And before it goes

451
00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not afraid. Right now, let me create I'll create with you. I'll sit here and all I'll draw with you. I don't have any cool things to do in here. It's kind of a sterile cold land over here bunch squares.

452
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But, uh, but I can draw. I love drawing and we'll do it together. I am i know i probably look like this is going to be this really predictable cognitive thing but I truly believe that you are inside of you.

453
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It knows what to do.

454
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Way deep inside the

455
00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Sense of I know how to heal myself and I want. I want you to know your own strength right your own wisdom, your own ability to nurture that natural vitality and it sounds like creativity. I got a little crack in the door there. That sounds like a way to it.

456
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.520
Saraniah Aston: I did it actually you really did.

457
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:49.140
So exciting.

458
00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.940
Saraniah Aston: It's really exciting for me.

459
00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take, let's be really gentle

460
00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And give ourselves lots of time right now. We still have have time left in the session and let's let's walk through today together and

461
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Share with me, if you will, what you noticed about you that's most important. What's, what's

462
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:21.570
Saraniah Aston: About you, my speaking today.

463
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything is really such an open ended question.

464
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.660
Saraniah Aston: Okay, yeah.

465
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:28.020
What's up,

466
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.390
Saraniah Aston: Well,

467
00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.870
Saraniah Aston: I can definitely say that

468
00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:42.180
Saraniah Aston: Ever since I woke up, I didn't see me about meeting with you and I've been a little I was

469
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:52.290
Saraniah Aston: In a different headspace of like kind of a little bit of worry and then the decision to just be completely closed off.

470
00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:59.970
Saraniah Aston: But that didn't work out for me and I feel much better. I feel

471
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.540
Saraniah Aston: Much, much better.

472
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.170
Saraniah Aston: I feel right now, especially

473
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:09.990
Saraniah Aston: I feel extremely inspired

474
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.860
Saraniah Aston: I think that opening up those that

475
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:16.770
Saraniah Aston: Those different places.

476
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:20.280
Saraniah Aston: The nurture and all

477
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:30.570
Saraniah Aston: That stuff on just, you know, kind of a little, a little fire for me. So that's really exciting. So basically,

478
00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:44.310
Saraniah Aston: What I was expecting didn't turn out to be what I expected and and what I thought it would. And I'm really, I just, I feel, I feel safe, so that's good, that's really good thing for me.

479
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm in off.

480
00:50:52.350 --> 00:51:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: From such a space of a fret and this is going to go badly and this woman right whenever he or she could hurt me. She could say something that's going to send me backwards and all of whatever your concern was

481
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And then to find out it wasn't what you thought. And in fact, you're feeling inspired. I mean, that's pretty cool to have a negative connotation, and then to come to find out. I feel safe.

482
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:18.810
That's pretty neat.

483
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and I also heard some pretty cool things earlier which had to do with it's such remember you, you found this. I can't remember if it was Dr Berkowitz or what the name of the psychiatrist is but you also ran into a psychiatrist. That's pretty good to

484
00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:42.330
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, Doc. Dr. Burke with that says, yeah, we really mean.

485
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:44.400
Saraniah Aston: He's very

486
00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:50.520
Saraniah Aston: Human like he's very, very, they're just like you know he's not just like a

487
00:51:51.660 --> 00:52:12.690
Saraniah Aston: Doctor Who is kind of just like doing his job and maybe doesn't like it so much, and just wants to get through it. He was really interested in everything I have to say. And he's also doing the keto diet that he's like a keto master and

488
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.270
Saraniah Aston: I was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so

489
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:28.320
Saraniah Aston: He told me that if I continue to with my keto he believes that I can actually reverse it completely.

490
00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:36.570
Saraniah Aston: So, and he's excited because I'm excited because I'm really serious.

491
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:47.580
Saraniah Aston: And he gave me some a website to go to. He's like, well, in that case, although we write this down for you. And he's like, well, in that case, I'll give you back that everyone, write this down because you realize that I was

492
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:54.690
Saraniah Aston: really serious about my health and the keto diet. So he was writing all these references for me.

493
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:59.880
Saraniah Aston: And I think I'm totally going off topic. I know you're on it.

494
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It was, I'm just, I'm highlighting that maybe it's a neat thing to have an expectation. A lot of times, it turns out not as bad as we think

495
00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But a couple of times it's turned out even better. And as we start to kind of move closer to the end of our session today I'm want to offer an invitation to

496
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't give homework I don't tell people what to do with their life. I'm not qualified to live your life to tell you how to live yours. I just you know best, but I can, I can be inspired. And I'll just share my thoughts. If you want them.

497
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: It may be think when you were saying earlier about, I'm excited. Like I'm I'm inspired right now, you know, and then I went backwards. And I remember you saying that where you get tripped up in that cycle.

498
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Here that if you went with this recollection of how this dynamic went today as your filter of how to now like reference this like, Well, I thought she'd be whatever it was a rigid cold bossy. I don't know what you thought I'd be

499
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: uncaring or something. So, okay, I thought these things. And it turned out to be this other thing. I ended up feeling safe.

500
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I can take that as a new filter for how I'm going to not wait a minute, not delay at all. I'm going to use my inspiration and I'm going to trust and I'm going to go start creating my collage.

501
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Because maybe it will turn out amazing, maybe it will actually turn out better than I thought and see what actually happens.

502
00:54:47.250 --> 00:55:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: As you're doing it. Maybe you'll feel safe. Maybe you'll feel more creative more inspiration and the truth of the matter is we don't actually know how we're going to feel we can do a decent job of predicting we don't actually know till we get there into that moment.

503
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:11.910
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. No, see, I mean the right next to me like everything so I'm I think I'll just

504
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.030
Saraniah Aston: Just move right just start

505
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't even have to drive anywhere. It's already in the right room.

506
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:20.220
You're already there.

507
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic.

508
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything else that kind of came up as we bring today to a close.

509
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.440
Saraniah Aston: Um,

510
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:34.380
Saraniah Aston: No.

511
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:38.340
Saraniah Aston: No.

512
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.800
Saraniah Aston: Good.

513
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's schedule another time.

514
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Now for something I do meet twice a year. You want to stick with once a week. Individual therapy and then group once a week.

515
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.700
Saraniah Aston: He for now. That would be good. Yeah.

516
00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.310
Saraniah Aston: Okay, excellent. So I already had.

517
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we had set this one before my today opened up. I already had you tell me if this is still okay I have February 25 for

518
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: 11am so basically the same time just next Tuesday.

519
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:16.110
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

520
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.190
Saraniah Aston: Tuesday at 11 is what I've got. Yep.

521
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And what I'll do is moving forward. If you really like the timing on this. I'll do my best to I don't tend to schedule more than a week or two ahead because people's lives kind of change jobs change people will register for school or travel

522
00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm going to do that time slot for you. I'll try not I'll be checking in. Like that one still like that one so that there's some predictability.

523
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

524
00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:49.920
Saraniah Aston: He liked that. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

525
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:58.410
Saraniah Aston: So I am since I did change the group meetings, um,

526
00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.700
Saraniah Aston: I hate talking about medicine.

527
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me make it easy for you that

528
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:05.880
Okay.

529
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll make it easy for you. I want you to suffer.

530
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody does it. I don't feel it when it comes to these sessions, if they're ever bridge to individual therapy that would probably mean you're out of medicine. So when I real quick do is I send a quick note over to

531
00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll be your I think I'll probably send it to Dr. All and and that's where your original doctor was right.

532
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.070
Saraniah Aston: Correct, yeah.

533
00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to send him a message and he he already kind of has a heads up that you may be making this transition to. Oh, but wait. You don't have that. Where do you want to go. Do you want to stay with Dr. Solomon. Okay.

534
00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that you don't have the job that

535
00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:45.150
Saraniah Aston: You don't know. No, definitely.

536
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to change. We're going to

537
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Put you I think on a low

538
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.730
Saraniah Aston: Key thing and

539
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:52.320

542
00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we'll have to be shy. This is what most people say all either. Remember, this is how it'll sound right at the end, I'll say let's reschedule. And then I'll say this, I'll say

543
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Was medication bridge today. And you'll say, yeah, and then I'll just all I do is I send a quick slack. Notice this program and I say, Dr. Solomon. I'm your, your patient your client sorry he is here. She attended and he takes it from there. All I do is like a she's here.

544
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll just remind him though that plan is she'll be in and you're going to attend the Friday group right

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.370
