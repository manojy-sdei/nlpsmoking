Daniel Guerrero: Good morning.

4
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so it looks like you are you creating some alone time in here.

5
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: In your room. Okay.

6
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.500
Daniel Guerrero: Let me just close this door right quit.

7
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.500
Daniel Guerrero: Studying right now.

8
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.110
Daniel Guerrero: They all have

9
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.720
Daniel Guerrero: Assignments and stuff that they're doing with their team here. So they're doing a face to face.

10
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.450
Daniel Guerrero: Classroom this morning, so

11
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.150
Daniel Guerrero: It'll be quiet for a little bit.

12
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get inside your, your note here, I just want to see where we are with some of

13
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: My preparation pieces. I was thinking we might be able to do something kind of different today.

14
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And less talk therapy and more about reprocessing and desensitization sort of getting it some of that early trauma kind of changing the relationship to it, but I'm not sure what we have in place here. So let me just take a look in your record. Okay.

15
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you doing, by the way.

16
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.000
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, you know, I'm doing actually pretty good. We're doing

17
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.490
Daniel Guerrero: And I do say we because like, I'm just looking at us like as myself as a whole. So like I think we're doing really great

18
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:18.570
Daniel Guerrero: Considering you know like dirt go the changes in the world, you know, and just all of that, you know, I just, we just continue to put our faith in God. You know, and just allow him to do what he wants to do in our lives. And so

19
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.520
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

20
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.980
Daniel Guerrero: For that reason, I just leave that we're all we're sitting comfortable as we're sitting today and and we're all doing well, you know, but

21
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.540
Daniel Guerrero: You know there's there's less drama there's there's less

22
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.440
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, kids, the kids, right, especially when you got six of them, you know, so other than that things are really great

23
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.420
Daniel Guerrero: How about yourself. You're doing good.

24
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, sorry I'm typing. I know I look like I'm ignoring you. But I don't mean to look like that.

25
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so sorry.

26
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good, thank you.

27
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let's see we got open

28
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm opening up a note and it'll look like I'm distracted, but I'm not. What I'm doing is looking at, at your record right now.

29
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.700
There's no

30
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You record sound so awful. I'm gonna change that word I want to say a note, our previous note.

31
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.810
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I'm used to. I'm used to people saying, well, your record. Yes.

32
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like that. I probably made your stomach turn just now. I'm so sorry.

33
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Which reminds me, I saw this. Oh my gosh, I saw this video actually Dr. Rob rail. Send it to me.

34
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, I want to get it to you.

35
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to see if I'm going to write myself a note.

36
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I really think it would resonate with you just write a note to myself. But for someone to look and see something in my last progress note.

37
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So last one. So we're due for 12 today's for 16 so we do need to review. So today, real quick, just want to make real quick statements. We don't have to spend a lot of time on it, but I want to do a couple of updates.

38
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to update make a little statement if we can

39
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And then move on, make a statement, move on. Okay. Because this could take the whole session and you're going to miss out on some of the more therapeutic things okay ready. All I'm doing right now is just dropping in

40
00:05:45.780 --> 00:06:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your impression. Just a quick little comment when you look at your goal of I want more self control. Once you to look inward. Once you assess go inside. Don't tell me, just go inside.

41
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And just sort of Roll tape. Hmm. This is how I used to be when I didn't have self control. This is kind of when I was learning new means of self control I'm maybe I'm learning how to use this breath technique I'm going for the walk.

42
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking, new thoughts like, is this a me problem. A you problem I'm remembering the development of the brain. I'm remembering. I want to change a generation. I want to be this kind of parent

43
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I assess how is my self control. So how do you assess your progress in managing self control.

44
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.330
Daniel Guerrero: I'm still need some work.

45
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.060
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

46
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.080
Daniel Guerrero: I'm not honest here.

47
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.620
Daniel Guerrero: And

48
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.130
Daniel Guerrero: We're not going to be able to, you know, reach a goal. No.

49
00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now let's hit honesty straight up. Let's keep it raw. I know it still needs some work because straight up this morning I dropped the F bomb. I

50
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Screamed and I couldn't believe I did it, it was over just a wet towel on the floor, that's keeping it real.

51
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.290
Daniel Guerrero: What have you know what it's crazy because that's one of my pet peeves. I

52
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.950
Daniel Guerrero: towels on the floor.

53
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: so disgusting.

54
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Nina. It happened to me to the man is almost 12 them like, That's so nasty.

55
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Nasty but kind of the wash. Okay. But listen. Now you tell me what happened this morning that that's your evidence, tell me a story. This happened and I did this.

56
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:46.080
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, you know what this morning I'm nothing that's happened yet. Okay. You know, this morning, we've had a pretty good morning.

57
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.810
Daniel Guerrero: I got up at seven, you know. Today's my son's birthday, he turned 15 today.

58
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, happy birthday, man.

59
00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:06.870
Daniel Guerrero: And so we went and I kind of, I completely blew him off last night. He came in here about midnight the night. Well, guess what today is, you know, and I'm just like, Yeah, happy birthday, you know, just kind of blew them off, you know,

60
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

61
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.900
Daniel Guerrero: Because I had something planned for him this morning before my wife went to work. So we went bought him a cake and, you know, we'll come

62
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.790
Daniel Guerrero: Up with a to him and stuff. So this morning, has been a good morning for us so far.

63
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:28.950
Daniel Guerrero: And like I said, the kids are in school right now. I mean, they're in our kitchen, but they're FaceTime in in school, so, so, so, so far it's been a good, a good morning, you know,

64
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

65
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, here I don't get wrapped up on the day you this is for you to tell you know what Glenn. I know I need work on self control because that the date that's for you to fill in the blank that that that that I said and did this one.

66
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.250
Daniel Guerrero: Well yesterday.

67
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.080
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, yesterday I kind of blew up at work, you know,

68
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.750
Daniel Guerrero: And

69
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:06.600
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I could have, you know, being the team leader, I could have had a little bit more self control there and you know lead more by an example. And I didn't

70
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're being vague. I don't know what blow up is maybe blow up over here looks like this. Maybe BLOW TO YOU LOOKS LIKE THAT. What did you do and say when someone did and said something

71
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.570
Daniel Guerrero: I got in the ass. I'm like,

72
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.720
Daniel Guerrero: Basically, like you know you're not doing your fucking job and can't keep up.

73
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:41.700
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, these words didn't come out. I didn't say you know you didn't work. The book because those are the words that wanted to come out. Okay.

74
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you say, What did you say

75
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.800
Daniel Guerrero: I say you can't even keep up with the French fries dude like

76
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:48.630
Daniel Guerrero: No.

77
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. And what happened right before that. So what was the, um, the provoking either build up. It was 123

78
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It was. This is the fifth time this guy did it, or the fifth time someone did it. What was the build up that then it was you can't even do this and now you want more responsibility. What was the build up.

79
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.890
Daniel Guerrero: The build up was

80
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.470
Daniel Guerrero: There like lack their lack of being able to control what they're doing, because they're in a corner.

81
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:35.760
Daniel Guerrero: And their lack of being responsible that corner their lack of being responsible for their jobs pissed me off because I there. I told them exactly how to do it, how to do it right out of the book and like to be I wasted my time.

82
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.500
Daniel Guerrero: Right way.

83
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I believe I wasted my time.

84
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

85
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they went and clearly

86
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: They didn't do what you had taught them.

87
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:59.280
Daniel Guerrero: Or I mean you know that's why i say i think i was in the wrong, you know, because like we were seriously busy yesterday, like I'm saying seriously busy.

88
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:07.620
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, I ran around 1800 dollars yesterday in five hours. That's how busy you are

89
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:16.080
Daniel Guerrero: You know and I know that I don't know if you ever ever have ever worked in a restaurant business before or done fast food.

90
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.660
Daniel Guerrero: Restaurant that's that's that's that's busy. That's super busy. Yeah.

91
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.920
No. Yeah.

92
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's, let's, let me just dip in here a member, how I slow time down

93
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a whole other thing to have given me a detail than it is to just say, Hey, I blew up. Notice the difference. Notice how much more vulnerable. You are to my criticizing you, to my redirecting you or something. Notice your vulnerability and that when you actually give me content right

94
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel it. Oh, I would have rather just said I'd look at work. Notice that right who I wish you wouldn't have pushed me

95
00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.400
Daniel Guerrero: Right, yeah.

96
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Now, look at me.

97
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I criticizing you

98
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.500
Know, no.

99
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not like that in. I'm not going to

100
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to

101
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I am going to slow time down because remember the the opening today was I want to touch lightly on how you assess you're doing

102
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll take it from there and see where we go. Maybe we'll do a little inner some deeper work, but I wanted to see what would come up just touching on some of these topics. And he said, it still needs work.

103
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: At press a little harder into how do you assess yourself and you pulled up a memory. And then I pressed harder and said, well, let's be specific and what you ended up saying at

104
00:12:54.210 --> 00:13:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of your staff, or at least one dude, you can't keep up with the French fries. You can't even. That's the key word right

105
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. There we go. Was that even and I didn't even put that one in there. You can't even keep up with the French fries.

106
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That gets it even right so right. How am I supposed to expect you to do this, this, this, this, I need right inside your thinking. I need you just to be able to do five more things really well. This is just one I just taught you. What the what.

107
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, okay, so now remember you assess yourself as I want more self control. So here's the thing. You also gave me a really neat glimpse into what you were actually thinking of what you would have liked it. If you didn't have a filter.

108
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Hello would have sounded right yeah

109
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. We all have those. And you know what your filter was operating at the time, so I'll do you say to me, it needs work.

110
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I think your filter is working.

111
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you have one, I think it is functioning. It might be a dial, much like I have dials for a skill. It might be that what it needs is maybe an updated app.

112
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right and that the apps can come from my fancy words like we can have these little phrases instead of. You're not even doing the french fries, we can come up with a new little upgrade.

113
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But the dial itself, but the the operating system itself fully functioning what you didn't do was take the fries and throw it in his face.

114
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.130
Daniel Guerrero: Right. Hey, and trust me.

115
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and or or getting his ear and go

116
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.600
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

117
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's let's keep it real your filter was working

118
00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You were in control, you may just want more tools on how to deliver that information in a way that you like even more. And that's where you and I can play with. We can play with that but give yourself some credit, you could have lost that job right then in there.

119
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.890
Daniel Guerrero: Oh yeah, trust me.

120
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.280
Daniel Guerrero: You don't know how many boxes I kicked yes you're doing

121
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I made a note, let's jump. I know, let's jump over to another one. Here we go. You're doing great. We're just going to pop in and pop out. I want to build a resume, I believe you have already reached that goal. But you tell me

122
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.720
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I got there, right. I did one

123
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:47.250
Daniel Guerrero: On the resume. I got one response I had like 10 reviews and and I got one response, but the response I got was

124
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Not

125
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:56.850
Daniel Guerrero: being selfish here. It was not what I was looking for because the the job that you know

126
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.320
Daniel Guerrero: They're like will give you 30 hours a week.

127
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.590
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you come in, start at the bottom.

128
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.750
Daniel Guerrero: Work your way up.

129
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:22.050
Daniel Guerrero: And so I'm like well quit the job that I have go work for $9 an hour work my way up. But there's opportunity there because the matter can climb. From there, because they're not only the franchise or also a corporation as well.

130
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:32.040
Daniel Guerrero: You know, working at another restaurant. But then I looked at the downsides of it is like, I'm going to lose two weeks, my bills won't wait two weeks.

131
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:41.250
Daniel Guerrero: I'm going to lose $1 and 15 cents. I want to lose. I want to lose over maybe 25 hours every paycheck.

132
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:52.530
Daniel Guerrero: It's always just like, you know, there was a lot of, you know, do I DO THIS. DO I NOT WHAT DO I DO. And then at the end, you don't have to stay where I'm at, because

133
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:54.960
Daniel Guerrero: For one, it's convenient.

134
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:07.140
Daniel Guerrero: And that and that sucks. You know, because I feel like I feel like I'm working here because it's convenient especially today, you know, especially today. The way you know all these changes are happening.

135
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:16.530
Daniel Guerrero: Um, if you're if I'm not at home. I'm at work. If I'm not at work. I'm at home and or at Walmart, you know, just

136
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.470
Daniel Guerrero: And that's it. You know, so

137
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:20.610
Daniel Guerrero: No risk.

138
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's the quality of life, you know,

139
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:35.370
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know, and so the whole resume thing you know it worked out great. You know, it's going to all these resumes i was i mean i was sending my resume to all these companies and then this happens. And so I'm just like,

140
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:38.490
Daniel Guerrero: When

141
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.920
Daniel Guerrero: You're when you know I

142
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.550
Daniel

143
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: We're all in this together.

144
00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.070
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

145
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or in it. Notice how you said we he said the collective I'm doing well, because we are doing well. I'm guessing you're saying you and your wife are making a really good team right now.

146
00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.370
Daniel Guerrero: Is that right, yes.

147
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.990
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

148
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:15.660
Daniel Guerrero: You know, we've come a long way in the past year, you know, past few months, let's be honest. The past few months, you know, there's we've come a long way. Yeah, there's still some Baker and you're still whatever

149
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:23.700
Daniel Guerrero: You know, well if you want it done this or if you would have good, bad, or, you know, kind of, you know, but

150
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna write that down. Because I'm gonna want to circle back to that.

151
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.410
Daniel Guerrero: But for the most part.

152
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We're bringing up the past

153
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:39.030
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know, and it's something that we don't practice, you know, it's just so we'll get into a heated argument, you know, we want to bring up the bass. But is that something

154
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Shark infested waters.

155
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let's again just touching lightly on this. I'm going to leave that goal here because I'm suspecting later on you and I might explore it a little further on this resume. I'm just gonna leave it there.

156
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to move over to I want to get GED and education. When we last spoke on April 2

157
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Clovis Community College rescheduled and shut down and Clovis, I feel like it's closed door. I also opened up the website, you got to see it firsthand that there are still things you can do. Did it and right there and you forgot all about it.

158
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.840
Daniel Guerrero: Though I mean I'm going to be honest with you. Since then, I haven't

159
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.580
Daniel Guerrero: Looked into it because I'm not because I don't have time.

160
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.060
Daniel Guerrero: Because I'm just tired, you know, it's just

161
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.360
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm not going to make an excuse it, I forgot and or whatever. I mean, I just haven't, you know, and

162
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:46.350
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know why I haven't because I know the opportunities there, you know, and I tell my wife every day vendors, the opportunity is there.

163
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:54.420
Daniel Guerrero: And I just don't get it, you know, because I'm a slow learner. You know, I'm not very bright. You know, but I know I can do the work.

164
00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:01.890
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because I missed, I missed my GED, but like three points. You know, I was in prison. I missed it by three points.

165
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:07.830
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, if I would if I would have had like four more months in there. I probably would have passed it.

166
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:17.250
Daniel Guerrero: I got out. A week later, and soon as I hit the streets I you know I I fall into these responsibilities, you know, and it's just like, you know, it's on the

167
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:29.040
Daniel Guerrero: It's on the to do list tomorrow and then tomorrow. It's like it's on a to do list by the week by the end of the week. And by the end of the week. This is the end of the month, you know, it's already a new year.

168
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.810
Daniel Guerrero: You hear me.

169
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Do. Of course I do. Okay, so we're not. We're not even going to do that one. We just, I just made a little note we're going to move on. Okay.

170
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, you just pay attention to whether shame gets activated inside around that just you pay attention just note it just notice. Oh, I hate it when that woman brings us up on it. Oh.

171
00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wish you had written that Darren goal down OVER THERE IT IS. AND NOW WE MOVE ON. SO WE TOUCHED lightly and it came up and hopefully you came in with positive self talk this too.

172
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a temporary experience shame to comes in and he goes, and I'm going to get back into feeling motivated and optimistic those feelings also come and unfortunately they go to

173
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: All of them come and go, our moods, our feelings. They come and they go, let's move into the next goal, which is this one came, I think, very heavily weighted for me.

174
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And it has to do with because I recognize the terminology which is change. This is when you first walked in change people, places and things you almost immediately.

175
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: just coincidentally, I think I don't know moved you moved and now you are away from sort of those same

176
00:21:52.230 --> 00:22:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That same street sort of folks that environment had a positive effect. And then what did you say last time.

177
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have it. Did my brother in law's still in that he still knocks on my door I purposely make myself busy. If I tell my brother, and if I tell my brother in law. Oh, it will make me look like a coward.

178
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.040
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, so

179
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When you go ahead

180
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.500
Daniel Guerrero: You know now, today, you know, like

181
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.860
Daniel Guerrero: You kind of just knows, you know, like it's a closed door. You know, like

182
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:46.470
Daniel Guerrero: Don't even don't even spark a conversation like that, you know, don't you know there's got to the point, it's gotten to the point that we're he's always asked me for money, a bro, you got any money. A Bro Bro Bro Bro, and now it's just like

183
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:59.220
Daniel Guerrero: Hey. What's up, bro. How you doing like a was a analysis chillin and he just, you know, goes on about his business. You know, it's just a Hey what's up you know love you. Love you. All right, later.

184
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.100
Daniel Guerrero: So now it's not even a

185
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.550
Daniel Guerrero: A spark conversation anymore like it used to be, you know, used to be a conversation. Oh man, I'm doing this. I'm doing that.

186
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:19.560
Daniel Guerrero: You know, what's up, you know. And so now, today, like getting away from that environment into this new environment that I'm in also help close that door. You know what I'm saying. Because today. It's just like

187
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.640
Daniel Guerrero: I say I'm gonna be honest, we don't even think about it, no more, you know, so

188
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.340
Daniel Guerrero: It's done.

189
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh huh

190
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, I wish it was that easy baby in a

191
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a rush to health right there. Oh, I don't think about it. Hey, you know what, maybe you don't need to go to treatment anymore. No too soon. It's okay, you get both. You get to feel really proud, you get to observe that those triggers aren't happening as often. That's fantastic.

192
00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just the beginning. Okay. It's both like oh there's where, you know,

193
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: There's so much to learn.

194
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.790
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

195
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Hang in there. Okay. So you said I don't think I'm gonna write that down. I like it. I don't think about what's the it

196
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:24.300
Daniel Guerrero: Um, you know, and I know, let's be honest here. You know what I'm saying, like, because, because we have substance, because I have substituted, you know,

Daniel Guerrero: You know, I just, I just want to be me again, you know,

199
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That mean

200
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think about what

201
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:54.840
Daniel Guerrero: I was saying about getting high anymore. I don't think about, you know, doing pills anymore because, you know, I'm gonna be honest, you know, I was the biggest crackheads smoking meth in marijuana puffin

202
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.270
Daniel Guerrero: All consuming

203
00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.390
Daniel Guerrero: Guides ever meet in your life.

204
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:08.160
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I did everything I did everything on the map that there is to do that you did can harm me. I've done it.

205
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.860
Daniel Guerrero: And

206
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.710
Daniel Guerrero: You know, today I just

207
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:22.500
Daniel Guerrero: It gives it like, and I think about it, it gives me Oscar, you know, like Oscar. What makes the light turns my stomach. You know, like

208
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.470
Daniel Guerrero: This

209
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is called agita

210
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.120
Daniel Guerrero: Oh really agita

211
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.010
Daniel Guerrero: I like that.

212
00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And yours is hospital.

213
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Hospital. Oh boy. I got a lot of people trying to give me Oscar. I tell you what.

214
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Us go

215
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so. Yeah, no, that's no no good.

216
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So yes, what's it like to say that to me.

217
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:14.280
Daniel Guerrero: It feels good. You know who's gonna say that, you know, it feels good to, you know, and I don't want to become like I want to, I want to be proud of what I've done, but I don't want to have too much pride, you know, because to me, I think. Pride is just like one step before failure, you know,

218
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.520
Daniel Guerrero: I'm going to be proud of. The moment you know one of the minute because, you know, we're talking about this yesterday.

219
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.490
Daniel Guerrero: When I was at work and I was just like,

220
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.140
Daniel Guerrero: You know I never say never, you know, never want to say never.

221
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.820
Daniel Guerrero: I since I said like today. I don't know whether

222
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:44.820
Daniel Guerrero: I say, but today I can probably say, You know, I'm clean, you know, but I'm never say never. Because you never know what's going to happen.

223
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me again. I know that is hard because there's so much to do in such a short amount of time. I love what you're saying, which is never say never.

224
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's also this this word pride and again I'm going to dip into some language and some other words that might hold that space where you can both feel really accomplished and humble at the same time.

225
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

226
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I want you to have access

227
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To the vitality that can live in that I'm proud and humble, the same time I want you just like everyone else have access to that and for it not to be such a threatening space because yours was just about to be a mess.

228
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like, but but it right up to it and I'm concerned. So I'm gonna visit that again. Okay.

229
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right before failure. So I'm going to, I'm going to come back to that.

230
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, again, I know today is a little

231
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Around here another one of your goals is I want to spend more time with the Lord and in prayer.

232
00:27:49.260 --> 00:28:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Last time I wrote a little note in March, I wouldn't be in sobriety without him. He guides. My every step, I think God. He is faithful. He loves us when we are on lovable.

233
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Client reports currently you spending about two minutes in undefined in Meditation, Prayer once an hour a day wants to go to church twice a month. Truth be told, what's really happening.

234
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.280
Daniel Guerrero: Um,

236
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Every day, or five days a week or three days a week.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.940
Daniel Guerrero: No, I'm talking about every day. I do this, seven days a week.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Crack headed is Smith smokiness drink drunkenness drug dealing as dude you ever nude quote unquote

257
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.040
Daniel Guerrero: This stuff, but it's the truth. You know,

258
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

259
00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Got to

260
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.990
Daniel Guerrero: Be a but you can set yourself free unless you unless you tell yourself the truth, you know,

261
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.280
Actually

262
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It does make it that the presence of another. I'm in, then you're lifting the shame around it which means

263
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you can really look at the self in a holistic way that there's no part of you that you are rejecting okay so that it serves a really big purpose to actually say the ugly.

264
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: To say say the shame side to another.

265
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

266
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:21.090
Daniel Guerrero: Because I see people that you know they're out there getting high and you know they're messy know and they deny it to the fullest. No, I'm not getting high. I haven't gotten high him three days, four days, you know, but it's just

267
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:27.750
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I used to do that crap you know and I know what somebody looks like after they've been up for 24 hours.

268
00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:39.300
Daniel Guerrero: Or 72 hours, you know, you can you can just tell you know the eyes are soaking and they got the blackness going eyes are so dilated, you know, their movements good reactions. I know.

269
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:49.500
Daniel Guerrero: Because I used to work on, you know, and, and for them to sit there and tell me knob on getting high or no bro. I've been clean for this many days.

270
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:56.490
Daniel Guerrero: You know, they're in denial there. I mean, I don't feel like I don't feel like they should have to lie to me to make themselves feel better about

271
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:11.670
Daniel Guerrero: You know about themselves, getting high because I used to do the same shit I do the same exact, you know, just be like, Mom, I put that I put that I promise I'm not high and I'm high off my ass, you know, and so

272
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.650
Daniel Guerrero: I just, I just think that, you know, facing

273
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.620
Daniel Guerrero: Facing yourself is the most difficult

274
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. Let's do a little work together. Daniel and you haven't done this work before

275
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:26.820
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

276
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What you've done so far with me is, notice how we touched on some goals. Right. And you've started to share with me some of your stories, some of your family history being tense of violence, sort of in that family dynamic coming up and now you survived it

277
00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And part of it has been patterns of

278
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Of having to cope using drugs and alcohol having to survive meant slinging having to survive meant

279
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Never really getting to grieve never really getting to heal.

280
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And not learning ways to manage anger, you've pulled away from the goddess, you know, a lot of impact. And that's just naming a couple of them. Okay, there's a lot

281
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it becomes, where do we begin the healing. Yes, it's nice to share my just as you did just to say, Yeah, I did these things, but it's it's this next level stuff that I want to introduce to you.

282
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you get to heal from that history and I want to introduce

283
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Some am Dr. To today.

284
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It does require some preparation. So we're just if you're willing. I'll do as much or as little education around what it is.

285
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But it will make a difference as far as its efficacy, which means you don't have to believe it for it to work. It's not happening hypnosis. It doesn't require you believing

286
00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: In the mechanisms of change for it to work, but it does require a little bit of setup.

287
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So on this phone that you're looking at right now, can you possibly maybe go in your kitchen or in your medicine cabinet. See if you can find too tall objects and at the same height.

288
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And put them right next to your phone kind of shoulder width apart, if my face is the phone how I'm sitting sort of right next to the phone about the same height. Can you go see if you can grab a couple things.

289
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:31.800
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, I got something right here in the bathroom.

290
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:32.760
Oh, cool.

291
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.330
Daniel Guerrero: What about this this work.

292
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome. Those are gorgeous. They're exactly the same height. So put them right next to the phone you want about shoulder width apart, which means if you stuck your arms out

293
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: They'd be coming sort of straight out, they'd be about as wide as your, your shoulders and then as far as distance. You want to be about arms.

294
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Some probably a touch closer on either you bring the table closer to you yeah yeah we're good. You wanted about wrist. I've noticed that this seems to be about the good distance of comfort for people. It's about a wrist to your eyes distance

295
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's too far. Then you won't get the bilateral stimulation

296
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the eye movement.

297
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm going to talk to you about is a really complicated process for me but for you. All you gotta do is just answer honestly

298
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

299
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I do want to give you a little information. Okay, so what I'm talking about right now is I'd like to do a technique with you. Maybe today. We may not get to it because it might take the whole time you talking about it.

300
00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But down the line. Maybe next time or some other time. But I'd like to do is I like to do. E. M. D. Are you can look that up.

301
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: what it stands for. And actually I do.

302
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: A VM. Dr. But we'll get into that in a minute. So em Dr stands for I movement Desensitization and Reprocessing

303
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The eye movement part. It's a stupid. They should just change the name because it doesn't require the eye movement, what it requires is bilateral stimulation. So if you were in my office right now. You would be holding little buzzers in your hand.

304
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And you would be feeling. Oh, this my left one my right one, and I could change the

305
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Speed did did did did did did did did did did. Did I can change it. I could also change the intensity but you're not here. So what I'm left with typically people are on a phone, much like you

306
00:36:53.130 --> 00:37:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're left with are these two objects and looking at the top of those two objects, what I would be doing in the middle here is I would be setting the pace with my finger.

307
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So you'd be looking without moving your head, you'd be looking at those top a hair sprays or deodorants or whatever they are.

308
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And so why don't you do that. Now, let me just look at your eyes as you look at the top of those two hairspray back and forth only left and right, not me in the middle, not me in the middle. This is just setting the pace just left.

309
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And, right, left, top of the hairspray or the hairspray or do or what are those things.

310
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.710
Daniel Guerrero: Together hair sprays.

311
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. See you just looking at those two things. And notice how you can, you don't really even need to look at me. You kind of get a sense of the pace and I'm not going to change it. So once you get it. That's it.

312
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So, did you notice that your eyes were strained just now, did they pull on the muscles. Did it hurt.

313
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.540
No.

314
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:51.120
Daniel Guerrero: But I mean, I could tell that, you know, like they were like that stranger. Like, I guess kind of strange. Yeah.

315
00:37:51.450 --> 00:38:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What you'd want to do a couple of things right now. I don't know that you are exactly centered. So I don't know if you need to move yourself, your you would move to the right, about three inches. Move on your bed to the right, three inches.

316
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.440
Daniel Guerrero: Three inches. Okay.

317
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Another another three

318
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:12.540
Daniel Guerrero: Are you there.

319
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oops. So the reason why I'm asking you this is you're not quite center with me. So it makes me wonder if all of the objects are off center. They have got is got to be where you and I are dead center.

320
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this and these objects that you are looking left and right equal sides to your eyes. I'll end up doing this.

321
00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it.

322
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.010
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, regarding

323
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What I don't want is this where you're you're looking off and you're just staying over here because remember what I'm looking for is a bilateral stimulation, which means left and right hemispheres of the brain.

324
00:38:53.490 --> 00:39:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wanting it to be going from side to side. If you were here, I would have a little headphones and you would hear a sound that would be in the left and the right year

325
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And you would have little buzzers being put under your thighs or something that you I'd be able to work other means. So it's really important that those two objects. Here's your here's your nose and those two objects are dead on each side you see on the are you exactly in the center.

326
00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.630
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah exactly in the center, both of them.

327
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so the phone isn't then something's off because you weren't on the center of my screen or just maybe, maybe. Okay. All right. So we figured out that you had a little bit of ice strained. So let's look at them again might mean sitting back

328
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.210
Daniel Guerrero: just begun my glasses on.

329
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I forgot all about definitely

330
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.600
Daniel Guerrero: You know, kind of level that my head or something.

331
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.210
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

332
00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's just

333
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just have you look left and right with your eyes. Don't move your head.

334
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Our connections really crummy

335
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a great connection.

336
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:32.160
Daniel Guerrero: Maybe

337
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.820
Daniel Guerrero: Let me, let me turn off my wife.

338
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.660
Daniel Guerrero: Because I have Wi Fi in my house. So let me just go off.

339
00:40:59.490 --> 00:40:59.940
Daniel Guerrero: There we go.

340
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:03.990
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

341
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:15.270
Daniel Guerrero: I disconnected you from my Wi Fi. So I'm hoping that that'll help because everybody's connected to the Wi Fi in my house. So I'm just going to use my

342
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.350
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, my data on my phone. So maybe that'll help us.

343
00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's just let me see if you're looking left and right only your eyes.

344
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. Let's talk objects.

345
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now all of a sudden, I'm seeing you really looking so some there's something's off.

346
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:44.130
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know.

347
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:51.030
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know, there's just too close, where I'm just like, glancing, you know, but when I started looking from wall to wall.

348
00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.320
That's when

349
00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw that. I saw that. So, um, this might be a subtle difference to you and like, why am I fussing but I can tell the difference between when someone has me centered

350
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And those objects are centered. I can tell because when I see the eyes, what happens is I can see you're looking all the way to one side and only slightly to another, all the way to one side and slightly to another. So my guess is if you stuck your arms straight out like this.

351
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Put your arm straight out. Yeah. See how I cannot see your left arm and I'm looking right at your right one.

352
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.770
Daniel Guerrero: Or got you.

353
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: off center. I am not in the center that you can have to move that whole phone and all the way. So I am literally straight in front of your nose. I know this is Becky, but this is your mind we're talking about here.

354
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You go to the left, the whole phone needs to move to the left.

355
00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:47.970
Daniel Guerrero: That's weird.

356
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Only about a half inch, not by much.

357
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.410
Daniel Guerrero: What's going to take you completely to this thing.

358
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.870
Daniel Guerrero: This, this helps. Bam.

359
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Bam, bam, bam. Now, those little hair sprays are literally exactly equidistant from the phone right there about, you know,

360
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Mmm hmm. Now we're talking.

361
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.120
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah there exactly

362
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:21.960
Okay.

363
00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, make sure you're about wrist to face distance was to face. OK, now I'm going to

364
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This is great. I can see a difference. So I want you to just just track from the peripheral vision my pace of my finger, but don't stop and look at me. I only want you looking at the top of that hairspray. Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue like that. Okay. Here we go. Ready and

365
00:43:49.980 --> 00:44:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: setting the pace. Sometimes I'll be setting it slow. Sometimes I'll be setting it fast. And I want you to just look at the top, nothing in the middle just Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue.

366
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to stop in the middle.

367
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Not all the way the wall just those blue hair sprays because you're as a curt, right, it'll pull on those ocular muscles, you know, and you don't be a stranger. Okay, how, what was that like for you. Was there distress. Was it pulling

368
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.680
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah. To me, it's kind of like

369
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.290
Daniel Guerrero: It was like a little bit stressful. Right.

370
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: autos

371
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.960
Daniel Guerrero: I'm not sure if

372
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.210
Daniel Guerrero: Like if I'm like

373
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:53.520
Daniel Guerrero: If my eyes or even like moving or am I just looking, you feel me so I'm like, so to make sure that I'm trying to do the exercise. Right. I'm trying to make sure that my eyes are moving and not just

374
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:56.190
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just glancing

375
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.450
So I'm trying to make

376
00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

377
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So far it looks pretty good. Again, the challenge is the tele health

378
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to show you what what i want your eyes to do

379
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then maybe you can copy me but also know I did see them. I did see them going left and right. What I couldn't tell, is whether you are also trying to focus on me in the middle. And you don't need to. The only thing you need to be doing.

380
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is be looking at your to your two objects here like this.

381
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Top. Top. Top top once you get a taste of it. You don't have to really look at my finger. I will own. I'm not going to change the pace in the middle of an iteration. So once you get it, like, oh, she's asking, left, right, if it doesn't change. So if that helps at all. Um,

382
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And we

383
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:55.920
Daniel Guerrero: Got a short a short span of attention. So like part of me wants to see what you're doing.

384
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.760
Daniel Guerrero: And I'll do what

385
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.380
Daniel Guerrero: We do so I don't

386
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, okay, but it's good for me to know that because what, that's what I can learn from you is I might say to myself, well,

387
00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: For Daniel I might do short iterations. I might only do them for 10 seconds and then I'll say

388
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to give you a little heads up on what this would look like. I'm not telling you the mechanism of change. Yet, if I have time, because it's so 1152 my time.

389
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If I have time, I'll explain it, but I can always do it next time. Um, but what it would look like is this, I might say, Daniel want you to picture the worst part of that memory and pull it up into your working awareness and then I might say,

390
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel and we would get to it over a lot of discussion, but you would know what I was talking about at the time and I might sit down and not only do I want you to picture the WORST piece of that memory.

391
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I also want you to pull up that negative cognition, you have about yourself and hold it there.

392
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about that. And I want you to be looking left and right, and I would do that for a little while and then I would in here would say, Okay, now let's inhale together, big belly breath.

393
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let your mind go blank.

394
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And what comes up for you and then you would share a little bit of information like this. Oh, I started thinking about black a person a thing I had this thought I had this feeling in the body or an emotion and then I would say go with that. And then there'd be another iteration.

395
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you don't have to do in this particular technique which is really great for people that have

396
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Experienced post traumatic stress disorder is that they don't always want to tell their story. They don't always want to go into the gory details, sometimes people do sometimes people don't

397
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What's nice for people around this particular technique is you don't have to. All you do is hold it in your awareness, you're thinking about it. That's enough exposure.

398
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To have this exercise be effective. Other exposure therapies are I sit here and I listened to you retell and refill all of that trauma.

399
00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't do that, typically with people because I think it's very traumatizing for them, which is not to say that there might be stories that you, you want to have a witness to you want another human being to hear the atrocities that you have survived.

400
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And I definitely can do that at any time. But there might be other times when all you want to do is only want to think about it.

401
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And not to say it and you get to still have the healing impact from this particular technique, which I think is pretty neat.

402
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what this is. There's a lot of work that needs to be done ahead of time that we don't have the time to do it in the six minutes that we have remaining

403
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I just did was introduced to you. So now when I say, Hey, Daniel. I'd like to continue to prepare for an end our session. Now you have some kind of vague idea. Boy, I better have my little hairspray setup.

404
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I better have my phone dead center and I'm going to have it all set up, ready to go. In case she wants to do that.

405
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.310
Daniel Guerrero: Right, okay.

406
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I would suggest over the next two or three sessions to have it set up just like this. Don't let your wife throw out those blue caps.

407
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:11.190
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

408
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.790
Daniel Guerrero: Good about that stuff. Do they take the cap off the cat.

409
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.120
Daniel Guerrero: I'm like, where's the captain hairspray. I don't know that so

410
00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm only kidding of course you can do the top of the little, the little nozzles. I'm only joking with you.

411
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just check in with you though. Right. You just see how you're doing. So I'm introducing a really different kind of technique, it might not be something you've even heard of

412
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's coming up for you as I introduced that we might do a little deeper work.

413
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:42.810
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

414
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:47.190
Daniel Guerrero: You know, to me it's like

415
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:56.460
Daniel Guerrero: There's probably something that I do need, you know, because like I want to be honest man, I just feel like I feel like there's something in there, man, that just needs to come out, you know, is

416
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.030
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I think that

417
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:01.530
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

418
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.580
Daniel Guerrero: Two weeks is too long to wait. You know, because you know scheduling two weeks to two

419
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's change that.

420
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:15.930
Daniel Guerrero: And so I you know I was as you were talking, I was thinking that

421
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.810
Daniel Guerrero: You know, for us to have another session, I have to wait for two weeks. You know, and I just

422
00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:22.830
Daniel Guerrero: I just

423
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:36.930
Daniel Guerrero: I just think that whenever we were doing the week to week to week you know was there was. It was working better for me because I was able to, you know, because there's just some things you can't talk to with your wife or your kids or you know what I'm saying.

424
00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to meet weekly until you and I decide. Let's try it again. I love it. Let's go back to weekly. I agree. And this work actually demands that of you because it may bring up on processed.

425
00:50:52.440 --> 00:51:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Information that you've been kind of compartmentalizing so it actually does need a lot more follow up so that timing spot on. I would have invited the same thing. So we're on the same page. So I'm looking right now at availability for

426
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: For next week.

427
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I know an easy one. In the second week is easy because of that. I know I can definitely do this.

428
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:27.780
Daniel Guerrero: If you have to wait until maybe next time. And then maybe we can work on next. I don't wanna. I don't want to disrupt what you already have going on.

429
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel I only offer what I can do. You don't have to worry about me but that's very respectful of you i'm i'm looking it just

430
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:44.730
Daniel Guerrero: Because we have we have to both. Remember that you don't normally you have a schedule, what else I was scheduled to because I can't do anything.

431
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:55.950
Daniel Guerrero: After two o'clock, and I would prefer to do anything like at this time, or even earlier if you can do even earlier eight o'clock.

432
00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got you. I'm Daniel. This might seem

433
00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Weird, but

434
00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes I am all booked up. But it's a yes. And it just means I do have some people on an on call list, which means on the fly.

435
00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You might get a text from me. Hey, are you free in the next five minutes. Can you log on to happen already be up

436
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And just jump in here. I know it's not ideal, and I can you typically the night before I can say, hey, can you be on call tomorrow because right now I'm looking at my people. I mean, unless you wanted me to six in the morning. I almost 6am or free right now. I don't think you want to go so

437
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Call I'll put you on call from 8am.

438
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So to up into that 11am space.

439
00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll put you all and then I'll text you quickly or you might get a call from Braveheart so if you see that number coming in. I don't know. It looks like when it comes from our care navigators just pick it up and saying,

440
00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, I'm on call. Yeah, I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. Let me give me please put some cold water my face.

441
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And then do this little setup, you may want to tell your wife. Hey, we're going to do this cookie stuff and I'm going to be using these hairspray.

442
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to tell her to kind of keep them handy and I'm going to put you on on call. Um, and it's going to be. It just can't be on that same day as group. Otherwise, if I get a last minute cancellation. I will text you okay

443
00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fine, but write this down for show for show is going to be your new thing. We got April 30 at 9am

444
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.030
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

445
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.740
Which is

446
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Although you are saying, you wouldn't mind something even earlier you said right

447
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't switch them Thursday. Sorry, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm

448
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I gotta leave it here for a while. I'm not saying, it'll stay this way.

449
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, let's stick with Thursday. Thursday at nine we for sure we have April 30 at 9am

450
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to be

451
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopefully you can move conflict with her.

452
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Then May six at

453
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Nine.

454
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will ask if this gal can switch to nine, and you go to eight, I will ask okay

455
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's your preferred time right ATM. That's the kids are asleep, kind of thing. Yeah.

456
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:34.890
Daniel Guerrero: Kids are three

457
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:49.980
Daniel Guerrero: Usually we're up easy my households usually up about seven but usually they're just on their phones or something or watching TV, you know, until actually we actually get up and then you know this bow starts moving around. But if we can do

458
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.690
Daniel Guerrero: It. Where do like eight o'clock or, you know, that's fine too. I can do that.

459
00:54:56.070 --> 00:55:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Just closed ended question. Do you prefer eight or nine yes or no eight or nine

460
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then I won't ask to make the switch. Let me leave you at nine then. Okay, so let me erase that.

461
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.230
Daniel Guerrero: 30th May six, yeah.

462
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now we have those and you're on call for next week.

463
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.520
Daniel Guerrero: No. Cool. Okay, so

464
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and he got called and you'll do I need to message a doctor about either buprenorphine or any of your support medicine.

465
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.040
No. All right.

466
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicely done. Keep up the hard work and I look forward to talking to you next time. And of course, I'll see you in group.

467
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.430
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, great. Have a good day. Thank you.

468
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Bye bye.
