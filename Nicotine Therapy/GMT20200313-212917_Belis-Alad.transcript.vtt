Belis Aladag: You did great, because you're eager. That means you made it through.

19
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.620
Anthony Whitmer: But I got

20
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.970
Belis Aladag: You got it. So hopefully next time it'll be an old hat, you know,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:27.180
Belis Aladag: I'm trained in both. And so in this case for you. It seems that I'm here to help you navigate a substance use opioid use disorder. Is that correct,

23
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.500
Anthony Whitmer: That's right.

24
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.930
Belis Aladag: So tell me a bit about you, what's been going on with you what you've tried, what didn't work. What's going on.

25
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.380
Anthony Whitmer: I guess my addition started probably around 15 with marijuana and things like that.

26
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:51.210
Anthony Whitmer: Okay, it got pretty serious in 1998. Okay. Just give me. I was carjacked in the shot five times in Indiana at a restaurant.

27
00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.360
Anthony Whitmer: I still have more to me, to this day, and I took a lot of pain medicine over that time period for about two years.

28
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:11.250
Anthony Whitmer: I became dependent on and become a vicious cycle. The where the doctors were at that time in the last summer I car now. Yeah.

29
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.790
Anthony Whitmer: And I

30
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.920
Anthony Whitmer: Really strong and I ended up going into a methadone program.

31
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.110
Belis Aladag: Here with that was that. How many years in so 2000 about two years. So you got shot nine times he ate two years, you were on the prescription meds.

32
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.520
Belis Aladag: 2000 right

33
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.440
Belis Aladag: Then did you go into the Methadone clinic.

34
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.910
Anthony Whitmer: Yes, finally, the doctors. They tried everything to get me going down and it just wasn't happening.

35
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.920
Anthony Whitmer: If I wasn't getting it from the doctors. I was getting it from the streets. I'm just trying to be honest.

36
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.520
Yes.

37
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:55.470
Anthony Whitmer: It got to a point to where it wasn't even about being high, it was just about function, because they were jokes. Yeah. And I've been in and now about patient

38
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.640
Anthony Whitmer: I do very well in a structured program.

39
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:23.010
Anthony Whitmer: That being said, I recently tore my rotator cuff at work, and I've been in so many years. So I've taken pain medicine. I figured I would be okay well that last couple weeks and then I was taking one or two per tribe. I was taking three or four yeah I was right back down that road. I went

40
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.040
Belis Aladag: Here. Sorry. When did you tear the rotator cuff.

41
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.040
Belis Aladag: September September. Okay. So it started September and then started getting out of hand again.

42
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.180
Yes.

43
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.400
Anthony Whitmer: I kind of really back in and was doing fairly well.

44
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.940
Anthony Whitmer: About a month and a half ago I fractured my foot and three spots.

45
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.600
Anthony Whitmer: And there was more pain medicine at that point and I just don't even want to chance it anymore.

46
00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:02.010
Anthony Whitmer: So I just don't want to be addicted and having that function from buying drugs on the street, me and said, and as fed up a little

47
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.830
Anthony Whitmer: Bit on Suboxone before in the past, and it works really well for okay

48
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.770
Belis Aladag: So you've been on you were in the Methadone clinic, kind of, were you using them.

49
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.580
Belis Aladag: Though, or were you

50
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.910
Anthony Whitmer: Pretty

51
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.160
Anthony Whitmer: Taking the methodology. Yeah. As far as opening that I was completely

52
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.120
Oh,

53
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.430
Anthony Whitmer: I was smoking marijuana while I was in medical program like

54
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.030
Belis Aladag: Taking the Methadone in the mornings and then getting on with your day for the

55
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.840
Anthony Whitmer: open heart.

56
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.190
Anthony Whitmer: Okay, so

57
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.460
Belis Aladag: Then, and then and then you. When did you try Suboxone later on you you yeah

58
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:49.410
Anthony Whitmer: happened was is I actually, I went to jail. And I came, I withdrew for a couple months in jail methadone is crazy, Beast.

59
00:05:49.950 --> 00:06:06.150
Anthony Whitmer: And after that I didn't want go back on methadone, because it was so hard to get off of it. So when I got out, I got into Suboxone program. And at first I started on 76. Okay. Real quick, the reward for me because it didn't have a marker for opiates.

60
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:20.550
Anthony Whitmer: I eventually went to the strips and had pretty good success. And then when I got out here. I moved from Indiana to here, July, and I was clean off everything and

61
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.630
Someone calling it

62
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.010
Anthony Whitmer: Okay there. Yeah.

63
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.620
Belis Aladag: I'm here. Okay, so you move to Cal, where are you right now, California. Yeah.

64
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.270
Anthony Whitmer: Let me get my speaker.

65
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.620
Belis Aladag: Can you hear me now.

66
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.550
Anthony Whitmer: Go ahead, I'm sorry.

67
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.370
Belis Aladag: Okay, so you were saying you move to California from Indiana in July.

68
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:57.000
Belis Aladag: And then did you continue your Suboxone prescription or did you never established care.

69
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.010
Anthony Whitmer: Well, I just never established the care here and I wasn't really familiar with the programs out here into the last week or two.

70
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:17.790
Belis Aladag: I see. So, so it's kind of been hit or miss. Since then, and then you injured yourself in September, then it got worse and then right then and then fractured your foot again in is it in February that haven't our January.

71
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.610
Anthony Whitmer: Yeah, the middle of February. What happens first have surgery on now, but I kind of been putting it off.

72
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:25.800
Anthony Whitmer: What foot which foot

73
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.400
Belis Aladag: Left foot

74
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:36.750
Anthony Whitmer: Notice my right foot. Um, I have a fraction on the outside ankle bone that's where the bone is completely broken off of the tip of ankle bone.

75
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.850
Anthony Whitmer: Fracture and the left side, my foot. One of the top

76
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:50.760
Belis Aladag: Okay, I see. So you have a fractured right foot, you have a rotator cuff tear which side is that

77
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.960
Anthony Whitmer: Left side.

78
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.550
Belis Aladag: Left side rotator cuff tear. So you have those two injuries.

79
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.770
Belis Aladag: And any other medical issues. Anything that you take

80
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.790
Anthony Whitmer: On other than that.

81
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:03.960
I'm pretty

82
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.450
Anthony Whitmer: Cold right now but

83
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.120
Belis Aladag: Yeah. OK. OK.

84
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:17.400
Belis Aladag: OK, I see. And then you mentioned the right foot fracture. Did you see a doctor, where they were like you need surgery or you're not.

85
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:24.510
Anthony Whitmer: Sure. Yes, ma'am. That's kind of why I've been putting it off a little bit. I seen Dr. Bella here in Crescent City, California is the orthopedic specialist

86
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.740
Anthony Whitmer: Dr bellows.

87
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:32.100
Anthony Whitmer: Okay. He told me that you know I needed some screws and probably the best I can hope for is a lamp.

88
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.920
Anthony Whitmer: I wasn't real happy with that. So I went, seeing a doctor weaker and Grants Pass.

89
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:44.670
Anthony Whitmer: Okay, his diagnosis was completely different. With Dr bellows. So I'm kind of maybe looking for a third

90
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.250
Anthony Whitmer: Opinion opinion. Okay.

91
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:55.800
Belis Aladag: So you want to avoid obviously you want to avoid invasive surgery. If you can, but you don't want to leave your foot deformed, if you, you know, you don't want to neglect it.

92
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:04.830
Belis Aladag: But in terms of Nat, please do let's let's stay in touch about where you're at, with that because

93
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:12.660
Belis Aladag: What we'll do is we'll, we'll put you on Suboxone are you currently on any buprenorphine naloxone tablet yet.

94
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:25.530
Anthony Whitmer: No, no, I haven't taken, I'll be honest with you, man. Probably about two weeks ago I came across some industry and I bought a couple of strips and I was splitting them like an accordion the strip, just so I did withdraw.

95
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:34.020
Belis Aladag: Okay, so you've been taking the, the ones you found on that you know that you bought on your own little quarters of a strip of eights. Is that right,

96
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:42.810
Anthony Whitmer: Right, I would take a strip and I would break it into four pieces and I was doing just a quarter of a trip a day just to, you know, just show I wasn't withdrawing

97
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:56.520
Belis Aladag: So, so the other thing I was going to tell you is we have every state has it, but in California. We have our own state database of like controlled substance sales right so i can i can see in the chart.

98
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.530
Belis Aladag: Is you actually, you did receive some hydrocodone pills. The last

99
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:10.710
Belis Aladag: So it may not be completely up to date, but the last thing they have listed for you is you got about 10 pills. Of the five milligram version, you got that.

100
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:10.950
Anthony Whitmer: On

101
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.080
Belis Aladag: The 10th of February.

102
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:23.100
Belis Aladag: From Saunders. So we have that the are you saying that after Dr. Saunders, is that prescription you you went on to your own Suboxone. Is that right,

103
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:40.170
Anthony Whitmer: Or mix between or no. Well, I could just tell that 1213 bills at a time. I knew I could just tell that it was going to get out of control and didn't take me two or three days to be taken eight or 10 of them you know i mean there's just no good.

104
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:47.490
Belis Aladag: You knew it wasn't going to be a sustainable thing. So you found Suboxone on your own. And you've been trying to take it right so

105
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.920
Belis Aladag: I mean it's not great that you buy elicit but what I'm saying is it's good that you chose to you get on the treatment, rather than continue to

106
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.240
Anthony Whitmer: Use the stuff that you know I continue to live my my dictionary or worse and worse and worse.

107
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.890
Anthony Whitmer: Consequences for you. I mean, because it comes with consequences.

108
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.520
Belis Aladag: It definitely does. So you made the right choice. And then, now you've brought yourself here so you can get it officially not illicitly

109
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.980
Belis Aladag: And right so the last time you took a little piece of that was yesterday today.

110
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.820
Anthony Whitmer: Um I done it three days ago.

111
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.670
Anthony Whitmer: Three days and I'm a little bit ship right now. You know, I'm not bad but I just, I'm not comfortable

112
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:36.180
Belis Aladag: Okay, so. So the good news is I, it sounds like we can go ahead and start you right away. So as soon as I can prescribe this for you. You can go to the pharmacy and get it.

113
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.590
Anthony Whitmer: You should be able to

114
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.530
Belis Aladag: Put it under your tongue. Let it melt. You know how to do this.

115
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:41.760
Anthony Whitmer: Because

116
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:50.010
Belis Aladag: If you chew it you bypass your system. You don't feel it. You want to make sure it melts under your tongue. Um, do you have a preference sometimes

117
00:11:50.490 --> 00:12:00.330
Belis Aladag: Depending on your insurance. The insurance pays for the film. Sometimes they pay for the tablet better. Do you have a preference. Do you want to try going generic and

118
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:06.390
Anthony Whitmer: Seeing my personally I'd rather be on the strips, if I can. You want to do the film is what I would like to take

119
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:13.530
Belis Aladag: Okay, let's try that. Because you're used to it and hopefully your insurance will cover it. Fine. And if we need to switch because of coverage will switch it

120
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:14.940
Anthony Whitmer: Okay.

121
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:21.000
Belis Aladag: It's all the same, but it just formulation might be easier if you like strips more. Okay, so we'll do that.

122
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:35.310
Belis Aladag: And you've been taking a piece of the eight milligrams. So how about this. Do you think you'll feel comfortable if we try doing a half a strip in the morning and then half a strip later in the day. Do you think that would be a comfortable dose.

123
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:35.940
Perfect.

124
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:45.450
Anthony Whitmer: Cuz I don't want to get my tolerance way up there by merely starting out in one strip, because the quarter strip that I've been taken, it's working.

125
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:53.760
Anthony Whitmer: And I feel like five star taking two or three a day that's just kind of defeating the whole purpose if I can keep my car slow and it works for me.

126
00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.630
Belis Aladag: Yeah. The other thing about keeping it low, that's very good for you right now is this foot situation.

127
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:11.310
Belis Aladag: So as we move forward. So let's say we stabilize you you're like okay yeah half a half a film in the morning. So it's four milligram in the morning and then a half later in the day works great.

128
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.500
Belis Aladag: And then you say, well, I'm going to have this foot surgery or some sort of operation or something.

129
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:28.980
Belis Aladag: I don't want to have to take Norco or Percocet, or anything. If I can avoid it. What we can do is increase your Suboxone dose. And so if you have pain you take an extra half and then maybe another extra half

130
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.300
Belis Aladag: Or something. So we can increase

131
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.670
Anthony Whitmer: The dose was getting ready to say it definitely helps me with my pain tours to good
