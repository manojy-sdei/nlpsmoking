00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, good morning.

2
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.780
Nadine Quintana: Good morning, Glen.

3
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Yeah, I was looking in there. I had sent her the gals in there at about three minutes after in virtual clinic.

4
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I don't know maybe you were you made to wait in or did you get there. A few minutes after

5
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.460
Nadine Quintana: I just have to wait for a little bit longer. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, they

6
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you had a six o'clock appointment, they would have checked it last night, they should have been right there.

7
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say for it's just show up, maybe a little before five minutes before even for these. I don't know. Then we can make the most of our time anyway. All right, let's get to it. Um, but, but, but let me open up a note.

8
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything kind of pressing going on right now kind of right on the tip of your tongue kind of thing.

9
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.830
Nadine Quintana: Um, no.

10
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay, so what's been working well for you as far as work, family living arrangement.

11
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.410
Nadine Quintana: Um,

12
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.750
Nadine Quintana: Just been

13
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.960
Nadine Quintana: so busy that I don't even

14
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.850
Nadine Quintana: I don't even know.

15
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe that's the point. This is not the first time you're mentioning that what's going on around that you designed it this way. This is a pressure from the workplace pressure for somewhere else. How has it gotten to this point.

16
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.560
Nadine Quintana: Um, I just been working

17
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.210
Nadine Quintana: A lot, and then just

18
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.990
Nadine Quintana: Running around everywhere that I've really got time for really anything

19
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. You already said that what I asked you was did you design it this way, or is this coming from somewhere else do you

20
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.690
Nadine Quintana: Want it or not.

21
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.980
Nadine Quintana: Um, no. It's just stuff that's happening, they

22
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.830
Nadine Quintana: Don't want it this way. But yeah, okay.

23
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what's happening. There's pieces missing.

24
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.050
Nadine Quintana: Well, I've just been having to work a lot because a lot of girls.

25
00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:08.070
Nadine Quintana: Quit or hot fire. Whatever happened to them. So I'm having to do extra a lot more extra work. So I leave from work really late at times and then

26
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:21.660
Nadine Quintana: When I do leave. I always have to go and do other stuff. The work that I don't really got time for myself for time to rest or time to enjoy your day off for

27
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.000
Nadine Quintana: Okay.

28
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not about just the therapy. It turns out there's more things going on in that because here we are we're meeting. We're carving out something in the morning on a work day

29
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.070
So,

30
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's is this this extra work that you're taking on for people that have quit. What is that about is that about Oh goody. I'm making more money.

31
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it a Dean doesn't want to say no because she's afraid she'll lose the job, or is it a third or fourth or fifth thing going on it. Maybe we need to identify

32
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:05.760
Nadine Quintana: Well, I really have no other choice because if I don't do it, then the other girl that I do work with is going to stay with more and it's not fair to her, you know that.

33
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.120
Nadine Quintana: She's kind of in the same situation that I am that I'm in so

34
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:22.170
Nadine Quintana: If I go and say why can't do this. I can't do this, then it falls all on her and I can't do that to her.

35
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And tell me about that. I can't do that her. Tell me more.

36
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.590
Nadine Quintana: I'm like, if I were to say, you know, I have to be out of here at a certain time or

37
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:45.600
Nadine Quintana: I can't work a certain day or, you know, just anything like that it like the extra whatever was supposed to be my job shell now have to do it.

38
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Not maybe I get the concept of a shift left of work being passed on. What I'm asking you is

39
00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like to ask why questions, but I'm feeling like I might have to. Why do you care about her more than you.

40
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.420
Nadine Quintana: Because I wouldn't like for somebody to do that to me. So that's why I don't do her

41
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's being done to you.

42
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's being done to

43
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Your boss is doing it to you're taking on the role of the boss's job. Now this is just another person's opinion.

44
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: How long can you do it this way.

45
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because when

46
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This is obviously a moral decision for you right

47
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's taking from you. You're getting to the point of exhaustion which here in here. I don't. I don't.

48
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a treatment plan for this this unnamed person. Okay. Both of you are getting dumped on it's the responsibility of your employer to manage the schedule. They need to call their buns in solve the problem. But that's we'll leave that aside your recovery.

49
00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: is at stake. And I'm wondering if you're thinking about that exhaustion. That is a typical really typical trigger for people

50
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what I'm talking about.

51
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.990
Nadine Quintana: I always have a trigger.

52
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You tell me because I'm not in recovery, you are. We're going to talk about triggers that have been for you. What have been triggers for your substance use in the future or over medicating

53
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Or under medicating or forgetting medicine or right exhaustion.

54
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.900
Nadine Quintana: I don't feel like you're really

55
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.420
Nadine Quintana: Does anything to my recovery.

56
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.120
Nadine Quintana: Because I still make sure I take my medicine. I

57
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:05.460
Nadine Quintana: Try to take her when I can. If I'm not feeling like I could taper the week I want to within I don't over

58
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.740
Nadine Quintana: You know, I don't push myself if I'm just not ready to taper. Then I tell you know I need another week or

59
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.470
Nadine Quintana: You know, so I don't really feel like it's getting in the way of me.

60
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.250
Nadine Quintana: Of my recovery.

61
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What has been a trigger.

62
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:25.560
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, because I'm still trying to even though I have everything that I have going on.

63
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.170
Nadine Quintana: I just

64
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.410
Nadine Quintana: I feel like really proud of myself that I wouldn't

65
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.970
Nadine Quintana: I wouldn't want to jeopardize any being, I wouldn't

66
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.300
Nadine Quintana: You know, so I don't, I don't really know. I don't really think I had a trigger.

67
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.770
Nadine Quintana: Even though I'm exhausted and I

68
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.830
Nadine Quintana: overworked myself. A lot of times I don't feel like I

69
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.050
Nadine Quintana: Don't feel like good trigger. I don't feel

70
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.800
Nadine Quintana: LIKE ANYTHING'S triggering anything

71
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.450
Okay.

72
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So what are your goals for psychotherapy, let's, let's see what it is that these moments when you visit me and we talk. What is your goal.

73
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.240
Nadine Quintana: Well, like

74
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.070
Nadine Quintana: I don't. I've never, I don't want any call that I that I have is

75
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.040
Nadine Quintana: The one where I

76
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.240
Nadine Quintana: Try to get off Suboxone before this summer.

77
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.710
Nadine Quintana: That's the only thing I have going on for myself.

78
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.870
Nadine Quintana: Other than that, I really don't have a goal.

79
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can see that. And I think over the years that I've been working with you. I've been feeling this for quite some time.

80
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And I try and I try and I come up with you with lots of different ideas about how to support your long term recovery. I have over 20 years of experience and getting you to articulate even a trigger.

81
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Years into working still can't do it. I have to at some point. Take a look at. I'm not the best fit for you. I have to, I have to at some point I have to

82
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: talk therapy. The many interventions that I do with clients, this is, this is like, this is what we do. We talk about what got me here. We look at trauma we and we kind of work through some of the desensitization. We do inner child work.

83
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not able to do those things with you. And at some point, because I've been coming out at a comment from a lot of different places. And I think it might be me.

84
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think it might be time to explore if you want to hear a little bit about some other people's style. You might feel more comfortable with them.

85
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: But I have to at some point. Take a look that it might be a deficit with with our something about our chemistry going on because at this point, you're not able to say what a trigger for substance uses and not be able to say what your goal is. In in in therapy. It is a challenge for me.

86
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's just tapering then you

87
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.800
Nadine Quintana: But I don't feel any triggers. That's the thing. I don't, I don't, but

88
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what the word insight is 19 like that word. Hey, I have inside. He has insight. She has insight.

89
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.120
Nadine Quintana: This person. Nope, nothing.

90
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Happens, like what is inside mean to you.

91
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.650
Nadine Quintana: I don't know.

92
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, remember when we first started, you said, I want to be a counselor. Remember that

93
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What are the skills necessary for a counselor.

94
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:35.430
Yeah.

95
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.220
Nadine Quintana: Okay.

96
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot. One of them is to know thyself. One of them is to never be caught off guard to really know the distinction between who I am, what my feelings are my needs and the other whoever the other, whether it's a client. It's a co worker really to be able to know what a boundary is

97
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And

98
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This insight into the self.

99
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It is my professional opinion that it is very important to prevent a relapse in the future.

100
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you believe that substance use for you came out of nowhere. You've said once before you've said a couple of different versions about how it's kind of about one I

101
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Told counselors this truth, it wasn't the truth. Now, there's this truth today, there is a wall up between us, that I can't get past there's something going on. I don't know what it is.

102
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.930
Nadine Quintana: Because the way I'm saying to see is that, that's my past that's that's some place I

103
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.600
Nadine Quintana: Don't want to be a

104
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:45.900
Nadine Quintana: I'm come so far and I look at how I was then and

105
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:56.550
Nadine Quintana: And I'm not gonna let whatever happened in the past. I'm not gonna let it for my future. I'm not gonna let it. I'm not gonna let that do and not

106
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.400
Nadine Quintana: letting that happen. Yeah.

107
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.540
I understand.

108
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And

109
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you believe that there's a piece of information about how psychology works that you may not understand yet, meaning how the brain works.

110
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a possibility, even a little bit that you may be missing some information I accept that I don't know it all. But do you that there might be something you don't understand that willpower. A note alone. I just won't go back

111
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That they might be more time.

112
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.990
Nadine Quintana: On I'm sure there's things that I don't know but I

113
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:49.440
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, like I've met people I know people that I didn't even know were drug addicts that were hardcore drug addicts and run businesses now and and you would never think that they

114
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.850
Nadine Quintana: Were ever like this and

115
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:55.890
Nadine Quintana: And

116
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.890
Nadine Quintana: You know, like

117
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.280
Nadine Quintana: Just seen them and knowing them and

118
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.080
Nadine Quintana: How they

119
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:05.940
Nadine Quintana: You know,

120
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:26.700
Nadine Quintana: were strong enough to lay I believe people could just do it. I believe that people could if they have it in them and they have that strength in them that I believe that they could, you know, there's some people that that really need more help than others. And then there's

121
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.990
Nadine Quintana: Some people that yes, they need help, but not for ever. And, you know,

122
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you have that you didn't have when you were using

123
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.820
Nadine Quintana: I

124
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.490
Nadine Quintana: Actually have more respect for myself, I have

125
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.370
Nadine Quintana: I have a family.

126
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.140
Nadine Quintana: I mean, I've had my family when I was using but

127
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.900
Nadine Quintana: I just gotten

128
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.880
Nadine Quintana: Closer with my family and

129
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:17.760
Nadine Quintana: The way our I really even though we get mad with each other and we fight sometimes. And there's times we don't even talk for days with each other, but

130
00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.990
Nadine Quintana: I have my family in a way that I've never had them before. I've never been close with my family.

131
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.830
Nadine Quintana: The way I am now.

132
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.440
Nadine Quintana: You know I

133
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you do that.

134
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.030
Nadine Quintana: A lot was getting clean

135
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.830
Nadine Quintana: Starting to learn how to open up to people and

136
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.590
Nadine Quintana: Let people in I may not let him and all the way, but

137
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.130
Nadine Quintana: You know, I learned

138
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.930
Nadine Quintana: I'm starting to just

139
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:19.050
Nadine Quintana: Open up a little bit more take down those walls that I used to have been

140
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it about talking about last that concerns you.

141
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.190
Nadine Quintana: Talked about the past.

142
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.350
Nadine Quintana: I know I just, I wouldn't like to be there again.

143
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.010
Nadine Quintana: Just

144
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.850
Nadine Quintana: Like I think about

145
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.240
Nadine Quintana: No good there's times that I've thought like

146
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.510
Nadine Quintana: How like

147
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.100
Nadine Quintana: grateful I am that

148
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.050
Nadine Quintana: Like I'm not doing drugs anymore because

149
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:46.320
Nadine Quintana: I just see the way that people are like, I see you know I see drug users.

150
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.760
Nadine Quintana: There's a lot down here and I see the set that's happening to them and you know

151
00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:06.120
Nadine Quintana: Like the way their lives are turning out and you see women that are 40 some years old and they have nothing to show for their lives because they're

152
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.390
Nadine Quintana: addicted to drugs and

153
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.680
Nadine Quintana: I don't want to be some 40 year old woman.

154
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:26.190
Nadine Quintana: addicted to drugs, even if I don't do something successful with my life. And even if I stay a housekeeper for the rest of my life. But you know what, I have a job, I have

155
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.760
Nadine Quintana: I have a good life and I don't

156
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.770
Nadine Quintana: I just

157
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.520
Nadine Quintana: I rather work my ass off like this every day and be busy every day and overwhelmed and

158
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:49.200
Nadine Quintana: And tired and drained and whatever, then to ever go back to the life that I had

159
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So this concept of insight there are people that

160
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Might need them already have it. Some people develop it through discussions through therapy through talking, they learn to understand, ah, this behavior was conditioned, you know that word.

161
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Shaped by

162
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically, our environment, our caregivers or or a specific time limited events. Sometimes it's a trauma. Sometimes it's the loss of someone they shape how we view the world how we view ourselves, our understanding of the past.

163
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: How it contributes shapes conditions, how we behave today is insight.

164
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the whole

165
00:20:50.340 --> 00:21:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: crux of psychotherapy, if we only talk about right now if you never look backwards and you never look at an antecedent. It's something that proceeds it

166
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you don't understand why you're doing what you're doing.

167
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to look back, we look back so that we don't repeat patterns that we didn't like

168
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And we get to feel proud as you said about the things that we're doing, we do like

169
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you talking about the past is something next level unwelcome you don't like to do it.

170
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And

171
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.120
Nadine Quintana: It's I mean of course I've talked about my past. I mean,

172
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:46.770
Nadine Quintana: There's a lot of times that I talk about my past and I, you know, talk to friends or

173
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:53.010
Nadine Quintana: You know, family, and I've talked about my drug use and stuff like that and

174
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.100
Nadine Quintana: And it just

175
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.200
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, it's, it's

176
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.970
Nadine Quintana: When I'm talking about it like for somebody

177
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:25.350
Nadine Quintana: Like for instance, my friend, her boyfriend's addicted to drugs and she was telling me about it. And, you know, for some reason, I started talking about my drug habit in the past and it felt good about

178
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:27.960
Nadine Quintana: I guess.

179
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.690
Nadine Quintana: I guess I don't know when I feel

180
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:46.740
Nadine Quintana: Pressured and for some reason this goes with anything, not just my past, when I'm forced into talking about something or I'm forced into doing something that's I guess it angers me

181
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Now you're getting somewhere. Now you're doing some truth telling. That's what I

182
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, uh huh.

183
00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:01.740
Nadine Quintana: And you know I like to do things, even if it's a little as littlest tiniest thing.

184
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.010
Nadine Quintana: You know, if I'm asked to do something or

185
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.840
Nadine Quintana: Talk about something. It annoys me

186
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.190
Nadine Quintana: I just like to, you know, let things out.

187
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:23.100
Nadine Quintana: On my time on my own. When I feel comfortable or I feel okay to do it or

188
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:32.910
Nadine Quintana: I mean, I don't like I said, I don't mind talking about my past. I guess it's just the fact that

189
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:34.620
Nadine Quintana: When

190
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're being pressured to do it. You don't like it.

191
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.910
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I don't like and

192
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:39.810
Nadine Quintana: And and

193
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that. I know that that I've been watching this for years. I know.

194
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm okay. I'm but it. Here it is.

195
00:23:49.260 --> 00:24:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Your end what I'm asking you is do you leave room for the fact that there might be big pieces of successful recovery for you that you're getting in the way of because of that.

196
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is very complicated stuff meeting you can't wait. We can't just lay it out. I can't just say, well, knock it off like Of course not. You've come out of this style, I believe, because you need it. It's adapted for you. But if it's the only skill. We're using

197
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be getting in the way. And out here. I gotta ask you

198
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you saw something in group or maybe you saw something in individual therapy. You don't get a lot of psychotherapy, because we're busy doing this.

199
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm talking about the wall. We do a lot of time I hammer away at it and then we today. We're 32 minutes in still haven't done an exercise now.

200
00:24:50.730 --> 00:25:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to be patient with that I have to say, you know, on my schedule, maybe what I consider is, you know, I think she's got the capability. I think she's got enough ego strength. I think she can do

201
00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The therapeutic interventions. I think she can do it. But if you don't think you can if you don't think you can sit with the vulnerability

202
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to respect that.

203
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But I do care. And I'm concerned because if you can't say this is these are triggers. I'm going to keep my eye out for it.

204
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got you go to any book. Go to any website. They're going to talk about relapse prevention, we have to know how we got where we are so that we can be more in control of our future.

205
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just how it works. It

206
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't just on strong know we we understand ourselves. We understand our behavior better so that we can have the future that we want.

207
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's relapse prevention. It's just, you can go by a lot of different names, but it does take inside

208
00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This piece about

209
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I don't want to be pushed

210
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There's been times where, in general, I don't. And it's created the space for you, where you volunteered things that I didn't push you came to me right that you're someone who's just, you know,

211
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Say what you want to say when you want to say it, that's up to you but at other times I mean we're, we're a long time into treatment. And so I'm checking in and I'm saying, Do you know the word insight. What's a, what's a trigger. And you're saying I

212
00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how can I not be concerned, I have this treatment. This relapse prevention that I've been building for years, and there's like

213
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.830
Not much in it.

214
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Triggers you've said in the past.

215
00:26:52.140 --> 00:27:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Are irritation negative self talk. Why is this happening to me. Okay, you've been able to say them in the past.

216
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Had habit of playing victim and plant blaming mom for a lot of stuff you've been able to say that

217
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A trigger doesn't mean I want to go use a trigger is I'm getting myself so emotionally distraught.

218
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That that idea of escape keeps moving up and up and up on the list of solutions. This can take months and years to begin the journey of a slip or a relapse.

219
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not diminished, because let me ask you something. Has there been anything that therapy meeting meeting with me has helped you with

220
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: AN AUDITION FOR A compliment I really just want to know whether you see that

221
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.780
Nadine Quintana: Or yeah, I think I've come over, I

222
00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:06.120
Nadine Quintana: Can't really pinpoint like what happened, but I know something happened along the way, where I was able to

223
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:07.680
Nadine Quintana: You know,

224
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:19.110
Nadine Quintana: start letting people in not something I had a very hard time that I've seen lots of counselors for and I was not able to do that.

225
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:33.300
Nadine Quintana: Till I started talking to you. There was with my PTSD, where it was so bad and I wouldn't sleep for days because of it. And when I started talking to you. It

226
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.040
Nadine Quintana: Like I never even had PTSD. Okay.

227
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.460
Nadine Quintana: So I have noticed

228
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.460
Nadine Quintana: A lot of, you know,

229
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.880
Nadine Quintana: Stuff about me syncing you

230
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.800
Nadine Quintana: Change.

231
00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: This is that's the word trust increased trust you may not know how to describe it, but out here. It's funny. I'm not in

232
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your moment to moment experience of thing so it's easier for someone outside to see what's going on. It's just the way it is because

233
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not distracted by how it feels. So here what you've done is you've increased self trust, which means it's been possible for you to let in people into your emotional into your personal life, not all the way a little bit.

234
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you have worked very hard around the, the reduction of the symptoms of the PTSD.

235
00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So knowing that,

236
00:29:50.760 --> 00:30:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Would it be possible for you to risk a little bit in here and not be the one that leads because there's many times when you have let me lead

237
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And have I lend you giving you such bad ideas. I don't give advice and I'll say hey Navy and go do this, I invite people to try some things on see if they work for him. I'll show you some skills. It's up to you what you do with them. I can't possibly know how to live your life, but I'm

238
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see my concern. I mean, you're hearing it like I hope I've got some credibility at this point.

239
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.650
Nadine Quintana: Yeah i mean i i see your concern. Um,

240
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:44.550
Nadine Quintana: But just being truthful. I, I don't know, I just like to me. I

241
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.400
Nadine Quintana: I've been like I

242
00:30:52.260 --> 00:31:00.480
Nadine Quintana: And I know I don't say much in in our sessions and I don't let a lot out for

243
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.420
Nadine Quintana: Like to me. I feel like I

244
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.130
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, I can't explain it, it's just

245
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:18.600
Nadine Quintana: Something that I

246
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.440
Nadine Quintana: Think that I feel

247
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:30.810
Nadine Quintana: About myself that I I never felt before like it.

248
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.130
Nadine Quintana: I don't know i i can't put into words. What I'm trying to see

249
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a lot of words. I learned a lot of them in school. Let me see if some of them.

250
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:38.940
Were

251
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Needing scale of zero to 10 how high is your self esteem.

252
00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.630
Nadine Quintana: I'm pretty is

253
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:50.040
Your number

254
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.580
Nadine Quintana: Good 910

255
00:31:54.330 --> 00:32:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's one way that we kind of measure how am I doing, how do I feel about myself, but I feel like if something negative happens I can get up.

256
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Assess the problem and put a solution to it. And I can get up and I can handle it.

257
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Tends to be a sense of esteem. I believe in myself. I don't question it. If this is what I think is in the best interest of myself, my family. Why then, I'm going to take action and I'm going to go get it done in general, that's kind of where it lives.

258
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: People that low self esteem. Don't trust. Notice that word coming up again don't trust if their ideas that one they're having right now. Oh, it's no good.

259
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't be good at won't work. And then there's probably not going to be a lot of movement solve the problem.

260
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not going to believe that they can go get that job, go back to school that they can even speak in group or that their ideas have value the esteem, the sense of I have value in the self is very low. Here's this high right now that says to me, exhaustion or not.

261
00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You still feeling really good about who you are. That's exciting. I love here. I'm not if it changes. I'm going to want to know, too. But this is a good way for me to, in the absence of really tangible goals. This is a good one.

262
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Another one is

263
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we'll just go real basic will go to things that basically everyone does in substance abuse treatment. So one of them is established a sustained recovery free from the use of all mood altering substances. So, to some degree, although certainly not to the degree that heroin is

264
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The buprenorphine is somewhat mood altering it can have just just this little experience, you know, just as it hits the bloodstream, people can feel this this little i don't know maybe it's a rush. But there's an awareness that it's in your bloodstream, whereas

265
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What would it be like for you to not have that anymore.

266
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.300
Nadine Quintana: Um,

267
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.720
Nadine Quintana: I thought about this the lot.

268
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:16.350
Nadine Quintana: I think

269
00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:20.010
Nadine Quintana: At the beginning, I would have to

270
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.610
Nadine Quintana: I would have to get myself use to

271
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.530
Nadine Quintana: La

272
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:35.850
Nadine Quintana: I'm

273
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:46.200
Nadine Quintana: Like when I'm starting to like really come off of it and I'm on my last little milligrams and that I i know that's gonna be

274
00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:47.880
Nadine Quintana: A little

275
00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:49.710
Nadine Quintana: Different

276
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.860
Nadine Quintana: Because it's already starting to

277
00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.160
Nadine Quintana: Feel a little different but

278
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.030
Nadine Quintana: I think it would be exciting.

279
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.130
Nadine Quintana: Like

280
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:11.850
Nadine Quintana: I don't know. That's what I think that I think it'd be like really, really exciting.

281
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so what you just did. Let's talk more about the it's already starting to feel different. Tell me.

282
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:27.630
Nadine Quintana: Specifically, say I see I was, I was like, you know,

283
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:39.690
Nadine Quintana: I went from, you know, doing heroin to now on the Suboxone to being on a really high dose to now.

284
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.560
Nadine Quintana: Being at four.

285
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.830
Nadine Quintana: And a half and

286
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so great and proud of you.

287
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.700
Nadine Quintana: And it's just like mind blowing like

288
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:56.670
Say,

289
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.340
Nadine Quintana: I don't know. I'm just like, I'm really proud of myself, you know,

290
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.410
Nadine Quintana: And it's exciting like

291
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.860
Nadine Quintana: It kind of brings me down when I

292
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:22.530
Nadine Quintana: Like like last week, I was just like, no, you know, I need to see another week. Yeah. Or, you know, even though it's not the two weeks, like I wanted. And I know there's going to be

293
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:42.120
Nadine Quintana: moments like that where I'm just like, I can't. This week I have to stay another week. I know that that's going to happen. Right. But at the same time. I'm just like, you know what I this is so exciting, like every time I move down a half a milligram. I'm just like static, you know, I'm

294
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:56.850
Nadine Quintana: Even though, like a lot of the times I don't feel good at first, and I'm with the cold sweats and I'm just like, I'm still happy, even though I feel like shit i i'm still

295
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:11.790
Nadine Quintana: It's like a wonderful feeling that I can have it just like I just want to jump up and down and be like, Damn, I came a long, long way from where I was that

296
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:25.290
Nadine Quintana: And it makes me really really proud of myself, you know, and I know I could do it. I mean, I know I could and I know it's going to be different. I know.

297
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:40.980
Nadine Quintana: It is, I know because like I said I was so used to doing the heroin and then I was so used to this. The boxes. Yeah. And having something there. I know it's gonna be a challenge. At first I know it is

298
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:42.600
Nadine Quintana: But

299
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:50.160
Nadine Quintana: I don't know i i just

300
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:57.090
Nadine Quintana: I believe in myself. I mean, I, you know, like I could do it even I know I could I

301
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.610
Nadine Quintana: And, you know, and I think about that, like we're

302
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:24.570
Nadine Quintana: I know I'll never be the person I was even before I started doing drugs, you know that happy outgoing funny person. I will never, I mean, of course I will be those things I will never be the person I was before I started doing drugs, but I'm a whole new person. Yeah, and

303
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:38.040
Nadine Quintana: To not be on anything at all, and to be this new person that I am that I'm becoming is exciting to me because I'll be sober.

304
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.990
Nadine Quintana: And I'm

305
00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.980
Nadine Quintana: Starting to get a little taste of

306
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.650
Nadine Quintana: The new me

307
00:38:48.150 --> 00:39:02.940
Nadine Quintana: You know the person that jokes around and and laughs and you know could cry like before I couldn't cry in front of people at all. I would be so mad at myself when I cry and print people and now it's like

308
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.970
Nadine Quintana: I have I been catching myself doing that a lot

309
00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:17.040
Nadine Quintana: You know, and I don't feel bad about it. I don't feel mad at myself, if anything, sometimes I even

310
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:24.720
Nadine Quintana: Laugh it off and and you know when I have people that talk to me. And it's a whole different

311
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:32.610
Nadine Quintana: It's different than what it was before. Before I would have gotten mad. I know I'm rambling and

312
00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep going. You're saying really important things

313
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.640
Nadine Quintana: And, you know, like

314
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:52.500
Nadine Quintana: I want experience that I want. I can't wait to do all this new stuff that I i learned all this new stuff that I've been

315
00:39:54.180 --> 00:40:02.160
Nadine Quintana: Feeling and, you know, sober, but nothing with no Suboxone, no nothing.

316
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.020
Like

317
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.380
Nadine Quintana: A new person I go

318
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.530
Nadine Quintana: With happy for once. I actually feel happy.

319
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can credit it to just you, you'll no longer have to include credit to a substance.

320
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:34.380
Nadine Quintana: Yes, exactly.

321
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: that suits your personality perfectly because watch what you were talking about earlier. I don't want

322
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: To have to hold on, because this is this sort of metaphor stuff. I don't want to have to credit. A gwan of year.

323
00:40:48.180 --> 00:41:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Of someone else when they tell me to go do something I want to do it by myself. I want to give myself full credit when I take someone else's push. I have to give a little bit of credit to them. I know that sounds like a real stretch. But if that hypothesis is true.

324
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

325
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Those two things match up really well, hey, when I look and I say, am I the one that's really happy.

326
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I enjoying what I'm enjoying it. My excited for my own reasons, doing the things I want to do not for someone else, not because someone else helped me I help myself. I know I live my own life. And I think what you're saying is that is really appealing, meaning you want that.

327
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right

328
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:41.610
Nadine Quintana: Um,

329
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.430
Nadine Quintana: Somewhat but

330
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.710
Nadine Quintana: I know a lot had to do because of the work with you because I have admitted it.

331
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.530
Nadine Quintana: To my friend passed.

332
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:05.220
Nadine Quintana: And I have mentioned this before that ever since I've come here.

333
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.190
Nadine Quintana: And started talking, you know,

334
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:10.950
Nadine Quintana: What to you.

335
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.490
Nadine Quintana: That it's

336
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:24.090
Nadine Quintana: That it's helped bring up it's helped with a lot of the issues I was having and I think it helps to bring

337
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:35.520
Nadine Quintana: You know, bring everything out and learn how to handle things. And I know we didn't always. And I don't know, maybe I'm just weird. I don't know what it is.

338
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:50.610
Nadine Quintana: But you may not believe this, because we don't get a lot of work done. We don't do a lot of the activities you want to do, but to me when it helps me to just talk. Okay.

339
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.880
Nadine Quintana: Okay. It really does.

340
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:59.790
Nadine Quintana: And I know you want to try these activities and I know

341
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:03.600
Nadine Quintana: But for some reason, I'm just, I

342
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.020
Nadine Quintana: Just the talking itself.

343
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.110
Nadine Quintana: Mean you talking like this.

344
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.510
Nadine Quintana: It helps me

345
00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And and i know that too. And it might be right around that you get to innocence. Be a little defiance meaning kind of hands on the hips like this. No.

346
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to do

347
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're awake when. But wait, if it's true because that's what I can see, I can see that happening. I've been watching it for a long time.

348
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And I've told I told you, and I've told a lot of people

349
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: There's concepts in psychology called transference and counter transference. There's these. They're really amazing things a different theory is going to call it a reenactment lots of cool terms out there, but I've, I like the one transference.

350
00:43:55.410 --> 00:44:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The relationship that you and I have may mimic copy looks similar to one that you've had in the past where you have not been able to

351
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Put your hands on your hips. It's just a metaphor and say no.

352
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch, not only say no. But the person that you're talking to doesn't walk away.

353
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't shame you doesn't blame you, doesn't make you feel like crap so you know how you're saying it just feels good. Like right now, to be able to say my truth even right. It's kind of scary because what if there was a conflict. What if we blow up now.

354
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not going to happen. I had to. I started with. I need to see if maybe I'm the problem.

355
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't run off the screen. This was an incredibly challenging dynamic. You and I are sitting through, you could have just as easily said f you, lady.

356
00:44:51.450 --> 00:45:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have registered one of your you're abandoning me. You could have registered so many different things and what you did instead is you sat here you felt through it and I bet it wasn't the easiest thing to do.

357
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're still here. That's right. This

358
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Is good because you there aren't a lot of relationships where you can put your hands on your head, you can stand up for what you believe in, say, I love to do it my way.

359
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And the other person doesn't get pissed off or offended. It's a very rare thing.

360
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's healing for you. That's probably why it feels so good.

361
00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Husband can't do it, kids. We can't do it. Mom No, see, you know, siblings, know they're all wrapped up making about themselves.

362
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: A therapeutic relationship if it's done right means you get to get mad at me.

363
00:45:49.350 --> 00:46:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to be afraid. You get to get hurt offended, all of it and I don't go away. I stay right here and I sit with it and I contain it. And I say to you over and over and over, basically.

364
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay to your. Okay, that's one of those emotions, it'll show up somewhere else. And let's sit with it together. It's going to be okay.

365
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it is very therapeutic. When you say I want to do it on my terms and I have a hypothesis about why that's so important, but thing about it is I have the insight and because I care about you because I want you to have long term, the rest of your life recovery.

366
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing how you got here is power and why you wouldn't want it.

367
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Concerns me. So if I do have some credit. Can you bank on that. Can you rely on that when I say to know thyself, is to heal thyself. When you know why you do what you do, you're powerful

368
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all I want for you.

369
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Always anything i have i want i want you to have it you have it. It's yours.

370
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Some things won't, won't be biochemically healed.

371
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: From just telling the story.

372
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: These other experiential exercises or the healing process. Now I could be wrong. And it might be because I've been watching and right you don't do a lot, a lot, a lot of sharing, but you've listened very closely and group and you've listened very, very closely.

373
00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:30.870
Nadine Quintana: In here.

374
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You take it in because I'll watch you won't say much. And then you'll come back and all of a sudden, there'll be a word in there that wasn't there before. There'll be this new confidence. This new assertiveness. This new piece. So I know it's going in there.

375
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it can hit

376
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This is coming from a place of

377
00:47:53.340 --> 00:48:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of what's called counter transference. Which means I don't know if I'm doing a good enough job for you.

378
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Your transference in here would be maybe getting irritated with me because I represent, maybe someone who's kind of pushed you around are

379
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Made to do something you didn't want to do that would be transference. But we're human beings, so that that flows. My job is basically to keep an eye on that stuff. So I've got to make sure make sure I'm keeping an eye on what's going on for me.

380
00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's going on for you. You just have to pay attention. You gotta do both.

381
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you hear that it's it's just I might be rushing might be hurrying well let's let's get this relapse prevention together because you are tapering and you're saying, I'm excited and and and and so when you say things like

382
00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I can do it. Well, yeah. The it

383
00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: In my terms is your life and life includes disappointment rejection betrayal falling in love and the terrifying experience of what if I lose that love

384
00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Sexuality hunger lust fear disappointment of embarrassment. I mean, all of it. When you say, I can do it. That's what I think of. And so when I say well how's 19 around all of those. How has she been testing herself. Has she never

385
00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

386
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I know about embarrassed. Yeah, I know about a few of them.

387
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.030
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I

388
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:38.070
Nadine Quintana: Tested myself quite a bit lately so

389
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:40.260
Okay.

390
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And

391
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.240
Nadine Quintana: So far I'm still standing. Yeah.

392
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: More than just standing. You're saying to me.

393
00:49:49.080 --> 00:50:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm happy, even in the presence of of what embarrassment betrayal disappointment. Those overwhelm. Yeah, that's what it is that's that's what my life is for life is life.

394
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It's what we do with it that makes the difference. And if before it was, I can't handle it.

395
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:18.630
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's over. If you're saying, whenever I can. I've tested it. I'm going down. I'm tapering and I'm feeling those feelings.

396
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: To a degree that I just didn't before. And I'm handling it in a way that I am proud of. Then Bravo, then you're doing what I think it's going to take for you to have sustained recovery.

397
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And all I'm doing is just I want to kind of poke those buttons, a little bit here and there just to see if they're there because I want to protect you. I want to make sure that you're ready.

398
00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:46.320
Nadine Quintana: I

399
00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Want. I want to hear it. I'll shut up.

400
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.800
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, I just

401
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.780
Nadine Quintana: I gone through some stuff.

402
00:50:59.370 --> 00:50:59.880
Nadine Quintana: And

403
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:08.580
Nadine Quintana: Like for instance, how I told you I couldn't say no to people and

404
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.760
Nadine Quintana: Um, you know, like

405
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.940
Nadine Quintana: My mom. The other day I told her, you know, like, you know what, I can't

406
00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:29.820
Nadine Quintana: I can't, I'm going to relax. I don't want nobody calling me. I don't want nobody bothering me. I'm gonna enjoy my day off, don't bother me like I was able to say that

407
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:33.600
Nadine Quintana: That's a man. I was so proud of myself and then

408
00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:38.340
Nadine Quintana: I started talking to my husband again.

409
00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:41.160
Nadine Quintana: Oh really, yes. And

410
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.370
Nadine Quintana: I just, it's just so different, like I

411
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: recognize you.

412
00:51:51.060 --> 00:52:01.590
Nadine Quintana: And he tells me to like I like the new you. I like the new you. And you know, and then like my mom finding out that I was talking to my husband again. She was like,

413
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:12.840
Nadine Quintana: Oh, you know why. And this and I said, because, and I stood up for myself and I was like, because I can, and because I want to, and he's the father, my kids and I'm not cutting him out of my life.

414
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:27.150
Nadine Quintana: You know, and I was able to send up to her and it felt really really good to do that this, this just happened yesterday. In fact, and I did it in a way to where I didn't yell at her.

415
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.810
Nadine Quintana: I told her how I felt. And you know what

416
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:39.630
Nadine Quintana: We continued enjoying the day and we continued shopping and when on like nothing ever happened. And I told her what I had to tell her.

417
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:46.530
Nadine Quintana: And before it wasn't like that before. It was like fighting and arguing and one of us would leave and

418
00:52:48.210 --> 00:53:02.460
Nadine Quintana: I was just so happy and proud of myself to handle it the way that I handled it and then a while back, you know, I started, I was talking to this one guy and I had been talking to him for five months. And all of a sudden he just

419
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:07.260
Nadine Quintana: acted like this big jerk and just, you know,

420
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:18.810
Nadine Quintana: Kind of was messed up with me, you know, and I was like oh my god I started crying and I was like, I'm going crazy. And, you know, and then I was like,

421
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:27.420
Nadine Quintana: Who the hell is he, you know, who, who the hell is why am I crying over him.

422
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:37.650
Nadine Quintana: You know, he's probably out there. Happy Talking to other girls and having a good time and I'm here like an idiot crying over this punk.

423
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:39.450
Nadine Quintana: Know,

424
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:46.290
Nadine Quintana: And I just was like, whatever, and I

425
00:53:47.970 --> 00:54:01.620
Nadine Quintana: I haven't even talked to him since I felt like that that day and it's been like three weeks. That's amazing. And you know, I just I just noticed a lot of stuff about myself that I'm like, I can do it.

426
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:14.280
Nadine Quintana: I can do it if I, you know, even if it hurts somebody's feelings, there's a way to say it to where you don't get into a fight with them or you don't, you know,

427
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:24.810
Nadine Quintana: Even though they're not going to like it. You know what I could do this because I need to do this for myself, because if I hold it in or I

428
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:43.200
Nadine Quintana: I go off with all my anger. It's not going to go nowhere. So I have to say how I'm feeling. And after let that out. Because if not, I'm the one that's going to stay hurting. I'm the one that's going to stay messed up. In the end, you know, so

429
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:44.970
Nadine Quintana: I have to

430
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.110
Nadine Quintana: Like when it comes to like the affiliate part

431
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:55.740
Nadine Quintana: I have to put myself first. Okay. And I'm starting to recognize that

432
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Some nagging see how you just said that.

433
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's face that I'm in around I'm getting overwhelmed. I'm doing it. So this friend doesn't get hurt.

434
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: It's right there.

435
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all that was my only points right there.

436
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So all I'm inviting all I'm inviting him right. Is that, is that just on your own terms.

437
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking a look at it and saying where's the line, how long can I do this before, because no matter what, no matter how strong whatever however you conceptualize yourself if I'm hungry.

438
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm angry. I'm lonely from sleepy but right I'm tired. I'm not going to act right I'm just, it's just a fact because that's just Kansas. Okay.

439
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's the halt hungry angry lonely tired, we memorize it, we say, okay, am I in that

440
00:55:51.840 --> 00:56:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't mean to be snippy snappy snooty with someone because you're overtired are exhausted. It just happens because we're not operating with her full brain we absolutely have to rest.

441
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you know how you protected it with your mom, you know it. So all I was was checking in on that word exhaustion. For many people, it's that one.

442
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That gets them. That's all I'm doing is just gently. So if, if you could just say if some introspection, while you're doing some work around. What is it about this friend. What is it about

443
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This particular moment that I won't stand up and say to my boss or to whoever hey

444
00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a way to say it, I need to do this for myself, even if it hurts someone because you just said those words, right, I've got to put myself first

445
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not at the expense of someone else. And he didn't. You didn't quit and dump all the work on said friend what you did was your job. Someone else was a mess, they're gone, the boss.

446
00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Put the pressure on you to now you'd you're going to do is you're going to do I. All I'm saying is out here. Just be aware, it's the same skill.

447
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That you use with mom that you use with husband you used in here with me, you know, your truth and you only you know where that line is where it's like

448
00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go with this. I don't want to dump on this friend because I don't want it dumped on me. But at what point, but I down to two hours of sleep at night or one, like, do you know where that limit is where you will have to say to your boss. Listen dude, dude.

449
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Work it out. I'm going home.

450
00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.050
Nadine Quintana: I can get the day to

451
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Me.

452
00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:48.300
Nadine Quintana: Well, I had like we had like 27 rooms, each of us and

453
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.950
Nadine Quintana: I

454
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:57.570
Nadine Quintana: You know what, I was like, I'm not. And I told the people out front desk. I was like, you know what I'm going to do as much as I can.

455
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:06.210
Nadine Quintana: I'm not going to kill myself and I'm not going to work myself to death over these rooms. Do I have to roll some rooms.

456
00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:17.340
Nadine Quintana: For tomorrow and matter of fact I was off the next day. So it was like, so if I wrote the rooms, you guys are gonna have to figure that out on how you guys are going to clean them.

457
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Your whole Tuesday off you kept it preserved for yourself. Right.

458
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, go girl, that's what I'm talking about, right, that's it. Now you see what I was doing over here going checking in really making

459
00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:32.490
Making sure you don't

460
00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:36.990
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I mean, I will do it.

461
00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:47.520
Nadine Quintana: And I will do a lot of stuff and I will work and work and work and I do get exhausted but I'm not going to

462
00:58:50.010 --> 00:59:03.120
Nadine Quintana: I'm not going to kill myself over it. So if it doesn't get done. It doesn't get done and no one's going to die because it doesn't get done. So I mean, people may be mad.

463
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:14.970
Nadine Quintana: But you know what, I'm not going to get myself so I'm not going to get myself drink because to make somebody else happy. Yes, I will do what I can.

464
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.990
Nadine Quintana: But that's as far as I'm going and

465
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, the phrases. I won't kill myself. That's what when I say, Do you know where that line is your boundary of how much you will do

466
00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: To not hurt this this other woman right because to dump on her. You're not dumping on her you're doing your work plus work it's

467
00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone else

468
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Now she has to maintain her own boundaries to friend said, friend.

469
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, I'm hearing a little bit more than indeed you are still very much protecting

470
00:59:53.580 --> 01:00:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Rest in that personal growth space and you're doing it in a way it sounds like you're really proud of the way you're saying it, you're, you're being mindful of.

471
01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to say it in a way that's not blame me. It's not name calling. I'm just going to say this is my limit. I'm going to spend time alone not going to go do this. I need some quiet time and it's turning out great people aren't

472
01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: getting pissed off, right, because you're you're changing kind of the way you're saying things to

473
01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So all right, well, that's just so cool. Now what you did is you explain to me the

474
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of evidence of how in the very beginning, you were saying I've got this. I think I've got this, you know, you gave me those pieces.

475
01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And that that does help.

476
01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are skills. That's the stuff that good can get plugged in a relapse prevention plan. I can go here, I can go to. How am I feeling. Am I, am I

477
01:00:53.730 --> 01:01:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I would go to exhausted. I would go there and say, you know. Am I completely empty tank, meaning I have nothing left. I

478
01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I have no energy no inspiration. No, creativity, no enthusiasm, have I given so much that I have nothing left for myself. That's what I'm trying to stay on top of, like,

479
01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what we're getting. We're getting that bad. What are you going to get that bad. How bad is going to get, you know, so I'm just sort of kind of go in there and making sure you're you recognize it when it's starting to get close.

480
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm hearing it, because you've been showing up in group.

481
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: With a real low sort of vibe.

482
01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And some keeping an eye on it and i and i just checking in and making sure you're aware of where that limit is and I'm hearing some good things you're saying I'm pushing back. I'm not going to let myself kill myself. And I think that's the boundary that

483
01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I are talking about call it. I'm not going to kill myself over this.

484
01:01:51.270 --> 01:02:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Tomorrow's another day. I think that's the same line as I'm talking about, which is know your boundary know nowhere to say that I've got to take care of my recovery and I say recovery. But what I mean is mental health.

485
01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:12.330
Nadine Quintana: Okay and see and I was just taking it, I guess, a different way. But now that you explained it to me. It makes a lot more stem

486
01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:23.400
Nadine Quintana: And I just, I thought your means something different. I, I really wasn't getting what you are seeing

487
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:25.470
Nadine Quintana: So now.

488
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Is really complicated for some people.

489
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: They're so excited about what they're doing a lot of people. I mean, there have been times in my life when I've worked three jobs plus was

490
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Spent a lot of time moving around, doing some fun things to I was like okay I started going a little psychotic

491
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know, I was like, all right, I gotta check myself now. Um, but I wasn't mad about it. I was just like, oh, I look, I can do this. I could do this. I was excited and in my own life. I'm having fun with it.

492
01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm putting myself out at my brain wasn't working. Well, I needed more sleep. I needed to actually have a little bit more balance and something had to give

493
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're excited about what you're doing. That's, that's great.

494
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Just keep keep a check on sleep. Sleep is going to be the one you're going to know

495
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleep and rest and personal time, those are going to probably be key factors to keep an eye on if they're getting scrunched and there's hardly any of it. That might be the line. Okay, I've got a step back. I've got to balance out work and personal life a little bit

496
01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are warning signs people oftentimes will use sleep and personal rest time as a warning sign if it's getting encroached on which means it's getting really small. That's when

497
01:03:42.810 --> 01:03:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I might be overdoing distraction, which work can be a might be

498
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's a pretty common one. So, all right.

499
01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How you doing today, how's the House today. How you feeling at the end.

500
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:58.860
Good. Okay.

501
01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so it is a challenge though because I'm very goal directed. I like to know where we're going. So that I can help us get there.

502
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You've mentioned some things about dynamics with your mother. But then I just heard something today that says you are assertive, so

503
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you, where do you think you need some growth.

504
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.400
Nadine Quintana: I'm

505
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.660
Nadine Quintana: People, I don't know.

506
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's just look at the things we have written down, okay, because we're right we're already 12 minutes over, so

507
01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just going to write a little something for the things we already have written, which is reduced frequency of nightmares. How many nightmares. You have over the last 30 days. Would you say

508
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:07.770
Men.

509
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Me Dean.

510
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.470
I know

511
01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so happy for you.

512
01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can, I can basically from zero times a month to twice a month was the goal. I can put accomplished on this one.

513
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:47.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually done. Okay. And then there's increased assertive communication to perceived authority figures you just gave me. He just gave me one about your boss, you just gave me one, a parent is also an authority figure, even though. Y'all are adult you're an adult child.

514
01:05:52.050 --> 01:06:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you still need work around that or want work around that, because I don't. And the fact that the way you phrase what you were doing with your mom with with your boss. Those are the skills. It's can't, I don't have that to give right

515
01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't work for me right now. I'll touch base with you if if something changes. Those are though. That's what you need. That's it.

516
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:34.020

Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

518
01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to keep working on it. Otherwise, I can close this one out. What do you want to do. How are you, how do you assess your assertive communication with perceived authority figures.

519
01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.870
Nadine Quintana: I mean, I think.

520
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:52.980
Nadine Quintana: I was gonna say, close it out.

521
01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.310
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, like I kind of want to stay working on it.

522
01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.160
Nadine Quintana: You know, just to

523
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.900
Nadine Quintana: Because it's happened a few times for

524
01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be about duration. It might be about. For some people, they'll say, Oh, I know how to do it, it's, I don't want to be as distressed while I'm doing it. I don't want to feel like I'm about URL up

525
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Or have my heart feels like I can see it like a cartoon coming out of my chest or about to cry or

526
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So for some people it's I got the skill. Now I want to be emotionally regulated while I'm doing it for some people it's like now I wanted to

527
01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Really roll off the tongue and not spend the next 10 minutes feeling guilty about it or something like it's different for everyone. How do you think you would measure yourself.

528
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: As having

529
01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.110
It.

530
01:07:50.340 --> 01:08:01.920
Nadine Quintana: as I can. I'm just because my boss is real easy. But like you said, like when I was doing that with my mom, I could feel myself like it tensed up

531
01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:09.810
Nadine Quintana: When I when I did that, even though I did it. And I follow through with it. I still felt really tense and I felt like

532
01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:11.730
Nadine Quintana: Like

533
01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:18.360
Nadine Quintana: I don't know, like I just want to kind of run but I stayed there, you know, and

534
01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:27.120
Nadine Quintana: So, I mean, maybe that's something I could work on, you know, like I have been there. Maybe it's just, yeah.

535
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: How about next time, kinda like this. I like this timing. There's no distractions, you're in the house. If we could take this right here.

Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think and you won't know until you meet me next time. But I'd like to invite right up front. Hey Dean. Let's take this, I felt like I wanted to run when I was being assertive with my mom and then can I do an experiential exercise with you around that.

Gwenevere Abriel: It won't be CVT where we're just talking like this will be doing different kinds of activities.

542
01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I am making a decision out of fear, it's automatic. I don't even know what's going on. Do you know when you are making a decision and really understand when you are trusting your intuition, you understand it.
