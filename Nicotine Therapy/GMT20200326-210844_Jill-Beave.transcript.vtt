Sobriety Rocks18: I got talked into doing walleye fishing.

11
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.340
Sobriety Rocks18: And it was a horrible idea.

12
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.080
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Why

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.210
Sobriety Rocks18: Yeah, this is closer, I don't have a hope.

18
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.930
Okay.

19
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.610
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I used to live in Ohio. We used to go to put me all the time.

20
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.580
Sobriety Rocks18: That's a fun place to go. I've gotten in trouble. There are a couple times and

21
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I did it when I was younger.

22
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.010
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I don't go. I mean so much now, but yeah, when we were

23
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.700
Sobriety Rocks18: Younger we wait

24
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.120
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Let me

25
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.010
Sobriety Rocks18: Find your Why, Arizona.

26
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.740
Jill Beavers-Kirby: got tired of the cold and the snow.

27
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.660
Sobriety Rocks18: Yeah.

28
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:23.100
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, we moved out here and June, but I spent all of my life there and Columbus, Ohio, so so licensed in Ohio. But here I am now.

29
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.660
Sobriety Rocks18: Transferred over there's on their job to get a little

30
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.300
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I had to get a new license out here, but

31
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.940
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It's just a matter once you're licensed. You just paid the state board meta money when you know

32
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, once they get their money they're they're happy, so

33
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.290
Sobriety Rocks18: That's usually how a lot of places.

34
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yes, they are. So, um, tell me about yourself, what brought you to bright heart health.

35
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:08.430
Sobriety Rocks18: Um, I had met a couple people that are going through you guys and I had been on Suboxone program before through Langham Medical Center.

36
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.340
Sobriety Rocks18: helped me stay clean for about three and a half years and I you know I thought I could

37
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.130
Sobriety Rocks18: Do it without it. And it kind of backfired on me.

38
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.730
Sobriety Rocks18: Sorry. Okay. Yeah, it's raining now so

39
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.800
Sobriety Rocks18: On top of everything else. It's

40
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.360
Sobriety Rocks18: Up.

41
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.970
Sobriety Rocks18: There we go.

42
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.690
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So when was last time you took Suboxone

43
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.640
Uh,

44
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.370
Sobriety Rocks18: I mean I periodically took a

45
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.900
Sobriety Rocks18: Couple years

46
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.030
Have you been prescribe Suboxone

47
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.610
Sobriety Rocks18: Okay.

48
00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.690
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then when you decided you didn't want to do it anymore to just quit. Suddenly, or what happened.

49
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.740
Sobriety Rocks18: Yeah, I just couldn't get it and I, man. I ended up

50
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.110
Sobriety Rocks18: toughing it out for about three weeks.

51
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.180
Sobriety Rocks18: And

52
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.210
Sobriety Rocks18: You know, I was good for a while and then just recently.

53
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:33.090
Sobriety Rocks18: started slipping up again. So I decided it was time to get back on it, I was buying them off the street and you know I knew I could get back on them somewhere. Yeah, without doing that.

54
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.150
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, um,

55
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.510
Jill Beavers-Kirby: What, what was your drug of choice.

56
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.200
Sobriety Rocks18: Um, well, it started this time. It started off with pills and then start dabbling into heroin so

57
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.070
Sobriety Rocks18: But before it was the same thing.

58
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.250
Sobriety Rocks18: Was on heroin for a while.

59
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Wasn't like OxyContin Percocet, sir.

60
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.400

Sobriety Rocks18: I just lost my job on Friday Thursday. Excellent.

65
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.920
Jill Beavers-Kirby: What kind of work, were you doing

66
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.020
Sobriety Rocks18: Working at 2020 molding, Brian.

67
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.290
Sobriety Rocks18: Plastic injection molding.

68
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.430
Sobriety Rocks18: Maintenance tech

69
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.610
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Did they lay you off, or what happened.

70
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:51.510
Sobriety Rocks18: I spent three months, four months working my way into the maintenance position and then with everything going on. They tried to move back to just an operator to pay me $6 less and

71
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.260
Sobriety Rocks18: I wasn't gonna take it because it took it takes me two and a half hours to drive every day so

72
00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.880
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Oh my goodness.

73
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.270
Sobriety Rocks18: wasn't worth it.

74
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.260

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.350
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Do you have a job lined up.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.540
Sobriety Rocks18: Or anything. I'm on

77
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.720
Sobriety Rocks18: I'm currently on indeed a monster. And I found front employment, so

78
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.780
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah.

79
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.230

Sobriety Rocks18: Right. Yeah. So it's either. I mean, I haven't been getting much response on jobs, but I'm hoping

81
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.790
Sobriety Rocks18: It's only been a couple days so

82
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.300

83
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.290
Yeah.

84
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.210
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That'd be cool, because a lot of times those people get free

85
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Free

86
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.570

90
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.360
Sobriety Rocks18: It's 1200 dollars a month in rent, but

91
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.930
Sobriety Rocks18: Most of it gets covered

92
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay.

93
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.790

Sobriety Rocks18: They they're her kids.

99
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.370
Sobriety Rocks18: We've been together for about a year and a half.

100
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So you're who they know

101
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.810
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah. That's awesome. Wow. Twins.

102
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.230
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I think for

103
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.670
Sobriety Rocks18: Her um, they're not identical

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.510
Sobriety Rocks18: I know, yeah.

105
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.810
Sobriety Rocks18: So I'm assuming that paternal yeah

106
00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:04.290
Jill Beavers-Kirby: One of my friends. She's a twin, and she, her brother is a twin. So it's a boy and a girl and she said, people would ask her if they were identical twins.

107
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.970
Sobriety Rocks18: Right.

108
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: A boy and a girl.

109
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.960
Sobriety Rocks18: I mean, some people don't know that, though, I

110
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.470
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Guess.

111
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.430
Sobriety Rocks18: But yeah, she said.

112
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.090
Jill Beavers-Kirby: People would ask him this all the time and I was like okay so

113
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.330
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So how is the mommy area dealing with the coronavirus

114
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:31.980

115
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.960
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Well that's nice. Yeah.

116
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.850
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'm surprised even out

117
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.560
Sobriety Rocks18: See the line of them out there.

118
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.910
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That's the Department of Natural Resources.

119
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.280
Sobriety Rocks18: No, that's guys fishing.

120
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.230
Sobriety Rocks18: Their office or on the other side.

121
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.050
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Oh, okay. No, that's nice.

122
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.120
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I've noticed it.

123
00:08:51.300 --> 00:09:02.730
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Even here, people are doing a really good job of staying keeping up a distance from each other. So that's, I like that. I'm glad that people are listening. I think Ohio's doing a little more than what

124
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.380
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Arizona is as far as steps, you know,

125
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:17.370

126
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.540
Sobriety Rocks18: I gotta go stand on the spot by myself. I will

127
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.750
Sobriety Rocks18: Oh, goodness. Okay.

128
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:34.140
Jill Beavers-Kirby: If you got to get the wall. I gotta get the wall life. So, um, so do you take any other medications anything prescribed

129
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.660
Sobriety Rocks18: I'm not as of yet.

130
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:47.880
Sobriety Rocks18: I'm currently seeing a psychologist or a psychiatrist. I'm trying to get put back on do Adderall. I was on it when I was younger and

131
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.030
Sobriety Rocks18: It's a process. So I don't know how that's going to go

132
00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.390
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Did they tell you, you are a DD or ADHD as a young

133
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.750
Sobriety Rocks18: Baby ADHD. I got a

134
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:14.940
Sobriety Rocks18: Actually had a phone interview with them this morning but it got pushed out for the psychiatrist till next Tuesday.

135
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.430
Sobriety Rocks18: I don't know. Yeah.

136
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Did you do well when you are on the Adderall in school.

137
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.010
Sobriety Rocks18: Yeah, yeah, it's actually what helped me get through it. If not, I was gonna fail.

138
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.510
Sobriety Rocks18: And I was on it for

139
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.450
Sobriety Rocks18: A couple years.

140
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.770
Sobriety Rocks18: My parents were handling it when I was younger.

141
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.100
Sobriety Rocks18: And then when I went out on my own. I didn't have

142
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.350
Sobriety Rocks18: Insurance and I you know I just oblivious to that. So I ended up

143
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.590
Sobriety Rocks18: Just being off of it and not having it.

144
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.090
Sobriety Rocks18: And then it's just like I've been in trouble.

145
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:04.590
Sobriety Rocks18: lost jobs, you know, I just, you know, I noticed that everything is a mess right now.

146
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.760
Sobriety Rocks18: Continuously gotten worse.

147
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.620
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Do you drink coffee or caffeine or anything.

148
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.660
Sobriety Rocks18: I do in the morning.

149
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:22.530
Sobriety Rocks18: One cup and I do drink energy drinks but I usually limit to that one a day.

150
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.580
Sobriety Rocks18: And it doesn't really do too much though, doesn't it. Okay. I was just wondering

151
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.400
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Do you take any supplements anything over the counter like vitamins or

152
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.270

Sobriety Rocks18: I did on my knee on my left knee. I have my tenants tie back together.

159
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.490
Jill Beavers-Kirby: How does the rupture your tenants.

160
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.030
Sobriety Rocks18: Work had a mental block for

161

Jill Beavers-Kirby: Oh my gosh.

162
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.740
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That just makes me her thinking about

163
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.540
Sobriety Rocks18: wasn't pretty.

164
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.350
Jill Beavers-Kirby: much did it cost any permanent damage. Are they able to fix it.

165
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.600
Sobriety Rocks18: Or they fix it. I mean, it hurts. Every now and then, if I'm doing something that's

166
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:28.920
Sobriety Rocks18: An activity like I played hockey. A couple I played when I was younger. But when I just recently tried playing hurt me for a while.

167

170
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:51.840
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, maybe when you get older, you might get a little arthritis and and i would i would think probably be something to just keep an eye out for. But I mean, you're out fishing so

171
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:53.370
Sobriety Rocks18: Good for you.

172
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.210

193
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.940
Sobriety Rocks18: We've gotten closer over the last year.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.370
Sobriety Rocks18: Older younger, younger. Okay.

195
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:17.280
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um,

196
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.730
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Did you say you had a friend who does she goes through bite her health

197
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.050
Yeah.

198
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:32.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So has your friend told you about how they do the group, group meetings and stuff.

199
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.200
Sobriety Rocks18: They mentioned yeah okay once a week, I think, or

200
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:56.160
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah they do group meetings, which is, um, something that I find unique and i like it i with bright heart health. This is my second week, but I've been a nurse practitioner for 15 years and I've been seeing patients with addiction issues for the past three years.

201
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:12.420
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And this is bright heart health is the first company I've seen that does the group meetings and it's really I seen a couple of them. And, you know, been in a couple, but it's really nice because you're in there with other people who are going through the same thing as you

202
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.060
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You're also I'll be in the meeting. And we also have a therapist in the meeting.

203
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.890
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But it's nice because you get to hear what other people have done.

204
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:34.110
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, to get through something or how they manage something just kind of, you know, I learned something. Every time I sit in one of these group meetings I just find it really

205
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.360
Sobriety Rocks18: I go to a place

206
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.230
Sobriety Rocks18: Racing for recovery.

207
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.250
Okay.

208
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.760
Sobriety Rocks18: It's by where I live, and I go to their meetings they do live meetings as well.

209
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.310
Jill Beavers-Kirby: How often do you go there.

210
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.330
Sobriety Rocks18: A pride twice a week. Good.

211
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.720
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And if you go there, or is it via the phone or how do you manage that.

212
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:16.890
Sobriety Rocks18: I go there sometimes Mondays and Thursdays Thursday's of their live feed meetings, but now that they shut down, they're gonna do more than that because they can't have everybody in the same room. Okay.

213
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.210
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So do you like the group meeting. Yeah, find it useful.

214
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:27.720
Sobriety Rocks18: I've been. I've been in and out of there for about a year now. Okay.

215
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.310
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So when is the last time you did any heroin.

216
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.240
Sobriety Rocks18: It's been two days.

217
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:41.040
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, how are you managing to get through. Are you taking Suboxone off the street or something or

218
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:55.860
Sobriety Rocks18: I had the head gotten one. And I took that about three hours ago. I wanted to wait there's close to 48 hours as I could. Okay.

219
00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.130
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Was it a pill or a film.

220
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.050
Sobriety Rocks18: A film. All right.

221
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Does your girlfriend do any drugs.

222
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.860
No.

223
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.160
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And she's pretty supportive in this process.

224
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:15.510
Sobriety Rocks18: Yeah, yeah, she's been there for the last year, so that's awesome.

225
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.860
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know you can never have too much support, I think, right. So the way we start Suboxone is

226
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.260
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Is we want you to be in withdrawal.

227
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:38.040
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, so I want you to feel bad. Not, not a little withdrawal. I want you to be on a throne and you're going to take a half of the film and let it dissolve.

228
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:58.770
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And it it'll take a few minutes before you start feeling anything. Um, but then in about four hours on should have kind of you know just how am I feeling. Am I still feeling bad. Am I feeling great. Am I feeling. Okay. Could I am I still having some symptoms, just kind of

229
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:05.430
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, go through all that if you're still feeling bad, and still having symptoms, just go ahead and take the other half of the film.

230
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:16.530
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. And the same thing you know you're going to see how you're feeling and a few hours. If you're still feeling not the best like yeah I could use a little more. You go ahead and take

231
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.850
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Another half a film.

232
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.810
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay.

233
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:33.420
Jill Beavers-Kirby: This will this will be sent to you, also by one of the care coordinators, they'll send you this in a written down forms. But what what we're trying to do is figure out what dose is going to work best for you and

234
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.670
Sobriety Rocks18: Everybody know where I was at

235
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.800
Sobriety Rocks18: For them three and a half years was

236
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.570
Sobriety Rocks18: Nothing.

237
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:48.750
Sobriety Rocks18: To 12 milligrams a day for I was on that. Well, they started me out on 90

238
00:18:49.950 --> 00:19:04.500
Sobriety Rocks18: And I was on that for three months. And I was three a day and then they dragged me down to two and a half for two months and then they put me on 60 and I was on NAP for just under three years.

239
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.890
Sobriety Rocks18: That's where

240
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:17.910
Sobriety Rocks18: Mentally, that's where I had been at your knowledge. I mean, that worked pretty good for me. I don't know. I know that on the higher end

241
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.500
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But so

242
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:24.960
Jill Beavers-Kirby: When you're saying 60 you mean 60 you would get a prescription for 60 films.

243
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.730
Sobriety Rocks18: Or 90 films. Yeah.

244
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.090
Sobriety Rocks18: Got it.

245
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.500
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, um, you know, that's okay. If that's what it takes for you.

246
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.640
Sobriety Rocks18: And that's what it takes for

247
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.630
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You all right.

248
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.520
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And we're gonna figure that out.

249
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:42.300
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So, you know, you've you've changed you've gotten a little bit older, your body might be metabolized things a little different.

250
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:49.140
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So, but I will. I'll give you you know enough film to get this figured out. Okay.

251
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.620
Okay.

252
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.600
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Did you ever take any Clonidine when you were on Suboxone

253
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.280
Sobriety Rocks18: I don't know if I did or not.

254
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.050
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So Claudia day

255
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:01.770
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So,

256
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.450
Sobriety Rocks18: I'm like bro

257
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:15.180
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Some people feel nervous or anxious inside or feel like they just have this pent up energy inside after coming off a heroin.

258
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:23.160
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So sometimes we can give you a little bit of Clonidine if you're feeling like that I'm

259
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.230
Sobriety Rocks18: Not sure what it is.

260
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:34.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. It doesn't say it doesn't sound like you've gone through that. But if you notice that you are feeling just nervous it Clonidine is originally a blood pressure pill.

261
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:44.010
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That's how it was originally, but we've also found that it helps to calm you down a little bit on the insides, you don't feel like you're

262
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.280
Sobriety Rocks18: Racing. I don't think I was okay.

263
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.900
Sobriety Rocks18: All right, good.

264
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.290
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Did you have any problems with constipation. The last time you were on Suboxone

265
00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.230
Sobriety Rocks18: No, not really. Okay.

266
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:04.200
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Because it is, you know, the paper morphine is a pain medicine so it can

267
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:11.700
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Make you constipated. So just make sure you're drinking enough water eating enough fruits with fiber in fresh

268
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:20.130
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Or Gertz French festivals, that kind of thing, obviously, if it gets to be a problem, contact me and we can you know some other ideas to fix that. I don't want you getting

269
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:31.950
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Loaded and feeling bad, because you're constipated. Um, what other problems did you have with Suboxone before other than when you decided to stop them.

270
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.160
Sobriety Rocks18: No one really okay

271
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.450
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The way that

272
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.790
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I've got your keep looking over here because I've got your chart pulled up over here. So I'm just kind of looking

273
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:53.970
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The way that I like to work with patients when it comes to that time that we're gonna get rid of Suboxone is I like to do a slow withdrawal or a taper or Wayne, whatever you want to

274
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.480
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Call it

275
00:21:55.170 --> 00:22:12.330
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, but cold turkey doesn't work. I find so when we get to that point, you and I will do that together. I don't have a cookbook recipe book or any rules that say you have to do this. You have to do that you have to do this, it's going to be something that you and I will do together so that

276
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.270
Jill Beavers-Kirby: We can manage how you're feeling how you're doing.

277
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.590
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And, you know, it'll be individualized to how you're feeling

278
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.050
Okay, so

279
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:31.740
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Keep me posted to about how things are going with the psychiatrist and the Adderall, because that will also play into how we

280
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:36.870
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, manage the Suboxone and how that all works together. OK.

281
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.710
OK.

282
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.540
Sobriety Rocks18: I will do

283
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:41.670
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um,

284
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:55.170
Sobriety Rocks18: I know through my insurance, though. One of the main issues I had was, as it has to be generic form. Okay. Good enough for in and relax and

285
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.590
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, thank you. I'm writing that down. So don't forget

286
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.370
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Every, every insurance is different.

287
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.270
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And it's funny how some insurances won't take the generic and some insurances that's all they'll take so I don't get it.

288
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:09.960
Right.

289
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.990
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I just do what they tell me to do.

290
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:28.440
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So I run that in. Let me look real quick and make sure I have your correct pharmacy in here before I send it. Like I said, you'll get a written instruction about how to start this to figure out the dose.

291
