00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.639
Gwenevere Abriel: Michelle of Sarah 9am

2
00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.279
Gwenevere Abriel: Michelle.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.710
Michelle Lucero: Hey, can you hear me.

4
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.630
Michelle Lucero: Uh huh. Okay, good.

5
00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So once you let me know what what's kind of getting a little chaotic over there. Your life.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.160
Michelle Lucero: Um, I have no idea. I'm just super tired all the time. I can't wake up my alarm goes off and

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:44.400
Michelle Lucero: I just don't want to get up I wait literally till the last minute, and I've been doing this for the past couple of weeks to where I'm like barely getting into work at the right time and barely doing things I have to do.

8
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.170
Michelle Lucero: Hmm, at the right time. I just, I don't know.

9
00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't sound anything like what what was happening before you were feeling optimistic. There was a real turn a positive turn that was happening, what's what's going on at work, how have dynamics changed. Maybe were just tell me how maybe it's changed.

10
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.570
Michelle Lucero: There's a lot of drama going on at work. It has nothing to do with me. But of course, I hear all day long.

11
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:31.170
Michelle Lucero: And I just keep to myself and don't like if they start telling me about drama about other people. I'll just walk away, or just pretend night in the room. I just don't want to get caught up in the drama.

12
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.230
Michelle Lucero: And even my managers, like, oh yeah, there's a lot of drama going on here, just

13
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.310
Michelle Lucero: Tell them. It's none of your business. Literally. So that's what I've been doing

14
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.440
Michelle Lucero: I'm trying to

15
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.760
Michelle Lucero: Think

16
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that that is basically affecting whether you want to go in or not.

17
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.160
Michelle Lucero: Maybe I mean it doesn't bother me because it doesn't have to do with me. The people that have been here forever, but

18
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.780
Michelle Lucero: Like during the day. I love being here because my day goes by so fast and my mind is

19
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.950
Michelle Lucero: At work, and I don't have time to think about other stresses like Anthony or

20
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.280
Michelle Lucero: Dealing with any of that family drama.

21
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Last, last week was like

22
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: A mess like we didn't see you something about a P. O. I'm staying overnight over here like it got this one.

23
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.910
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I had a horrible week

24
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:55.770
Michelle Lucero: I didn't have meds and then Thursday night Thursday was my worst day I was off Thursday and Friday, and I knew I got paid Friday. That was just sitting at top of my mind.

25
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:13.080
Michelle Lucero: And tell me, and called me. She switched her schedule. So now she worked 5225 in the morning to two in the afternoon. So she had called me like it too, and I had been sleeping all day and she called me and she's like, Oh, let's go pick up the kids because our kids go to the same school

26
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.390
Michelle Lucero: And I told her I don't feel like going anywhere. Doing anything. And she just said, okay, but then she showed up at the house.

27
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:33.750
Michelle Lucero: And she was like, and in the shower, get ready, let's go. You're not gonna sit at home all day, you're not feeling good and I don't want you here just feeling depressed by yourself. Okay.

28
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's back up though. So this Monday was the 10th, but it all started falling apart like last Monday, like the third right

29
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.260
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

30
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So what, why, Miss group and why Miss individual therapy and

31
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You were communicating with me. BUT THEN YOU WEREN'T YOU WEREN'T sticking with the plan what happened.

32
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.470
Michelle Lucero: No, I just, I'm tired. Okay.

33
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:24.480
Michelle Lucero: I've, I've felt this tired before but it's like I could just leave for ever. I go home like last night I work till 830 I went home. I didn't even eat. I went straight to sleep like I'm just exhausted. I feel so tired all the time.

34
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.800
Michelle Lucero: No matter and I got good sleep last night I went to sleep at like nine and a bit six this morning.

35
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

36
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:49.560
Michelle Lucero: I just feel so tired like I didn't even get in the shower, I woke up at six. I didn't get in the shower till eight like just last minute.

37
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.250
Michelle Lucero: I don't know. I'm usually excited to get up and get ready and put on makeup into my hair and

38
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.770
Michelle Lucero: I just don't even feel that

39
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:10.080
Michelle Lucero: I at least shower today. I haven't showered for the past two days. I just know my hair up in a ponytail and wash my face and

40
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.060
Michelle Lucero: Go to work.

41
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.640
Michelle Lucero: I don't know what it is.

42
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're you're saying don't think it's connected to what's going on at work. You don't think it's there.

43
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.100
Michelle Lucero: I mean, I don't think so, because it even happens on my days off when I'm not at work.

44
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.450
Okay.

45
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.450
Well I don't either.

46
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And no change in medication.

47
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.180
Michelle Lucero: No.

48
00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:00.900
Michelle Lucero: I haven't been needing anything to fall asleep. Like I fall asleep, without the game planning right

49
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And the dynamics between you and Anthony

50
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.610
Michelle Lucero: It's still the same. I mean, we don't want

51
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:25.350
Michelle Lucero: We don't buy as much now that I'm working. I noticed, but I'm not around or him to fight with. And while I'm at work.

52
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.180
Michelle Lucero: He's at work. So we don't really talk during the day, unless like it's almost three, and he has to

53
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.120
Michelle Lucero: Or I call him this if he's going to be home when is Devon gets there or

54
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.870
Michelle Lucero: That's the only time we really talked, and then when I get home. I just go straight to my room.

55
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we were due for a review of your goals. I think this might help us kind of see

56
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Where areas that we need to keep focusing on

57
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We discussed in January life satisfaction, you were saying that day you were at about a six from zero to 10 you had gone to an interview. I was so uncomfortable didn't let other people ruin my interview I did my best.

58
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I was nervous and you've been proud of yourself and you were concerned about a rejection due to a background check.

59
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.410
You've got

60
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to this particular goal feel fulfilled.

61
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got a written three times with different objectives, one of them as journaling once a day are you journaling at all.

62
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of them is identify areas of pleasurable activities that you think will bring more satisfaction. So did you think that this job was going to make you happy.

63
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.410
Michelle Lucero: Um,

64
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.800
Michelle Lucero: I think I thought it was gonna make my life easier.

65
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you saving money.

66
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.210
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I still have money saved.

67
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.140
Michelle Lucero: Up it

68
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:47.040
Michelle Lucero: Really I had 125 saved and I just saved on hundred more. But I don't have money. So I might put more back into VC.

69
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you said on that card, you have to 25

70
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.190
Yes.

71
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and I'm

72
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Is is is the reason that you're keeping some of it out because you have an open door to possibly getting pills. Now what you're doing.

73
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:17.460
Michelle Lucero: It's for like cigarettes and gas and Red Bulls and lunch and coffee just stuff like that.

74
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How much is it How much is left out.

75
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:27.060
Michelle Lucero: Now I have about I think it's like under 100 it's like 90 something

76
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you concerned, having not around right now. Does it seem like this is a vulnerable time for you.

77
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.800
Michelle Lucero: Know, I don't have like cash. It's in my card.

78
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:46.230
Michelle Lucero: But no, I don't feel. I haven't felt like I want to escape. Like I had

79
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:56.310
Michelle Lucero: On Thursday, I really did feel like that and just being around Tommy like totally made me forget

80
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:05.580
Michelle Lucero: And she totally helped me Friday. But I mean this past week. I know it's only Wednesday, but I haven't felt

81
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.760
Michelle Lucero: Like using or

82
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything but you did as recent as last Thursday. That's pretty recent.

83
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.220
Yeah.

84
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:30.870
Michelle Lucero: I didn't feel like using anything other than the box. Then, but I knew if I couldn't find the box them with the next would be, but

85
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so some of the pieces are coming to me, it's hard for you to remember. Everybody's story, but it was, Oh, I'm not going to make it at seven in the morning last Tuesday I have to go to my PO

86
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm like, Okay, what will I get I'm gonna see you the next day on on Wednesday, and then you weren't there for that either. And then you see what I'm saying, like, it was starting to crumble really early.

87
00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and, and there was no kind of communication about why and I got very concerned that you were disappearing into the woodwork here and doing what you do, which is he started to withdraw. We don't hear from you for a while and then you've got a good excuse to just look

88
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.750
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, but I mean I kept in contact with you.

89
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.780
Michelle Lucero: I wasn't trying to like just not

90
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened.

91
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.850
Going

92
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened to, oh, I'm gonna go at seven instead of going to grow. What happened last Tuesday morning. Were you sleeping, is that the reality of it.

93
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.350
Michelle Lucero: I wasn't sleeping. I was at home just not doing anything.

94
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.570
Michelle Lucero: just tired.

95
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you said out loud was, I'm going to go to the lab at seven. But do you know that right

96
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.070
Michelle Lucero: That was my. That was my whole intention. That was my intention. I just didn't do it.

97
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but notice how oh well Thursday. Well, hey, I didn't have my medicine you set yourself up. You're setting it up.

98
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We gotta take really close attention to this. I'm tired.

99
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it may seem like, Oh, well, everybody gets tired, but they're everything else is seems to be connected to it you, in a sense, made a promise to your program.

100
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And didn't keep it now, you're out of medication, there's a disconnect with getting support. Now you don't have saying like, it's all connected to this if we can't get

101
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

102
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:35.040
Michelle Lucero: I think I'm just feeling this way because I keep letting myself down and not only myself. Other people

103
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.690
Michelle Lucero: Well,

104
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: starting Tuesday. We're starting before that. How are you letting people down. I'm not seeing it.

105
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.560
Michelle Lucero: Just not keeping my word not doing what I know I'm supposed to be doing, and just

106
00:12:52.470 --> 00:13:00.900
Michelle Lucero: being lazy. That's what it comes down to. I mean, yeah, I'm tired, but I could push myself to do things, and I don't

107
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me all the medication you're on. I already know this, Fox on, but what else

108
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.850
Michelle Lucero: Just quantity, nothing.

109
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.430
Michelle Lucero: But I haven't even been taking notes.

110
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And and and not the not the Wellbutrin

111
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.910
Michelle Lucero: I haven't gotten a prescription for that.

112
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm curious, are you wanted the people that's like, yes, I do want to cut back on the smoking.

113
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.280
Michelle Lucero: I am

114
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that it's an anti depressant. That will be your turn.

115
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.630
Michelle Lucero: I did it.

116
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It could you do it two things.

117
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:40.650
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

118
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:48.990
Michelle Lucero: You know what I mean. I don't know if I don't think I got in a prescription for it. I mean, Walgreens hasn't said anything.

119
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.650
Michelle Lucero: I don't know. So pay for it.

120
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I would think so.

121
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.790
Michelle Lucero: I don't think so. Yeah.

122
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you tell her. Hey, I want I want a prescription because she would have heard that around the smoking cessation.

123
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:12.240
Michelle Lucero: Did you told me she asked me, and I told her yes but she never mentioned anything about the prescription

124
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and just this week.

125
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.020
Michelle Lucero: And

126
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I had heard, and I know this from years of listening to clients that the, the, it sounds a lot like buprenorphine. It's Bupropion sounds almost exactly the same but it's will be a trend is the brand name.

127
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, I've been hearing really good things about it for people, they're like, well, I, I was smoking a whole pack and now I only smoked, you know, 10 cigarettes nine

128
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm concerned about that sleep because you know it's one thing to say lazy, but my guess is there is

129
00:14:53.670 --> 00:15:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you do you get excited about about stuff you'd like to do the makeup. You like to get ready and go in. But if it's just going to be a bunch of gossip and you all you have to do is hide. I don't see that that's very rewarding.

130
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.320
That's true.

131
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't ever get to be Michelle and what here we are again, we're at this point where, where does Michelle get to express yourself how fulfilling is that

132
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Nobody wants to look forward to those kind of days. Yeah. If you are coming to me and saying, oh, this is just temporary I want to, you know, I want to gather you know a couple, couple thousand dollars in savings and then I'm going to go do school

133
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That could be exciting. Again, if you put that back on the horizon that could be kind of like this is temporary for you could kind of get your mind wrapped around that if you wanted to. But maybe you're not in that mindset. What, what goes on when you lay in bed.

134
00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.570
Michelle Lucero: Oh god, everything goes my head when he lay in bed, let me

135
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me hear how how how cookie. It gets

136
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:17.700
Michelle Lucero: I think about a lot about paying bills to keep Anthony quiet but he doesn't have a reason to bitch. I even helped him pay the rent and our deal was

137
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:29.010
Michelle Lucero: He was going to pay the rent and I pay all built. Okay. I mean, the rents more than all bills put together because now, none of us are ever home all day. So our bills are really low.

138
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:43.260
Michelle Lucero: So I was like, Yeah, that's a great deal, because I don't have to be as mentioned, he does, but yet he makes a lot more money than I do. So I'm I've been worrying about bills. I've been thinking about

139
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.100
Michelle Lucero: I don't know how to put it like

140
00:16:48.990 --> 00:17:02.820
Michelle Lucero: In my head. It's like a fantasy of my goodness on those. But I think a lot about when I'm not home like when I get my own place. And I think a lot about that. Well,

141
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Why is that crazy. That sounds actually exciting. That's not a fun thought

142
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.880
Michelle Lucero: I mean, maybe it is, I love thinking about it and like thinking

143
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:21.420
Michelle Lucero: Oh, I can go to savers in goodwill and by these really cute furniture and definitely the walls and like

144
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:27.150
Michelle Lucero: I just, I don't like thinking about being there is the only thing

145
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Being at the house with Anthony

146
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

147
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you see that it's all connected. When you get your tissue out of bed when you do your makeup when you take your shower when you get into work. That means that you show up on time. On Tuesday, then you get your medication, then it doesn't get thrown off.

148
00:17:47.640 --> 00:18:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all connected and why that's that's that's the carrot in front of you. You could have your own place. You can look at working at Goodwill, where people aren't is playful is maybe they used to be in. It used to be a pleasant thing it's temporary

149
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Some jobs are temporary there just to get an income going

150
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you go to the next place.

151
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that you're thinking about how cute you make the apartment and how how comfortable. Remember how comfortable. It's going to be for you and Stefan right being able to get up and eat walk play just do whatever you want to do. That's exciting.

152
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're doing a really big piece of that you weren't doing this before you didn't have a job and thank goodness for this probation, because I think that's what pushed you

153
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.110
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, totally done

154
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:54.210
Michelle Lucero: So I don't know if I told you, but my boss Ernie and my probation officer our best friend, literally.

155
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.590
Michelle Lucero: They used to be seals together at the county jail.

156
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:10.260
Michelle Lucero: And I didn't know that. But my boss asked me on Wednesday. Who's your probation officer and I told him audio and he's told me, tell him I'm your boss.

157
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:21.600
Michelle Lucero: So I went in Friday and told him or nice sterile told me to tell you he's my manager. And he was like, Oh really, and like they were they both told me stories but

158
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.830
Michelle Lucero: My heels been coming in my probation officer has been man like every day.

159
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.960
Michelle Lucero: To have lunch with my boss and so uncomfortable.

160
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:40.260
Michelle Lucero: I don't know what that had to do with anything. I just wanted to tell you that it's

161
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.540
Michelle Lucero: How small, the world is

162
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is small boys at the truth and your and you said it's uncomfortable.

163
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.830
It's so uncomfortable.

164
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.260
Michelle Lucero: Oh my god.

165
00:19:53.670 --> 00:20:07.080
Michelle Lucero: I mean, he doesn't bother me. He'll talk to me and say hi, how's your day or he doesn't do anything like a probation officer. He, he just act like a normal person, but it's still so nerve wracking when he's there.

166
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So as I'm talking about this job is temporary.

167
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's you're getting RIGHT YOU'RE REBUILDING THIS resume YOU'RE REBUILDING, you know, sort of your credit

168
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that seems like that's not true.

169
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:31.800
Michelle Lucero: No way. I feel it is true because I I don't see myself here a long, long time. Like, I don't like

170
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:48.300
Michelle Lucero: Having to find a job. So I'll stay with the same job for years and years and years. I'm not one of those people that like work for three months and then find another job, but I do see myself staying here until I at least pay restitution.

171
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.120
Michelle Lucero: And then that way.

172
00:20:53.340 --> 00:21:02.130
Michelle Lucero: I have that conditional discharge to where if I paid restitution in 18 months that the charges were going to be

173
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.380
Michelle Lucero: I can't remember the word

174
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.460
Michelle Lucero: The charges were going to be not there.

175
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:21.540
Michelle Lucero: In other words, anyway. We talked about that on Friday, me and my probation officer any called the DA because we still haven't gotten the jns that shows how much restitution.

176
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:37.290
Michelle Lucero: I have to pay because everything I've paid so far, which is like a lot of money every month, whether I was working or not. I was still taking them over $100 because Anthony or my dad or my sister were helping me

177
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.450
Michelle Lucero: And

178
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:53.640
Michelle Lucero: I mean, none of that money's gone towards restitution, which makes me really mad because that's why I was giving them so much money, but it's all going towards my probation costs because they don't have a restitution amount

179
00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:03.360
Michelle Lucero: That really bothers me. And he got up my probation officer called the DA in front of me writing instead of like

180
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:17.430
Michelle Lucero: We need her Jay and as because she needs to start paying restitution. She just started working and she needs to have it done in 18 months and with you guys not doing this. She's not able to all her money is going straight to probation costs.

181
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:25.950
Michelle Lucero: So the lady told him call me back next week and we'll see because they still don't have it.

182
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:34.980
Michelle Lucero: They didn't have it for court on the last day, I went to court. They didn't have an amount and all. She told Mario was

183
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.790
Michelle Lucero: They have to see what the insurance paid out because I'm going to have to pay the insurance that

184
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:57.900
Michelle Lucero: That's really bothering me too. I don't know if that's deterring me just, I feel like when I found out that all the money I've given him already which is over $800 has all gone to probation class I was mad.

185
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:05.730
Michelle Lucero: Because, I mean, the whole reason I was giving them so much money was for the restitution.

186
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.200
Michelle Lucero: And now, none of us even gone towards it, not one penny.

187
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, probation has a cost. So it's not going nowhere you

188
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:33.990
Michelle Lucero: Know that is true. I mean, it would be I in my head what I thought because probation once a month is $35 so I thought $35 of whatever I would give him that month would go towards probation and the rest of the goal towards the restitution.

189
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Receipts you know it.

190
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but clearly this P I was taking action on it sounds like they're they're trying to work it out.

191
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:57.720
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, he's he's been a lot cooler now than he was in the beginning, I mean obviously through me and Joe, but he um

192
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:03.510
Michelle Lucero: He's pushing for me to get my own place. And he's like,

193
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.880
Michelle Lucero: He knows, Anthony. He used to be Anthony's probation officer. I don't know if I told you that

194
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:18.870
Michelle Lucero: He, um, he's like, are you still at Anthony's and what are you doing there. He knows that Anthony's

195
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.600
Michelle Lucero: No good for me.

196
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.480
Michelle Lucero: He's like, Have you looked into getting you don't plays. Can you get into housing.

197
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.750
Michelle Lucero: Like he's always asking me those things. He doesn't like me, being that Anthony is and he

198
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:47.730
Michelle Lucero: But I have. I mean, I can't say I have no choice, because I do. I could go to my dad, but it wouldn't make any difference. I'd still be miserable there.

199
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So just keep saving your money. Yeah.

200
00:24:53.340 --> 00:25:06.390
Michelle Lucero: I told him, like I'm saving money. I do plan on getting my own place just me and my kid. Well not Kayla because she's moving. She's gonna be moving to Texas know that she grabbed graduates in June.

201
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But Texas dad or something, I don't know why.

202
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.880
Michelle Lucero: I don't honestly, I have no idea. I think the college who wants to go to other

203
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would prefer that you're out of the car.

204
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's you said, oh, yeah, you don't know your schedule yet. Maybe you do for 13 and whoops. That's this week for

205
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: One. First, you know,

206
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:45.000
Michelle Lucero: Let me log. I'm just gonna go in and look at my schedule. I have the app on my phone.

207
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:47.010
Michelle Lucero: I

208
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Think it would be working out. If you know

209
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: These are good for sort of a casual kind of update but it'd be nice to have you home.

210
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.380
Michelle Lucero: For the

211
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Week of 17 through 21

212
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:22.980
Michelle Lucero: No, it's not on there yet. I could go in and ask them, I think they have a paper copy but it's not on this app yet.

213
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.090
Michelle Lucero: Oh my god. Did I lose you.

214
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Know I'm here. Yeah. Yeah, it'd be good to know the soonest you can tell me so that I can put it in here for next week on a day that you have off.

215
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:41.970
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

216
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.220
Michelle Lucero: That would be better for me because I hate being late.

217
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.310
Michelle Lucero: And then like notice when I do that when I run Lee, it messes up my whole day.

218
00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:03.360
Michelle Lucero: And it's all my fault. I mean, I can't blame anybody. I was up, it's, it's, I could have gotten ready right away. I just kept making excuses in my head.

219
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:04.950
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

220
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: My, my guess is it's just right now you have kind of a negative work environment. There's a negative home environment, there's, you know, you have this dread about all this money that you've spent

221
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got a lot of context, just have some self compassion go in, you got a few minutes go in. Now go look at that you can plug, you know, check in, go look at the schedule text me what it is. And we'll set something up for next week.

222
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:33.390
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

223
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna I'm gonna wait for that.

224
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.390
Michelle Lucero: OK, I will go in right now and do that.

225
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.010
Michelle Lucero: All right.

226
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.400
Michelle Lucero: Okay.

227
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.170
Michelle Lucero: Bye bye.

228
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:46.860
Bye.

229
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: stuff going on.

230
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: engineering officer.

231
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think the nauseous from

232
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.430
Elizabeth Sandoval: Maybe from tapering maybe, I don't know.

233
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if it's something else.

234
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:45.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because you

235
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Have been taking six and a half for two days.

236
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.220
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, probably. Yeah. Since Monday.

237
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.240
Yeah.

238
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.160
Right.

239
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:21.480
Elizabeth Sandoval: I was taking it. The week before that I started with the six he wanted me to do six and then like I tried it for a few days and then, you know, I was like, well, this is kind of too much. So then we I asked you about the 6.5

240
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:32.970
Elizabeth Sandoval: So I felt I felt better than I did with the six we're having like a little bit of sweats and stuff are at night. I've been like

241
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.250
Elizabeth Sandoval: Kind of sticking to this.

242
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:49.530
Elizabeth Sandoval: Okay. So, but, I mean, I, you know, there's other things like my brother. I've been spending a lot of time with him, he's you know he's he's doing good, but he's not doing good, you know,

243
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:52.110
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

244
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get a note open here.

245
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.400
Elizabeth Sandoval: Okay.

246
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.710
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yes, like some stress related things to maybe

247
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so. It's oftentimes it registers in the

248
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: In the stuff

249
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: We've seen this with you.

250
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:12.660
Elizabeth Sandoval: That

251
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Seems to be a real communicator.

252
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You say he's doing well. But he's not. Can you go into that a little more

253
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:37.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well he's he's on hospice at home because nurses come to see him, he's just not he he hasn't been very like, you know, my brothers always gets up gets ready, you know,

254
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:42.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: Lately, he just, you know, and I expected to be sleeping more sluggish.

255
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

256
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:50.790
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just see that it's his health is declining, which I'm realizing that

257
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.980
Elizabeth Sandoval: Right so 13

258
00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess my question has to do with if it's starting to bring up other memories, if it's already starting to look at what if what if it declines rapidly, you know, is what the fear is

259
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:13.200
You know,

260
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:22.770
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, because he's he's he's losing more weight you know yesterday. He looks really like pale and, you know,

261
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:30.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: So yeah, so just the fear of him you know itself.

262
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: I mean, I know people die.

263
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.090

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Your son will

277
00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:14.790

Gwenevere Abriel: Their own child.

284
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I couldn't imagine

285
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You tend to be the one that takes care of people in this in this family system of yours.

286
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.920
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I think I'm going to end up like taking care of everyone.

287
00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How's that going to impact.

288
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.320

289
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:34.470
Elizabeth Sandoval: Center. You know, I know, it might be too hard, but I have to be strong.

290
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.870
Elizabeth Sandoval: A lot of people might count on me for

291
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:46.650
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, give me more more of a push to keep continuing my

292
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.150
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

293
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.740
Elizabeth Sandoval: My paper. And all this is, I would never want to go back

294
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: To any of that other stuff, you know,

295
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:16.260
Elizabeth Sandoval: I feel like a lot of my brother. He was real bad on you know offseason I told you about this before. Before you been bought six oh my back. So like maybe that had a lot to contribute to him being sick, you know, slows down everything in your body.

296
00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.670
Elizabeth Sandoval: He had colon cancer for

297
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.040
Elizabeth Sandoval: But yeah, I think about that, you know,

298
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: So it makes me not even want to

299
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.430
Elizabeth Sandoval: mess around with anything.

300
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What is this done with your plans. You were setting in motion.

302
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:15.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: Um, I have to put that put that aside, you know, but I still like every morning when I do get up. I usually stretch and I do some, you know, some exercises. I'm not saying I exercise for hours, but I take 20 minutes beliefs.

303
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.850
Elizabeth Sandoval: And that helps

304
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.550
Elizabeth Sandoval: Even if I don't get to go physically to class know

305
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:31.350

313
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.800

314
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.950

329
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: What about your kids. I don't think they would handle if she ends up

330
00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.260
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know there, there'd be

331
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.350
Elizabeth Sandoval: No heart.

332
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.860

Gwenevere Abriel: So, what, what's your, what's your biggest concern about what's going on.

339
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.930
Okay.

340
00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I had asked you if the biggest piece was

341
00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To take care of everybody and

342
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.750
I guess.

343
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: that worries me.

344
00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: More time together as well.

345
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.510
Elizabeth Sandoval: Good. My mom. Yeah.

346
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:34.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: You and your mom kinda she's, she's been a little distant to

347
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know her my brother. He just

348
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:45.450
Elizabeth Sandoval: He's, he's been angry with her for, I don't know why, for a long time.

349
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:47.760
Elizabeth Sandoval: But I don't

350
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like he acts like my parents were never there for us, like we had like wonderful parents

351
00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:56.730
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know,

352
00:41:58.410 --> 00:41:59.910
Elizabeth Sandoval: And then I mean

353
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:05.250
Elizabeth Sandoval: So they

354
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:06.510
Elizabeth Sandoval: Buy and

355
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.170
Let's just

356
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just come play

357
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:24.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: Oh, maybe like that he she left him when he was young, which is not true him and see me and my mom when when my brother was a teenager he was racing how

358
00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:30.210
Elizabeth Sandoval: Raising how so it put a lot of strain on my mom and dad's marriage.

359
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:40.680
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, and so me and my mom ended up getting our own little apartment like. And my grandma was older. So my mom always like trying to care of my grandma, you

360
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:50.040
Elizabeth Sandoval: So we kind of move next to her and then just the situation. We just needed to get away from that situation. I guess my mom felt at the time.

361
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.260
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because and my, my dad stayed with my brother.

362
00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:06.870
Elizabeth Sandoval: My house, you know, at our house. Hey, mama got the herbal apartment. So I think he always feels like maybe he she just like left him or something.

363
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.750
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like he likes always those on his face.

364
00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.450
Elizabeth Sandoval: He was she wasn't there for him younger

365
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:29.160
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like going through stuff and but a lot of the stuff he was doing, you know, he's making bad choices hanging out with the wrong crowd and

366
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.500
Elizabeth Sandoval: getting into trouble.

367
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Apparently, when a kid is hanging out with the wrong crowd and getting in trouble.

368
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:48.030
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well obviously they they worry and will say, hey, look, you're making the wrong decisions and, you know, try to correct them.

369
00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:51.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: How did you show me get them on the right path.

370
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.270
How did she tried

371
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.680
Elizabeth Sandoval: She would

372
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:02.070
Elizabeth Sandoval: Tell talk

373
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.980
Elizabeth Sandoval: Is kind of disrespectful.

374
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.440
Elizabeth Sandoval: Said it put a lot of strain on my woman is married with white about it.

375
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: all she did was just talk to them. Is that enough to get a teenager.

376
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.160
To stop probably

377
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What did your dad do to try to get them to stop.

378
00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.500
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just supported and stayed with them.

379
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that kind of where this complaint is

380
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:47.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: You

381
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.920
Elizabeth Sandoval: Go, I went I went on.

382
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.490
Elizabeth Sandoval: With my friends like why they did it.

383
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:00.870
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well,

384
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.200
Elizabeth Sandoval: I think it is just that he was

385
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: So out of control and kind of like she had enough of it.

386
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:18.690
Elizabeth Sandoval: They would come in like break our windows and shoot at our house and like crazy things like that.

387
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: So it's pretty scary.

388
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like you like you had a lot of enemies and stuff.

389
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:34.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: So my mom was like, worried for me, you know, like this is not safe.

390
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Something about the home environment that it was

391
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Up until the shooting in the broken windows that it was acceptable.

392
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: in that neighborhood for some neighborhoods. That's the norm.

393
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.370
Sometimes, yeah.

394
00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:05.610
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, well, you know, like I guess we lived in the neighborhood so long, like all the people around us, us, but it was like people from other neighborhoods coming around, you know,

395
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:12.630
Elizabeth Sandoval: From like other games, you know, because we lived in like this. Well, it's called Ball Park neighborhood.

396
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:21.930
Elizabeth Sandoval: And you know they had at that time, you know, they had like the softball fair crews like different neighborhoods, you know,

397
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:32.490
Elizabeth Sandoval: But yeah, the song. Hello boys were after him and they just disliked him my brother had a nice car good looking guy like there.

398
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

399
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:40.800
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

400
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:45.030
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

401
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If your son was doing the same thing. What would you do

402
00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:58.650
Elizabeth Sandoval: To

403
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.510
Elizabeth Sandoval: Take them to like

404
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know what to do.

405
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.460
Elizabeth Sandoval: I was just

406
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:13.830
Elizabeth Sandoval: Drives me bananas, sometimes you know when you try to take off and go out

407
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:20.910
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'm like, no, not going, I don't care if you want to do these things. You gotta get your own place.

408
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.470
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

409
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder if that for a lot of people. That's called the tough love part where you

410
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Win consequence and you pull away privilege privilege of a car insurance, a place to live. And I wonder if that was missing. If that's what maybe your brother was although we don't know it when we're young.

411
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's what help might have felt like for him. Maybe that's his complaint.

412
00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:55.020
You

413
00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like

414
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Parents know what to do.

415
00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:01.680
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

416
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.770
Elizabeth Sandoval: And they just divided, you know, which is not good. They should have

417
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.760
Elizabeth Sandoval: Came together, but it just like divided them.

418
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:14.250
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

419
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:18.660
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, my brother, me and my mom says my brother.

420
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:26.910
Elizabeth Sandoval: taking forever. I mean, we didn't live far from my mom, my brother, my dad, but probably a few

421
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.240
Elizabeth Sandoval: Blocks of the most you know

422
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.680
Elizabeth Sandoval: What she needed. I just thought systems.

423
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you know don't see your brothers perspective and you only see your mother's perspective or can you see both

424
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.150
Elizabeth Sandoval: I can see both

425
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:58.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: I can see both for him. You know, I would know how I would think, like, you know, maybe my brother deadness something obviously if it's hurting them to this day.

426
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:12.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, but you know that they my, my mom and my brother don't know how to communicate with each other and it always turns into a bad thing and things left unsaid. You know,

427
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:15.480
So,

428
00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:18.150
Elizabeth Sandoval: I think we need to fix that.

429
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.650
Either one of you might

430
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Want

431
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To they want to fix it.

432
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:44.220
Elizabeth Sandoval: I mean i i think my brother. He kind of shy away my know my mom gets sad because she doesn't understand why he's so distant, you know, but I think they need to spend that time and talk about it, you know.

433
00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: I think he would help. I mean both

434
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Will you let me know if there's anything I can do if it sounds, what would be useful as having me there. I'm happy to facilitate that conversation.

435
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe your mom feels safe enough to listen to what her son has to say. So she doesn't end up being stuck with never having been me. Sorry, or I did the best I could, or

436
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And and maybe your brother being able to say

437
00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You did the best she could so that your mother can forgive herself and let go because if there's this stuff and he passes away, I just wonder how much damage that's going to be

438
00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:45.810
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yes. Yeah, I went up to

439
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.500
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, for her. And I always tell you

440
00:50:51.750 --> 00:51:00.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: How much you need to say because you don't want them, you know, what if something happens and you have that insight and you never get to see or even, you know,

441
00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:02.550
Elizabeth Sandoval: Are you

442
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How's your dad handling this

443
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:27.120
Elizabeth Sandoval: He's, he's not handling it well like him and my brother is like my brother can be pretty neat thing.

444
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:33.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: To my dad and my dad is like the kind of guy that I won't put up with like, you know, things like

445
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just like disrespectful, you know,

446
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:48.330
Elizabeth Sandoval: My dad says like trying to help. But I think you don't feel good. So he pays it out like that sometimes

447
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.360
Elizabeth Sandoval: I know

448
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:58.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: My dad's really sad and then really sad because we haven't had the best relationship either

449
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:04.710
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, we've gotten a few arguments also lately so

450
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: Not too good.

451
00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I guess my, my concern is that both of them are going to end up somehow blaming themselves if they don't resolve this all he's alive.

452
00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:19.860
Yeah.

453
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:28.470
Elizabeth Sandoval: Super to talk with them. Maybe we can do something that would be really helpful to have that

454
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:31.500
Elizabeth Sandoval: Brown.

455
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And it you know the way to sort of facilitate that he

456
00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you, brother. I could be on zoom. I can meet him.

457
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can sort of view it as a family therapy intervention.

458
00:52:49.800 --> 00:53:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, because my guess is what's going on with you right now with the gut with what's going on. My guess is that has a lot to do with it. So from my perspective, I like working with families.

459
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Happy to happy to help.

460
00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If it means that you guys can come together more

461
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this that that's going to feel like love that's going to feel like support and that

462
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Something happens. You guys are together coming together around this and not mad at each other and not have that be the last.

463
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Story you your because he just

464
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: He's he doesn't sound like he knows how to say what I said.

465
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I needed tough love. I needed you to kick my ass and maybe stay home and get me out of town, get me over to another state or change my

466
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:47.250
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

467
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't know any better. You know, he

468
00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't maybe have the ability to say that all you can say is you left me.

469
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:55.260
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

470
00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And so he's angry and that's that's a child's solution is is anger, because we don't know how to articulate those deeper sad.

471
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.310
And abandoned feelings.

472
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So no one's wrong. No one's bad, it's just everybody who's doing the best they could, but there's a there's a real crisis going on right now.

473
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.300
Elizabeth Sandoval: You need

474
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.520
Some help

475
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So consider it. Okay.

476
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:27.750
Well,

477
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'll talk to my brother today.

478
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, you know, talk to my mom.

479
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You may say, hey,

480
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.380
Elizabeth Sandoval: Will be open.

481
00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, hey, look, maybe you won't like talking to one of your maybe you will, but it would be a place for you to start. She might help you kind of Organize, organize your, your thoughts around your feelings about your mom help you organize your thoughts and feelings around dad.

482
00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And just talk to her. Just, just see what you think of her you know like looking at it like that. And then I hear you don't have to know everything. It's just getting him comfortable enough to do it.

483
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's

484
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Move on some of your goals. Um, one thing you had said is I want to clean my closet out. Have you been procrastinating on that or did you actually get to it.

485
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:20.820
Elizabeth Sandoval: No.

486
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:23.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: Okay.

487
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:24.720
Elizabeth Sandoval: You want

488
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To do it well you set yourself a goal of the 23rd, or I said it, it isn't there yet. You got a little bit of

489
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:31.920
Time.

490
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:33.510
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

491
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So how would it feel to have that closet organized, something that you can sort of you can organize the whole family. We can't get that all out. But you could have this organized closet.

492
00:55:52.470 --> 00:56:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see what you had written in here. Maybe small tasks to get rid of the box of papers. Did you even go over and work on that box to pay for. Hey,

493
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:02.490
Elizabeth Sandoval: Papers or did, yeah.

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you have made.

496
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.370
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I've done that.

497
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:18.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, I've done a few things that haven't worked on my closet right like like

498
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:22.800
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like

499
00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:25.290
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like everything and there's

500
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.110
Elizabeth Sandoval: My boyfriend, he decided to post

501
00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:40.920
Elizabeth Sandoval: Office in here. And then I was

502
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:47.550
Elizabeth Sandoval: Then finish and I'm like you to start a closet.

503
00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:52.080
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, I'm here, right at least

504
00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Your microphone is a little muffled is something about boyfriend doing something about a bat cave something

505
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.010
Oh, yeah.

506
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:08.400
Elizabeth Sandoval: I think

507
00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:09.600
I'm done.

508
00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

509
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:24.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: Okay, no, he, he decided one day he is. He's like, I'm gonna make a little button here. I'm going to put like a little Dallas on my side and blah, blah, blah. This will be like my little spot and

510
00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:36.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: He didn't do nothing but he destroyed his side of the climate and so on, all the show all the things for now it's like, I mean, I still have like your own but

511
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:42.360
Elizabeth Sandoval: Not on my side.

512
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:43.830
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

513
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: He wants a desk in the closet.

514
00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:48.000
Yeah.

515
00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:50.010
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like is a little

516
00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:53.490
Elizabeth Sandoval: Bit closer than

517
00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:55.230
This

518
00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, let's see. I want more time for myself just pay attention. Elizabeth that you're where you're pulling back is time for yourself, is that

519
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You're spending more time with with family and you're not doing the self care.

520
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That has a big impact for a lot of people when they start pulling back on that.

521
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be mindful that it's as you're adding more stress right with what's going on with your family and your brother. It doesn't mean you stop taking care of yourself and doing the things that you set. Okay, it's not being selfish.

522
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be really careful that you don't cut yourself off from doing things that feel good.

523
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:48.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: I went to do my nails and I did my hair.

524
00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:58.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: Thank you. Yeah. So I mean, I still like to build things for myself, but

525
00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:09.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, as far as like maybe taking time for just sit or read or be like yogurt, like you said, you need to do.

526
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:11.160
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

527
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to go back to school last thing we said January 22 I can look into online classes was Amanda for of the truth of I'm I'm capable. Okay. You read about a four.

528
00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And because of time and transportation online might be easier.

529
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard for me to make decisions. I want to get better at it.

530
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm capable check and see how true that is for you today.

531
00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:48.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: Not 30 people

532
00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:59.910
Elizabeth Sandoval: I know I am capable of, like, doing things but like right now it's just like this so much going on.

533
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.120
Elizabeth Sandoval: eating something right now.

534
01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I can go on line.

535
01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I could look online, do you really you've got yourself convince you don't have time to look online, or is that

536
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:22.650
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well, no, no. I totally do. But

537
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't rush

538
01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: To find figure out why.

539
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What kept you from going and looking

540
01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:38.640
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just

541
01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:54.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: Do something here going somewhere. Take care of my kids you know i mean it's it's it's something that I just need to do know, and look into and I need to stop putting it off.

542
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I hope you hear that this isn't I'm only saying it's sort of very clearly, because we have a disconnect on this Tele health

543
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes we're talking over each other. And this is something you wanted some I'm saying it really sort of nice and sharp so that you can hear.

544
01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're making excuses, like you're getting in your own way, maybe because the kids are in school.

545
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Who cares if the house is messy.

546
01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to go to school on your list is not, I want to keep a clean house that's going to give me meaning in my life. That's not what's on your list your list is I want to go back to school. And so I'm checking to see if what you're doing is making excuses.

547
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.560
Just checking in.

548
01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:58.620
Okay.

549
01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you are, or is there time to go online and look and see what classes are all there.

550
01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:12.930
Elizabeth Sandoval: I probably I'm making excuses and I do have time to look at online.

551
01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:24.240
Elizabeth Sandoval: Movies. Yes, I can do that should have been already so common.

552
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: For many people, listen, but the reason why they don't do it is because they get a flood of

553
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: All of the expectations. This self concept. Why haven't I done it already, you get some people get flooded with the past fear about the future and they get overwhelmed and it's easier to not have those experiences and so they don't go and look

554
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But my guess is, we're not going to know what it really is, whether it's fear.

555
01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the past or if it's fear about the future, or maybe either one show up if you don't do that behavioral experiment and just go put your little hands.

556
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:15.330
