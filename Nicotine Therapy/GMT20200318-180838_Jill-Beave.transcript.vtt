Sherry Young: This is

120
00:12:55.110 --> 00:13:02.790

124
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:19.590
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay. Um, if you still feel bad that just means you need more medicine so

125
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:32.370
Jill Beavers-Kirby: If you have withdrawal feelings. Go ahead and take the other half of the strip. Um, and then like later on in the day like six hours later, see how you feel. Again,

126
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:41.520
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And if you feel okay then then you don't need to take anymore. But if you still have withdrawal feelings, then go ahead and take another half of stripping. Okay.

Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, everybody's doses different

131
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.530

Sherry Young: Okay, I've had those before a long time ago and I think they gave them to me for my blip.

140
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.670
Sherry Young: blip.

141
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yes, yes.

142
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:02.670
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah.

143
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.050
Sherry Young: Yeah.

144
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.440
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so my guess is your blood pressure is on a problem now with all the weight loss.

145
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:18.450
Sherry Young: No, not now. I'm doing pretty good with my blood pressure. So I don't know. So, so far so good.

146
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.220
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Yeah, you lost all that weight.

147
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.260
Sherry Young: I'm sure that hell yeah yeah

148
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:40.230
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so this Suboxone can also cause some constipation, because it's you know it's an opioid so make sure you're drinking a lot of fluid and you can get a stool softener like colet or something at your pharmacy to that can also help with

149
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, constipation, okay.

150
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.740
Jill Beavers-Kirby: If there. Yo, you know, if you go if you go without having a bowel movement for several days, let us know.

151
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:51.570
Sherry Young: All right. Okay.

152
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.850
Sherry Young: And so we can recommend the right treatment for that.

153
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.110

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:25.320
Sherry Young: Take your you you guys, I don't know, somebody said that told me to go to CVS friend of mine said to do that. So I'm not sure what to do, should I switch pharmacies or should I just stay with what I am.

158
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.530
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Why did your friend think that they wouldn't take

159
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:42.090
Sherry Young: It because she had that and she transfer hers to CBS. She's one of my friends. She's the one that referred me to you guys is the same thing, trying to get herself well and better
