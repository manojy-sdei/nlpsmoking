00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder if you have

2
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The ability to set up a little bit of a setting where your eyes are right across from mine and you have

3
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The two two objects about shoulder width apart.

4
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right on the Mac side each side of your phone, just in case we want to do some bilateral stimulation

5
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know I'm throwing it as you unexpectedly. So take a minute and think, well, gee, I have this crate that I could build off or I have some books. I could stack up just sort of, I'm going to open up a note, just really let's give some brainstorming from London. See what's possible.

6
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes are the same height and then how you're looking down. Let's see if we can bring your eyes.

7
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.890
Alicia Noedel: Right, okay.

8
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that you're like this because it won't

9
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your time, though, there's no pressure. Don't, don't.

10
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Want any

11
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Extra stress to it. Easy, breezy.

12
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, that seems like it's higher. It seems higher.

13
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: To be like, no, not too high because what we want what I want is

14
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That when you're looking at these two objects.

15
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That are they about the same height those objects that are next to your phone left and right of your phone.

16
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see you look at the tops of those two objects.

17
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're above you somehow it's interesting.

18
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.340
Alicia Noedel: I have I have like a little steps to on top of my because there's no

19
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You're okay.

20
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.070
Alicia Noedel: You're okay where I am.

21
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you something. So here's what I want you out. Here's what your eyes just did.

22
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want that. Here's what I want. So

23
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so maybe it's just a little, a little piece of tape right at the center of right of those little things working, get creative. I know I'm not hung up on anything.

24
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But we just want this bilateral to see your eyes have this nice horizontal gaze left and right, I need this left right hemisphere going on.

25
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It could even be the label. If you knew that you were just going to look from label to label to label the label label you could turn it to the back. Maybe they're about the same height. What are we thinking

26
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

27
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.410
Alicia Noedel: Trying to figure out what I can

28
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Little piece of tape a little marker Sharpie.

29
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: bandaid

30
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I

31
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to waste those standards.

32
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.600
Alicia Noedel: Hey,

33
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What about sticky note.

34
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.560
Alicia Noedel: Maybe we can do it from here. Hold on.

35
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.120
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

36
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: BAD IS IT FEEL. Um, so your eyes and we're just going to set it up right now.

37
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just want to check and see if they're in distress. If the eyes are in distress. So if it feels like they're, they're looking too far and we come back a few inches.

38
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we want it to be comfortable. So you're looking at about. I know it's like a foot and a half. Just looking left and right. So, your eyes will look like this.

39
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You see mine.

40
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're not doing is all the way over. We're told you know

41
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: We I don't want that distress, because you won't want to do it and it'll, it'll be kind of paint.

42
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.660
Okay.

43
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.130
Alicia Noedel: Sorry, I had to get my little pillow know

44
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You just, this is all about setup. Right now it takes longer need

45
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there's no way I can put this in a text. So I try to explain

46
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That if I'm like okay so finding like what is this lady talking about

47
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so let me just see a comfortable. I gaze from the tops of those two objects.

48
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, that's it. Does that feel like it's straining. No. Yeah. It didn't look like it. That seems like that's about right.

49
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.750
Alicia Noedel: Excellent. And if they are, you could put the little closer because they're about an inch away from my phone still on each side.

50
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so have a headphone jack.

51
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is the way I think about it. I'm

52
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm closer to it, then it's going to strain more as I'm, as you said, Daniel, move them away. So you have more movement. So if you are about an arm's length away.

53
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.610
Alicia Noedel: We probably

54
00:06:44.760 --> 00:07:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Still about, I would say shoulder width is probably a good distance. So we'll just stick with that, well, we'll see if it's effective that way. Um, so, but first I want to see how you're doing. Want to check in with you physically sleep eating emotionally. How are you doing,

55
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.230
Alicia Noedel: Okay.

56
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.150
Alicia Noedel: Still dealing with them problems with my daughter.

57
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.460
Alicia Noedel: I'm

58
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: The formula.

59
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.020
Alicia Noedel: The yeast infection that she had in her mouth.

60
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:23.280
Alicia Noedel: Right, I guess it's common for it. Once it's in the body to spread to other places.

61
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.570
Alicia Noedel: And so she has it on her private parts. Now,

62
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.910
Alicia Noedel: Okay, and

63
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:39.690
Alicia Noedel: The doctor told me to get, you know, like they make medicated ones that come with applicators that you insert

64
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha, he

65
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:54.120
Alicia Noedel: Told me to get them and put it on the surface of her skin but not a lot of it and yesterday when I took her pamper off in the morning to change her. She was bleeding from all the little bumps that she had

66
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:08.940
Alicia Noedel: So I'm just kind of frustrated because they don't want to send me any antifungal that's like a lower grade. That's not going to affect her that. But now she has wounds. It's not just like diaper rash.

67
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And so she's probably fussier and more irritable and that affects everybody and you and sleep, and it has a chain reaction.

68
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.320
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I went to sleep at like four last night. So I'm really feeling it.

69
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so that's all right with some you've shown up tired.

70
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm just showing up.

71
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: For a lot

72
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: How are the dynamics with relationships.

73
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, okay, good.

74
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: No increase tension with fiance.

75
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:52.050
Alicia Noedel: I'm, you know, I'm really happy to have him home even, you know,

76
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.730
Alicia Noedel: If that means he's not working. I'm you know missing. This is the most time we spend together in our whole relationship.

77
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's not like you still like to die.

78
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:03.840
Yeah.

79
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.710
Alicia Noedel: Matter, now I'm stuck to them anyway.

80
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a good thing to find out.

81
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like him around feels good. So that's the upside of this sort of global crisis. And how's your mindset around things you can control things you can control how much

82
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Be watching me, being careful to not watch hours and hours of it just sort of go in, maybe once a day. Watch it.

83
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, get out.

84
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.720
Alicia Noedel: I check it once a day to see um

85
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.800
Alicia Noedel: You know what the amount of numbers of cases are

86
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.670
Alicia Noedel: We made masks. Although us masks that have bandanas and hair ties.

87
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really cool. I like that.

88
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.260
Alicia Noedel: We've just been drinking along

89
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. Okay. And you're stable on your buprenorphine. You look stable.

90
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Tired unstable. Yeah.

91
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just go nice and easy. Here, we'll just see where this takes us

92
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of what we've been doing is developing.

93
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple of things. Let me check in on the anchor room and see if we expect. Somebody texted you.

94
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:30.660
Alicia Noedel: Know I was I'm seeing if I could switch the camera because right now I'm the big picture in your the little picture.

95
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.170
Oh,

96
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're my big picture.

97
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, I'm fine.

98
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we got all the way through. So we might want to spend some time.

99
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Completing it's up to you. But we had begun to develop resource room. And one of the reasons

100
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I'm suspecting it's incomplete is I, I can see, we ended with

101
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The emotion. I'm scared. I feel less overwhelmed everything

102
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:20.430
Alicia Noedel: Will

103
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Be fine. I'm not in this position anymore. You're able to really distinguish time

104
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I can handle things more now. I don't feel helpless anymore wish somebody would have protected and cared enough to stop putting drugs before you, you were able to sort of say that tired of being hungry every day head.

105
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Head was shaking. No, I

106
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I am just. It is hard to think about. I wish they could hug feels better trust the hug all the tears and insecurities being scared in the ball. So it looks like there was this sort of there was some emotion that came up. We didn't quite get all the way through this

107
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: This exercise and we needed to put it in the ball.

108
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Or even drop it off at telos Gorge Bridge. Oh, no.

109
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can see, we didn't finish this activity, though.

110
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a couple of pieces that are missing.

111
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry yours just kicked in, just start. Sometimes I wonder if it has something to do with coffee, but

112
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I've done a month or so, without it still had it. That's not it. Yeah, I'll be doing the hair flip

113
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So there might not be much left. Let's just, let's just go in in there again. So give yourself a nice

114
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Gentle breath just tuning into the breath again get back into the body. Maybe. Maybe. Close your eyes. If you're able

115
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to use some of the adjectives that you use to describe this room. See if we can go back there. We're going to perfect it because again this has to be an anchor room.

116
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And the world around you, the people may be

117
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: upsetting you can go here, you can go here to solve a problem to sit and be quiet or socialize, you can have whatever you want in this space. This is your space because a lot of important things that can happen there.

118
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So you were originally

119
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Walked around. I wasn't there for him. The way I should have been. I was in an abusive relationship sister miscanthus boyfriend didn't

120
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me be at Dad's house and my relationship with Father suffered

121
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There was an emotion of sadness and the stomach was hurting like a sinking feeling

122
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's an awareness that it goes as far back as age nine, there was this sense of dread.

123
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We used a nickname Alice

124
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What you came to mind was the basement.

125
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Came to my about an average size.

126
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: white color really nothing in it, gray and white speckle

127
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Bright bunch of lights on the ceiling. No windows.

128
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And as I start to use these adjectives. I'm Elisa if you want to change it because there is more there. I want to hear about it and I want to add to the room.

129
00:14:50.490 --> 00:15:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's something you want to take away if your stomach turns if something happens in your body when you hear me say something if you don't like it anymore. Then let's change it. Remember the destiny is that it is a beautiful, peaceful safe space. I don't quite see that in here yet.

130
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I want

131
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.670
Alicia Noedel: That it's empty. I don't like

132
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, exactly.

133
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:23.160
Alicia Noedel: There's no reason to me when I think about it being empty and makes me nervous.

134
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to address that.

135
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.010
Alicia Noedel: It kind of takes away the safety part of it, you know.

136
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. Good caught it makes me nervous. And we certainly don't want you, you're not going to want to go there if you're nervous.

137
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, neither so

138
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can bring what's needed in here. Let's go to, let's go to the stomach and check in there. Let's just see.

139
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What would bring a sense of relaxed.

140
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Stomach.

141
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Safe feeling what can be there.

142
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.840
Alicia Noedel: I was gonna say a fireplace, but that doesn't make any sense.

143
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put it in.

144
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And see this is you're wrong, or you should you should see that the things we've got in these rooms.

148
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: There are stairs leading in my room wooden white glass handle two or rather glass handle. There's a door that has a lot to handle walk

149
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was

150
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:55.740
It was

151
00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Locked

152
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The room is warm clean

153
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I am thinking is this carpet. That's fluffy and soft.

154
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And you could hear actually the heater.

Gwenevere Abriel: You can see the event on the ceiling.

157
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You can smell cleaning products and a fresh air freshener kind of not much of a taste.

158
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

159
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Were sitting on the floor in the middle of the concrete floor.

160
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: more pleasurable that tolerable.

161
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Check in with your body and see, as I said that what comes up.

162
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.920
Alicia Noedel: Other way around

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.600
Alicia Noedel: more tolerable and pleasure. Okay.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: See if we can

166
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Make this something more pleasant.

167
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to that fireplace. So let's just sit with the fireplace and why don't you describe it to me, where is it what do you just described it.

Alicia Noedel: It's on the front wall of the room.

169
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:30.990
Alicia Noedel: So if you're against the farthest wall away from the stairs. It's on the front wall next to the staircase.

170
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.740
Okay.

171
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.500
Alicia Noedel: And

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.270
It's

173
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.640
Alicia Noedel: As a mental but it's made of raw

174
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.850
Alicia Noedel: Hmm, like individual rocks.

177
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:56.730
Alicia Noedel: Let's see, I would submit, I know envisioning my my auntie Connie's

178
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.380
Alicia Noedel: She had a really beautiful fireplace in her house and

179
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.360
Alicia Noedel: Her house meant meant really like calm safety nets to me because she was very

180
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.300
Alicia Noedel: Like stable. She was one of, like, the more stable people in my life when I was a kid.

181
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:39.120
Alicia Noedel: So I think about that fireplace. And I remember how COZY THAT HOUSE WAS because we would spend, you know, like every Christmas for like a week there so it just felt very warm and like you could smell cookies baking and it was like everyone was there. And everyone was happy and

182
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.990
Alicia Noedel: So I think about that fireplace.

183
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go to your room. And let's see. Let's see what we can do to add on to see if you can really envision

184
00:19:53.250 --> 00:20:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That that mantle just right where it is by the stairs, and is it lit is the fire burning

185
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.200
Yes.

Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned cookies earlier and you're not mentioning it now.

191
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's the, it's the smoky smell from the fire.

Gwenevere Abriel: I think there was, I could have sworn, there was a little bit of carpet at one point.

250
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm checking with a body. See how it's doing MySpace.

Alicia Noedel: Or legs.

254
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:47.160
Alicia Noedel: That's usually what starts to tense up on me when I get like nervous. I start to either bounce, or I stiffen up my calves I flex

255
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.460
Alicia Noedel: My stomach.

256
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.030

Alicia Noedel: When I get stressed out, or like nervous.

259
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.420
Alicia Noedel: It starts to turn

260
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

261
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:16.050
Alicia Noedel: It's almost like the same feeling like when you get in trouble in school and you know you're getting very like going to call your parents or

262
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:24.240
Alicia Noedel: Your you know you get in trouble somewhere and you know you're going to get in real trouble. It's like that feeling in your stomach like butterflies kind

263
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.530
Alicia Noedel: That's what everything is

264
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: In the room.

265
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.040
Alicia Noedel: What was that

266
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing in the room.

267
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.910
Alicia Noedel: Sitting on my couch bed.

268
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked you earlier. The last time we had done this, I asked you to sit with some misinformation. I'd like to visit that again.

269
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: While you're feeling at ease, while your legs are relaxed and your stomach is level, I'd like you to remember that the magic that's possible in here is limitless.

270
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can call upon that magic anytime you want.

271
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to wait for me. You can just do it anyone anything anywhere.

272
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

273
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The misinformation that we had started to to explore was

274
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I

275
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: pretend nothing is going on.

276
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Every everyone's life is like this. I'm over exaggerating. You remember that.

277
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.330
Yes.

278
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That was the misinformation of the nine year old. I

279
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no reason to be upset, everyone's life is like this. I'm just exaggerating.

280
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to pretend nothing's going on.

281
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Without it,

282
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:16.380
Yeah.

283
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to make sure that's true because I changed the wording.

284
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit because you said I pretended nothing is going on. Did you feel you had to pretend. Yes. Okay.

285
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You as an adult. No, that's not true.

286
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: The nine year olds needed to believe that, in order to survive. Alice needed to believe that

287
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To survive.

288
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Checked out your body's doing

289
00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:00.990
Alicia Noedel: Are we doing to ok ok I just got a little watery.

290
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: does Alice

291
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a question just Ellis have something she wants to say

292
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this misinformation, she may have a question. She may have it might be in her legs. It might be in her stomach. Sometimes we give voice to the bodies, the body parts that didn't have a voice and maybe got stuck in lodged in there.

293
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:44.280
Alicia Noedel: I think that most of the time, I always wondered when it was going to stop.

294
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:54.000
Alicia Noedel: And more importantly, how it was going to stop because I didn't see anybody you know getting clean anytime soon, and in

295
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:59.310
Alicia Noedel: You know, I didn't want to get taken away, either because I had

296
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:10.170
Alicia Noedel: The theater. I think the school knew something was going on because they had me go into a room with a woman. I think she was like a school counselor once a week.

297
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:21.390
Alicia Noedel: And she asked me, you know, how are things at home or your parents. Okay. Does your parents do drugs do they hit you, whatever. And I like every time.

298
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.100
Alicia Noedel: Because I don't want to get take

299
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Away. Oh.

300
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

301
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:27.510
OK.

302
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.260
Alicia Noedel: I told her you know I told her what I told myself, everything's fine. Yeah.

303
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

304
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I heard Alice that you might want to know wondered

305
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How

306
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And when this will stop.

307
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Most important how

308
00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:06.210
Alicia Noedel: Because even that I was scared about because I knew that if you know if it was gonna stop it wasn't gonna end well. Like, one of them was gonna die or both of them. I didn't think

309
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.010
Alicia Noedel: Any way that situation would in positively.

310
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.110
Alicia Noedel: Even that gave me like anguish, just thinking about

311
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stay here. Let's not expand out any further. Just stay right there, wanted to know how

312
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm just wanting to get a sense of

313
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: The it

314
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see if we can get either a few words, one word or maybe you've got a label for the get

315
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it that needed

316
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To stop.

317
00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.230
Alicia Noedel: When was my life going to

318
00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.710
Alicia Noedel: Win was all of the

319
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:12.720
Alicia Noedel: Things that were happening in my household going to change because

320
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.630
Alicia Noedel: I didn't know I want to, I want to elaborate on that.

321
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Is why not. Okay.

322
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's the it and the stuff that I'm zeroing in on

323
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to be inviting a conversation. And so it can come clear

324
00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually through this conversation. So I want you to just kind of have in the back of your mind that

325
00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Some conversation. It might be about to happen between Alice and Elisa

326
00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

327
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that might not be who the conversation.

328
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Is worth. I'm not sure.

329
00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But Alice

330
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And see the wondering, are you wondering

331
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: When

332
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What will stop.

333
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.360
Alicia Noedel: I guess I can rephrase it.

334
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.890
Alicia Noedel: As not stop but change.

335
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Once the it

336
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:36.360
Alicia Noedel: The

337
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.530
Alicia Noedel: Way, the way that

338
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:51.150
Alicia Noedel: Things aren't normal like everybody on drugs. I wouldn't, you know, how are we going to become an old man weekend.

339
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got parents on drugs is there neglect and abuse is that the it

340
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.000
Alicia Noedel: Look like. Yeah, okay.

341
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's drug use those neglect. When will that stop.

342
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And when

343
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.040
Alicia Noedel: They knew that when they're drug use, stop.

344
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:21.030
Alicia Noedel: The abuse, like the physical abuse would stop because those weren't who my parents were, you know,

345
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's um

346
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can get Alice to maybe ask the adult

347
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of turn inward to

348
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: To that space at this young girl at about nine

349
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: MB. She's cozy on that couch and feeling case.

350
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This difficult question, and I know things change.

351
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you think, Who does she need to ask, Who does she want to ask about when will it stop and how so first thing that kind of comes to mind.

352
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.360
Alicia Noedel: There's no one I could ask

353
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.770
Alicia Noedel: I kept it to myself.

354
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. And now once you to bring in the magic, magic of

355
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Time and Space completely morphs and anything is possible. And you get to know the how you get to know the when you get to know all those things, magically, so just imagine that Alice makes a wish.

356
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Wish you wish.

357
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.910
Alicia Noedel: Life was different.

358
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What was there. What would be different.

359
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.110
Alicia Noedel: Mom and dad were we doing drugs.

360
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:10.890
Alicia Noedel: Mom won't be working and she wouldn't have all of these medical problems.

361
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:19.290
Alicia Noedel: And we will live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood with food and all the cabinets.

362
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:31.440
Alicia Noedel: And I will get at least a couple new school clothes and it was time to go to school every year, not have holes in my shoes.

363
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That space wants you to feel cozy and warm for that room and you hear the crackling fire.

364
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see

365
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: All the details.

366
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:04.740
Yeah.

367
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the color.

368
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: On the couch and almost feel because suede kind of has these fibers that if you move them back and forth. They can create patterns and feel the fibers.

369
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe allow this younger self to be absorbed into that sensation. Maybe it's cool when she first touches at the suede and maybe it warms your hands remain on it.

370
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.600
Alicia Noedel: Maybe she's I didn't know what suede was I was like 17

371
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.720
Alicia Noedel: I would have probably been amazed.

372
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And you can even draw a little patterns. It's like, light, dark, light, dark, light, dark

373
00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:53.340
Just notice

374
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Her little nine year old legs.

375
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Just tuned in to where she needs.

376
00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: She was notice they're

377
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Not so much in possessions, but more like a feeling

378
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What would bring the feeling, what do we need in that space.

379
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So that Alice can feel at peace.

380
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Her legs can relax and your stomach can level.

381
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: To picture her in choose cutie pie shoes when you picture.

382
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.020
Alicia Noedel: No shoes.

383
00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

384
00:39:50.940 --> 00:40:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Want someone in the room. Notice how you're not bringing anyone in there that magic can pull magically anybody anything anywhere.

385
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:15.690
Alicia Noedel: I just felt very misunderstood at that time. And I felt like I didn't really have anybody know I could talk to anyone on my side. So, you know, like I just very withdrawal from everybody.

386
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.950
Yep.

387
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So, for a moment, let's do this experiment now and wants you to notice little one for our for Sarah in that room. But that's when she was nine. So just picture her little self there she's in that room and I want you to sort of oscillate, which means move back and forth from her.

388
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To you.

389
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You are an adult. Those things are not happening to you right now and you are okay. Yeah.

390
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And forth, and I want you to see.

393
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, there we go. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yep, to be Alice and am I still saying your name correctly.

Gwenevere Abriel: Looking at each other. So you can look at each other and

404
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see if we can have our Alice ask

405
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Elisa a question.

406
00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: She's wondered

407
00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How she has wondered when

408
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Just even proposing that how's Alice doing

409
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:23.700
Alicia Noedel: worrisome.

410
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So, does she look away from her adult self. Did she look away.

411
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.710
Alicia Noedel: Her face changed.

412
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're worried about

413
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.850
Alicia Noedel: Herself and future.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.400
Alicia Noedel: Lost my composure.

419
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What is Alice worried about

420
00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: 50 check and see if Alice has picked the right person just the right person to ask these questions of how is this substance use with my parents.

421
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And subsequent physical abuse and neglect. How is it going to stop.

422
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Alice pick

423
00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right for

424
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Let me hear how it sounds if Alice would ask

425
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.600
Alicia Noedel: Going to be normal again.

426
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.660
Alicia Noedel: When am I going to be okay.

427
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:28.110
Alicia Noedel: Because if they started again stopped doing drugs everything

428
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you do

429
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:37.290
It.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she do

431
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:58.020
Alicia Noedel: Everything's gonna be okay. One day, it's not gonna last forever. It feels like an eternity right now.

432
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.990
Alicia Noedel: It feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel one day.

433
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You can you look at

434
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.590

440
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:41.670
Alicia Noedel: Defeated

441
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Conference, or by holding our and telling or everything's going to get better. This will pass

442
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What is Alice

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Alice response to that.

444
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You probably already past. It was the first response.

445
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.600
Alicia Noedel: When I see it.

446
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I got to hear that stuff right I'll believe it when I see it. So do you trust. What are they saying

447
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.660
Alicia Noedel: Yes, but I would

448
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.910
Alicia Noedel: Have reservations.

449
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell the adult self. What's your have reservations about

450
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.940
Alicia Noedel: It's been going on for so long.

451
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.950
Alicia Noedel: That I don't see anything.

452
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.650
Alicia Noedel: Changing for the positive

453
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If you've got another question for the adult Ellis.

454
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get your answers you have every right to ask them, you didn't have a right before. So go ahead.

455
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Want a moment ago, and what it looked like was why me

456
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

457
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: seemed like it was for you.

458
00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:02.970
Alicia Noedel: I just, I just got overwhelmed by thinking about how much I missed out on being a kid.

459
00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

460
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it. Now we got somewhere.

461
00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where we use the magic. So we've got to be able to say that, but it doesn't

462
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I I think maybe something like

463
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you tap into some anger.

464
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you steer instead of sorrow and defeat. What could Alice say because remember

465
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All of the human condition.

466
00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: All of it now just turning all of that inward into the salt we can make me angry.

467
00:48:55.770 --> 00:49:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: can at least see a here that are just someone else needs to hear this. This if there were anger, who, who would need to be the audience.

468
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing that came to mind we rolled it out. What was one of the ones you rolled out

469
00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know.

470
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: How about this one. I missed out on being a kid.

471
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If it wasn't sad and sorrow. What if it was you were angry that you missed out who would listen to you would you need to tell that to

472
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.940
Alicia Noedel: My parents

473
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:39.870
Okay.

474
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And a distance that would seem safe.

475
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Where they couldn't

476
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Do anything to hurt you.

477
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of for a moment, if you could, in your family with you being in this room, you can have however you want.

478
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture where those parents would be, they could be on the moon. They could be just outside the door, they could you can have anything you want with this, but if you gave Alice yourself permission in here. And again, you have this magic or you get to say your piece.

479
00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: How would those parents appear, where would they be, what would they be doing

480
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you be doing

481
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

482
00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so can you picture. ALICE HAS THE PHONE IN THAT ROOM.

483
00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm kind of on

484
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.670
Alicia Noedel: The line of course was

485
00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

486
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Carlos.

487
00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And today, color. Do you call

488
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, where's this adult. Could this adult do it for you. Is there a sense that you don't want to make that call that that's not, is there a way that maybe Elisa could make the call.

489
00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:17.310
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

490
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Does that feel better than I, just, yeah. Because a little girls job is not to be

491
00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All of that you were already

492
00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Returned to foot. Great. And the whole point of childhood. So now it makes sense to healthy Elise, you make the call, doesn't it.

493
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so how does that happen Alessia

494
00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you picture when she do

495
00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:55.560
Alicia Noedel: Just say

496
00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.720
Alicia Noedel: That

497
00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:02.820
Alicia Noedel: You need to know how

498
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:16.200
Alicia Noedel: Even though I didn't show it. I kept it inside a lot that every single one of their negative actions that I was exposed to affected me

499
00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:23.220
Alicia Noedel: And I wasn't allowed to be a kid because they had to worry about my safety all the time.

500
00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:31.560
Alicia Noedel: I had to worry about whether or not I had to go across the street and still a bag of chips.

501
00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.270
Alicia Noedel: I couldn't just worry about playing with my Barbies.

502
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

503
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You are feeling the feelings of the little girl, the difference

504
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If you do that, it'll be more difficult for you to stand your ground with your parents.

505
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So borrow some indignation. As in, would you do the same thing to your children.

506
00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: If someone took over and started to treat them that way. What would you do

507
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is. There. That's a hard no right.

508
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:23.040
Alicia Noedel: Right.

509
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the, that's the good stuff of what what the vitality that comes from anger everybody gives anger such a bad rap.

510
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's got some cool juice in it.

511
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not here. It's just me.

512
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to just dip in and you can

513
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Come back out of it.

514
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of feeling the feelings of Alice

515
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She to be a little angry and and we me

516
00:53:55.590 --> 00:54:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: How fucking dare you in there like that. Not like that your way, but

517
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: This is unacceptable.

518
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it.

519
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We throw all those good communication skills and where we can't make them see because they're in addiction because of all that they cannot hear the subtle. It's just not a possibility. But you're representing protection, keeping her safe.

520
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I'm the parents and you're on the phone with me. The first thing you want to say to me.

521
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:48.990
Alicia Noedel: Why, he still acting like your kids like your teenagers. Why are you acting like as if you don't have children Mary's

522
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.220
Alicia Noedel: You didn't want us. You shouldn't have had us

523
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.800
Alicia Noedel: Things need to change this is a right

524
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To tell me what you want me to do.

525
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Active addiction and I can't reason I cannot problem solve. So you just tell me what you're going to do.

526
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.460
Alicia Noedel: We do street loser.

527
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha

528
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.420
Okay.

529
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:32.340
Alicia Noedel: I don't think either of you guys realize how many times she sat in a room and wanted to kill herself, because she feels so low.

530
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.120
Alicia Noedel: That gets me sad.

531
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

532
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But your sadness.

533
00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't you tap in just a little bit. We've only got a minute here. Now I need to do some processing. So

534
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice about the way I did it, my little my little animation, but it look like to you when I did that.

535
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Narrative I looked assertive. Okay.

536
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

537
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

538
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Alyssa. Have you been able to cultivate assertiveness in your development.

539
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:31.590
Alicia Noedel: Everything so

540
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so maybe that's the word we use is it's not anger. It's so assert

541
00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself on the phone with your parents and say definitively what

542
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What. Absolutely. You're going to set a boundary and a limit that gives Alice the space to play your kid.

543
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow on this, you're going to either assert demand state. It's not going to be a question. It's going to be a search

544
00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you say to me, representing parent

545
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes possible play for the child.

546
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.660
Alicia Noedel: You guys should be ashamed of yourselves.

547
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.390
Alicia Noedel: If you don't stop what you're doing.

548
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.100
Alicia Noedel: You know,

549
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:39.930
Alicia Noedel: You're either gonna die or be an open jail and I'm gonna she's gonna end up in foster care and God knows what's gonna

550
00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.480
Alicia Noedel: Do you want to be a statistic.

551
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're asking a question. I'm an active addiction.

552
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Won't be able to answer that. I want you to tell me be assertive and tell me

553
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.960
Alicia Noedel: What would it be a statistic.

554
00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you need to protect Alice

555
00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because you're the adult right now. She's not even on the phone, but you are going to protect her her right to play.

556
00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you say to me.

557
00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can find some anger in there.

558
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.720
Alicia Noedel: And then start being parents

559
00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The parents

560
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Your parents, what do I need to do. Tell me what to

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:43.800
Alicia Noedel: And follow through.

574
00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: closed doors. In fact, there's locks and on the other side.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.040
Alicia Noedel: Once you leave.

01:01:58.290 --> 01:01:59.250
Alicia Noedel: Family

592
01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:07.560
Alicia Noedel: Are used to pretend that I was a rich family and they'll have like seven different Barbies at once all talking to each other.

593
01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:11.190
So,

594
01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

595
01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:13.590
Yeah.

596
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:23.760
Alicia Noedel: I would set up little said never haven't Dollhouse or anything. So I would make little rooms all over my room.

597
01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

598
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can kind of be

599
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:29.910
Alicia Noedel: Thought about that.

600
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of see those rooms.

601
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And knowing that you can have that

602
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That Barbie doll house if you want in this room.

603
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe you just like the ones that you created yourself that's up to you.

604
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Just see them kind of moving around and playing and really getting lost in the storyline.

605
01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That you get to wander in your own mind.

606
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Your own imagination.

607
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's play

608
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to do that in this room.

609
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:13.920
Yeah.

610
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the temperature

611
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:19.110
Alicia Noedel: Warm

612
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you playing on the couch on the on the

613
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:23.880
Floor.

614
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Before in front of the couch and what's the emotion.

615
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.270
Happy

616
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any charge left in the legs right now.

617
01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Any things stirring around any discomfort anywhere right now.

618
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no. So nothing to drop off the gorge.

619
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.280
Lou.

620
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know you're happy. Where do you feel that

621
01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's a funny question.

622
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:11.820
Alicia Noedel: Because I don't have anything on your mind.

623
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.890
Alicia Noedel: I can be. I can be the thoughtless

624
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:17.670
Alicia Noedel: I'm just

625
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:23.250
Alicia Noedel: That's what I'm doing. I have to worry about anything.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:05.880

Gwenevere Abriel: Night, I
