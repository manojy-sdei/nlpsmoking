00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, good morning.

2
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.610
Good morning.

3
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.030
Nick Graham: Morning.

4
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.420
Okay.

5
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I can, I can hear you. Great. How about how. How's the audio and video

6
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.230
Nick Graham: Audio is good. Yeah. I went down to my office and someone there. So I can't

7
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.450
Nick Graham: Make it work in my card.

8
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Work with what we got. No worries.

9
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Today is at least in part an opportunity about once a month to review goals and see with them so

10
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.070
Sometimes that can take

11
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So I did add to no one.

12
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

13
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.750
It was a little new

14
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Which was to

15
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait till you're set their

16
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Time, it's worth it to just take your time. Because once it's you can kind of prop me up in their

17
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.820
Nick Graham: creative ways to do this.

18
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I have a client that keeps a clear tape is kind of clear it's not duct tape. But it's also really sticky. It's almost like packing tape. She keeps it in our car.

19
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.230
Nick Graham: And then sure.

20
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: He creates these bilateral things that hang

21
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Next to the

22
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: divisor advisor and she can put the phone and prop it up and make things sticky. Anyway, she just kind of keeps you

23
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.520
Nick Graham: See, I think, I think that would be pretty good so

24
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.120
Nick Graham: Let's see if I can make it work.

25
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we may not even get to the

26
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.530
BIOS

27
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: No worries mean you you've been doing some pretty intense work.

28
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To check in. Today I'm so right around that topic. One of the things that you identified that you wanted to

29
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a goal was, I want to better regulate extreme emotions.

30
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and

31
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: A way to do that right away to sort of say, let's put in motion a task is increased frequency of using emotional regulation skills from three times a day to five well

32
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

33
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: On the 18th, you had

34
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A concern of sad that was something you mentioned, and I think I don't know, with one time in the past that you had had some sadness, where you had done some of the emotional regulation skills.

35
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.280
Nick Graham: On. Sure.

36
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But why don't you can update me on just these last seven days, whether you have

37
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember because you've had some real challenges with the fast.

38
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.120
Nick Graham: In the last week one in my car and

39
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.640
Nick Graham: That was

40
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.320
Nick Graham: Pretty cool.

41
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.040
Yeah.

42
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.010
Nick Graham: Yeah, so it's been pretty cool. I was like,

43
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.840
Nick Graham: So,

44
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.890
Nick Graham: Yeah, it's been this week has been good.

45
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.190
Nick Graham: I haven't been going like having crazy, crazy emotional

46
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:25.500
Nick Graham: Breakdowns or anything like that. So it's been pretty good. The only concern that I'm going to have probably when I throw my phone out the window right now is I try to make this work. But besides that I've actually been

47
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.940
Nick Graham: Pretty well regulated, I would say.

48
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you certainly been tested.

49
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.420
Nick Graham: Right, it seems that you

50
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Had an opportunity which you did, um, do you kind of remember what you use to get through it.

51
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.240
Nick Graham: Yeah, so for me.

52
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.490
Nick Graham: The only really the one that seemed to have stuck his box breathing.

53
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.910
Nick Graham: Wow, so far that that works.

54
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.860
Nick Graham: That works pretty well.

55
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.640
Nick Graham: Jay, thanks. Kelly.

56
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes

57
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so right stay right on that topic a little delay in the realize, so I keep talking over and I'm sorry about that. Um, when, after you do the box breathing. Well, first of all, you're remembering that that's great but then get into the cognitive piece, see if your shift.

58
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Where once. It could be, oh, you know, maybe something like, oh, the world is just keeps accumulating and it's never going to get any better. And this is so awful, look what just happened. I was burglarized again, right, because this is the third time I've heard it from you had the fight.

59
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.990
Nick Graham: You could

60
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.420
Gwenevere Abriel: classifies it you could really do that or. So what was your thinking that got you through it. So you didn't. Wipe yourself out.

61
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.460
Nick Graham: So,

62
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.890
Nick Graham: Trying to recall it because it's been, you know, a few days.

63
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.940
Nick Graham: I remember just like not being super faith in the first place like

64
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.660
Nick Graham: I got in. It was kind of like a

65
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.620
Nick Graham: Okay, so it's kind of thing, but not like, and I don't think I got like in that spiral.

66
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:37.980
Nick Graham: I don't, I don't like feel super attached to like stuff anyways, really. So that is really my bikes are the only thing that really impacted me so I don't really get that

67
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And that was already gone

68
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.340
Nick Graham: Yeah, exactly.

69
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.760
Nick Graham: They didn't get that. So that was a good thing.

70
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've got a really good lock.

71
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.460
Nick Graham: Yeah, pretty much.

72
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, that's a good investment, where you live.

73
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.260
Yeah.

74
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So you used it sounds like

75
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: A value system you realized you know there's there's not a lot of attachment to material things that was

76
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You also

77
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Your bike is still very

78
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.560
Nick Graham: The bike.

79
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have this sort of loose attachment to things maybe not sure if the bike is the stronger one but ok so you realize that

80
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And he did remember to do this breathing. Did you see any one around. You kind of lose in there. Cool.

81
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.920
Nick Graham: Yeah, I saw one of my roommates.

82
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:42.720
Nick Graham: freak out.

83
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.440
Nick Graham: Like pretty frequently and

84
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.580
Nick Graham: He just like getting angry. I was kind of like, hey, like, okay.

85
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.830
Nick Graham: We'll get it back, kind of thing.

86
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.390
Nick Graham: So,

87
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.420
Nick Graham: He was kind of losing it more than I was.

88
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: What was it like to see him doing that.

89
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.610
Nick Graham: Weird, you know, like watching people do that like when people do freak out. It's kind of weird to

90
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.330
Nick Graham: Like a weird thing to witness

91
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.450
Nick Graham: And I like kind of saw that like yes and issues like because I've seen him do it.

92
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:34.620
Nick Graham: Within it makes me think, Oh, that must be how I live kind of thing. Yeah. So yeah, I've actually been way better about that, like,

93
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.530
Nick Graham: I don't know if it's

94
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:45.720
Nick Graham: I don't know why, but like, I've even been talking to Sydney lately have been freaked out haven't gotten

95
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.540
Nick Graham: Any single moment where I lost my cool. Okay.

96
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you had opportunities, things that you can say, Wow, this, this should really

97
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.540
Nick Graham: Yeah yeah like similar thing for that freaked me out. I was like, oh, it's fine.

98
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like that. Do you like

99
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.770
Nick Graham: Yeah okay yeah I mean sometimes I feel like I'm not

100
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.820
Nick Graham: Gonna have enough emotion. You know, like, like enough like

101
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.890
Nick Graham: Happy I assume it's those about, you know, I don't know where maybe, but I feel like I don't

102
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.680
Nick Graham: Have

103
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:30.870
Nick Graham: A lot of

104
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.910
Nick Graham: Joy or

105
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.740
Nick Graham: Like happy emotions.

106
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.410
Nick Graham: Negative

107
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.030
Nick Graham: Emotions

108
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:50.730
Nick Graham: Okay.

109
00:09:50.970 --> 00:10:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can tolerate that while you're going through this tapering and just realize that they'll all going to come back on board and the convenient part is if you keep doing all this hard work you're doing.

110
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be able to meet those emotions with a different meaning you're going to be able to access more tools you're you're rehearsing these

111
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The skills that you're learning in here and I think you're going to not find them quite as

112
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, maybe. I mean, the goal is not as intense right

113
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's cool.

114
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say how many milligrams. Do you want because you had said I run a note actually on

115
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see. Which day

116
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It was February 13 start 5.5

117
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: See to for growth, doubt, so you must have talked with the doc about a plan. Did you find yourself kind of not doing it or doing it. What, what's, what

118
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.740
Nick Graham: I mainly

119
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.840
Nick Graham: It's hard to

120
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:15.360
Nick Graham: Divide them up because they're so small, like completely accurate those, but they're like, pretty, pretty freaking close to the correct. Now it's like the difference between

121
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:24.450
Nick Graham: Breaking two and a half and taking two and three quarters, you know, that's like one of my and so it's kind of hard to measure that. But

122
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.160
Nick Graham: Besides that, like it's been

123
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.490
Nick Graham: Fine, I kind of get

124
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.450
Nick Graham: As I taper like them with Joseph

125
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you describe him.

126
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.310
Nick Graham: Yeah, like, for me, it's, it's usually like restlessness like

127
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.940
Nick Graham: Maybe a little irritability.

128
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:51.660
Nick Graham: There's

129
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:57.720
Nick Graham: Usually sleep problems, but that's it. Take that other thing whenever they ever give up.

130
00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: On it.

131
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.980
Nick Graham: Yeah and that helps a little bit with that.

132
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um, how many days. Have you been at this 5.5 milligrams, which you say

133
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:15.870
Nick Graham: Like

134
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:20.820
Nick Graham: Maybe like

135
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It was posted

136
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: On February 13 so if that was the case may be right at

137
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That'd be one, you write it two weeks, right now, is it possible you waited.

138
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.660
Nick Graham: Yeah, I think I might be a little bit behind.

139
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me just put a little

140
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Note here today is to such to 720 will say at

141
00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So in January. January six, not January 9 at seven milligrams, your, your goal. The but we were at a rate of going down one one milligram at a time and when I've been listening to people.

142
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This can be a sticky receptor moment right in this six for down to three, they could get kind of sticky and going half a milligram might be the way to go.

143
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.580
Nick Graham: So the truth you to

144
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Run your life.

145
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now what we had set was by Monday, you'd be it too.

146
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but that's at that 1

147
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.090
Nick Graham: Million rock.

148
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're, you're just fine. What we do is

149
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's good for you guys to see, oh, I think I'll just, I'll just say one is a small number. No one milligram of Suboxone think is I think it's 20 milligrams of morphine.

150
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like an insane amount of analgesic medicine. So it's not a joke. So I know your emotions are you doing this, this little thing you're doing

151
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But it matters.

152
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: As best you can to try and get that right, because it's when you add it back on that that little straggler receptor that one that maybe if you'd gone through four days, and he would have finally reabsorb he's going to stay there.

153
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you keep going up and down on on the dose. He's going to stay and be looking for an opiate and be giving you a hard time with restless leg hot, cold sweats runny nose, sneezing,

154
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So we really do try if you can make

155
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: over a weekend or something, I don't know.

156
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.540
Nick Graham: Yeah.

157
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:55.350
Nick Graham: I'm not sure if they make one milligram tablets. Do you happen to know if they do.

158
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:57.450
Nick Graham: They do up

159
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I can ask

160
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me ask right now. I'll send a little message to her Shane are not awake yet but um

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: They make and what are you taking. Is it some box on the brand name.

163
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.370
Nick Graham: No, I'm not taking the tablets, because

164
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.110
Nick Graham: They just work way better. Okay.

165
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. Is it. Do you know the name on the package is that Dr. Reddy, is it

166
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh shoot, starts with an M and had my little words. It's been a while since I

167
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.070
Nick Graham: Know that they come in like these little pink pills.

168
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:40.020
Nick Graham: Little

169
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, they

170
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.190
Nick Graham: Don't they come in a

171
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.320
Nick Graham: Like like dispense like in fills in a pill bottle from the pharmacy like

172
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:50.790
Nick Graham: Like

173
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.680
Nick Graham: Like they come in like a bottle like this.

174
00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:58.230
Okay.

175
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll stand us okay anyway so

176
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just saying recording message do you do they make one milligram tablets. He's having a hard time getting

177
00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Exact

178
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: milligram

179
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Portion when

180
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.120
Cutting

181
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Tablets.

182
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I know she'll say, you know, go get the tiny little milligrams scale saying, and then you get this little tiny spoon thing and you know

183
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.270
Nick Graham: Do you really want my scale.

184
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:42.090
Nick Graham: By skill must not be sensitive enough because that's what i. That's what I was doing with the larger ones. It was

185
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.730
Nick Graham: Easier to do. So I think that I probably couldn't get any more sensitive scale.

186
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you can because this might be a nice or smoother ride. Nobody's coming months.

187
00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.350
Yeah.

188
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might be celebrating your success more frequently.

189
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.080
Nick Graham: You're going to do

190
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, look at me. I've heard weeks I feel good. I feel good. I remember. Oh, and my mind feels sharper. I like this versus week after week, you might keep coming back to me that that those withdrawal might be there. That's my concern, so I just want to make sure if you can

191
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To get a good accurate scale what just curious. I can't remember where we left off. I wasn't sure if

192
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: You have remind me because I do get there's a lot going on with people's insurance. Um, are you feeling like they're that your insurance, there's something you can do to try and get them to

193
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.230
Nick Graham: Get I

194
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.220
Nick Graham: Spoke with billing that that person told me

195
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.580
Nick Graham: That they're basically they were billing guys as if we were a brick and mortar.

196
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.960
Like

197
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.960
Nick Graham: Place. And because we don't make this

198
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:13.290
Nick Graham: We only exist online. It's not covered, but they're putting in some kind of requests to see if they can be covered.

199
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.250
Nick Graham: It was really confusing. I need to read the email again. But that's what I got from it.

200
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and was the author of that email Krista beginning

201
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.190
Nick Graham: Yes.

202
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Good. Very bright

203
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.990
Nick Graham: Yeah, they seem to

204
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.480
Nick Graham: Know what she's talking about. It was

205
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I

206
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.070
Nick Graham: Will I will let her do with it. Okay.

207
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. All right. So, but let's not not go too far away from it.

208
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't want you overwhelmed with with a bill in here. So just, just stay on top of it. Okay, let's keep going. I made some notes around the better regulation, you're definitely remembering

209
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: The I've been recently calling it belly breathing, because that's the mechanism of the Vegas nerve.

210
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The parasympathetic nervous system getting activated. So I kind of been focusing on that phrasing better so people remember that it's that balloon belly. That's really making the difference. I'm calling it belly breathing. So people remember

211
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, if you forget the timing. If you forget the nose. Inhale, all that is like fancy and fantastic and an add on but skipping the belly part, you might miss being able to regulate

212
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:32.730
No, I

213
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta go in here. You can't keep because that's what we do when we're in distress. That's what we do when we're going to throw blows run a mile. Okay, that's what we do when we're activated. So we've got to get that air down to the bottom.

214
00:19:47.280 --> 00:20:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Of the long press that viscera activate that Vegas nerve send the message to the brain and contradiction that there's a threat. No we're not. We've got to activate that so I'm sorry to call it belly breath so people can remember it in the belly.

215
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, right.

216
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh dear. Well, it's gonna work a lot better when you push that belly out

217
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so let's see. And it's so hard. Remember, it's going to take concentration, you'll get your mind off of whatever sort of spiral or rumination you got going on. They'll help you bring back to the present in the body.

218
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to touch on another one which has to do with spirituality. Remember how you define it.

219
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: By heart has you guys do these brief addiction monitor surveys, the BAMs, and you have been putting I think

220
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: A to write it helps moderately I think as a to

221
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Has that has the Neil moved on that. Have you been delving more into spirituality last like when

222
00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:57.930
Nick Graham: I was like,

223
00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.110
Nick Graham: Oh, and for a little bit like

224
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.360
Nick Graham: And then kind of

225
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.590
Nick Graham: Fallen, I would say like think the level of like

226
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.630
Nick Graham: What, like I feel God has an impact on data. I mean,

227
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.320
Nick Graham: I would probably say

228
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.040
Nick Graham: It like moderately

229
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:21.360
Yes.

230
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, if they're

231
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:27.960
Right.

232
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but, but it's not a waste of time. I don't seem to to look at it to say, Where's Where's my focus then

233
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's look a little bit at the getting out into nature for you. There's been sort of sometimes you were getting up and making sure those hikes were happening over the last seven days. How many times have you actually gotten out into nature on a real intentional way.

234
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.550
Nick Graham: Yeah, the last seven days.

235
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

236
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.710
Nick Graham: I don't think

237
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:14.490
Nick Graham: I only think once, but before that I was doing. I've been doing really well, but we've been doing these campus visits, where we have to go recruit. So I've been working like ridiculous days lately.

238
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:29.280
Nick Graham: So I'm like, even more than normal. And then there were like three days that I was like, Screw it. I need to train my dog, and I didn't go so we're going on a hike data diverse dog that I've done on so

239
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What's

240
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.260
Nick Graham: Your question 00 days, seven days. I feel like shit about it.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.520
Nick Graham: You will

242
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Not do not know.

243
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That be a win if you were neglecting another priority. You have a new

244
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: EP already. That's okay. You're going to learn how to balance it you're doing it, you're bringing the dog and you're going to go hiking you're learning

245
00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: How to modulate your like life is going to continue to have competing priorities, how will I manage it. What's, what's your dog's name.

246
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.410
Nick Graham: Is David, same way

247

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.610
Nick Graham: To the mountain.

259
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.580
Nick Graham: Make them wear whatever. Yeah.

260
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any snow on the ground.

261
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.520
Nick Graham: A little bit, yeah. Not a whole lot though.

262
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, yeah, no, no, um,

263
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: These are your goals.

264
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.370
Okay.

265
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, there's, I mean, I know you're being playful.

266
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've got to pay close attention to where some of our sarcasm conduct can have that more. So the truth. You know that little bit

267
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I I review them because that's kind of good practice been doing this stuff for a long time, we were film every month. That's just what I do.

268
00:24:51.330 --> 00:25:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're your goals you look at them and you say you get to decide, by the way, whether you've reached him or not. Look what your goal is. It's actually, I would like to be out in nature more often.

269
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The only, the only objective of this was climbing identify challenges and barriers currently to engaging and more physical activity and you did.

270
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you've been able to identify. So if we wanted to, we could actually put achieved on this. So you've got that like it's handled. We can set more can set different ones ones that are more relevant. We could do that right now, what would you like to do

271
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.510
Nick Graham: Think

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.960
Nick Graham: I want to finish my education. Okay. I think that

276
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.900
Nick Graham: Maybe something along this line.

277
00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me put achieved on this one. Okay. Because you did you wanted it more often.

278
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.470
And prior to

279
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a huge commitment. You just made with this was, yeah.

280
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.110
Nick Graham: I did that. Yeah.

281
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So why

282
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me let me catch up to you. Now they're coming at me.

283
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me just end something about losing weight. So let me just get down here and put that create a new section here for achieve goals. Okay, achieved.

284
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.880
Goals, right. Hey,

285
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's a common one right as as you start to shift from this is what I don't want to do. I don't want to. I don't want to. Now it gets exciting as you turn towards what you do wanna and you're thinking, I want to go back to school. Okay, so that's that's the big goal I

286
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to go back to school now small step that can be done in 30 days might even be a micro step. It's a call today. It's a

287
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Go online look at three things, you know, those are micro steps. And those are what's going to get you there. So for now, what would be one step you can take either this week, or over the next 30 days.

Gwenevere Abriel: Have to go to campus dia dia download it online. What do you do

296
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.610
Nick Graham: It done online. Yeah, okay.

297
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you know, right where it is.

298
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Now when you

299
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a constraint, you know, you have to be at work at a certain time or you're going to catch some some flak or maybe get fired by constraints are useful, you might find him on the front hand and annoying, but they they will help you right prevent procrastination. So go inside yourself.

300
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And check and see

301
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: where that line is between it's not so far out that I'm just making excuses. It's also not like in the next 20 minutes that's really too soon, I'm already doing something. See if you can find out when you can fill this out.

302
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.050
Nick Graham: Probably

303
00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.700
Nick Graham: Sunday, but I can do.

304
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That is March 1. Okay, got it.

305
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:10.740
What

306
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.140
Is

307
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Evidenced by where's that on

308
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Forever in a

309
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:24.600
Copy.

310
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Paste. Okay. Fabulous. I spelled it be a s like Sam F like financial aid like aid.

311
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's the eligibility eligibility document UNAM need to fill out the FAFSA online by three one, as evidenced by and you'll you'll tell us when you've done it more than welcome to text me and brag about it.

312
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.390
Okay.

313
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, next one. So I always worry

314
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Or when people say, I want to lose weight.

315
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And the reason is because sometimes the reason for it is not one that comes from

316
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: A psychological well being a self esteem. Well, being placed like the intent behind it can sometimes. So it's hard for me, doesn't matter. It's not my goal. You can set whatever you want, but I'm transparent, I say things out loud. I tell you what I'm thinking.

317
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.250
Nick Graham: And so much and

318
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is many years of hearing people say that that that's what they want. But why do you want to lose weight.

319
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:45.720
Nick Graham: Definitely comes from body dysmorphia like and feeling like like shit about the way that I'm at now. So that's like one of them.

320
00:30:46.680 --> 00:31:01.230
Nick Graham: Like whatever reason. Like, I also know that when I'm at like this this way to do hundred pounds like that. That's like where I in my recollection have felt the best in terms of like feeling because like

321
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.590
Nick Graham: Yes, I think, losing weight.

322
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.820
Nick Graham: Is the thing that everyone feels like they always have to do and it's bad.

323
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:22.620
Nick Graham: I'm also trying to think like I do remember being really happy at a, at a lower weight like because I just felt like muscle. Every time I run. I get shin splints now because I'm carrying an extra 30 pounds and

324
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.090
Nick Graham: Some weird stuff like that. So I don't know, like

325
00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:29.940
Nick Graham: In my rational. I don't know.

326
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what if, what if we play with this a little bit. What if it's

327
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Increase other things. What if it's increase nutrient rich fruits and vegetables.

328
00:31:47.250 --> 00:32:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Living, um, you know, non hormone meets you know where you're going to be spending, you know, it's more pricey, but this is this is the medicine. Your body needs right to run

329
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we say we're increasing this you might notice

330
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of weight loss as a byproduct of it.

331
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:12.690
Nick Graham: Maybe like

332
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:26.340
Nick Graham: They definitely don't eat like super healthy right now. I think that can be good exercise for like maybe five days a week or something like that. Those combined with results probably

333
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you already know about. I don't want to make any assumptions here and

334
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but when you say not eating healthy. Are you eating at fast food a five days.

335
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.120
Nick Graham: No, no, not as not as much like

336
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.190
Nick Graham: So let me think, if I didn't think about the last week 36 hours.

337
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.630
Nick Graham: I've not eat fast food at all really in the last week or so rarely more than a week.

338
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.550
Nick Graham: But I like

339
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:10.320
Nick Graham: Oh yeah, like the other day was broken a Little Caesars pizza over the course of two days, like, stuff like that. Like, like for people to basically

340
00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so most people I don't know about most people I I you know I live in a sort of the suburb, it's a family oriented kind of place. And there was a pizza night.

341
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pretty sometimes you end up having a leftover so a couple times a

342
00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Week pizza gets eaten its crust. It's red sauce. It's permission. It's mozzarella and if you eat the pepperoni, or maybe sausage or whatever is on it.

343
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not catastrophic it's

344
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.770
Nick Graham: Yeah, with the ice cream is

345
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.440
Nick Graham: You know what, when I do my screen.

346
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:57.330
Nick Graham: Like

347
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.560
Nick Graham: Okay, like maybe twice.

348
00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.980
Nick Graham: Twice a week probably too much.

349
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so when you look in

350
00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The index right of what a healthy weight is for you. What does it say you're healthy weight is

351
00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:26.940
Nick Graham: It says like 186 which, as for my for my that's not proven to be like

352
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.780
Nick Graham: The chief who even at my leanest like I'm not that

353
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:34.770
Nick Graham: Like muscle mass, normal, so like

354
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.160
Nick Graham: I know that 200 is good.

355
00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about sugar for a minute.

356
00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you were going to

357
00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: minimize how much ice cream you are eating to me. Would you say it's twice a week, or would you minimize if you are telling me how much ice cream you were eating as five days a week.

358
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.840
Nick Graham: Yeah, I'm eating like maybe twice a week.

359
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:17.310
Nick Graham: Twice a week and I like almost throw up every time.

360
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, almost throw up. How much are you eating.

361
00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.960
Nick Graham: Like, like it.

362
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:30.060
Nick Graham: Like this, like a cup thing like you know when you get like it.

363
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:38.430
Nick Graham: Belly like this size of this mason jar right here for the ice cream, kind of like an amount like probably

364
00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.200
Nick Graham: Yeah, probably 12 ounces of ice cream. I would say

365
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a lot to me. And you're saying that you're almost throwing up

366
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:51.630
Nick Graham: Every time

367
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.660
Nick Graham: Every time I eat ice cream. I like

368
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.500
Nick Graham: I pretty much well i i probably also have, like, moreover, active like

369
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.180
Nick Graham: Stuff, I don't know, maybe like a stopping and I don't know. I felt a lot like not intentionally either like

370
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:22.350
Nick Graham: Sometimes, so when I eat ice cream. I like feel it and then sometimes all like just throw up a little bit in the toilet like like not a massive amount at a time. But like a little bit at a time.

371
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.720
Nick Graham: Definitely when I

372
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.360
Nick Graham: I probably go up like

373
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.200
Nick Graham: I just put an average like maybe once a week.

374
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.330
Nick Graham: So not a whole lot

375
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.590
Okay.

376
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're going to disagree. That's a lot.

377
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.350
That's a lot.

378
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Ever

379
00:36:49.710 --> 00:37:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Doctor, so you hear it ever when we are vomiting and we don't know why people end up in the emergency department. So when you say this is normal, it's that needle is really skewed.

380
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.970
Nick Graham: So Where's it coming from

381
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Where have you had this since childhood and someone said, Well, you're just not supposed to be, you know, really having milk, dairy,

382
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:14.490
Like

383
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:26.580
Nick Graham: That was like, it is generally associated with dairy, but I also like it when I overeat, and like I have a hard time like I've been trying to get better, but like

384
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:43.200
Nick Graham: I at one point in time. Like I said, I work out really hard. But then I eat a lot. I could eat like a whole like pizza and like a triple a burrito like so I don't really have that

385
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.120
Nick Graham: Like off switch. Sometimes, okay.

386
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.960
Okay.

387
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.000
Nick Graham: Yeah, so then I like sometimes I will literally to the point of like throwing up

388
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.820
Nick Graham: I got going along.

389
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's that is binge. It's called binge eating right so you have any very technical word of body dysmorphia so

390
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You have some awareness of it, and definitely food is a substance that people can can have compulsivity around can really engage in addictive behavior with the same as a

391
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.640
Nick Graham: Substance, yeah.

392
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet gives you don't for me.

393
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Yeah. And I think there's still a lot for us to learn around that gut brain access. But what I have learned so far has

394
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Truly just it's transformative. Once I really get when I sit there with that visual is that serotonin right that 90% of the serotonin receptors are in your gut that blows my mind that

395
00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is like

396
00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Holy crap.

397
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.780
It's crazy.

398
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we know level right our brain is going to give us a little dopamine hit when we

399
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Write when we eat.

400
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Right when we solve a problem.

401
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: When we feel this sort of love.

402
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And connection. We're going to have that. So it's for survival. So it's this balance of will. Am I just an animal.

403
00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Or because that's one part of the brain that's only one part that's that sort of sub cortical one, that one, that's your dog has

404
00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: On, but we also have other parts of our brain. And if you can bring those online course the belly breathing is a great way to start. And you can say, okay, this is where I use

405
00:39:53.400 --> 00:40:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Although I'm going to get this immediate gratification. Does it meet my long term goals. What can I do, what am I list of two or three teeth things right now that I can do.

406
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm not behaving in a habitual addictive way I'm going to go eat some carrots. I'm going to go real quick. I'm just going to do some stretching. When I go pet the dog. I'm going to rub some lotion on my hands.

407
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, we, you know, whatever. These are the list that we need to be developing

408
00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You have that lived experience and you're making neuronal connections in your brain. I can have this thought and we don't know what it is yet.

409
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Another lonely and sometimes there's so unconscious. They're so young, because you've got some early childhood stuff that has happened and for most people. It's right food is it's it's like an inner little hug. Right. It's a hug and side.

410
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:52.680
Nick Graham: So,

411
00:40:54.750 --> 00:41:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We need a real hot, a sense of okay we need nurturing you need that feeling. So if we address the underlying need. Okay. Wait, what's really going on. Oh, I'm bored.

412
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we've got to get right into a camp for what typically I'm bored. I realized it's kind of lonely and i and i and so habitual does the thought walk to the fridge happen.

413
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You like no that's where we got to interject. We got to get in there and be like, Okay, when I feel bored. This is what I'm going to do when I have

414
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: When I don't even know how I feel. I'm going to go, no matter what. Just going to always pick up the dog. I'm going to give Sam was a little kg and I'm going to do some Watch a funny video, I'm going to do some reading whatever your

415
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Goals are. And over time, you're going to start to see. Oh.

416
00:41:47.310 --> 00:42:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have to be that first impulse. I can access right that different part of my brain, but it's not an easy thing to do, you have multiple addictive behavior, right, I mean, I get you. You're not alone. A lot of people do this and this one might have been with you a long time.

417
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: How long have you been doing this kind of

418
00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.600
Nick Graham: Binge Eating which you said

419
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:15.330
Nick Graham: Oh, you're frozen.

420
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you hear me okay

421
00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:26.130
Nick Graham: Yeah, I would say, I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you but you're also

422
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.290
Nick Graham: Trying to turn off video

423
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:30.180
Nick Graham: So,

424
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.050
Nick Graham: I've been doing this as long as I

425
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:35.760
Nick Graham: Really

426
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.210
Nick Graham: Really the first are you able to hear me. I can hear me right now.

427
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I can if you want you can turn your video off for just a little bit to bring you up to speed, about

428
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.470
Nick Graham: Yeah, cool.

429
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:51.960
Nick Graham: All right, we're good now.

430
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.380
Nick Graham: As probably like

431
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:24.000
Nick Graham: Eight years older. So it was like yeah probably like eight years old and I look like smash.

432
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:33.960
Nick Graham: box of cookies. And I'm like, so the reason that I remember. Because I remember, like, like you said, it's just like

433
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:47.010
Nick Graham: I remember being rolling. I didn't understand it. Okay. Like, that's pretty safe to eat it. So it's like I might get really sick. But it tastes really good 7870 but doesn't like it really young, stuff like this is wrong and I'm still doing it. So yes, I've been doing that for a while.

434
00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you

435
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Had any treatment for this.

436
00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:12.660
Nick Graham: Week. No. No. Okay. The only that I ever did was just when I work out as much as I hate basically that's like how I generally say like physically fit and it's just because I work out as much as I eat.

437
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.460
Nick Graham: So,

438
00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:19.740
Nick Graham: Yeah, definitely not a, not a great thing. They're probably

439
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's it's not this is you're describing some elements of right trying to control and that's what people do. They were either restricted or they are over exercising.

440
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But a real focus

441
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: On

442
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: The body shape and

443
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you've got a long history of this vomiting. Have you ever induced it

444
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.290
Or do you

445
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.060
Nick Graham: Know, never

446
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Any laxatives or anything like that.

447
00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.650
Nick Graham: No, nothing like that.

448
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

449
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.770
Nick Graham: It's got to be a dairy thing like a dairy associated thing.

450
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, okay, I'm with you on that.

451
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's also still an awareness that

452
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe right the full piece of extra burrito and done it up is right. That's maybe access to you that that's access. Yes, there might be just concurrent thing going on.

453
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: For now. Will you try on this phrase, just as an experiment.

454
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If you catch yourself and in habitual all my gosh I'm staring into this fridge or I immediately I'm already my car I'm driving somewhere to go get food right

455
00:45:53.040 --> 00:46:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Doc, and think I can never get enough of what I don't need

456
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:08.820
Nick Graham: Yeah, I can never get an answer, but I don't

457
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Write it on your hand write it everywhere. I can never

458
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:33.120
Nick Graham: Say that again. What do you think the next question is,

459
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: The statement. I can never get enough of what I

460
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Thought. That's the next question.

461
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.180
Nick Graham: My head around the freezing crystal.

462
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:51.930
So,

463
00:46:54.030 --> 00:47:05.910
Nick Graham: Yeah, so I'm trying to think of like times when I like well like be on my way home to work in the past is freaking Taco Bell every time in and then sometimes I'm like worn out from the day and I came here, go home and

464
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:17.220
Nick Graham: Not have much food in the fridge your stuff is talked about them. And so like I eat this nasty putrid garbage and then I feel like kind of full to the point of like feeling nauseous.

465
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:25.740
Nick Graham: You know, so it never is like a good Association. After I do it. So that's kind of what I'm thinking about, like, like it's pretty accurate.

466
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, watch this.

467
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll play it out over here. And then you see if there's some that one you used was more around exhausted and you don't have food already made it home and you

468
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Aren't right here and preparation. That's a task that you can get into really already

469
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready to go. That's just us going to

470
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This one that I'm bringing up has to do with the whole pizza.

471
00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about you're

472
00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about

473
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What watch

474
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I keep eating.

475
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I literally can never get enough of it. It will never be enough, because that's not what I need, what I needed.

476
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe if I was physically hungry.

477
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Was fuel.

478
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I do need a carbohydrate. I need protein. I need fruits and vegetables. I need to make sure that might guide is healthy that gut biome we mess with it with the yucky burrito stuff.

479
00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't care about your serotonin and cares about your GoFundMe it wants you to have short term little rush and you come back.

480
00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not going to do it. Your, your gut health will give you Sarah tone and happiness that burrito will give you quick rush, but that's your reptilian stuff that's like

481
00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:57.960
Nick Graham: Yeah, I

482
00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to be tapping into this evolved brain, which is this is a pain in the ass to get to Whole Foods and to get the foods, wherever you get them you know sprouts, or whatever you go

483
00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And with intention and deliberateness because this is the medicine. This is what the body wants its fuel. It's a very different relationship with food.

484
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so watch if I eat a nutrient rich food. DO YOU KEEP YOU KEEP BRINGING IT IN NOW YOU EAT UNTIL YOUR STOMACH kind of expand a little bit and you're done, you're not going to keep eating a whole bunch of

485
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole grains, short, short, whole grain brown rice with a little bit of this a little bit, right, you're, you're going to stop.

486
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You've had enough. Okay, you needed that you need fuel, you're done.

487
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Sugar. Sugar, sugar, you don't need it but it tastes so good. You're getting the domain.

488
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And your guts like stop and making you sick.

489
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say you can never get enough of what you don't need

490
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You might keep exercising, you didn't need all that exercise and keep doing it. It could be an alcohol. You didn't need that it's never going to be enough. It could be a toxic relationship that's not what you need. You could began

491
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it could be some people, it's a it's a pornography or it's a sex or it's a that's not you can never get enough of it.

492
00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You'd never will, because it's not what you needed what you needed was to take a second you've pulled over you, please, you're breathing, like what's that I can never get enough. What am I trying to do.

493
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I never actually going to be satiated from eating this stuff at fast food, it will not say she ate.

494
00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And you you don't know what that question was that second one. Once you really grow up with this this freezes, it's what do I really need right now. That's the question.

495
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm lonely.

496
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to feel this

497
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I text someone I call someone I write someone I hope my dog I spend time with myself, I create time I take a whole day off from work, because it's that important.

498
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That is not habitual for you. You don't have that mindset yet.

499
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You can never get enough of what you don't need

500
00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's it's it's a cool phrase. And once you really get it, you're like, Oh my gosh, I could catch myself doing excess things and I can use this to turn inward and find out what do I really want right now.

501
00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I fueling my body and my mind my spirit and my soul.

502
00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Or did I just do that automatic thought because I've been doing it since eight because I didn't have. Right. I didn't have a caregiver there for me when I need it. I'm food has become that caregiver.

503
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Your relationship with food. I think may need to change. If you want to

504
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.770
Nick Graham: Yeah.

505
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:28.410
Nick Graham: I think so. I think I'm

506
00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.910
Nick Graham: I'm trying to think about periods of time when I'm like

507
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:42.540
Nick Graham: I'd like gone like on my way to like some place to get food. And I'm like, it's like the same takeover is like when I was going to get high. Like, you know,

508
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:51.120
Nick Graham: Like, just like the feeling when making I was, I remember at times being like you at first, you're like wait, I shouldn't do this. And then you rationalize it then you're doing and you're like, fuck it.

509
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.240
Nick Graham: Yeah, you know, so I've definitely felt that so I could

510
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.470
Nick Graham: I could like, I definitely get that I think

511
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.270
Nick Graham: Yeah, yeah. I get that. Okay.

512
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:11.580
Nick Graham: That's all good gut health. Yeah, I think gut health is a good. I think that's a very a lot about that, I'd like to learn more about gut health

513
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that now. That's an increase. That's a I can increase information. There's no I don't even have to make a behavior.

514
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just increase my knowledge that can be a task. Right. That has to do is, I'm not going to do something impulsively. I'm going to gather information. I'm going to learn more. And we'll see. But it's an investment understanding of how to have a change relationship with food.

515
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is not to say that

516
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: like ice cream and pizza. Thanks, that are salty.

517
00:53:53.040 --> 00:54:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: shimmery high fat right there's there's a great reward. That's like dope. I mean stuff going on and but everything kind of like moderation.

518
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The problem that it's not a

519
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: body is telling you

520
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: For

521
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.310
Nick Graham: Really long time

522
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Knock it off.

523
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You're ignoring it.

524
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a long

525
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: TV, you do need to see a new nutritionist or see a primary care person and find out if maybe you are lactose intolerant. I don't know. Maybe that's worth also checking out

526
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Oh goodness me, um, let me check on a couple more things down here. Um,

527
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.910
This one's 5.5 to 2728

528
00:54:51.120 --> 00:55:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to give her an individual. Okay, more connections with people going through the same thing. So that's a goal you set. Tell me, tell me more with that.

529
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:08.040
Nick Graham: No, not really.

530
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:10.500
Nick Graham: I'm not really anywhere with that.

531
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:18.360
Nick Graham: Currently, so I think like maybe at the time of the goal, like I just needed more connections with people.

532
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.350
Nick Graham: I've kind of there a couple friends that

533
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:24.330
Nick Graham: You know, we talked about

534
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:29.520
Nick Graham: Substance use, but I feel like it just turns into like a like a giant like

535
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:39.990
Nick Graham: I just think that there are more productive things to focus on in that like I'm getting help for that. And I don't think that like maybe I'm wrong. I don't perhaps them around, but

536
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:51.150
Nick Graham: It's annoying and it's self defeating when I hear people just talk about their sleeves and like, yes, like I get it, I was there, but

537
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:53.550
Nick Graham: I don't like he's bitching about

538
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.780
Nick Graham: How I want it. I don't know. I think that

539
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.530
Nick Graham: Message. I feel about it.

540
00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

541
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:03.540
Good.

542
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Thoughts just now.

543
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:09.420
Nick Graham: But I think if I hear you. I

544
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Think what you're saying is

545
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That when the topic of substance use comes

546
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:17.460
Up.

547
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And you don't like being around it.

548
00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, one of the reasons why I liked this goal you set for yourself which was connections with people going through the same strain addiction, has to do with this.

549
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to do with the relief shame.

550
00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're there all by

551
00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself, being able to

552
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear that, that your social medicine. That's this right and wireless or wired for connection.

553
00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay, you're okay. Am I still okay you seem okay we're okay. I'm okay, you're okay. We're just constantly going going, going, and what happens in a group setting and you haven't benefited from it in here because of insurance you are missing out on a big piece of this

554
00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But there it is. So what can happen in group is you hear yourself say

555
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I Benji.

556
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And you look at people's faces and they go, oh yeah, man. Me too. I use that I've been doing that since I was little, and I feel like it's gotten worse since I'm not

557
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting drugs at now it's like it's taken its place and that compulsivity that that singular focus of automatic. You're not even thinking

558
00:57:52.110 --> 00:58:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: anymore. You're like this this. It's just you're in a zone, you're just going to get it and you've eaten it and you don't even remember doing it. It's much like you know you're not going to be able to have that social

559
