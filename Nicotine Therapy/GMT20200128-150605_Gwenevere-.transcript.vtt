00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.549
Gwenevere Abriel: We're checking on the volume here.

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.700
wasn't working.

3
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Test.

4
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.230
Marianne todd: Can you hear me.

5
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.930
Marianne todd: Yes, okay. It did the same thing when I logged into the admissions to

6
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

7
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.820
Marianne todd: Yeah, I had to restart my phone and call her back because nothing was working

8
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

9
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.780
Marianne todd: Well, why

10
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't either.

11
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me just get a little something here. I'LL SHOW. SHOW. SHOW. Yes. Okay. So today, um, I'd like to work with you.

12
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Individually, if that's okay.

13
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.720
Marianne todd: Yeah, excellent.

14
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm opening up a note.

15
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.470
Marianne todd: Now people are pretty major things that have happened that I really need to talk to you about as well.

16
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.050
Marianne todd: Pain.

17
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.130
Marianne todd: There we go.

18
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do want to not only be this sort of support for kind of a listening ear and having someone to bounce things off. But I also want to continue to keep pressing forward to resolving underlying issues with gotta persevere through that, too.

19
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But I really want to hear what what what are you going through what what's going on.

20
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:19.050
Marianne todd: Whoa. Verse three, how to situation at work. You know how I told you I went up to customer service. So I handle doing returns cashing checks, like all a ton of financial things basically

21
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:35.280
Marianne todd: Well, nobody had made me aware that anything over $50 without a receipt as a return needed CSM approval and the computer usually it'll prompt you and tell you you need a CSM approval and you can override it without that CSM overriding it

22
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:48.060
Marianne todd: Well, I had done one return and it never popped up and said anything never said I needed to CSM approval, like my CSM was right there when I started the return and never said anything.

23
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:58.080
Marianne todd: Well then next thing I know, she's telling me you know you shouldn't have done this return and let them know what the policy was. And I was like, okay, I thought that was that.

24
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.310
Marianne todd: Well, the next day I got into work and they called me to the back and I got a coaching for it, which is basically like a write up

25
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:17.490
Marianne todd: Okay wasn't bad enough, then I get told a couple of hours later that I'm going to be talking about a customer service and I'm going to cuz I told them shut up. But it was a training issue that I had never been made aware of it.

26
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.130
Marianne todd: Because that is one thing there about about is they don't train everybody the proper way like they should

27
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:35.160
Marianne todd: And so then they told me they were going to take me off and they were going to retrain me on the as a cashier than they were going to retrain me on self checkout, then they would think about putting me up to customer service.

28
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:46.290
Marianne todd: Which really had me upset because they just don't even after talking to a couple other supervisors. They're telling me that I need to go to the store manager, because that shouldn't fall on me.

29
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.200
Marianne todd: That it should fall on them for not training me the proper way and making me aware of all those policies.

30
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

31
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that a lot of what this week is about is this self evaluation of how unfair. This is unfair. This is, this is horrible, like is it around that stress of

32
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:18.360
Marianne todd: Know like I think I mostly got past that like I was able to kind of like stuck that up. You know what I mean. And plus, they're still scheduling me on customer service, so I don't get it at all.

33
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:28.950
Marianne todd: But I think the thing that I'm having a hard time with is what me and bonito went through, like, and this just happened a couple of nights ago and

34
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:40.380
Marianne todd: Needless to say, I was extremely upset so you know how I talk to you a lot about him thinking I'm cheating and security and not and everything else. Well,

35
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:52.230
Marianne todd: I had actually started being more loving towards him. Okay, and two days into it. He like he started flipping out like just really angry.

36
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.490
Marianne todd: Didn't know what was wrong with them. So finally I asked him, I'm like Babe, what's going on.

37
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.320
Marianne todd: And he's like, well, you've been being really weird. The past couple of days and I think you're up to something and de de de. He's like, I know you're cheating on me.

38
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:14.040
Marianne todd: And I'm just like, Oh my God, are you serious, you know what I mean. I'm like, Why do you think that, and he's like, well, you're being more loving. I feel like you're just trying to distract me

39
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:25.290
Marianne todd: And I'm just gonna wait a minute, really. And then so um when I had ended up relaxing and using heroin, for the first time he had downloaded the spy app on my phone.

40
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.040
Marianne todd: And that's how he found out that I was using because I want to come forward to him about it. You know what I mean.

41
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:42.750
Marianne todd: And so he started bringing up the spy up and I told my said, I don't care if you don't download it. I said, I have nothing to hide from you. I said, I guarantee you're not going to find anything. You know what I mean.

42
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.470
Marianne todd: And so he downloads it and it's telling him that I'm going like 20 miles away that day.

43
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.030
Marianne todd: And I knew it was full of crap and he started getting he was so mad, but he was like shaking and just ready to put out

44
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:06.750
Marianne todd: Well, when I kept smarten up and down to him, like, no, that thing is full of crap that's not true. And then, so he ended up looking at the GPS on my phone and found out that he was wrong.

45
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:18.360
Marianne todd: Well all night. He continued to stay angry with me. And when I brought up. Well, I'm like, Why are you so mad like you've proven that I'm not doing anything.

46
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:29.610
Marianne todd: And then it turned into, well, I feel like you're just trying to prove me wrong. Now you're just trying to rub it in my face that you were right and blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, No, like I'm trying to get you to understand how hurt. I am

47
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:37.470
Marianne todd: Because I know I'm not doing anything in the one time in my life that I'm trying to do the right thing. I'm still being accused of doing something

48
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:55.020
Marianne todd: And. But then the next day, like I actually came home to roses and a letter and he apologized and everything, but it's still driving me nuts because I don't know what to do. You know what I mean, to get him to realize that I'm not doing anything.

49
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on, hold that sentence right get him to realize

50
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.500
Marianne todd: That's the one.

51
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: That energy

52
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one you could if you wanted to. It's not your job. There is nothing that you can do to get them to realize you just did what he asked for. He gave, you gave him affection and he managed to twist that you cannot move him. You cannot get him.

53
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: To realize

54
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This is

55
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: On his terms it is when he's ready to let go of this and start to look at himself that the changes are going to happen.

56
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.820
Marianne todd: We don't know how to cope with that you

57
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, that's something else.

58
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the work I want to do with you. Okay, so let's do this, remind me what kind of are you on iPad or phone

59
00:07:49.380 --> 00:08:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Phone. Okay. Go grab. Let's do some work around this. Okay. Go grab two things that are higher than your phone that we can sit next to it. I need a about what is that about a foot and a half about 18 inches.

60
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Go grab that put them next to the phone. I'm going to go use the ladies room. I'll be right back.

61
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna get some

62
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.940
Marianne todd: I got two cans hairspray.

63
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it.

64
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.260
Marianne todd: I'm just trying to get a better setup here, everything's like awkward.

65
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. What we want is so that it's off to the side so that when I do this, and I say, Look Left look right that you're actually looking at like the tops of them.

66
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And the reason I'm doing that is because normally right i would have this light that you'd be watching, but it's just too small, on a phone.

67
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.190
So,

68
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me watch your eyes for a second. You might be too far away. The reason is because we need your eyes doing this, you need to be able to move about.

69
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Half. If you're so far back here. You're only moving like a

70
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.700
Marianne todd: Like a couple inches. Yeah, I'll hold on my screen.

71
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.270
Marianne todd: Okay, my stuff. Is it makes it a

72
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.110
Marianne todd: pain in the butt.

73
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.950
Marianne todd: Work, but I'll try it.

74
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.100
Marianne todd: Is that any better.

75
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, are you, you're right in front of it.

76
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.760
Yeah.

77
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.420
Marianne todd: You want huh

78
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:19.680
Marianne todd: It's just like

79
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.440
Marianne todd: But what was it, I don't have anything like

80
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:23.400
So,

81
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The cans of hairspray or to the side about 18 inches or so.

82
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.150
No.

83
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.380
Marianne todd: No, they are okay so

84
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.850
This would be

85
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This is 11

86
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.160
Marianne todd: I think maybe even

87
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Depends on how far away, or that 1111 inches might be okay.

88
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see your eyes moving back and forth from those tops of those two objects.

89
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: As a little far bring them bring them in closer

90
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they about the width of paper.

91
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.520
Marianne todd: Called they were before. Yeah.

92
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so about the width. This is about 11 inches from here to here, right.

93
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.350
Marianne todd: In half

94
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: By 11. Okay, so there are about that distance right now.

95
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay. So now let me see you going back and forth.

96
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the is not the face.

97
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And arm. How many arms, legs, are you an arm length like this elbow to fingertip away how how far away are you from those

98
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.900
Marianne todd: From these, like, I don't know. It's about as close as the cameras.

99
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no. I mean, take your hand and reach

100
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.040
Marianne todd: Oh, like

101
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.030
Marianne todd: It. All right.

102
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.240
Marianne todd: All right here on my arm. Okay.

103
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I think we'll be okay you you might find that you're too close. If your eyes start to get like strained. I would step pull back like five inches foot six inches. I would pull back.

104
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to need to find that

105
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.530
Marianne todd: That range where you can

106
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Put because it for it to be effective. We've got to be able to do this a few iterations, quite a few iterations of it.

107
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, so what I'd like to do today is we'll see if we can get into being able to do some of the bilateral stimulation

108
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: For someone to do some preparation. Okay.

109
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And

110
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, I want you to be able to either do this like stop can say stop and that can be distress in the body.

111
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you could be so emotionally activated that you want to stop. You could also encourage more like let's say I start to interrupt you, or something and you want to continue along that

112
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Train of Thought, you're more than welcome to also sort of signal. Now I want to keep. I want to keep going.

113
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to let me just double check and see if we developed

114
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you and I do. I don't remember who's in group and

115
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you develop the container feel like it did.

116
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.250
Marianne todd: Yeah, I did. Okay.

117
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And yours was what

118
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.910
Marianne todd: Pink save what sparkles all over it and a light pink.

119
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Pink safe with sparkles.

120
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, nice. Okay, so we're going to use that right at the end, possibly, we need to sort of safe keep what we're doing. We'll put it there and it has a lock and you have the key.

121
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.980
Marianne todd: Mm hmm client on me.

122
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, another one I want to do important for this process is let's do some imagery and we're going to be using this inner energy imagery, so are my ears are

123
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Congested today.

124
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well out of it. So,

125
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing

126
00:14:51.540 --> 00:15:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Figure her a protective figure wise figure. Want to have those in the mind today. So let's really cultivated if you weren't able to put him completely together before

127
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put them together today. So which one seems the easiest one to summon up a protective figure, make it be real or imagined.

128
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.510
Marianne todd: Protected for your

129
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.470
Uh huh.

130
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:19.530
Marianne todd: Um, I would say my step dad. There we go. He stepped out

131
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And is it all of him, or just parts because I don't want there to be ambivalence, because we're going to need to be pulling this in as a resource for you.

132
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.590
Marianne todd: Know,

133
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no mixed. I, for some reason, I have in my mind that he did something negative to you and

134
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:44.880
Marianne todd: Yeah, but like, when he had done the things that he done. He was on drugs really bad.

135
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:45.690
And

136
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:56.340
Marianne todd: Yeah, so every since he's been sober. He's a completely different person. And so me and him are actually really close now. Got it.

137
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's this sense of the real him the authentic.

138
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.760
Marianne todd: Yeah yeah

139
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay step.

140
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:09.840
Marianne todd: I was never able to understand that till I went through what I went through. But now I do when now we're really close because of it.

141
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey. And what about a nurturing figure real or imagined. I know this one might be difficult, but it can be a combination of fantasy things you've read seen images animals that can be whatever you want, nurturing,

142
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:32.160
Marianne todd: Nurturing, I can say, my mom because I WASN'T THERE IN EVERY WAY BUT nurturing is one thing she was

143
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And why I think the last figure

144
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.800
Marianne todd: I would honestly have to say bonito.

145
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so for now kind of close your eyes and really breathe into picturing protective figure in Step Dad.

146
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure, his movements his actions. His face his temperament, the sense of being surrounded by this protective figure

147
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And then have this nurturing figure join the room with you this creating this whole team.

148
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a protective figure your mom, the imagery of really embodied in that, uh, that nurturing behavior and she's in the room to

149
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this wisdom that comes

150
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: With Benito in this figure, and that they're all their

151
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: surrounding you.

152
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you feel as you imagine this.

153
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.180
Marianne todd: Quote calm.

154
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: calm and happy.

155
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.770
Definitely want that.

156
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And for

157
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: A distancing metaphor.

158
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to picture something where, let's say something distressful comes up and you want to put some distance the containers. Kind of cool. That's where we box it up and leave it until we meet again, let's say,

159
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But for distancing. Let's say we want to just distance it but want to be able to still work with it, but we want to put a little bit of distance. Try and picture, let's say,

160
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What this feeling you had this confusion this mixed message, maybe about Benito his response or what happened at work.

161
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And just picture maybe on a river that it's floating

162
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe on a log or on a leaf and it's passing. It's just drifting away from you while you stay on the riverbank

163
00:18:50.100 --> 00:19:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a distancing metaphor or for you. It might be a train car like you can see the train and it's in one of those train cars and that train is continuing to pass away on the train track.

164
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, what what metaphor comes up with. I want to have this distance where it's a way for me and it's moving away.

165
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:20.280
Marianne todd: I would say on the beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and it being on a boat.

166
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: On a boat Myrtle Beach and it's sort of driving away.

167
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.360
Marianne todd: Yeah, got

168
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:31.800
It.

169
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, I'd like you to think about, you know, that zero to 100 thing I want you to think about maybe something

170
00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That we can start with one of these things that has been disturbing you this week, or sort of present in your life. Which one would you want to focus on. Do you want to focus on the one that happened with I was extremely upset with the Neato or do you want to do the one at work.

171
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.230
Marianne todd: Going on with Benito okay

172
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And how distressing zero to 100 was that

173
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.590
Marianne todd: All right, definitely say 100

174
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I was 100

175
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, okay.

176
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what feelings you had, what were the emotions there.

177
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.860
Marianne todd: I was really frustrated and hurt weight.

178
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.180
Marianne todd: And I just felt really defeated. Yeah.

179
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.650
Hey,

180
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And as you think about it. Now, is there any awareness in the body.

181
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.780
Marianne todd: I'd say like my whole body like just fills Ken's then

182
00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.240
Marianne todd: Like just, I don't know how to explain it just really tense.

183
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Whole body feeling tense. And when you think about that event.

184
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it say about you. What's this belief you have about yourself and you think about this event.

185
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting it sort of this belief about who you are and a negative cognition. So I want you to think about how you're thinking about this event and how to play it out and frustrated and hurt and defeated and you might know with that belief is about the self.

186
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: With an I am statement if you can find that

187
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:45.360
Marianne todd: Like with me being sober. Like, I would say I am extremely loyal.

188
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.370
Marianne todd: And just a fighter. Like, I don't know.

189
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.290
Marianne todd: How to explain. I'm just a fighter and a hard worker and

190
00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.090
Marianne todd: My love for him isn't enough that it's worth it. You know what I mean.

191
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.270
Marianne todd: Like it's worth fighting for, like, I don't know how to explain it.

192
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Your love for Benito is worth fighting for.

193
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.040
Marianne todd: Yeah.

194
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:19.950
Marianne todd: Okay, so like I have a lot of fight in me and a lot of loyalty and me when it comes to my love for him. You know what they mean. Okay.

195
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Those sound like you tell me positive beliefs about yourself.

196
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.420
Marianne todd: Is that right

197
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You do like those. Yeah, I think fighter. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, very nice, very nice.

198
00:22:43.800 --> 00:23:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't you for a moment. Let's do a little deeper work. Let's do some bridging to something maybe in the past. I want you to become aware of when you were in the argument. You said you were in a distress of 100. It was one of the worst experiences you've ever had. Is that right,

199
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.700
Marianne todd: Maybe will be you.

200
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:08.880
Marianne todd: Well,

201
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.410
Marianne todd: I guess I rated thought

202
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's okay let's, let's, yeah.

203
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's not

204
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.140
Marianne todd: Let's okay yeah

205
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What we're doing it would

206
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.970
Marianne todd: I would say at least 75 to 80 then

207
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, speaking number you got you've got five numbers in there 75 to 80 let's get as close as you can do exactly what you want.

208
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:34.770
Marianne todd: Ad

209
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, got it. There we go. All right. And so you're at an 80 and feeling frustrated or undefeated and at the time. Do you remember what negative thought you had at the time.

210
00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.770
Marianne todd: Oh yeah, like my negative thoughts were

211
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.010
Marianne todd: Like, how are used to view myself.

212
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:15.450
Marianne todd: Like, and I think that's what made it so hard, because when I was using I even though I loved him. I didn't have that loyalty anymore and I didn't have that care. So it takes me right back to that with him thinking

213
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.550
Marianne todd: That I'm cheating on him.

214
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.480
Marianne todd: Like, it makes me feel like an old person again.

215
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I am what I am.

216
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: These are hard. Take your time. They're hard to get to

217
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.960
Marianne todd: Work really hard, like I just

218
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.950
Marianne todd: It's the thought of being useless.

219
00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.440
Marianne todd: Of being

220
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.250
Marianne todd: I don't know, just cold hearted selfish.

221
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:52.740
Okay.

222
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So that night. You remember thinking to like I'm

223
00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I I'm useless.

224
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember that one.

225
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.440
Marianne todd: Yeah, like, yeah, like that's the first thing that popped in my head. Okay.

226
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold on to that and let's do some bridging and see if you can find the earliest time where that I'm useless. It's all. See if you can go back in history.

227
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The earliest age and the most intense, we had a sense I am useless.

228
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:39.840
Marianne todd: I would say when I was 19 and my son got taken away for me. Yeah.

229
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do you feel as you think about that now.

230
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.960
Marianne todd: I still feel sick to my stomach thinking about it.

231
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.610
Marianne todd: I just feel a lot of anger and

232
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.240
Marianne todd: Hate towards that whole situation.

233
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Toward

234
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.880
Marianne todd: My ex husband and his mom.

235
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little, little desensitization. Let's do some bilateral stimulation. So this is new for you.

236
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me tell you what this process is

237
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What this is

238
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a bit of exposure therapy and it's integrating will be installing some positive cognition will be installing some of the

239
00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Positive nurturing figures, we're going to be doing all of that, but a really important piece of this is the desensitization so noticing that you're crying that some of that activation is present now.

240
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: what this can do

241
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This bilateral stimulation is

242
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You sensitize dulled down the emotional impact without event.

243
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want to bring in weave in the positive, so it's not going to feel like this all day with me, but there may be some distress as you bring it into the working memory. Okay, so this is what I'm going to be asking you to do so that you know what's coming. Okay.

244
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice you just went somewhere important, that means it's still really intense.

245
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And

246
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm going to be doing is I'm

247
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now you can stop what you want member, you can do this or stop.

248
00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Saying is the following. Okay. Mary and I want you to bring up that image I want you to picture the worst picture of that image of that memory.

249
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to bring up the negative cognition, I am useless. And then you're going to try your best.

250
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To hold it. And while the bilateral stimulation is going on. Okay. And then I'm going to be asking you, I'll be checking in on how the body's doing I'll be

251
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: On suds or sometimes I may just be going back to back.

252
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to be a lot of processing will be going. It's not like regular talk therapy will just be a quick check in, what's coming up for you, you'll tell me, and then we might go right back to it. Okay, this will feel a little different.

253
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

254
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.160
I am going to

255
00:28:50.310 --> 00:29:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: See if this works. So you're picturing the tops of you can see where you are that your eyes are going to be following my finger at that pace, it will change because when I'm installing something positive, the rate changes my movie, the rate may change. Okay.

256
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So remember you can always stop will be doing it for about about 3040 seconds.

257
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go, nice deep breath in and exhale.

258
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And Marianne, what I want you to do is I want you to bring up from the hippocampus. Oh, you've got all this stored memory wants to bring it up into working memory. I want you to picture the worst picture. The worst part of that event.

259
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to pull up the I'm useless negative cognition.

260
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to go with that. OK. And now let's look from one to Jerry go back and forth to the tops of those camps.

261
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's breathe in through the nose.

262
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, letting it go

263
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what came up for you.

264
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.040
Marianne todd: You're talking about the worst imagery

265
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right now. What's coming up for you.

266
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a quick check in.

267
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.970
Marianne todd: picturing my has been running, not the birthplace on

268
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want you to hold that picture that is that the worst thing and then I am useless.

269
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And another iteration. Here we go. Let's go with that.

270
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's breathe in together into the nose.

271
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale out.

272
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you noticing about yourself.

273
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:36.810
Yes.

274
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:48.360

Marianne todd: So what I do everything I can to avoid thinking about it.

429
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What's important about what you did.

430
00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:27.600
Marianne todd: I don't know, I feel like it's important because it just makes me stronger, to be able to look back of it.

431
00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:31.620
Marianne todd: In to talk about it.

432
00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.390
Marianne todd: Did you

433
00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:35.940
Marianne todd: Always have the

434
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:50.760
Marianne todd: Just always have this huge fear about getting emotional and getting upset or thinking about the situation like it just scares me about it. I'm going to end up relaxing because of it because I've just never known how to cope with it. Yes.

435
00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And do a little bit of it in here. Did you bring it up and think about

436
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: How

437
00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:02.430
Marianne todd: Did you

438
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:03.150
End up

439
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you cope

440
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:17.340
Marianne todd: No, I just have to calm myself down and make myself realized that it was who I was in the policy that's not who I am. No.

441
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not who you are. You did that.

442
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you hear me, given some long philosophy, some long lecture. No, you did that.

443
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You did not fall apart.

444
00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You sat with that. And you also remember you started at 90 and you move down move down I checked in. I went down to 20 and

445
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't check in many, many times, but I could have in my guess is it's continuing sometimes it bumps back up and comes back down and it moves as you're running through different beliefs about the self and and things like that, but

446
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see that you see that you were able to cope with it.

447
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: How close is this idea of money to escape into heroin or other substance closest

448
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:26.520
Marianne todd: I don't think it's close. I mean, it's something that every time I even crosses my mind it's like I instantly fight my way out of it.

449
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.500
Marianne todd: Okay.

450
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you find it with

451
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:41.850
Marianne todd: Just my pride in myself now. Like, how much better, right Phil, how much of a huge change. I've seen in myself and not wanting to give up.

452
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty important that you remember that, isn't it, that that be true. I'm a fighter and they take pride in doing

453
00:53:53.490 --> 00:54:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That negative on that negative one. Notice how when you were talking about with Benito

454
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That argument of I feel useless.

455
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That helplessness from way back at night.

456
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Is connected. It looks similar. This event this

457
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:15.120
Like

458
00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Solve this thing with what's going on with can come up that same feeling

459
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's important that we're leaving

460
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Other stuff to

461
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's in the past. What is present is you are literally biologically chemically a different person now.

462
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Have access to resources ready

463
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You have back then.

464
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:46.470
Okay.

465
00:54:50.010 --> 00:55:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing when you're at work or when you're about to be around someone that might bring up feelings of distress like useless. Right, well you picture. Some imagery that we did we bring your team and sit with it.

466
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And surround you.

467
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if from that position, you can make a decision that you were proud of because this moment, we have this is the one we could do something with that other one that stuff's in the past doesn't have to be relive this moment anymore.

468
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So whatever's left over. Let's put it in the container.

469
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything we're kind of going to need to put in there for a little while. I could pick it up at a later time can open it up the pink safe or anything you want to leave in there.

470
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:54.480
Marianne todd: You don't have the flu honestly don't think so. Okay, so there you go. Okay, with everything.

471
00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Excellent. Well, I'm really impressed you worked very hard. You went to a painful place and you work through it all on your own, you did this, you take pride in that you see that right

472
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't do I did you all I did was point my finger.

473
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: You know, fatigue, there might be some things that come up just communicate with me and let me know if something feels a little different, long before you even entertain the idea of acting on on any negative action. Okay, just reach out to me, let me know.

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, I can't hear you yet. I'm waiting to see if I can hear.

510
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:50.490
Bryanna Terry: The audio was

511
00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotcha. Now I can hear you loud and clear. Very nice.

512
00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're in in this sort of waiting

513
01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:04.260
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, all

514
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.460
Bryanna Terry: I all I'm waiting for is my background checks clear

515
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's like, every day, you're wondering, you're waiting like they don't know

516
01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:22.680
Bryanna Terry: Well, like she said she'd be calling me sometime this week and I was like, well, because, you know, I still have an like my other job that

517
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:30.450
Bryanna Terry: I told them this will be my last week, but I was like, well, I wish I would have known you know our last you could have been right. Last week, you know, I wish I would have known that I would kept working

518
01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly.

519
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, going

520
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:45.870
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, but like everything else that's like my drug screen everything. It's all clear. I'm the only like big sent me the employee handbook and stuff to fill out and everything like that. So I don't know what's going on.

521
01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Background check. So there's a variable, they work. And when the company is taking longer

522
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.300
Bryanna Terry: So yeah, a lot of things like back east

523
01:00:54.450 --> 01:01:01.200
Bryanna Terry: To so like like my drug screen with back east, and so I guess I don't know. Maybe that could be a

524
01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:03.600
Okay.

525
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:14.640
Open for you here.

526
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How's the communication going with your boyfriend.

527
01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your audio just

528
01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:08.550
Bryanna Terry: Um, it's a lot better. We. We. Sometimes we'd have like nor like little you know like fights here and there are like disagreements, but we really haven't had any, um, since the last time we talked

529
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you attribute that to

530
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.070
Bryanna Terry: Um, well, cuz now I'm trying to like instead of like

531
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:30.120
Bryanna Terry: Just blowing up. I tried to express like um you know try that. I feel like, and it's helping a lot better because that way I can express my emotions and not just like yella and

532
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't mind, I'd like to hear a little bit of a specific thing that maybe you said connect check on it because I did hear a little something I want to check in on it.

533
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:44.610
Bryanna Terry: I love not like it's like like

534
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:47.340
Bryanna Terry: And

535
01:02:49.680 --> 01:03:00.570
Bryanna Terry: See what what were we doing, oh well, our car that we had just bought like a couple like in December, has a blown head gasket or Blow Blow motor

536
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:15.150
Bryanna Terry: And oh, like we were still making payments on it. And so like I was really frustrated because I wasn't able to get to work for two days last week. Today I have a car and like

537
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:26.190
Bryanna Terry: I was getting upset at him, because I felt like he wasn't trying to do anything for me, you know. So instead of like just yelling at him like you're not helping me you're not doing anything. I was like,

538
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:36.690
Bryanna Terry: I said I feel frustrated when you don't help try to find me a ride because money and work is important to me.

539
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did he say, That's beautiful. What did he say to that. Think about his face. What did you do right away.

540
01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:52.230
Bryanna Terry: You're just like, oh, he's like, what, but then you're like, okay, baby all let me see. I'll try to find your island I I'll call my mom.

541
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:53.940
Okay.

542
01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's really really sit with that for a second. So instead of right yelling and accusing and blaming and name calling even

543
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: If what you're telling me is true.

544
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: He seems like he was surprised by the way you

545
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you guys talk

546
01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: talk at all about how you were talking, did he go what what are you why are you talking so weird.

547
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:31.530
Bryanna Terry: Kinda us like what is that like, what, what did you say in the US, like what

548
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:39.510
Bryanna Terry: I thought of you do or learn to do that. Or why did you learn to do something like that in that area. And I was like, well, my

549
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:47.670
Bryanna Terry: Bright heart. She taught me how to good instead of just in that way we can communicate better and he said he likes it. Oh.

550
01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:48.510
Very nice.

551
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's keep it going.

552
01:04:54.060 --> 01:05:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming you're liking the effect because that's one of those things that you want is to have this improved communication. You don't want to be

553
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of yelling it upset showing your feelings you want to share your feelings and you, you did an experiment. And it worked. He looked he noticed the difference. Yeah.

554
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And and that argument, if you are really looking at how long that argument might have lasted had it gone the other way. How long would you have been pissed off at each other.

555
01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.210
Bryanna Terry: On Broadway, the whole day.

556
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.410
Bryanna Terry: And

557
01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how efficient that is gets done.

558
01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:29.850
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

559
01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's because when you think about human beings, we think about why do we bother to say anything at all to do anything at all, we're motivated by our emotion.

560
01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm drawn to this is going to be exciting. I'm curious about. It's interesting.

561
01:05:47.130 --> 01:06:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Or Oh, this is so immersive. I don't want to have anything to do with that we're driven by those intense emotions. Right. So why on earth would we not talk about those. They're the reason why we're bothering to talk

562
01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the reason is the reason why not having this car available right. It's why we're bothering to address it with your sweetheart. Right.

563
01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because you feel strongly. So it's efficient. Let's talk about the underlying emotion and you did it and it moved very quickly because now he doesn't have to interpret what you're doing. You don't have to analyze it. He doesn't have to try and read your mind he literally heard you.

564
01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Knows exactly how you're feeling and why

565
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a very direct way of communicating and then oftentimes it's just done.

566
01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So can we play with the flip side of that, how you can also, can we review a little bit of the mirroring

567
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, that's a hard one to do

568
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.450
Bryanna Terry: Yeah. Sorry, I'm a little bit sick.

569
01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Why did you not take your medicine. Did you take last what's going on.

570
01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.800
Bryanna Terry: Oh no, I have a an upper respiratory infection.

571
01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:09.930
Bryanna Terry: So,

572
01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:14.610
Bryanna Terry: Rid of that failure.

573
01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

574
01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually, as I recall, you're actually pretty naturally good at the at the mirroring

575
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:22.710
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

576
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check in on it. You did the I feel, which is powerful and that that is something you're going to be able to use everywhere.

577
01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the mirroring is a really good one. And it's awesome for kind of tense situations and it work too.

578
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, very convenient where we just sort of regurgitate what we heard. Yes. Did you have a chance to play with that new skill.

579
01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:56.310
Bryanna Terry: No, not yet. After like we did like cool because we bought a new car and stuff. And so it's been kind of like

580
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:01.350
Bryanna Terry: Not getting stressed, I guess, and there's not much to fight about

581
01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:09.510
Bryanna Terry: But I do want to try it. I have been looking I've just kind of waiting for an opportunity, but nothing has a Rosa.

582
01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get ready for it. Let's think about

583
01:08:17.190 --> 01:08:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Put something here. Give me boyfriends names, just so I don't keep calling a boyfriend.

584
01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.910
Bryanna Terry: named Adam Howard.

585
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, Adam. So at

586
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you to picture something that typically when Adam, let's find a place for me to land because I'm getting a little notch nauseous with like the screen moving so much plot me down on a couch or something.

587
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so picture something that out of might say, or you might get hurt or offended.

588
01:08:55.830 --> 01:09:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You might feel Shane activation. You might feel guilt. You might feel a boundary has been crossed. See if you can find something that's kind of a powerful experience and he really knows your button.

589
01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.020
Bryanna Terry: And he

590
01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Pushes it anyway.

591
01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you got one.

592
01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:31.410
Bryanna Terry: You got well like

593
01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:49.410
Bryanna Terry: He know like, Well, I guess I like things done a certain way, like I'm real OCD, like, you know, if I clean. If I make something in the kitchen I clean up right away or you know I clean up a mess. Or, you know, clean out the counters or something and

594
01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:54.990
Bryanna Terry: Now he's kind of the opposite. He's real messy so like a

595
01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.360
Bryanna Terry: You always tells me like you can't control everything. Or I'll do it my own way and

596
01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.860
Bryanna Terry: I just, I guess I started to freak out.

597
01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's the I will do it my way.

598
01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:21.720
Bryanna Terry: Yeah. Or like, like I give them suggestions on how to do things. You know that I normally do day to day that he's like you know taking over for me and he's like, I'll do it my way. And then it's just a whole mess.

599
01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.160
Bryanna Terry: Okay, it wasn't he wasn't really saying anything or, you know,

600
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm going to put I got that written down. I think we'll come back to that one. Let's do a different one. Let's do one where

601
01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Adam shares with you, his frustration over something he has been offended.

602
01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you have pushed his button.

603
01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.630
Bryanna Terry: Um,

604
01:10:53.040 --> 01:11:03.930
Bryanna Terry: When I like tell them how to do things because then like I get frustrated because he doesn't listen to me. Sometimes I get real mean with them and like you know column names and stuff. Okay.

605
01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: How does, what does he say when you are mean and call names. What does he do and say.

606
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:24.000
Bryanna Terry: No, and he tells me I don't need to act like a fucking beep. And that I can't control everything. And I just need a and because it's not done my way that that doesn't mean you're done good

607
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I got it. It's about

608
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This control thing and

609
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

610
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That that statement if I'm, if I'm out. And I'm saying I I'll do it. I'll do it my own way.

611
01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop being such a I'm assuming it's it's a bitch word is that without air.

612
01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

613
01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not offended by those things and it's useful if we can sort of get into it, unless you really don't want to be swearing, for some reason, I mean that's what actually is going on, we might as well use the right words.

614
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Yeah, I wouldn't want to swear, but I'm down with all the words.

615
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what people are talking to each other like that. We got to use the right ones. Okay, so

616
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: This is hard. This is probably going to be hard for you to do. So we're going to do an easy one first.

617
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to mirror me and mirroring is it starts with this phrase. Let me see if I heard you right. Let me see if I heard you correctly, let me see if I got that. Let me see if I'm hearing you see, do you see how they're all in common. It's a I'm checking in to see if I'm hearing you.

618
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how you're going to start and

619
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do an easy one.

620
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I

621
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I miss

622
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Going and find Adam I'm saying it really kind of benign one. I'm assuming it's benign, because it's not what you're saying here, so I miss

623
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Going out on weekends and

624
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And not having to think about responsibilities. So I made that up. Obviously, to ensure that with me.

625
01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, I don't know if I told you I've got this year condition. It's really bad today. Yeah, I gotta flip my head up some down so

626
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Here I'm going to do it again. And you're going to do.

627
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The script of

628
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see if I understand what you're going through right now. You can switch it up. So it's like more your style of talking, it doesn't have to sound like a robot.

629
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, until you get your groove.

630
01:13:55.110 --> 01:14:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And and keep in mind also he already knows that you're playing with communication skills, you can always be light hearted and say, well, I'm trying this mirroring thing on that, that when taught me.

631
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To show you that I am listening to you. I'm not putting in my own opinion. I'm not putting in there. My own analysis.

632
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because sometimes people are like, don't be saying the same stuff. I just said you

633
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So sometimes that can be the response. So I'm getting you ready for this other truth which is I

634
01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It may seem like that, yes, but its intention. Its purpose is to show you

635
01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That I'm not making it about me in this moment that I'm really listening to you. And then if we want it. You know, if you're interested in my interpretation or what I plan to do with it. Okay, fine, but I'm practicing really just listening.

636
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:52.020
Hearing

637
01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We get we're so quick to ALREADY HAVE OUR OUR REBUTTAL already stacked up our sort of list of evidence.

638
01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: In context of people are saying how it's not true.

639
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.910
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, that we

640
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: skipped over that we have to listen to our sweetheart, we have to show them that we are holding and containing their information. Okay, so all that aside, blah, blah, blah, blah. Back to role play. Here we go. I say to you,

641
01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: REALLY MISS going out on the weekends and not having to think about all these responsibilities, if you were just to mirror. Remember, it's exactly what I'm saying, especially if I use an emotion word. What do you say to me.

642
01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:41.340
Bryanna Terry: So let me see if I heard you correctly, you missed going out on the weekends and doing activities.

643
01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So then there's a couple more pieces. Then you say, Did I get that right. Did I hear that right

644
01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:51.750
Bryanna Terry: Did I get that right.

645
01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

646
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And does it seem like I have more

647
01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:00.330
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

648
01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So then you say, If you suspect like the face is kind of turned away or you know something, they're kind of hold back.

649
01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You can say, Is there more. Did I get that right. And then is there more so it starts with, let me see if I got that right. And then it's

650
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:22.320
Bryanna Terry: Is there more

651
01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, did they get that right, and is there more like giving them a chance. Like, you're not going to just be laying out your rebuttal. You're going to create this wide open plane for them to get out.

652
01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so there is more I might say is out of my mind. So yeah, and I'm I'm lonely.

653
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:47.640
Bryanna Terry: Let me see if I can just write your lowly

654
01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I notice

655
01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how at the end of your sentence is a question mark alone Lee.

656
01:16:55.890 --> 01:17:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't go out on the weekend notices a little question mark. You don't have to do that. Make a statement.

657
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to ask in real time. You're going to actually say, Did I get that right. You don't have to have that question mark with just the tone. You don't have to do that, you're going to literally ask it. You see the difference.

658
01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:18.630
Here.

659
01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, you did. So now let's go actually into a real one. You did great.

660
01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Try, try to not do the good question tone right and give it a shot. Here we go. So I'm going to be added in this time it's going to be more real, okay, because now I know what's really going on.

661
01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because there's a dynamic between you two you have strong preferences about how things need to be done, and when they're not done your way, you kind of go off the rails, a little bit right even

662
01:17:55.710 --> 01:17:56.040
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

663
01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said your mean

664
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

665
01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:05.850
Bryanna Terry: Name call. Yeah, well, it gets to that. Yeah, okay.

666
01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So this him doing it your way is very important to you.

667
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.730
Bryanna Terry: Well, not my way, but like clean and efficient.

668
01:18:22.050 --> 01:18:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Those whose ways. And if that's not your way. What have who determines efficient and clean. Isn't that you're

669
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:33.840
Bryanna Terry: already are. But all I asked you to do is clean up after you're done, or to do

670
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is probably going to be hard for you. Here we go.

671
01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can mirror. Now remember, mirroring does not mean you agree, you get that

672
01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It is just saying I can listen to what you're saying. I can, I can hear your perspective, that's a big piece and communication is the listener has to be able to hear

673
01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. I'm Adam. This is what I say. I say, my gosh. It's just you're such a pitch, which is just lay off everything doesn't have to be your way.

674
01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:32.520
Bryanna Terry: Let me see if I heard you correctly, think of a bitch and everything doesn't have to be my way. Did I get that right.

675
01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm sick of it.

676
01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Like back off.

677
01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:39.990
Bryanna Terry: Is

678
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.640
Bryanna Terry: Is that it is you

679
01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted you want to mirror that second piece.

680
01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:48.690
There was more. It was morrow.

681
01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:50.490
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

682
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:59.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how it's hard to do. Did you see that because this is more real. And did you notice it was harder to listen to me.

683
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.320
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

684
01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That's because we're activated our defenses are up the threat response has kicked in.

685
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:19.620
Bryanna Terry: It does not mean you agree it's just mirroring. It's just showing me

686
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: This last part when I said yeah and and I want you to just back off.

687
01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll do it. I'll do it my own way.

688
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can hear that back.

689
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Now with a question mark at the end.

690
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:51.930
Bryanna Terry: I mean, that's good. I mean, I don't know, I just, I don't see myself using this one. No.

691
01:20:52.230 --> 01:21:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. I know it feels super awkward. It is there's more to it than just, oh, I'm gonna do it like that. Right. Does it feel robotic or something.

692
01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why you're saying, yeah.

693
01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:03.300
Bryanna Terry: Yeah yeah

694
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what do you know why it doesn't seem realistic to do you know why.

695
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I wonder, wonder why you don't want to do it.

696
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:19.560
Bryanna Terry: All I just

697
01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.430
Bryanna Terry: I don't mean like what the fuck are you doing, what are you

698
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:26.790
Bryanna Terry: What do

699
01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You think he would do that.

700
01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:30.840
Bryanna Terry: I really forgot. Oh, why

701
01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you doing it. Why are you communicating differently. Why are you showing him you're listening. See if you can answer that. Why would you do that.

702
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:49.290
Bryanna Terry: Well, yeah, don't draw new ways innovation, when you

703
01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with me.

704
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, I'm Adam and I say, Why are you talking like that.

705
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you say to me.

706
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.430
Bryanna Terry: Into a meeting with you. Yeah.

707
01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to kill you. I'm listening. So, and you think that that's ridiculous.

708
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.030
Bryanna Terry: To show your sweetheart that you're

709
01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:14.010
Bryanna Terry: Just wondering you there.

710
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, why

711
01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:22.500
Bryanna Terry: Is unnatural. It doesn't feel like something I could do with him and

712
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:35.310
Bryanna Terry: May the, the other one. Yeah, that's been helpful. But this one you just be like, who is it like us like drew like people a mock him.

713
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's the one you just found it. That's it, that we just found that's the mock that's common what you just said. I think what you're saying is you're concerned if i'm out i'm right you're concerned that I'm going to get

714
01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Angry, not only at you're trying to control me but also now. You're mocking me.

715
01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's going to add another layer is that right

716
01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:00.810
Bryanna Terry: Yeah yeah

717
01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:02.970
The only thing is

718
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You weren't doing this from a therapist perspective, you weren't doing this from a perspective of integrating a new way of communicating. You never said no I'm genuinely

719
01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to make this moment about me.

720
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm genuinely showing you. I love you and care about the fact that you're feeling controlled i i'm working on myself right now, I'm just listening and I find this awkward to I find that okie and control.

721
01:23:39.090 --> 01:23:40.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to know.

722
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel like I actually heard you, Adam.

723
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have to keep repeating your words, but do you hear that I can hear you don't want to be controlled. You don't want to have to do it my way.

724
01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now does that sound disingenuous.

725
01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Doesn't sound mocking anymore does it

726
01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Know if that's why we kept pushing because if we really understand what the concern is

727
01:24:15.690 --> 01:24:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You can share why you're doing it, but you're going to have to have buy in Briana, if you think it's just the stupid crap you won't be able to sell it to

728
01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, so that's why we're doing it in real time right here. We're doing this role. Remember I said the real one is going to feel more difficult.

729
01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And it is notice your natural light. I can predict. Oh, he's going to get like stop talking like that. Knock it off. Don't make fun of what I'm saying, I don't want to hear my own words, slapping BE BACK IN THE FACE RIGHT.

730
01:24:50.130 --> 01:25:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but then you say i i i get i get that I'm saying your words back at you. I'm doing it because I don't think I've been showing you. I'm listening. In the past, and I want to

731
01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to show you. I'm actually hearing you. Before I give you know before I give you my perspective on it. So, no, I'm not making fun of you and this is hard to do. It's hard to actually just be a listener.

732
01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.360
Bryanna Terry: Yeah.

733
01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How hard it is. How hard is it for you to really just listen.

734
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.000
Bryanna Terry: Um,

735
01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:31.950
Bryanna Terry: It depends.

736
01:25:33.210 --> 01:25:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll notice, around, around, even this concept around clean

737
01:25:38.970 --> 01:25:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, Oh, you have a preference. Right. And notice, have you like knows how hard can it be just freaking clean it.

738
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.140
Bryanna Terry: Well, yeah.

739
01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:56.040
Bryanna Terry: It depends. Like, I'm like the person, place, thing.

740
01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:00.210
Bryanna Terry: I

741
01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:11.640
Bryanna Terry: Don't know. I guess I talked to, I can talk to anybody. I'll start talking to somebody in the Walmart line grocery store alarm. So like, I've always been very opinionated.

742
01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:16.560
Bryanna Terry: And

743
01:26:17.850 --> 01:26:21.900
Bryanna Terry: Nobody is nobody. They're both amazing so chill out and get along.

744
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, I can hear you. Let me see if I heard you correctly. Wait, wait, wait, let me see.

745
01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I heard you say I am fascinated and I talked to people in a line, let's say, at a store and then I didn't hear you. You're on what happens when you talk to people in a line.

746
01:26:41.850 --> 01:26:51.900
Bryanna Terry: Well, like I don't know. It's very social. But like, I'm like, I guess with opinionated, nobody's ever told me anything until I don't belong. So

747
01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.160
Bryanna Terry: No trouble.

748
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got a connection issue. So hold on. Nobody's ever told me

749
01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And just say it really clear ever told me why.

750
01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:12.570
Bryanna Terry: Nobody's really told me anything about being opinionated before like a pilot kept quiet around me until Adam came along.

751
01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. Oh my gosh. So nobody's ever sort of called you out about your opinion.

752
01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: About being an

753
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:25.740
Bryanna Terry: Exact way.

754
01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:34.050
Bryanna Terry: Know my dad's Exact same way so we don't get along, like we don't mean my daughter, we really don't get along.

755
01:27:37.770 --> 01:27:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, good listening to a group to there's a lot more to what's going on with that and just opinionated and is to write

756
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It was quite quite some stories in there. Yeah.

757
01:27:48.630 --> 01:28:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Alright, so what's this like to both love Adam and happy called out on the strong opinions you have what's this like for you.

758
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.840
Bryanna Terry: Um,

759
01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.470
Bryanna Terry: It's conflicting like

760
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:19.800
Bryanna Terry: You just always as usual stubborn or like everything doesn't have to be your way. And I'm like, Well, yes, it does. And so like we fight for a little bit.

761
01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:28.710
Bryanna Terry: And then like instead of like next time afterwards, though, I realized I realized I'm being real.

762
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:40.710
Bryanna Terry: Controlling so I tried to tell him you know like, hey, so like so like telling you how to do things, it kind of like try to instead I'm now I'm trying to, like, yo, suggest ways to do it.

763
01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:50.460
Bryanna Terry: Or like, Hey, babe. You know you instead of like yelling at him. Now, I tried to be like a baby. You know, you forgot to clean up the counter or hey, could you clean up the counter for me or you know

764
01:28:51.120 --> 01:29:07.080
Bryanna Terry: And so he's starting to do like a like he's starting to pick up like we made pork chops there night and he played off the counter from all of our bread crumbs and stuff. And like he he helps me, actually he's doing a lot more. So it's not in like as much

765
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're noticing you're changing your delivery.

766
01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.200
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, so

767
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:18.570
Bryanna Terry: I love him. I don't want to yell at him, or like talk down to them, you know, I don't want to thank you

768
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:23.430
Bryanna Terry: Yeah, I just don't want to talk down to them. So like I'm trying

769
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all about communication and delivery. Let's go a little deeper. Let's go at the need to

770
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.400
Bryanna Terry: Start. Let's go.

771
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: A little deeper into the need to control

772
01:29:44.280 --> 01:30:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Lets you and I have, what would be called a Socratic dialogue. I'm a real person. Okay. And it doesn't mean what I'm about to say is my actual opinion, but it will get you to really see what you really do believe in. So we're going to get in a kind of argument.

773
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're, you're not going to really know what I actually believe in, but let's just see. Let's have a little argument of our own.

774
01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm back to this clean

775
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:16.110
Is it a fat.

776
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That being clean is the right that his picking something up, let's, is it a wet towel on the floor like what's the thing he does the kitchen stuff in the same. What's the thing

777
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:39.930
Bryanna Terry: Like okay, for example, he is. He makes some butter finger shakes with Butterfinger ice cream and he puts like buttering up or you know like

778
01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:53.520
Bryanna Terry: He makes like he gets the mini buddy beers and put them in there while he smashes a month before you put them in there and we opened the damn containers. You know, like chocolate goes everywhere, or it's all over the calendar and he just leaves it doesn't pick it up.

779
01:30:55.410 --> 01:31:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now that feeling you have that tell me the emotion.

780
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it

781
01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.280
I'm

782
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:15.900
Bryanna Terry: Just like frustrated or, you know, like, I'm like, How can you not like I'm giving you just like allegiance leave it there.

783
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold on, you know, clean up there for a second. Stay there.

784
01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of own that I feel frustrated when you take the cap off and sticky stuff is everywhere. Now hold on to that you can you put me down for just a second. Brown, I'm getting a little queasy.

785
01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:36.120
Bryanna Terry: I don't have anywhere to put you or was

786
01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.500
Bryanna Terry: Just good coach or so.

787
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep that in mind for future sessions we want to have some hands are going to be free. Some of our work you'll be standing

788
01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: We do some with not just us sitting here in touch chit chatting sort of here, we're going to be doing some other kinds of interventions. So

789
01:31:55.080 --> 01:32:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can get that that planning ahead anyway let's focus here so I feel frustrated when really sit with that I'm feeling is frustrated stickiness is everywhere. The here's the next piece I want you to identify

790
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: His treatment of you. What is it that that says about who you are.

791
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning do you make of what's going on. What does it say about your value, what's important. What does it say about

792
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.580
You

793
01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:35.010
Bryanna Terry: I'm Allah, he doesn't really listen to me.

794
01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.190
Bryanna Terry: Okay, because I tell them all the time.

01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So can you you know over. Yeah, over and over and over. He doesn't listen

Gwenevere Abriel: What meaning you make of that, what does that say about who you are.

797
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:53.400
Maybe our girls.

798
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:55.860
Bryanna Terry: Oh, no.

799
01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:57.840
Bryanna Terry: Oh,

01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:03.390
Bryanna Terry: When I don't want you to listen or no.

802
01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Finish the sentence picture it happening over and over it already does it happens again and again the emotion is frustration. The belief about yourself. What do you believe about yourself, but that keeps happening. What do you believe about yourself.

803
01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll know it by finishing the sentence.

804
01:33:23.010 --> 01:33:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

805
01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.330
What do you believe

Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't spend a lot of time to sit a little longer with it. It'll come to you.

807
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: keeps happening. People keep doing the same thing over and over

808
01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:47.520

816
01:34:13.050 --> 01:34:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your opinion about pushovers

817
01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:19.710

01:35:04.710 --> 01:35:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Use this belief about yourself is coming up.

830
01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.170
Bryanna Terry: See if it's true.

831
01:35:11.970 --> 01:35:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't say something and make him hear me, I'm

832
01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If I don't make him change I'm weak, see if that's true. Don't. Don't answer me right away. Briana sit with it really get in there and see if what we're talking about is true if he doesn't change if he doesn't do it my way. I'm weak.

833
01:35:33.450 --> 01:35:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a pushover. I'm easily manipulated.

834
01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: See if that's true.

835
01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:57.690
Bryanna Terry: No, I wouldn't say it's true but like

836
01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:00.030
Bryanna Terry: Why

837
01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:13.680
Bryanna Terry: Like why no I didn't keep happening. Unless, I say something like, I mean, even if I say something, nothing happens. Well, it's like one ear and out the other.

838
01:36:14.190 --> 01:36:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. The fact that he does that, let's keep at this, we didn't find the core beliefs. Yet what does it say about you that he keeps doing it.

839
01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.910
Bryanna Terry: I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

840
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.380
Bryanna Terry: Know I

841
01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:33.630
Bryanna Terry: Think about what I have the same

842
01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does that mean that he doesn't think about you.

843
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:39.780
Bryanna Terry: I don't, I don't know.

844
01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.870
Bryanna Terry: All I can think of is doesn't listen to me.

845
01:36:49.890 --> 01:36:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it

846
01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if, if someone doesn't listen to you. What does that mean,

847
01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.700
Bryanna Terry: They don't care what I have to say, I don't know.

848
01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What

849
01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So find out if that one's

850
01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not cared for. Now let's try that one on. Okay, ready

851
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture him doing it again and again and again, leaving a mess.

852
01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel frustrated. That's the emotion and imagine that the meaning you make out of it is I'm not cared for.

853
01:37:29.130 --> 01:37:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, does that one feel true

854
01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:32.910
Bryanna Terry: No.

855
01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

856
01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you know, you're cared for.

857
01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:38.310
Yeah.

858
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see this week.

859
01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see him leaving things on the floor, the couch. The table in the kitchen, leaving things out and spoiling and leaving a mess. When you see those things again and again and again is not listening.

860
01:38:01.170 --> 01:38:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: In instead of

861
01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Spending time going Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why and changing

862
01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And changing him instead of changing him instead to check and see

863
01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm cared for. I know my sweetheart. Adam loves me and I'm cared for, because when something like really significant happens. He's got my back.

864
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I am cared for.

865
01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because he cleans the way I want things cleaned and cared for.

866
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: In more meaningful ways

867
01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine that you had access to that throughout the day. How do you think you'd feel around him.

868
01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:52.890
Bryanna Terry: It would be a lot different.

869
01:38:54.330 --> 01:38:56.430
Bryanna Terry: Because we're appreciative or more loved

870
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So what did you notice I pushed very hard.

871
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You pushed really hard and you hung in there for it. This is a moment to sort of process what this was, like, what did you notice what you just said and what you're what you're thinking about

872
01:39:17.730 --> 01:39:34.440
Bryanna Terry: Um, but you're like, you're right. Instead of like trying to, like, get him. I guess just do everything. Why we just try and see like why he has his way or you know under stand not everything's gonna be my way

873
01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:39.120
Bryanna Terry: And it's okay if it's not my way

874
01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.290
Bryanna Terry: Everybody has their own way of doing things.

875
01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is it

876
01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You are cared for.

877
01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:55.650
Bryanna Terry: Very

878
01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you are valuable.

879
01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.090
Bryanna Terry: Even

880
01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:04.830
People don't listen

881
01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're valuable and important.

882
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't change.

883
01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember this

884
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: is valuable.

885
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Even when he makes a mess and doesn't do it my way.

886
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can get there this week.

887
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:36.240
Okay.

888
01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm going to give you a little mantra, a quick one that will help you remember to turn that switch

889
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a pretty powerful one.

890
01:40:51.060 --> 01:41:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Typically Briana people spend a lot of energy trying to be right. In other words, it's logical. Hey, Adam. It's logical. You don't want a sticky mess the ants come the bugs. Come on my clothes stick to it. Everything sticks to it, it's you know, it's going to get solid, it's gonna, you know,

891
01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll lose our deposit like there's lots of logic right and you want to spend your time being right.

892
01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:17.820
Yeah.

893
01:41:19.230 --> 01:41:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a really interesting dynamic that's going on when we're busy trying to be right.

894
01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The other person.

895
01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:28.410
Is what

896
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:30.450
Bryanna Terry: Wrong.

897
01:41:30.930 --> 01:41:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And who wants the person we love to be in a one down position.

898
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Ever want our sweetheart to feel wrong. Somebody has to if you're busy being right.

899
01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why people do it is because deeply unconscious

900
01:41:52.770 --> 01:42:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: They get a sense of value of the self when they are right again and again and again. They're right there. Right there. Right there. Right, I'm valuable if I'm not right, this person not saying this is conscious. A lot of times, this is goes unconscious might leave me.

901
01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I might lose this thing. I love

902
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not about, you know, chocolate on a counter anymore. It's about something much, much bigger.

903
01:42:20.190 --> 01:42:20.700
You know,

904
01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Now back to the mantra haven't said it yet throughout the day. You know how I said, see if you can get to that space. See if you can get there by remembering the following I choose curiosity over being right.

905
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I choose it. In other words, in the moment of a sticky kitchen just instead of storing up all of the reasons why what he's doing is wrong. And once you do, imagine in your mind.

906
01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That this man, he's really just focuses on his sweet treat. He's just up in there just just so and oblivious to the world just

907
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What a childlike spirit and see if you can actually ask him a question and open hearted question. Oh, tell me about the one you're making you put an extra ice cream in it. Have you ever put any nuts in it.

908
01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:14.910
I'm

909
01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Not trying to be right, not trying to even almost control manipulate him, but rather just accepting who he is.

910
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet you're going to have some interesting information. The next time we meet

911
01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:31.800
Yeah.

912
01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet you're going to be able to inform us how often the need to be right, come up

913
01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:38.820
Yeah.

914
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I mean someone else has to be wrong. But if instead we're just curious.

915
01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We soften our heart opens

916
01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're not ready to pounce on someone.

917
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can use that this week.

918
01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:00.870
Okay.

919
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, you worked hard today.

920

Gwenevere Abriel: Something today. I hope you get it right away and you have a sense of scheduling.

01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But as soon as you do if you can remember to reach out to me so we can schedule them. You know what I mean.
