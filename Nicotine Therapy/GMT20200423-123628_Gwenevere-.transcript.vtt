Gabriel Lara: Well, thank you.

3
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I'm going to open up a note. So maybe a little silence for a minute. Welcome to update me on the doings of

4
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Being home all the time, but I'll be a little distracted opening up a new

5
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.160
Gabriel Lara: Things are going okay

6
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.870
Gabriel Lara: Working going well. So I'm happy about that.

7
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.090
Gabriel Lara: We have a, like a sales board.

8
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.900
Gabriel Lara: That show like how people are doing throughout the week.

9
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.110
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, and I'm number one in the country.

10
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that nice

11
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.040
Gabriel Lara: Feels really good

12
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.800
Gabriel Lara: They did some

13
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.330
Gabriel Lara: Some layoffs yesterday. One second round of layoffs.

14
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.000
Gabriel Lara: No would have survived the boat and they did my one year evaluation yesterday and I'm doing really well so

15
00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like you're noticing you're putting away a little extra money for just in case, kind of thing scenario.

16
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.640
Gabriel Lara: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

17
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people are doing that.

18
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.080
Gabriel Lara: Surprisingly, I haven't got much stimulus.

19
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.670
You

20
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:27.750
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, I applied for it. Well supposedly everyone is supposed to be getting everyone that every individual that makes under I think 77 and every couple that makes less than a combined income of 250,000 a year.

21
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.710
Gabriel Lara: Will automatically get I can be filed you filed

22
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.710
Gabriel Lara: The file taxes and 24 2019 you'll get it.

23
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.220
Gabriel Lara: But I haven't gotten it so

24
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.150
Gabriel Lara: Hopefully, once that comes in and you know definitely boost my savings but

25
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.520
Gabriel Lara: I'm doing okay so far.

26
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.610
Gabriel Lara: Well, the thing is that I didn't file tax and

27
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.460
Gabriel Lara: So I had to like do back taxes and I owe a little bit from 2018

28
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.100
Gabriel Lara: But one thing is that I finally done it. I've done all of it. And finally caught up to 2018 2019 so I'm back in

29
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. That doesn't seem right to say we're told money for the stimulus. You know what I mean, this isn't the time to be working out.

30
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Separate issues. All right, let me just get some paper here.

31
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.450
Gabriel Lara: No good.

32
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about the rest of your family.

33
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they hanging in or is there certain

34
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Family members starting to

35
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.610
Gabriel Lara: They're doing good.

36
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.800
Gabriel Lara: My, my own Teresa in California.

37
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.230
Gabriel Lara: Have coronavirus today.

38
00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:04.170
Gabriel Lara: So like every everyone in their home. I'm happy to be quarantine and enter my cousin Claudia my cousin Liliana, my cousin, Stephen.

39
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.140
Gabriel Lara: Died.

40
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.120
Gabriel Lara: A few years ago, so

41
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.050
Gabriel Lara: But the thing is, when we were when we were at a funeral together about a few months ago.

42
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember

43
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.460
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, and she was like holding the baby and

44
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.000
Gabriel Lara: When it turned out that she had she testified the front row, we were like, what the

45
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.610
Gabriel Lara: Mission doing better now.

46
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And yeah, it's not we, you know, if we have enough resilience in our immune system, we're going to, we're going to be okay.

47
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's still it's a scary thing. Was there a moment where you got kind of scared around that.

48
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.180
Gabriel Lara: Yeah yeah

49
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.170
Gabriel Lara: She's already like an older lady.

50
00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:02.190
Gabriel Lara: You know, in his late 60s, early 70s. So is concerning and she's an important figure in our family.

51
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.440
And I

52
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.450
Gabriel Lara: My heart.

53
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.500
Gabriel Lara: My heart.

54
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.840
Gabriel Lara: In California, and she was hanging out with my grandma and my grandma's really old and really

55
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.060
Gabriel Lara: Worried about grammar.

56
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm starting to look at your

57
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: My last note with you and it looks like a really big piece that I like to do with people. I haven't done which surprises me.

58
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe we could do that today.

59
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Um, if I said have you ever developed an anchor room because maybe the note. They don't always get kind of moved over from one session to the next this anchor room is things like I'll say something

60
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, what's something you're blocked in let's add a room to the current home you're in. Now does that sound familiar at all.

61
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: No, let's do it unless you've got some sort of pressing right now. It doesn't sound like you're kind of like kind of feeling pretty good about your job.

62
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's take this opportunity because we have a nice full hour sometimes these anchor rooms can take many sessions.

63
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: They can take well or not in one session, it can be done. So let me give a little bit of invitation around it. You've been working with me a little bit, the basics are I'll be the guide, meaning

64
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to do analysis, you don't have to wonder. Oh, what's she doing, what's that good enough to where she scrolling around she's trying to analyze something you don't have to worry about that.

65
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Now all you have to do is pay attention to the next thing that comes up that's always what I'm looking for. Oh, I just noticed, like I felt defensive. Well, I just noticed I wanted to

66
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Cry I'm noticing tearing my stomach feel sick. Oh, my back just hurt. You know, I want to know about the body.

67
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know about the guts. I want to know about emotions when you can label them. That's great.

68
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know that felt sense in the body and also thoughts. Well, I just thought, How dare you think that or I just got a memory. Whoa, that came out of nowhere. I just caught this glimpse of blah, blah, blah.

69
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm looking for. Try not to predict what I'm going to do, it'll get in a way of giving yourself.

70
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: An uncensored experience and we're unlikely to get some core dynamics. If you're people pleasing trying to look good, that kind of thing, it will really get in your way, and it'll extend this process and it won't be as productive for you.

71
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.240
Gabriel Lara: OK.

72
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So the basics are my next question will be the guide and just answer that one. It's probably going to be kind of a short response and then there'll be my next question then will be my next question. Another sort of

73
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Parameter around this activity is it's very tempting to want to force memory.

74
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to remember to when I was this age. I'm not quite what I'm doing. There's really only three things that I'm going to be pretty precise around memories going to be how old

75
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What was a nickname. And then the third question will be somewhere when we're kind of deeper into the process.

76
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to probably be tempted to want to press hard to. Well that didn't happen when I was this age, but that's not what I'm looking for. This is imagination. This is the anchor room is basically your happy place. You know, it's got everything that you need all the

77
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Resources all of the emotional stability, everything you need. Okay.

78
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I see you kind of pushing really hard to force it to be. Well, that's not what happened. This is what, then I might say, hey, doesn't have to be remembered. Go to imagination and there'll be opportunities to refine that. Okay, I think I've given all the parameters.

79
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Your job is just to pay attention to your truth. Okay.

80
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's begin by developing this anchor room by finding out where you are still stuck. So, for a lot of people in your life right now. Like, man, I'm still feeling

81
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: A little underdeveloped you and this area of my life. I'd like to improve over here. Where are you still feeling a bit blocked, like you're not quite sure what to do.

82
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:32.400
Gabriel Lara: I want to say in my own luck on the education side of my life.

83
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so say it. I'm because what do you mean how would you be blocked in your education side like say as

84
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:40.500
Gabriel Lara: I was

85
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:49.800
Gabriel Lara: Like I feel like I still need to finish nursing school like it's always on the back of my mind I dream about it. I think about it every day. I bring it up in conversation, often

86
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:58.410
Gabriel Lara: I honestly truthfully feel that I'm going to go back to it. I just don't know when. And I don't want to make the mistake of leaving my job again and then

87
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.660
Gabriel Lara: Going to nursing school and then changing my mind and trying to come back because it's just a bad look

88
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

89
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.810
Gabriel Lara: Like I have to commit to one or the other. And it's just

90
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:21.210
Gabriel Lara: You know, luckily I jumped out of there. What I did, because I guess the students at the school aren't getting credit for the spring semester.

91
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.510
Gabriel Lara: Now, because of the shutdown.

92
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:39.240
Gabriel Lara: And the students can go today, they can go to the hospitals, they couldn't finish the semester. So they got a refund and they're gonna have to do it again. And then the summer is online.

93
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:51.300
Gabriel Lara: So basically the spring semester and summer semester finished and those would have been a few semesters and I needed to graduate and luckily I jumped out that way.

94
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.730
Gabriel Lara: Now just integration.

95
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.210
Gabriel Lara: But that's a big thing. I think

96
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have two semesters left

97
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.800
Gabriel Lara: Three.

98
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.610
Side.

99
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.240
Gabriel Lara: It would have been the to spring and summer it had been in the program.

100
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You have three semesters left

101
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.020
Gabriel Lara: To graduate. Yes.

102
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And he would have been a waste of time. Right.

103
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.790
Gabriel Lara: Right, because I wouldn't have done credit for this spring and the summer would have been discontinued.

104
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:35.910
Gabriel Lara: So I wouldn't have been able to attend and I would have been looking for a job. In the meantime, and there's been a headache.

105
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:53.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would say I would say for for the remainder of this activity, I noticed that you kind of started explained why you gave your response.

106
00:11:53.700 --> 00:12:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get was quite a bit of storytelling. After that, I would say, moving forward, your response is exactly enough and it's just right. You don't have to do the

107
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Explaining part you owe me nothing. You already know the truth. You already have your facts. Okay, so that I know the temptation is going to be to want to to default to that but you in here in this activity.

108
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It might not be as productive as you think ready

109
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. I think I've got an idea. So, um, let's go to go go into that experience of you're feeling blocked around an unfinished nursing degree.

110
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to death. That's a, that's a thought. Now go to the emotion that you get when you have that thought. I have this unfinished nursing degree. What's the emotion you get

111
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay yeah unsettling.

112
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And

113
00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.190
Gabriel Lara: Angry

114
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, angry.

115
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay in that turn further in to introspection turn less into the data you're getting through video. I'm not going to have anything useful coming through visual what's probably going to be useful is my next question. My next invitation.

116
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The resource and answers will come from you, from within. So let's try to focus all your attention inward.

117
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And now pay attention to what that I'm settling that angry emotion around an unfinished nursing degree just find it in your somatic experience that's your felt body.

118
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Experience, where is it in your body. Where is that true yeah this is unsettling. Yep, I'm angry.

119
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.790
Gabriel Lara: My body like where I feel

120
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:04.980
Gabriel Lara: Like

121
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That okay and describe what that right above gut feels like kind of hold your hand there and kind of turn in

122
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe even close your eyes, because most of this is really all of it won't even need your eyes open to turn awareness inward trying settled in someplace pretty comfortable where you're seated.

123
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a sense of size of that gut feeling that right up there.

124
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Above the got. Is there any heat to it. Is there a color to it, these are, this is where we start to go into this sort of thing.

125
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.860
Gabriel Lara: It's almost like a dark man like a baseball five

126
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.530
Gabriel Lara: Like thing.

127
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.340
Gabriel Lara: Like it hold emotion and anger and it's a lot of negative feeling

128
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.340
Gabriel Lara: When I think about it and I feel it right there.

129
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So right there. Now I want to bring it back to the. This is where I remember I said there'd be memories to we're going to go back. We're going to bridge back or we're going to do regression. We're just going to catch an age walk it back, feeling that dark mass unsettling anger.

130
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: tumor size eating away at you.

131
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And try and see how old this is go back in time, I want to catch the earliest age when that existed.

132
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Walk it back to

133
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll get back to 1715 1413

134
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.260
Gabriel Lara: I feel like it is developed about three years ago, not even very, very long ago.

135
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me check on that. Um, let's see. So how do you know that didn't exist at let's say 28

136
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.100
Gabriel Lara: I guess I don't know.

137
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll feel it. That's why right you're thinking. Good. You're really

138
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to figure that out. That's why this question is important to just sit there

139
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to rule it out so sit with maybe some goings ons and 28 and 29 checking right here. This is where we got to really focus right above the got

140
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: He might be where that diaphragm is not sure kind of where that middle of where the top of the organs are in the bottom of the organs, maybe

141
00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get a sense of whether that unsettled feeling existed, whether that anger existed. So it's hard to do. Take your time.

142
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That's hard to

143
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep working backwards to see if it's there.

144
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What you were doing interacting with people.

145
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:46.440
Gabriel Lara: started happening is when I am when I started getting arrested. Often when

146
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, when that

147
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:54.210
Gabriel Lara: Happened about like what I when I was first arrested for driving under the influence.

148
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What age.

149
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.410
Gabriel Lara: About 21

150
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check on it, even then I wrote it down. Let me check. So walk it back again. There was a real life. Hi think it got started. Then let me. Let's just keep checking. Welcome back before that there's a real sense of this timing with the alcohol right in there 21

151
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And then forward now walk back a little further.

152
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Checking and see unsettled.

153
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Something unfinished anger, see if it's there at 19 1817 keep walking back

154
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to catch the earliest age.

155
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:49.560
Gabriel Lara: I think it was after another time after high school after I graduated I had the opportunity to go to college and

156
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.750
Gabriel Lara: I didn't want to. And then, New Mexico. There's a thing called the lottery scholarship

157
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:06.030
Gabriel Lara: That I was eligible to get it and I turned it down because I didn't want to go to school at the time. I just wanted to hang out and party with my friends.

158
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: told me the story. That's true. I know it's true. Let's walk back. Keep going back. Yeah. Then, boy, it's still, it's like I didn't want to go. I wanted, I was offered this opportunity. I didn't want to. I wanted to party.

159
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, something. Okay. Welcome back, further back 17

160
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's an unsettled, and it's angry.

161
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's just one piece of that. And it's up in that

162
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Stomach.

163
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: A dark

164
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.240
Gabriel Lara: Mother divorced when father

165
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:57.540
Gabriel Lara: When I was younger, and we moved to New Mexico and California

166
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:10.890
Gabriel Lara: Because I didn't want. Yeah. Cuz I didn't want to leave, California. I wanted to stay with my father and my mother said it was just true. We're just going to come visit for a while and it turned out we just stayed

167
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.480
Gabriel Lara: Yeah. Yeah. And I felt like to live betrayed and

168
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.380
Gabriel Lara: I would act out and I would want to go back and I would say that I couldn't go back to sit with my dad and they wouldn't let me

169
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel that in that same spot. Do you feel it there. That one's

170
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:35.910
Gabriel Lara: A big one.

171
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And I remember that story.

172
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so we're thorough this anchor room is awfully powerful. So let's really roll it out and by rolling it out. It means we checking back even further. Now this age, was this a London, how old was this

173
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:53.910
Gabriel Lara: About so yeah

174
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's walk back for that. Let's go to fifth grade.

175
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Fifth grade this greatest 10 check and see kind of picture what you're doing and whether that that space up there that dark mass eating away at you. Was there where it holds emotions anger and negative feeling

176
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:26.910
Gabriel Lara: I remember in the fifth grade when we were going to leave elementary school and go into middle school. I think it was

177
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:37.890
Gabriel Lara: And at the end of the year, they would all take us to an amusement park to Six Flags Magic Mountain and California and

178
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:44.400
Gabriel Lara: You know, but he said get in trouble. Have you got in trouble. You know, you would be food from the trip.

179
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.100
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, and

180
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.070
Gabriel Lara: I remember

181
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:51.690
Gabriel Lara: I remember

182
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.330
Gabriel Lara: We were sitting at a cafe.

183
00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:02.910
Gabriel Lara: And we wouldn't get these little salsa package and then he twisted them up stepped on them. You can splatter it against somebody up

184
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:11.580
Gabriel Lara: I remember one of the kids sitting next to me twisted went up and stepped on it and splattered kid.

185
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:13.230
Gabriel Lara: And

186
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:21.120
Gabriel Lara: After lunch was over. I was walking to class and the kid that got splattered thought I did it. And he punched me in the face.

187
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.280
Gabriel Lara: And I thought,

188
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.600
Gabriel Lara: I thought, oh, you know, I can't you know back because

189
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.480
Gabriel Lara: Then I won't be able to go on and shirt.

190
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:32.580
Gabriel Lara: And

191
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.650
Gabriel Lara: He just kept

192
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:49.050
Gabriel Lara: egging me on and I just said, screw it, and I got in a fight with him. And then I went into the principal's office and I felt them in the same area just report regret anger.

193
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you not get to go

194
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.360
Gabriel Lara: No, I stood up.

195
00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: In office was there.

196
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But that feeling, what kind of thing.

197
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:07.590
Gabriel Lara: Yeah. Again, like why would I let anger get ahold of me, and I should have been more calm.

198
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.050
Gabriel Lara: And they understood

199
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Check and see. Let's go back a little further.

200
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to fourth grade, go to nine.

201
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: acquainting fifth grade nap. The top of the class or school that point. So you're in nine and

202
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Officially doings going on at home in your world.

203
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe sports, maybe not.

204
00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture eight

205
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.930
Gabriel Lara: I remember a time when

206
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:08.370
Gabriel Lara: You're not wouldn't when I was when I was in elementary is going about the third grade, I would ride the bus to school and

207
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:21.210
Gabriel Lara: They had this program where they would take inner city kids and drive them and then you take a bus and the bus would take you a little further out to a nicer school so you wouldn't be so

208
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah we call magnet schools out here.

209
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.040
Gabriel Lara: Okay, yeah, I'm

210
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:35.550
Gabriel Lara: In California, I'm not sure what what the program was called when I was part of that program. And then, then it would bust me back into where we live in Sydney. Yeah.

211
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.740
Gabriel Lara: You know, the inner city.

212
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.210
Gabriel Lara: And

213
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:53.040
Gabriel Lara: And then you know when, what's the bus will drop us off. I have my little friend, and then I'd walk home and on that I met this group of friends there. And then I don't know how it came about what we

214
00:24:54.450 --> 00:25:03.060
Gabriel Lara: At one point, we would go to this little GAS STATION AND IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST TIME EVER SOLD ANYTHING. And we would just steal candies and chips.

215
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:13.650
Gabriel Lara: And then we all go to one of our houses and then a snack and eat everything and all the chips, all the candy have a talk that we've gotten and

216
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:23.970
Gabriel Lara: Then once we can, we would do it almost every day and then one time we got caught. And one of the kids so that beer from the cooler.

217
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:37.110
Gabriel Lara: Well, the gas station that wasn't a gas station. It was more like it's like a little Bodega Thai place because it wasn't built in so gas. It was just, you know, liquor and snacks and whatnot.

218
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:46.080
Gabriel Lara: And my kids love beer and we got caught on the police were called and they made a big deal about it.

219
00:25:47.460 --> 00:26:01.470
Gabriel Lara: And they kept on me, who told the kids with the beard. And so the kids are still a beer and over take upon themselves to still be just didn't know how to say it. I was in so much trouble. I felt like I wasn't so much trouble. Okay.

220
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and you didn't. You didn't know how to say the kid took it upon himself. We

221
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes the person that's doing the young guy.

222
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, say that

223
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.940
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, I didn't know how to say it. And they kept

224
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.170
Gabriel Lara: Yelling and, you know, they all look so much bigger than me and

225
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.150
Gabriel Lara: I remember feeling shame and

226
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.440
Gabriel Lara: The number of

227
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: A police officer so much bigger than you.

228
00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:35.760
Gabriel Lara: Yeah.

229
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, you were I'm trying to track this back if you're in third. You're only like eight

230
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just a little guy.

231
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.770
Yeah.

232
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

233
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.160
Gabriel Lara: Yeah.

234
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you like beer. When you were

235
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Eight. How did you already know that part.

236
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.180
Gabriel Lara: Because it takes it.

237
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Was around the house.

238
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.350
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, my dad drink a lot of

239
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.060
Gabriel Lara: Parties, you know, family gatherings.

240
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that you may be drank a whole cup at that age or earlier.

241
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.870
Gabriel Lara: No, no, just like

242
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.420
Gabriel Lara: Me, I didn't like it. Yeah.

243
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything earlier than that.

244
00:27:51.360 --> 00:28:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be interesting. So instead, that's feel feel up here are exploring how old that dark mass eating away you is trying to see how old bridging it back. We're regressing back to early, early ages gotten back to

245
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Each eight

246
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: tethered you kind of talk long ago was it there at seven, you can move it back, you really see how was this there was going on. That wasn't there really sit with it.

247
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.400
Gabriel Lara: far back as I can remember.

248
00:28:53.730 --> 00:29:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, did you so we're going to go with age eight and. And did you have a nickname at age eight

249
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm probably going to be distinguishing between the two. So I'll just say younger Gabriel

250
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that going to be okay. Yeah.

251
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I might say you it will be you and then it might be younger Gabriel

252
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.540
Booker.

253
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can distinguish

254
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

255
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's do some of the sort of imagination. Now, okay, this is the part. This isn't something you've done before. So it's going to kind of be off of the creative side of the brain. Okay. Give yourself permission.

256
00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: To see what comes up. So I want you to look around this home you're in now.

257
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Ground in a sense of it we present with the home, you're in

258
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The corner right what's over there can look what's in front and behind where you're seated.

259
00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like you to imagine a room is attached to this home you're in

260
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be anywhere anything

261
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And what kind of room pops into your head.

262
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't

263
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Smile.

264
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, like so. I'm a bit like a mushroom shape.

265
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.110
Yeah.

266
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

267
00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:54.210
Gabriel Lara: No windows moon.

268
00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's gonna ask about those windows. Okay, so, um, now take a look around. Are you in that in that room right now sort of

269
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Tried to turn off what you're seeing in your video and try and get in that space because I'm going to be now really going to be focusing focusing on all the sensory awareness of being in that space.

270
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But like you picture sort of what you see on the walls that space.

271
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.550
Gabriel Lara: Like I can see the room. The machine standing outside looking at it.

272
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, you're outside of it.

273
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.830
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, I'm looking at it.

274
00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:42.090
Gabriel Lara: It's like one of those super mario machine like a red dots on it.

275
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.970

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:17.970
Have a quote

154
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That hasn't close okay so nearby and close

155
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You get the sense that he's in the room just outside the door. He's in the room.

156
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.310
Gabriel Lara: Setting right

157
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.200

158
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So be present with that. And he's right there. And notice what

159
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Number Gabriel gets to do once he feels good and safe when you are close by right next to him.

160
00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: How his attention gets to turn to what interests him and what he gets to do just want to tune into that.

161
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And after you've really settled into that space will come back.

162
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit.

163
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Man.

164
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.420
Gabriel Lara: Good night.

165
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of a different way to start the morning

166
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.210
Gabriel Lara: Yeah, good.

167
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.730

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: As well as therapists are good for

170
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is you actually got pretty far and it worked very hard to

171
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You're pretty far.

172
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And so this space. There's a couple of more things I want to introduce to it.

173
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll probably pick it up over the coming sessions. If unless there's something there's ever anything and you kind of know that from group to if you guys ever have anything that's like

174
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I in front of you, like, I gotta talk about this right now. Um, my agenda will always be sent off to the side so um but so far if everything's sort of goes along and

175
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Things are kind of clipping along pretty stable emotional pretty stable financial pretty stable residential, you know, the domains of your life are pretty even keel, and probably invite us to continue that process and develop that room further

176
00:19:48.540 --> 00:20:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: With that can be for people and you can use it right away if you want to. It's yours to your mind is, it's a safe place. It's a safe place to process a decision, maybe that you have kind of going on. Or let's say you want to settle your, your emotions somewhere and

177
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go there can visualize it. Feel good there and then solve problems. They're like,

178
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I want to do this, do I want to do that. And that's a place that you can go to anytime you want to. Okay. And again, it's, it's not quite finished yet but I'm just giving you

179
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of, why bother. Why would I do this. Why would this be of service to you. It's not only therapeutic in the work that we're doing, but it also serves as an actual skill, a place your happy place that you can go in your mind.

180
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.860
