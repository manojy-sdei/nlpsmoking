00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.830
Amber Romero: Hi.

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.630
LIsa Anderson: How are you

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.030
Amber Romero: Are you

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.099
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.930
Amber Romero: Am I doing what

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.390
LIsa Anderson: Are you in a place. It's okay to hear and talk

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.380
Amber Romero: Yeah.

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.810
LIsa Anderson: It's like if you're in the car. Okay, good. How

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.430
LIsa Anderson: Last week,

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.440
Amber Romero: Um,

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.270
Amber Romero: I had a little bit of issues with with my prescription

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.920
Amber Romero: So I normally take it to Walmart and I don't have a problem, picking it up, but then

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.070
Amber Romero: When it came time to pick it up. They told me they weren't able to verify it.

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.530
Amber Romero: They

15
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.300
Amber Romero: weren't able to verify it. And if they weren't able to verify it. Then he wouldn't be able to. So they said that they had made

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:27.600
Amber Romero: They made the call, but nobody was calling them back. So I went and I called and the lady told me that there was somebody there, but she was with somebody and they don't know they're going to be able to have it verified that day so I explained to the lady that if

17
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:40.770
Amber Romero: That if I couldn't have it verified. I didn't have any more Suboxone that I was gonna get I'm gonna use because I'm not gonna be sick, you know and and

18
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.100
Amber Romero: I, for whatever reason they didn't verify it. So, okay, that's fine.

19
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.230
Amber Romero: I didn't, I didn't get my prescription on Friday. So then come Saturday.

20
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:08.130
Amber Romero: I went again to read it or to try to pick it up and they said that it, it still hadn't been verified. So then

21
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.730
Amber Romero: Eventually that day. It was verified and when I went to pick it up there were

22
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.210
Amber Romero: There was only 12

23
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:39.840
Amber Romero: Which means that this money was the last time that I took my prescription and I won't have any until sometime after group tomorrow. Once the script, the sentence filled so I probably will be till two o'clock, maybe three or four

24
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.390
Amber Romero: So like that's, I don't understand why why it was less. It was kind of odd.

25
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.340
Amber Romero: Especially when I got asked the doctor feet can make it higher.

26
00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:07.770
LIsa Anderson: Right, that you know, that is that is all that it was less. Um, so I can send a note in today and I will let Dr Ouma know that you know you and I are meeting regularly and I know you've done a great job.

27
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:19.560
LIsa Anderson: Of making all your appointments, because that's a big piece of this is making sure that you're making your appointments and then that the doctor. The procedure is that they will set the script.

28
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:30.720
LIsa Anderson: For longer so that you don't have to keep going to the pharmacy. So I'm. It sounds like there was a delay. Maybe that was just a delay in them, verifying it

29
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.450
LIsa Anderson: But as long as you're, you know, you're compliant with your appointments, you should get a longer script so that you shouldn't have to go to the pharmacy so frequently

30
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.130
Amber Romero: Yeah.

31
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.420
LIsa Anderson: Okay, I wasn't

32
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.220
LIsa Anderson: Out to

33
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.050
Amber Romero: Wait, hold on just a second. I need to me.

34
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.970
Amber Romero: I'm driving and I can't really hear you. What's holding

35
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.760
LIsa Anderson: Take your time.

36
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.320
Amber Romero: Okay, can you hear me okay

37
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.720
LIsa Anderson: Yes, I can hear you now. Can you hear me.

38
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.910
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Okay, so, so I'll get on and send a message about that today. And maybe just I can inquire with your doctor.

39
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:32.040
LIsa Anderson: What was going on with that. But yeah, as long as you continue to show up for your appointments, they should give you a longer day script so that you won't have to go to the pharmacy is often

40
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.840
Amber Romero: Okay.

41
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.060
Amber Romero: I was only calling

42
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.610
Amber Romero: Once a once a week, which is fine. And I never had issues picking it up. It's all

43
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.130
Amber Romero: Disappointed because

44
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.000
Amber Romero: I

45
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.660
Amber Romero: Mean I told them, if I have it. I was

46
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.750
Amber Romero: I was gonna do heroin. I told him just like

47
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:10.080
Amber Romero: The girl. She said that she sent a message to a supervisor even and and you know what's odd is that

48
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:20.880
Amber Romero: That same day, they called me. I missed the call. They didn't leave a message, but when I did call back

49
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.350
Amber Romero: They had told the lady to the phone told me that they were calling

50
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:38.730
Amber Romero: In regards to verifying the prescription change. And I told her, there wasn't any change. It was just to verify the prescription was was valid.

51
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:48.240
Amber Romero: And she's like, Oh, well, they didn't call. So I asked them all if they didn't cry. Why are they calling me and not calling

52
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.710
Amber Romero: The pharmacy, they were supposed to call the pharmacy. They weren't supposed to call me.

53
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.840
Amber Romero: Was another thing that

54
00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.220
Amber Romero: Really upset about actually

55
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.220
Amber Romero: Lady. I think for me, why did she fall

56
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:10.920
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, you know, I saw some some reference to that in your chart and and I am sorry that you had that frustration.

57
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:25.710
LIsa Anderson: Hopefully that was just a one time thing. And we can get you going on your prescriptions. But I asked me amber when you when you say, Well, you know, if I don't get my prescription and I'm just use heroin.

58
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.820
LIsa Anderson: You know I'm hearing you. I'm hearing you don't want to go into withdrawal, but

59
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.160
LIsa Anderson: Who does that. Who does that hurt.

60
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.750
LIsa Anderson: That

61
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.980
Amber Romero: Was the one

62
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.190
LIsa Anderson: Who does that hurt you know is this to get back it

63
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.340
LIsa Anderson: You know it.

64
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.700
How does that make sense.

65
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.120
Amber Romero: Are you there.

66
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.760
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, I'm here. Can you, can you hear me now.

67
00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:58.740
Amber Romero: Yeah.

68
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.760
LIsa Anderson: So, do you hear what you're saying there.

69
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.440
LIsa Anderson: Can you hear me now.

70
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:26.100
LIsa Anderson: Yes. Okay, so my question to you is when you're kind of frustrated and I understand that frustration about not being able to get your prescription. But then you're saying, you know, if I can't get it. I'm just going to use heroin.

71
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:34.110
LIsa Anderson: So So walk me through your, your thinking in that have a food that's gonna hurt or get back at

72
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
Amber Romero: It just came from, because I, I'm not gonna say

73
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.720
Amber Romero: I do you say

74
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:53.280
Amber Romero: It was, it was more along the lines of putting a sense of urgency on it, you know, because I would think that, you know,

75
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.990
Amber Romero: Participants to go backwards, you know,

76
00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.670
Amber Romero: And

77
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:12.240
Amber Romero: So I mean that that was my. That was my thought process on it. Oh, so I'm not sick and I am. And then you guys know like important because

78
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:22.410
Amber Romero: I kind of took it as they were gonna just throw it in the message and oh I was even told somebody will be there until Monday.

79
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:36.480
Amber Romero: So before I die within us. They had told me that no one's gonna be there till Monday. So that's when I said, Okay, well, I don't mean I'm not going to sit. If it's not verified that I'm just going to

80
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.490
Amber Romero: Going to use it.

81
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:47.880
Amber Romero: A lot of the reason why I stayed by doing so long, but I didn't wanna I didn't want a kid. I got hurt.

82
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.500
Amber Romero: So,

83
00:09:52.440 --> 00:10:02.010
LIsa Anderson: So I guess. Do you see what I'm saying that there's other ways maybe that I want you to communicate and think communicate to yourself. Most importantly,

84
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:22.260
LIsa Anderson: Is is taking responsibility for yourself. So, so, absolutely. That was a sense of urgency. I know it can be tough to get in touch with, um, sometimes the admins down for the weekend. I've tried to get in touch with them over the weekend to and and definitely that is a sense of urgency, but

85
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.250
LIsa Anderson: What you're saying to me.

86
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:35.400
LIsa Anderson: And Friday. Right. And then for them right for them to say, oh, there's no one here until Monday. Absolutely. That is frustrating but like the way you're saying it now is is

87
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:45.540
LIsa Anderson: You know you don't want to be sick, you, you want to get your script. You want to do what's keeping you on the right path. So you're taking responsibility for those steps.

88
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:58.770
LIsa Anderson: You're taking responsibility for for your own actions and that's that's what recovery. I mean, first, first step you know i mean i hear you, that you don't want to be sick, but um

89
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.390
LIsa Anderson: You know, if you were choose. I'm glad that you didn't. But if you had chosen us this weekend.

90
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.290
LIsa Anderson: You know that that's kind of

91
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.000
LIsa Anderson: You know, I want you to just be in a place where you're in the driver's seat.

92
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.720
LIsa Anderson: Where, where your partners in this. But, but your, this is your recovery is your life.

93
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:40.080
LIsa Anderson: So, you know, we want to make sure that things are a smooth process. From now on, as far as getting your scripts and yeah you know they should, they should give you that longer day supply, but I just kind of want to throw that out there that this is your life, no one else's

94
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.400
Amber Romero: Yeah.

95
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:50.430
LIsa Anderson: You know, it doesn't it doesn't hurt us. It doesn't hurt the person answering the phone at the pharmacy. Um, if you use you know it.

96
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.920
LIsa Anderson: It hurts you. It hurts your kids, it

97
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.970
Amber Romero: Also says

98
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:00.210
Amber Romero: Every

99
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:01.710
Amber Romero: Place.

100
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.030
Amber Romero: I don't know.

101
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:07.680
Amber Romero: This

102
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.540
Amber Romero: Is

103
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.850
Amber Romero: Me tell you

104
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.030
Amber Romero: By Saturday in the afternoon.

105
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.890
Amber Romero: I

106
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.070
Amber Romero: still hadn't been verified so had been filled. So I was

107
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.090
Amber Romero: On, hold on.

108
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.330
LIsa Anderson: Let me. Yeah, and I'm gonna pull up and see if I can see anything on my end here in your chart.

109
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.480
LIsa Anderson: So it looks like um

110
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.850
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, this was on the 17th and

111
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.240
LIsa Anderson: And you're going to use them all the time you bank.

112
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.460
Amber Romero: Not well I

113
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:21.510
Amber Romero: During that time, I was waiting for for because of all the ideas to verify the prescription. The second call was to change the pharmacy to the Walgreens, because I was I was having issues at Walmart and I don't have these issues at Walgreens.

114
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.150
Amber Romero: Was

115
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.610
Amber Romero: Um,

116
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:40.590
LIsa Anderson: Okay, well, so I am I, you know, I am sorry that there was that delay, I, I hear you, that you know you don't want to go into astrology, it's you know why you're doing this.

117
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:50.250
LIsa Anderson: So you got that prescription eventually you're going to have group tomorrow, so I definitely would just talk with her doctor and

118
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.760
LIsa Anderson: Just asked about getting that script.

119
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:54.570
LIsa Anderson: For that

120
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.920
LIsa Anderson: And if they can verify it. You know, especially excited to the day right so that you're not running

121
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.610
LIsa Anderson: You know, running into this issue of it coming up on the weekend.

122
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:16.770
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, so, um, yeah. I am sorry, frustration, but you know definitely you can like what you do and what's within your control.

123
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.880
LIsa Anderson: And it sounds like you did that, you know, calling and following up

124
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.420
LIsa Anderson: You know, that's

125
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:30.300
LIsa Anderson: That's only you cannot use only you can make that choice for yourself.

126
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.030
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, I

127
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.510

Amber Romero: To

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.570
Amber Romero: Somebody named Don

131
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.060

And brought her

136
00:14:59.340 --> 00:14:59.670
LIsa Anderson: Doctor

137
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.070
Amber Romero: received a response from her. So it says now five days ago.

138
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:13.320
LIsa Anderson: Dr. All men is your, is your main doctor. Yeah.

139
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:22.590
Amber Romero: I was given this email from a friend of mine who actually referred me to the program. So I she said that

140
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:31.470
Amber Romero: This was the email that she had but this lady was maybe like a supervisor or something, I don't know, but

141
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.540
Amber Romero: It was the only I was able to get so I

142
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:50.550
LIsa Anderson: Okay, yeah, she she's one of our doctors and then you know you're going to have group tomorrow with Dr. Solomon. So, um, you know, I would definitely just whenever he checks in with you just, you know, kind of asked him if he's going to be able to get your

143
00:15:52.080 --> 00:16:01.800
LIsa Anderson: You know your prescription in and as long as you know you're doing those drug screens to and, you know, attending all of your appointments

144
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.610
LIsa Anderson: Hopefully, it shouldn't be an issue going forward.

145
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:07.140
LIsa Anderson: So,

146
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.120
Amber Romero: Yeah I my. Oh, it's not. I mean, I'm a female now.

147
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:17.910
I know

148
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:27.750
LIsa Anderson: It's for it. You know, it's still early on, hopefully, maybe it's just getting some folks out and hopefully you won't have this issue again in the future. Um,

149
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:38.610
LIsa Anderson: So let me ask him, her since since last week, I know you've mentioned that there was a lot of stress going on, you know, some fights or or arguments.

150
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.710
LIsa Anderson: With some, you know, some relationships and stuff and you had that slip up with math.

151
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.770
LIsa Anderson: You know, how have you been doing. Now this week. Any slip up since then.

152
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.270
Know,

153
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.150
Amber Romero: Kind of slow, I guess.

154
00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:04.650
Amber Romero: My, my biggest issue was what happened over the weekend with the with the prescription, um,

155
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:06.870
Amber Romero: And then

156
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:15.600
Amber Romero: You know, not having enough but aside from not having enough like one day short being and then I had asked to have it.

157
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.340
Amber Romero: My increase too wordy.

158
00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.150
Amber Romero: You know, it's

159
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.280
Amber Romero: Kind of slow

160
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.510
Amber Romero: Down.

161
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.880
Amber Romero: That hasn't changed.

162
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.440
Amber Romero: As far as like me being able to sleep and stuff.

163
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:42.420
Amber Romero: So like

164
00:17:44.370 --> 00:18:02.160
Amber Romero: Monday, maybe I stayed up Monday. Monday night, and then Tuesday. And then I ended up falling asleep. Probably Wednesday morning, about two o'clock I slept all day Wednesday and then

165
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.980
Amber Romero: Probably

166
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.240
Amber Romero: Up until this morning about four or five o'clock.

167
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:19.800
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so your sleep schedule has been pretty pretty disrupted. Um,

168
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.840
Amber Romero: Yeah, it's been pretty crazy. Um,

169
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:30.120
LIsa Anderson: So last week when you had used when you have used methamphetamine. How long did that keep you up. How long were you up.

170
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.600
Amber Romero: It, it really doesn't keep me up.

171
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:39.870
Amber Romero: Like I can. I got to a point where I was able to smoke and then go to sleep and eat.

172
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.400
Amber Romero: Okay. Oh.

173
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.950
LIsa Anderson: So, you know, it does disrupt your sleep schedule, though, um,

174
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.450
LIsa Anderson: So remember we were talking about

175
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:56.460
LIsa Anderson: Last time that you can just all the chemicals in your brain. It, it takes

176
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.810
LIsa Anderson: It takes some time.

177
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.290
LIsa Anderson: For your brain regulate itself.

178
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.350
LIsa Anderson: For just for all of those

179
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.270
LIsa Anderson: chemicals in your brain.

180
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:15.420
LIsa Anderson: That affects sleep that affect energy, those can take months to get back into balance.

181
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.330
LIsa Anderson: Dr. All men can't

182
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.520
LIsa Anderson: Sleep.

183
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.910
LIsa Anderson: You know that that can be sure

184
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.300
LIsa Anderson: You know, we talked a little bit about just kind of

185
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.540
LIsa Anderson: sleep hygiene. So just trying to get on a consistent

186
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.460
LIsa Anderson: Schedule where you could try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.

187
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:36.870
Amber Romero: Right.

188
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:46.680
LIsa Anderson: So, so there's definitely you know just kind of those routine and behavioral things that that you can do. And, you know, in combination with maybe a sleep medication.

189
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:53.370
LIsa Anderson: That might help. And in an early recovery, it's really common to have you. No problem. Sleeping.

190
00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:10.050
LIsa Anderson: So that's, you know, that's something maybe to bring up in group tomorrow as well you know that maybe a medication can help, but also maybe for you to just try to get on a set routine, you know, if you slept until 4pm today, like if you slept a lot of the day.

191
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:15.930
LIsa Anderson: Then that might make sense that you're going to then have a hard time sleeping tonight.

192
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.260
LIsa Anderson: Right, like your days and nights are playing

193
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.240
LIsa Anderson: Good.

194
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:28.440
LIsa Anderson: Um, is the anxiety still pretty pretty high this week.

195
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:38.970
Amber Romero: Yeah. Yeah, it is. I mean, it's true. I don't know if it's turning into stress or whatever, like, I'm like, my eyes are starting to twitch um

196
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.470
Amber Romero: I yeah that's really the worst one is my i

197
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.640
Amber Romero: Am I did mixed over a la

198
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.740
Amber Romero: La, la,

199
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.750
LIsa Anderson: I'm, I'm just looking at those

200
00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:00.540
LIsa Anderson: worksheets that you filled out amber talking about your anxiety levels.

201
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:22.350
LIsa Anderson: For some reason on that one GA d seven. I'm just seeing that score from last week. That was pretty high pretty severe anxiety. Um okay then then depression. We talked about that last week. How's your mood in

202
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.840
Amber Romero: I'm

203
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.130
LIsa Anderson: Feeling down or

204
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.980
Amber Romero: The same

205
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.480
Amber Romero: Mean, generally, I'm not up and down like that, you know,

206
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.780
Amber Romero: Doesn't really take me a lot to get

207
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.500
Amber Romero: Mad, but when they get mad, I'm

208
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.300
Amber Romero: pretty upset.

209
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.010
LIsa Anderson: Like that issue with the prescription was

210
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.220
LIsa Anderson: Right, a big frustration.

211
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.900
Amber Romero: Oh, yeah.

212
00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.080
Amber Romero: You know, it's like, especially because I had to, you know, like

213
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.190
Amber Romero: Take the extra steps to be like, Hey, hey guys and

214
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:20.640
Amber Romero: You know i i know i felt as if it could have been done like better. I took three or four minutes to give the pharmacy a call instead of taking three or four minutes to give me a call, you know, and then

215
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:37.950
Amber Romero: Aside from that, it was to less so, like, I'm like, kind of in the same situation because now I don't have any. I don't have any Suboxone and I potentially won't have any until about

216
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:49.470
Amber Romero: I'm from this maybe this time or later tomorrow it's 130 groups at 1212 to one and send it takes. I don't know how long I

217
00:22:49.920 --> 00:23:05.790
Amber Romero: Last, last week when I went I went about five and it still hadn't been verified. So, like, I mean, I didn't. I haven't run into that issue before and that in the last week and the week prior to that I didn't run into that issue so

218
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.250
Amber Romero: I mean i i don't

219
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:16.440
LIsa Anderson: Know, hopefully that's just maybe a fluke that happened last week, I would definitely bring it up with Dr. Solomon, you know, when you have tomorrow, just to say, you know,

220
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:25.860
LIsa Anderson: Is it fair, you know, will it be verified so that you can pick it up and then will you be eligible for that longer script, because you have you've been making all of your appointments

221
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:36.030
LIsa Anderson: You know you've been following through on your end, so, um, yeah. So I yeah so that that definitely I'm hearing that was the big thing this past week.

222
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.650
LIsa Anderson: What about pain, how, how was your pain level this past week of

223
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:41.580
Have any physical

224
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.590
Amber Romero: Physical

225
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.270
Amber Romero: I mean the same. It doesn't get any better. I'm

226
00:23:52.560 --> 00:24:00.540
Amber Romero: Mean, there's days. It gets worse. But it doesn't get any better. It's, it's at a constant always

227
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.580
Amber Romero: You know, I've gotten used to that over the years.

228
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:23.970
LIsa Anderson: Okay, okay. So, about the same. And then what about kind of relationship and family stress. I know last week was pretty tough with with your kids dad getting out of jail, and you mentioned a fight or an argument with your partner, how, how are you feeling about that stuff. Now this week.

229
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.000
Amber Romero: Um, yeah, it's better. I mean,

230
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.180
Amber Romero: Oh my, Daniel.

231
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.940
Amber Romero: Daniel has

232
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:37.800
Amber Romero: Done.

233
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:50.790
Amber Romero: Urgency not an urgency, but a high expectation as to what I'm supposed to do or how I'm supposed to handle things. And when I don't he gets mad and see like

234
00:24:51.510 --> 00:25:07.920
Amber Romero: We've been together since we like, Gosh, he was still in his teens. I was in my early 20s. So like I'm 35 now, you know, and I used to let him get away with a lot of stuff. So when he would like sit there and make basically talk share or

235
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:19.290
Amber Romero: Tell me things that he didn't like I would just not thinking, you know, just kind of let him walk all over me, And lately. I haven't been doing that. I know have been

236
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:38.070
Amber Romero: yelling at him back, so to say, or, you know, telling him why I'm doing this this Saturday the other. And, you know, he asked why why I'm why I'm so like mean so to say. And I told him like, I'm not gonna let him like treat me like that or let him punk me and the last time.

237
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.880
Amber Romero: You see on Friday, we were having it was our girls him and I were having a video.

238
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.440
Amber Romero: And

239
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.070
Amber Romero: I don't know, he said something he said something to me that that that really like

240
00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:07.320
Amber Romero: It didn't bother me until it started bothering my kids and my daughter, my daughter said, Hey, don't talk to my mom like that.

241
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:26.100
Amber Romero: You know, and then he kept on going and she told him. If you want to talk about something you wanted to talk about. How about an apparent you've been she told that to to her dad and you know you stopped. And then at that time, you know the the call was ended.

242
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:46.380
Amber Romero: And I ended up talking to my daughter by herself. And, you know, she told me, you know, don't let him talk to you like that. And I had to explain to her that you know there are things that should be said. And that shouldn't be said in front of the kids and I've never like

243
00:26:48.030 --> 00:27:10.380
Amber Romero: Talked bad to them about their data. I've never, you know, like talk like fought with him in front of the kids like so I had to explain that to her. So she understood, but you know I after that I didn't talk to him, probably for about three or four days until he finally called

244
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:23.640
Amber Romero: You know cuz he knows I'm not, I'm not gonna kiss us. I'm not going to chase him and and i think he knows that. So he's been a lot better. A lot better with me.

245
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.260
Amber Romero: Okay.

246
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:40.470
LIsa Anderson: Well yeah, I am sorry that you know you had that experience of him being disrespectful, especially in front of your daughter and I think you're absolutely right to kind of then have that time where you just talked to her by yourself and say you know that's not okay.

247
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:56.970
LIsa Anderson: For that, you know, argument or for him to be speaking to you that way in front of her. And you know, I know you mentioned to me that in the past. You've been probably verbally and emotionally and maybe even physically abusive, a few times.

248
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:12.150
LIsa Anderson: In the past, and so are you saying you feel like now you're at a point where maybe you didn't you weren't as assertive to him, like when you were younger, and now you're kind of standing up for yourself and asserting yourself more

249
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.020
LIsa Anderson: Yeah.

250
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:29.820
Amber Romero: I'd be safe to say because you know like we both were both in our 30s. Now, it's not like it was when we were in our early, early 20s teenager years, you know, like this, they grow up.

251
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:38.460
LIsa Anderson: Say that he was speaking to you recently would be verbally abusive. Did you feel it was emotionally abusive.

252
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:40.650
Amber Romero: Um,

253
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.290
Amber Romero: I think he tried to be

254
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.440
Amber Romero: You know, um,

255
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:53.850
Amber Romero: I don't know. I don't. I think sometimes he doesn't think before he speaks and it just kind of like

256
00:28:55.050 --> 00:29:00.660
Amber Romero: Like, as if he took x slacks for the mouth. It just kind of like spews out like diarrhea, you know,

257
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:10.140
Amber Romero: It's kind of hard to say just I don't think he realizes the severity of what he says until the damages are done.

258
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.860
Amber Romero: You know, and he

259
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:22.800
Amber Romero: He has I think he has a hard time apologizing go but like i mean i need to. But the thing that is things that he said

260
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:35.820
Amber Romero: In reference to why he said it. I mean, he knows it was inappropriate. He didn't say he didn't apologize sorry for being but I mean

261
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:46.890
Amber Romero: Once like once my daughter started telling him what she told him like he stopped and it hurt him. You know, so like Tony, which is

262
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:59.220
Amber Romero: The lady who has my kids Daniels as Daniel cousin, my one of my daughter's godmother. She actually used to be my best friend back when we were in college, but um

263
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:14.130
Amber Romero: You know she ended up calling me and her and I talked, and then she ended up calling him and I don't know what they talked about, really. I don't really care what they talked about. But I mean, since then it's been a lot better to me. So he's been dancer. Yeah.

264
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.530
Amber Romero: But

265
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:23.670
LIsa Anderson: Um, you know, it's still yeah I mean you're you're calling him out on this behavior in

266
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:35.640
LIsa Anderson: letting him know that it's not okay, sounds like your daughter really was, which, you know, I think, of course, you'll want to have her see like what a healthy relationship is

267
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:47.940
LIsa Anderson: You know having him, you know, not speak to you in that way. But then definitely you know having her kind of be in the middle of it puts you in a really tough situation and puts her in early tough situation to

268
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.160
Amber Romero: Yeah, it does.

269
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.160
LIsa Anderson: But I am glad like you and her were able to talk after

270
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.520
LIsa Anderson: Okay, well that yeah that sounds tough in, you know, definitely.

271
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:09.600
LIsa Anderson: Want you to be in a healthy place and in a safe place with him, because I know you mentioned to me last week, so he had just gotten out of jail recently.

272
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.090
Amber Romero: Yes, go to prison. Yeah.

273
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:21.960
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, so are you guys, I'm kind of like co parenting together right now. You've seen him obviously since he got out.

274
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.930
Amber Romero: We're just kind of

275
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:40.350
Amber Romero: Um, well, I mean, Tony's open to suggestions, you know, as far as like parenting and stuff. My, my activity with the girls isn't monitored.

276
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:55.890
Amber Romero: Compared to his. I mean, I, I've been working on this with my girls for a while, already so she aside from that, she she knows how she was and she knows how he has to

277
00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:01.140
Amber Romero: So mean he still has a little bit of adjusting to do but

278
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.550
Amber Romero: I mean, at this point, she is their legal guardian, so we don't

279
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:14.070
Amber Romero: We don't work were like reestablishing like parentage, so to say, I guess, right.

280
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.690
LIsa Anderson: So what's kind of, how would you describe the relationship between you and Daniel right now.

281
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.270
Amber Romero: I'm like, No, we're

282
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.580
Amber Romero: We were friends.

283
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:33.030
Amber Romero: Okay, we're supposed to be working towards, like, you know, getting back together and all this crap but um I

284
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.190
Amber Romero: Mean, he has he has to stuff to handle I have myself to handle and

285
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:46.620
Amber Romero: I mean, right now we're like living situation we're in two different living situations and and that that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that. But, you know, we

286
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:57.990
Amber Romero: We talk everyday we send pictures back and forth. And, you know, I'll see him when I can. But like he's he's on parole is at his sisters and with this.

287
00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:20.520
Amber Romero: coronavirus his sister is taking the quarantine thing. You know, like 200% so he doesn't leave the house without her. And it kind of makes it difficult because he's he's been in prison, and I say, for the last four years. He's only been out for about two or three months.

288
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.710
Amber Romero: So I'm

289
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:32.850
Amber Romero: Never having to get out and then basically be on house arrest them in a really shitty. But I mean, it'll well as

290
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:34.560
LIsa Anderson: Well, it is good.

291
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:52.530
LIsa Anderson: Good timing, though, that he got released and in this at less risk than he would be then if he were in in prison. Still, as far as getting sick. I'm so, so you mentioned, he's on parole. Was he was he using before. Was he somebody that you use Twitter back

292
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.270
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, okay.

293
00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:01.680
LIsa Anderson: So how are you feeling about that now is, is he clean. Do you feel it's it's okay to be around him.

294
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.790
Amber Romero: Yeah, he's he's always

295
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:12.090
Amber Romero: He's never condone getting high II.

296
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:24.960
Amber Romero: II okay with that, actually, um, you know, I'd say there's been like many, many, many, many, many, many, many countless times that he has

297
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:36.840
Amber Romero: You know, would say like remove me from the situation and to to help me kick and it would get me like the box in order

298
00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:49.920
Amber Romero: To help with the chicken and like Trump zones asleep so that way I can take in and he's he's tried over and over and over and just over and over and over. I want to and

299
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.540
Amber Romero: You know, so he's like I said he's never condoned it

300
00:34:56.490 --> 00:35:04.980
Amber Romero: He Himself has been clean from heroin for two years now. Okay, so they he's, he did that on his own.

301
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:12.870
Amber Romero: I know he has access to it like being in prison, probably more access than we do here on the streets.

302
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:18.090
Amber Romero: I am waiting for his

303
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:28.710
Amber Romero: His insurance to kick in, because he I told him about this program and he's interested in and participating. So are you guys

304
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.220
Amber Romero: I'm just waiting for his a

305
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.380
Amber Romero: Medicaid to get approved, I guess.

306
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:46.440
LIsa Anderson: Got it. Okay, well good. You know, I mean, that's good that he was supportive of, you know, of your past efforts and trying to get clean that he was helping you.

307
00:35:47.160 --> 00:36:02.070
LIsa Anderson: But, you know, definitely. I'm sure it's, you know, maybe hard for him right now. This is a big transition for him. So absolutely. I think if his you know once his insurance kicks in and you know if he can get involved with the program, you know, just for whatever form of support would

308
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.420
LIsa Anderson: Would work for him, just so that you guys kind of our

309
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:21.870
LIsa Anderson: Innocence doing this together that you're both a positive influence you know that he's a positive influence on you that he's a person who is encouraging your recovery, you know, porting your recovery.

310
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.060
LIsa Anderson: You know, and not possibly

311
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.410
LIsa Anderson: You know someone who you used with in the past or, you know, some of that you associate using with

312
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.470
LIsa Anderson: You know that he's a safe person for you.

313
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.090
Amber Romero: Yeah.

314
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:48.660
LIsa Anderson: Okay, and what about humans. I know you talked about, you know, your, your parents and friends and other people in your circle are all of those people in your circle. I'm drug free

315
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.200
Amber Romero: Yeah, okay. Yeah, they are.

316
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.280
Amber Romero: All right, darling. Well, yeah, no, they are

317
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.380
Amber Romero: Okay, it's easier that way.

318
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.160
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, definitely. Okay, good. Well,

319
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:05.640
LIsa Anderson: I'm

320
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:10.980
LIsa Anderson: You know, Amber I know you know we we've kind of just been getting to know each other and

321
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:25.920
LIsa Anderson: Like you know you're sharing with me a lot of where you're at, um, one question that I kind of was thinking about with you is, is what is rock bottom for you. Do you feel like you've you've had that kind of rock bottom moment.

322
00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:36.930
Amber Romero: Um, no, cuz you know when I thought I hit rock bottom. I found out that our basement so I never really

323
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:43.920
Amber Romero: Knew when when I thought I was doing the worst day about works well I don't

324
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.710
Amber Romero: I don't know me, I

325
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:55.350
Amber Romero: kind of felt like everything that could ever happen to me. That was bad, as has happened, you know, and

326
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.630
Amber Romero: I've always heard people say, oh, well, once you hit the bottom you have nowhere to go but up but

327
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:09.120
Amber Romero: But I didn't know with me. It was like, Okay, well, what's the bottom I, you know, was able to dig deeper. So

328
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.060
Amber Romero: Oh, I don't know.

329
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:24.060
LIsa Anderson: I mean it. You know, it's different for everyone, um, you know, I can't, I can't imagine how it would offend to be away from your children.

330
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:31.350
LIsa Anderson: You know, I know. See why FD takes a lot of steps before they get to that point.

331
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:37.830
LIsa Anderson: So, you know, just even going a day without seeing them.

332
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:47.910
LIsa Anderson: You know so i i hope that this is it that you know that that may be was was the big moment. Maybe the big wake up call.

333
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:59.790
Amber Romero: Yes and no. Because once that happened like this was our it's already been maybe like three years. No, but it's been like this, but um

334
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:07.380
Amber Romero: I mean, all that did was was make me us even more because they need to suppress that thing.

335
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.200
Amber Romero: You know, so like

336
00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:31.710
Amber Romero: You know, it's the thing now is just like reestablishing myself and even Daniel as well because I'm mean Tony's already made it known many, many times that she doesn't. She doesn't want to raise our children. And as long as we

337
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:34.050
Amber Romero: Can prove

338
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:43.500
Amber Romero: It in a safe environment, um, she will depart and give us our kids back

339
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:45.390
Amber Romero: You know, but we have to

340
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:51.360
Amber Romero: Wait until Sophia as well. And she is. She said she'll be 11 this year.

341
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:59.730
Amber Romero: So it's just it's just working on, you know, on doing the things that we have to do.

342
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:19.380
Amber Romero: You know, so like I I told her that, you know, I was participating in this program and stuff. And it was voluntary and you know like I give her my progress, like I said she, she was at one time. My, my best friend. This before I was with Daniel just so happened to be your cousin.

343
00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:27.360
LIsa Anderson: And that waiting until Sophia turns 12. Was that something that the Court stipulated just so that she's

344
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.520
That you know it's

345
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.770
Amber Romero: Something

346
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:40.830
Amber Romero: It's something within like New Mexico guidelines for parents who had parental rights terminated.

347
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:54.270
Amber Romero: I'm not quite sure, like the the details of it. I just know that Tony is the one that actually looked into it because you know she supports.

348
00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:07.290
Amber Romero: Anything that Daniel, or I would do to, you know, to, to get back with her with our family and she's the one that looked into everything and all that stuff. Okay.

349
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:13.680
LIsa Anderson: Okay, good. Well, I am glad that you know you're on on this path to

350
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:21.030
LIsa Anderson: You know, to improve the relationship with them. I'm sure there's a lot of hurt there that they've been through a lot too.

351
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:22.110
Amber Romero: Oh, yeah.

352
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:35.250
LIsa Anderson: And, you know, as, as you go through this process. And I think as you go through this recovery and you know sometimes those steps do involve like making amends.

353
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:48.990
LIsa Anderson: You know, trying to start the repair of those wounds with people that you've heard people that you've heard through your addiction. So, you know, I think that could maybe be

354
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:58.140
LIsa Anderson: You know, be something to to look at as as you go through this, you know, thinking about the people that your, your, your drug uses hurt.

355
00:41:59.250 --> 00:41:59.700
Amber Romero: Yeah.

356
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:17.040
LIsa Anderson: And especially, you know that they they were innocent in all of this. But, you know, they'll, you know, you're still there. Mom, I think they're, you know, they're always going to need you. And yeah, anything you can do to kind of repair. Those, those connections, like you said,

357
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:27.060
LIsa Anderson: Just to try to you know be involved as much as you can, and their day to day know them and and you know now they're teenagers. So they're in a tricky place.

358
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.880
LIsa Anderson: Anyway, but to really try to be there for them as much as you can.

359
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:34.230
Yeah.

360
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:45.660
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, well I'm glad that so those you know those family stressors and some of those relationships stuff has kind of

361
00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:56.550
LIsa Anderson: You know stabilized, a little bit since last week because I know you said with Daniel getting out of prison that just brought up a lot of emotions for you last week.

362
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.450
Yeah.

363
00:42:58.740 --> 00:42:59.730
LIsa Anderson: The past.

364
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:00.840
Yeah.

365
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:11.190
LIsa Anderson: And, you know, thinking about, like, when that anger comes up when that hurt comes up, you know, just thinking about how you're going to process those emotions.

366
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:26.580
LIsa Anderson: And for you. Your go to has always been using, it's been, it sounds like you. You have a feeling it was a negative feeling use you use drugs to mask that feeling. Yeah. Makes sense.

367
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:34.920
LIsa Anderson: And so I think one of the things that we can kind of work on is just helping you sit with those feelings.

368
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:42.210
LIsa Anderson: And feel those feelings. I'm going to write down something called distress tolerance, so

369
00:43:42.930 --> 00:44:02.160
LIsa Anderson: distress tolerance. Basically what that means is, like, you feel a feeling it's uncomfortable and for you to get to get clean long term permanently is is to learn how to sit with those feelings and to learn how to cope with those feelings without substances.

370
00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:15.180
LIsa Anderson: Because life's hard life is going to be hard life's going to be painful. You know, it doesn't, you know, having a clean mind from here forward isn't a promise of a life without pain.

371
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:21.060
LIsa Anderson: But but learning how to how to handle that pain that might come up

372
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.790
LIsa Anderson: Without using

373
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.180
LIsa Anderson: That kind of makes sense.

374
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:40.830
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. Um, so I think I kind of know the answer to this. But what would you say would be the, the biggest thing. Looking forward to, you know, for you being clean and having that stability, what

375
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:55.650
LIsa Anderson: reconfiguration hmm, yeah. Having your kids back having that family having that home. Um, if, if you were to continue using, where would you see that path taking you

376
00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.810
Amber Romero: Know, we're having charity been. Sure, sure.

377
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.850
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, so, so. No, we're good. Nowhere that you haven't already been

378
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:16.830
LIsa Anderson: And eventually, the only two roads that continued use will lead you is prison or the grave.

379
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.290
LIsa Anderson: Maybe you've heard that before.

380
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:28.410
LIsa Anderson: You know either either you'll end up in jail, you'll end up in prison or you end up dead, those, those are really the only two options.

381
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:32.010
LIsa Anderson: For you to, you know, continue using

382
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.260
LIsa Anderson: So,

383
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:39.840
LIsa Anderson: You know not to sound harsh but but that's the truth that's that's kind of the reality.

384
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:44.280
Amber Romero: Yeah, it's not anything. I haven't heard before.

385
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:50.280
LIsa Anderson: Hi, you know, not tomorrow, not next week but but eventually and and

386
00:45:51.300 --> 00:46:05.190
LIsa Anderson: Not that even that path would be without consequences which you've, you've already had a lot of those consequences, you know, getting your kids taken away, being in jail losing jobs, you know, losing a home losing relationships.

387
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.320
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. Oh.

388
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.550
LIsa Anderson: You know, I think maybe looking forward to

389
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:25.650
LIsa Anderson: You know you've, you've been there, done that. But there were so many things that you don't even know what's in store for you. You know, you know, some of the good things that that you can get out of it. If you keep, you know, if you keep keep clean

390
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:34.380
LIsa Anderson: And and who knows what you can accomplish staying clean. Like, who knows the good things that can come your way.

391
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:42.660
LIsa Anderson: But, but I think you already have the side of some of that having relationship with your kids, letting them have a mom again.

392
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.920
LIsa Anderson: You know, providing for them being able to raise

393
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.400
Them.

394
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.230
LIsa Anderson: That's the biggest thing, right.

395
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.310
Right.

396
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:57.660
LIsa Anderson: Okay, um,

397
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:06.870
LIsa Anderson: We talked about those baby steps as far as like thinking about working. Um, I am worried for you ever, like just about your sleep.

398
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:16.320
LIsa Anderson: You know that, then if you're not sleeping, you've been up for days at a time and then you know you kind of crash and like sleep all day.

399
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:23.280
LIsa Anderson: You know, that is going to be hard, of course, to, to keep a steady job.

400
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:32.550
LIsa Anderson: So his his his sleep medication, something you want to try. Do you want to print that off with Dr omen, um,

401
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.910
LIsa Anderson: Do you want to give it a couple days or

402
00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.710
Amber Romero: I don't know, I kind of feel like

403
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:57.540
Amber Romero: Maybe the anxiety has a lot to do with it. And that's why I'm always moving around a lot, too, because it hurts in my late for that. I, I already asked him, you know about

404
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.320
Amber Romero: Something for anxiety and

405
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:09.570
Amber Romero: I don't know if he's like just completely disregarded that or if you're just like, yeah, we'll give it a try and kind of put it off like he didn't ask him.

406
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:16.410
Amber Romero: Like I don't know I don't know I mean

407
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:28.710
Amber Romero: I kind of feel like if I take a sleeping medication. I probably get like codependent on that as well, you know,

408
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:32.430
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, no, I hear what you're saying, I don't. Yeah, I wanna

409
00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:33.510
LIsa Anderson: So,

410
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:34.620
LIsa Anderson: You know, I think.

411
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:39.990
LIsa Anderson: Let's, let's kind of defer to you on that. But I think as far as like anxiety medication.

412
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.320
LIsa Anderson: Recovery.

413
00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:57.960
LIsa Anderson: Um, you know, I don't want you to feel so anxious are so stressed out that you can't function. But, you know, this is coming from someone who says

414
00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:03.510
LIsa Anderson: That you use drugs because you you feel feelings that are difficult, right.

415
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.840
LIsa Anderson: Or that one of the reasons that you use, you know, getting

416
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:07.560
LIsa Anderson: Kids ticket.

417
00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:08.670
LIsa Anderson: You know, I mean,

418
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:15.330
LIsa Anderson: I can't imagine horrible that must have felt so drugs to map those feelings you know it.

419
00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:19.860
LIsa Anderson: Takes it is isn't comfortable, you know those feelings of panic.

420
00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.710
LIsa Anderson: You know those racing thoughts.

421
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:24.390
Amber Romero: We

422
00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:25.080
LIsa Anderson: All get those

423
00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:28.410
LIsa Anderson: Um, you know, I definitely don't want you to

424
00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.580
LIsa Anderson: You know, if it's if it's severe to where you're experiencing that all

425
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:34.920
LIsa Anderson: Or to the point that it's

426
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.400
LIsa Anderson: Your ability to function or do

427
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.660
Amber Romero: Anything to things.

428
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:54.480
LIsa Anderson: Like for someone who has used drugs for a long time because you couldn't sit with those emotions. This might be a time for you to kind of know for us to work together on on tools.

429
00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:00.900
LIsa Anderson: To feel your feelings to to cope in other ways.

430
00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:14.370
LIsa Anderson: So that's kind of, you know, I don't know if it's still early, um, you know, I definitely I think it's something worth bringing up with Dr. Solomon and you know if he does feel like it's appropriate to prescribe something

431
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:30.150
LIsa Anderson: You know that that's for you guys to work out, you know, I want you to be able to function, though, so you know if if your, if your sleep is really interfering with that are things. It is feeling with that. But it looks like you are going out.

432
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:36.390
LIsa Anderson: So it sounds like you're, you're not so anxious to where you can't

433
00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:41.430
LIsa Anderson: leave the house or or get out of bed or

434
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:51.450
Amber Romero: Yeah, I know. I know that's I'm just overly tired. I, I gotta get out of bed like I i can't i can't say still

435
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.880
LIsa Anderson: It almost sounds like a you know a little bit of

436
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:09.180
LIsa Anderson: Restlessness and and you know, like I said, your brain and your body and getting back on track that that can be a part of you, you know, just kind of

437
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:23.940
LIsa Anderson: Being off of drugs, you know, and methamphetamine too is, you know, can cause some of that paranoia can cause some of that restlessness can cause a lot of sleep disturbance. So, um,

438
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.070
Amber Romero: Yeah, I mean, it had it.

439
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:38.640
Amber Romero: Had it been longer than a couple days, then I could maybe you know understand how that would fit into my situation, but I'm

440
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:57.030
Amber Romero: Me because I i I've used mess for like long periods of time to where I couldn't even get out of bed, unless I had my revenue, the heroin to not be sticking in its a math. I knew the master to have the energy

441
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:04.530
Amber Romero: But I mean over like for this last weekend or whatever or the weekend before rather

442
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:11.640
Amber Romero: Mean, had it been longer than the one time, then maybe it would apply, but

443
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:20.610
Amber Romero: I mean I I don't feel like it was it was the the math that had any, anything to contribute to

444
00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:27.720
Amber Romero: You know this this week or last week, not being able to sleep, you know,

445
00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:32.550
LIsa Anderson: Like you said it was a pretty short period of time.

446
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:44.190
LIsa Anderson: That you were using it. Yeah, but your, your sleep had been going on before that. So I would just, just try to encourage you to give yourself a little bit of time.

447
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:49.770
LIsa Anderson: Just to let your, your body kind of be clear of of all of that.

448
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:58.350
LIsa Anderson: You know, try to get in a routine of going to bed at the same time every night waking up at the same time each day.

449
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.570
LIsa Anderson: You know, maybe try to

450
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:06.990
LIsa Anderson: You know, just getting that good habits of like winding down before bedtime.

451
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:14.610
LIsa Anderson: You know, I know it's hard right now because there's not a lot of routine. But, you know, just trying to

452
00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:20.790
LIsa Anderson: You know, not stay up all night trying to try to force yourself to go to sleep. If you can

453
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:27.360
LIsa Anderson: And then even just try to force yourself to wake up so that you can get back on track.

454
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:29.160
LIsa Anderson: To

455
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.200
LIsa Anderson: wake cycle.

456
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:46.350
LIsa Anderson: So yeah, I know you know that's that's hard right now if you don't have a whole lot of routine, but um yeah I want to encourage you, Amber, because I think you are on a good path. You know, I'm sorry, that there was all of that.

457
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:55.710
LIsa Anderson: Issues with the prescriptions, but I'll see what I can find out on my end. Hopefully that was just a one time.

458
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.120
LIsa Anderson: You know mistake that it took so long to get verified.

459
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.960
Amber Romero: Yeah i mean i i hope so, to

460
00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.000
Amber Romero: Me, I

461
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.160
Amber Romero: I switched

462
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:20.310
Amber Romero: pharmacies to to Walgreens is my, what is my normal fantasy, but I don't know why I chose Walmart.

463
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.230
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, no.

464
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:33.360
LIsa Anderson: You didn't you know you didn't know. Um, so, okay, how, how is how is social distancing treating you are you

465
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:36.480
LIsa Anderson: Are you feeling cooped up or I

466
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:50.670
Amber Romero: I didn't listen to it. I'm, I'm, I'm, I can't. It's just me. I get it. You know, stop stops, you know, spreading drums or whatever.

467
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:58.650
Amber Romero: To me, I, I can't. I mean, I cannot. I cannot say cafe so much I stay in one place.

468
00:54:59.220 --> 00:54:59.970
Um,

469
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.390
Amber Romero: So i mean i i never really

470
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.950
Amber Romero: Listened to that role. Um,

471
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:13.080
Amber Romero: You know i i don't know i just. It's hard to explain.

472
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:14.160
Amber Romero: I

473
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.930
Amber Romero: Mean I can probably tolerate being home for

474
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:32.970
Amber Romero: Maybe two days tops, where I, I can't. I can't. And I won't just, you know, because I've, I've been in jail. I've been confined i i

475
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.780
Amber Romero: Just can't do it. I don't want to

476
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:39.270
You know, and

477
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.610
Amber Romero: As far as them.

478
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:56.190
Amber Romero: You know there's there's homeless people that are on the streets and stuff and you know they don't have anywhere to go. And I mean they're, they're not like sort of say, doing anything to those people. So you really

479
00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.620
Amber Romero: Can't take someone off the street, they don't have anywhere to go, you know, so I mean there's there's still

480
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:09.360
Amber Romero: You know, of course, like the want to keep everybody off the streets, but the reality of it is, it's, it's not going to happen for everybody and

481
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:22.020
Amber Romero: I mean, I am overall I'm pretty healthy and i mean i that you know they say that this is, um, you know, like, you know, pretty traumatizing a pretty bad or whatnot. But, I mean, I have

482
00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:25.350
Amber Romero: Yeah, I have my thoughts on it. I

483
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:43.260
Amber Romero: Don't know. I just kind of guess I don't agree with what they're saying it is, you know, I could be wrong but I mean absolutely nobody I know has got the coronavirus or symptoms of ad or anything like that. It's just, you know, it's always a friend of a friend of somebody and

484
00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.400
Amber Romero: You know, just so I mean maybe if it was more

485
00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:57.330
Amber Romero: Like personal my immediate or even next to immediate life, then I would probably take it a little bit more serious but

486
00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:58.980
Amber Romero: Um,

487
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:07.950
Amber Romero: Yeah, I don't know. I think it's more along the lines of, like, population control and tactics for re election for Trump and

488
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:13.680
Amber Romero: You know, just, things of that nature. Yeah.

489
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:25.050
LIsa Anderson: No, and I just asked because, um, you know, you do seem a bit restless. So I was just curious if you have been out and about, you know, so definitely that restlessness. I think what's kind of

490
00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:33.990
LIsa Anderson: Keep checking in on that. I know you talked about, you know, just going to the park going for a walk. Has that been helpful.

491
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.270
LIsa Anderson: Phil. Have you been able to get on. Yeah.

492
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:37.200
Okay.

493
00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.250
Amber Romero: Yeah, like last night I went for a walk about

494
00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:45.180
Amber Romero: Last night last night like before when I was like

495
00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:50.580
Amber Romero: I went for a walk. Probably about 230 in the morning.

496
00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:53.010
LIsa Anderson: Okay, when he was

497
00:57:54.510 --> 00:58:07.170
Amber Romero: Yeah, I mean, I kind of felt like maybe if I got tired, it would work. Or they, you know, they get my body moving and maybe it'll help or something in order to help. All it did was give me a little bit more energized.

498
00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:22.950
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, well, you know, maybe not at 230 in the morning, but definitely I would encourage you, no one can stay in their house 24 seven, you know, we would all go crazy, but definitely getting fresh air.

499
00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:31.500
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, getting some sunshine and getting some exercise definitely can't hurt so so if anything

500
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:37.350
LIsa Anderson: I mean, do you think this next week, you might be able to say, do a walk one today.

501
00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:50.280
Amber Romero: Oh, I mean I you know I mean, minus the day bicycle data. I mean I i've been i've been outside. I've been moving around like

502
00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:54.810
Amber Romero: You know I it's easier for me because I can't see. So anyway, my legs.

503
00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:56.850
Amber Romero: Hurt in it. I mean it. It helps

504
00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:02.040
Amber Romero: It helps with the pain in my, in my day really does.

505
00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.920
LIsa Anderson: help with the pain. Okay, what about how about four times.

506
00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:06.840
LIsa Anderson: Or three

507
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:09.870
Amber Romero: Or four times a day.

508
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.700
LIsa Anderson: Four times in a week.

509
00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:20.520
LIsa Anderson: No, not four times a day. What do you think like would feel like, you know, just a small kind of little goal that you could have for this next week.

510
00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:24.030
Amber Romero: Um,

511
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:27.600
Amber Romero: Times are. Yeah, I mean I could I could do that.

512
00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.450
Amber Romero: Man Walgreens has this

513
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.240
Amber Romero: Has this like hello

Amber Romero: type deal. One of them is he happy.

519
01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:24.570
Amber Romero: Times a week and or walk 30 minutes a day for five days or whatever, you know, like little goals and stuff. And as long as you do that and you meet the goals for that week they give you the points. Oh no. So yeah, it is pretty, you do get so many points and they gives you

520
01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:31.470
Amber Romero: Like free stuff for X amount of dollars off of this or whatever but I

521
01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.640
Amber Romero: I like to do that.

522
01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:36.930
LIsa Anderson: Okay, awesome. We'll definitely keep using that, then that's kind of gives you

523
01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:54.060
LIsa Anderson: That incentive. And that's kind of a fun way to track your, your progress by how many points. You can accumulate. So definitely keep that up. You know, I wanted to give you some things to kind of think about some tools that we kind of start implementing so

528
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:44.160

542
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:13.260
LIsa Anderson: Well, try to get some rest tonight. You know, so that you can be up in them out in time for group tomorrow. And then because I want you to have a chance to talk with Dr. Element about

545
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:31.320

556
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:45.570
