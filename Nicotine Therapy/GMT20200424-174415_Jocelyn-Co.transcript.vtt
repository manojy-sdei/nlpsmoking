87
00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:10.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, I'm not. I usually don't open notes of the patients that only open my notes that they even care to patients, but for the regards to the notes from the therapies. I do not open it and I'm on a you know day we have two types of

88
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Note listing the other one is the

89
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.800
Jocelyn Corrales: That chart the carrier and the other one is another one. So I usually open the other one for recording

90
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:23.850
Okay.

91
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.300
Lyndsey Lorett: So when I was giving birth to my son.

92
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:27.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm.

93
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.700
Lyndsey Lorett: I had a C section.

94
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.530
Lyndsey Lorett: And a week after the C section, the whole thing split open

95
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:42.510
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh yeah, I had, I had a giant hole in there and they tried to put it with a wound vac for months.

96
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.000
Lyndsey Lorett: When our son was three months. That's when we lost my husband.

97
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.940
Lyndsey Lorett: And I couldn't live there anymore, so we

98
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.730
Lyndsey Lorett: Moved our stuff. And in the process, I developed a hernia. And now I have a hernia protruding out of the open wound

99
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.460
Lyndsey Lorett: And I battled

100
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.430
Lyndsey Lorett: All kinds of different infections.

101
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:13.980
Lyndsey Lorett: So, um, it's just such a long process to to shower changed the wound to get dressed.

102
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.170
Jocelyn Corrales: So you still have one

103
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.050
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I still have the wound.

104
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.250
Lyndsey Lorett: Because they put a ban on all elective surgeries.

105
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.510
Lyndsey Lorett: I finally had to negative test for mercy.

106
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.770
Jocelyn Corrales: So they were ready to

107
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.680
Lyndsey Lorett: Surgery and then the band it

108
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.870
Jocelyn Corrales: So, oh, because of the current situation right now.

109
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:46.530
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. Um, so it's you know it's been a long year and a half. I go through daily womb changes.

110
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.160
Uh huh.

111
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.900
Lyndsey Lorett: And so I tend to I have

112
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.330
Lyndsey Lorett: These wipes. These

113
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Medical white that I wake up every day with

114
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.920
Lyndsey Lorett: But as far as sharing. I usually just do it twice a week.

115
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.160
Jocelyn Corrales: At least here still caring about yourself. That's what I want to know about.

116
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh, of course. I don't like to smell. I don't want to smell.

117
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.800
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's a good thing. That's your in laws are also very helpful to you.

118
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:24.450
Lyndsey Lorett: They are very helpful, but actually getting this. I've had to felt surgeries are ready with this.

119
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.970
Lyndsey Lorett: And being an, you know, a recovering addict. It's difficult.

120
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.400
Lyndsey Lorett: And being in a vulnerable place of losing my husband.

121
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.430
Lyndsey Lorett: But I never got a prescription outside of the hospital.

122
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Doing. I'm just taking every precaution to not go

123
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Go back there. Yes, I know. I know. And you're in Los are very supportive of it.

124
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.640
Lyndsey Lorett: They are supportive, but I, I believe you should not live with your in laws.

125
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Without your significant other.

126
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.850
Lyndsey Lorett: It's a whole different. It's like you're being thrown into a whole new family.

127
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.500
Jocelyn Corrales: And, you know,

128
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.490
Lyndsey Lorett: What made it work.

129
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.560
Jocelyn Corrales: But they're being good to you.

130
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Ah, we have our good days in our bad days.

131
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh that's that's a typical of a family.

132
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.600
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, it's tough.

133
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.300
Jocelyn Corrales: But it's not always bad days it's it's a mixture of good and bad days.

134
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.140
Yes.

135
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.060
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so are you able to eat, eat, eat well eat on time.

136
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:45.360
Lyndsey Lorett: So because my intestines are outside of my body it. I have the most pain when I eat.

137
00:11:45.840 --> 00:12:01.350
Lyndsey Lorett: And so I will drink a protein shake in the morning, and I'll wait until dinnertime to eat because it just causes so much pain that I can't do a whole lot of words processing through there. Yeah.

138
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.730
Jocelyn Corrales: I mean,

Lyndsey Lorett: Over 100 pounds in 15 months.

150
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Not on purpose.

151
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.270
I like to eat.

152
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.620
Jocelyn Corrales: And that is because of your medical condition.

153
00:12:59.130 --> 00:12:59.850
Yes.

154
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:21.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried eating at least maybe because you're just I've noticed you just, you're just eating twice a day, once in the morning in once at dinner, have we tried eating just a light meal in between or just you know your protein shake in the middle.

155
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.490
Lyndsey Lorett: In the middle or I tried yogurt or just, you know, little

156
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Fruits that

157
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:35.730
Lyndsey Lorett: No matter what I put in it digest and it just, it prevents me from doing normal things

158
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh. So usually it's in the during the process of digestion, that it is very painful.

159
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:49.830
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. So even if you eat very light meal or very, like, for example, just in case to eat bread. It's still very painful.

160
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, we can't even read

161
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Our potatoes better

162
00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Sometimes at night with the protein. I'll have some bread or potatoes or rice.

163
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:07.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried in between meals. Try eating just Bread Alone.

164
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Trying to avoid acidic.

165
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Food so bread or

166
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.970
Jocelyn Corrales: Potatoes, something like that.

167
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:19.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Right.

168
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.700
A lot of

169
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:27.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Like nutrients. If I'm going to eat and it's gonna hurt. I got to put the right thing in

170
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, because protein are usually like for example, meet if you eat meat. It's usually

171
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.820
Jocelyn Corrales: See like you know in nature, but

172
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:47.160
Jocelyn Corrales: What about. Have you tried you know a little bit of rice and meat or it's still very painful. If you eat meat.

173
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't really matter.

174
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.010
Jocelyn Corrales: If you tried to take protein shake in between. Would it be better.

175
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:02.850
Lyndsey Lorett: And it's still, I still have the pain, not as bad as when I eat.

176
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.560
Jocelyn Corrales: A full me actual yeah

177
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.040
Lyndsey Lorett: So the protein shake helps um

Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, I know how you feel.

186
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:43.950
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's sometimes very difficult. You know, there are things that you would like to eat their stuff you want to eat very badly. But because of the medical condition you're unable to

187
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.580
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could try doing

188
00:15:49.230 --> 00:16:03.780
Jocelyn Corrales: A little bit of shape in the middle. Just try instead of eating a because you've mentioned it's when you're taking shake it's better than eating a meal so I try taking the shake in the middle, are you currently working

189
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.940
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I can't live

190
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.640
Lyndsey Lorett: Like, I'm not even supposed to lift my son.

191
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.720
Lyndsey Lorett: You know cuz it's the, it's the hernias like

192
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.580
Lyndsey Lorett: Couldn't just totally come out.

193
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.870
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, um,

194
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.930
Lyndsey Lorett: But you can't tell me not to lift my son. I'm gonna do

195
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.520
Jocelyn Corrales: It. You know why.

196
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.750
Lyndsey Lorett: can't work. Work can't work with this giant open wound

197
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.280
Jocelyn Corrales: And you know, I like your son. He's very he's very cooperative situations. Yeah.

198
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.210
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm glad that I get to experience these moments.

199
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.620
Lyndsey Lorett: But at the same time. I've worked since I was 16 and

200
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.700
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm I'm used to that schedule.

201
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:45.750
And

202
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:55.170
Lyndsey Lorett: Just the feeling of productive news and doing something important in life. And I know I've been with my son is important, but

203
00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.690
Lyndsey Lorett: I've never, I've never not worked. So it's thrown me off a little bit.

204
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. Okay. So, yeah, you know,

205
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:11.370
Jocelyn Corrales: They're not young at all times, you know it's it's good that you are able to take care of your son. Yeah.

206
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:17.520
Jocelyn Corrales: And I think you have a valid reason you know they were they grow up, it's you know, it's

207
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:32.850
Jocelyn Corrales: It's a lot harder. It's better to be able yeah it's eight it's better to, you know, see where that moment that you have built him you know he's only he's only a baby ones. No, it's not gonna repeat it again. So, you know,

208
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:45.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Memories you build up with him is going to be very vital for his growth and development actually not only physically but also emotional development.

209
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:51.330
Lyndsey Lorett: Because when I you know I going with when I do go back to work, how

210
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.240
Lyndsey Lorett: Is he going to handle not you know

211
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:55.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Not being with you.

212
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:05.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, but I think maybe I think by then he'll be a little bit older and they thought he would understand then. Yeah.

213
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried working home base or online.

214
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.860
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I didn't like him.

215
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.490
To complete that

216
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.420
Jocelyn Corrales: You could actually try working. If you have a computer at home.

217
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.290
Lyndsey Lorett: I do

218
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:32.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Right, yeah. You could try applying. Like, for example, try doing you know like typing or, you know, chat support something like that or

219
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.090
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

220
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.060
Lyndsey Lorett: They want like it. We have to pay you, and you need to give us your bank information and just like

221
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh really,

222
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:45.870
Yeah.

223
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.010
Lyndsey Lorett: But I can look more into it. I would be nice.

224
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.420
Jocelyn Corrales: You can actually try looking out there actually different sites.

225
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.230
Jocelyn Corrales: job sites. And usually these job sites doesn't

226
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Usually they asked for your bank account, but make sure that

227
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:13.710
Jocelyn Corrales: That particular job site is a legitimate one, you can always check, you can always do a fact check for that particular site. If it's a legitimate limit legitimate one, are not

228
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:21.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Good actually try because if you're going to do, you know, like for example, you want to do surveys

229
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:33.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Surveys, you would like to enjoy a row and you have to get paid by doing service actually involves money. Sometimes they would ask you for money for you to be able to do surveys is sometimes I would think it's just like

230
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.360
Jocelyn Corrales: What's the. Why do I have to pay when you have to do surveys. Yeah, yeah. So

231
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.260
Jocelyn Corrales: At no

232
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Charge. Because sometimes those

233
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:53.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Something I don't know if we could see that that has come, but try to look for a an online online job site. Like, for example, free up

234
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Work free up up work or

235
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.810
Jocelyn Corrales: Online jobs.com, something like that.

236
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:02.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay cuz

237
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Income would be nice. I mean, he gets

238
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.580
Lyndsey Lorett: survivor benefits from his dad.

239
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:21.810
Lyndsey Lorett: His Dad was going to school finishing his degrees. So I was the breadwinner, and he didn't make very much and so his survivor benefits are very low.

240
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, it's not enough for you and your son.

241
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.820
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah. Well, he's taking care of it go, it goes to him.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:40.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. So with regards to your mental health and you've mentioned to me that you're working out to be a

244
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Win right and it's in it's working out.

245
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.540
Lyndsey Lorett: It's been it

246
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:59.250
Lyndsey Lorett: I've done a lot of things with through the addiction and getting help, but there's a level with Gwen that I just haven't been able to reach with anyone else and

247
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.720
Lyndsey Lorett: I'm just ready to eat. I'm excited for, you know, even though it hurts.

248
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.060
Lyndsey Lorett: Good at the end.

249
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, yeah.

250
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.290
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually, it feels good to be clean.

251
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.000
It does.

252
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:30.270
Jocelyn Corrales: And I it's also good if you work out with a therapist that is compatible, really you someone who would not judge you for who you are, you know, and would understand your situation and, you know,

253
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:39.450
Jocelyn Corrales: Like a friend who would tell you that. No, you're doing this wrong, and would tell you honestly that you're not doing it right or you should do this. You should do that.

254
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:49.200
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, she's why I have a really hard time saying no, like, I just it like will come out.

255
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.830
Jocelyn Corrales: We're

256
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.950
Lyndsey Lorett: Working on being able to say no.

257
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:10.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, yes, try to work out saying know if you think you're not able to, like, you know, it's not bad to say no at times. So that's also one of your problem saying always saying yes to everyone.

258
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:18.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Just always be just not rocking the boat at all. I don't like conflict, it

259
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.550
Jocelyn Corrales: You don't want to complicate things

260
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.410
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, and

261
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:28.590
Lyndsey Lorett: A lot of things are not said in in our house.

262
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Because

263
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:30.960
It just

264
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.530
Lyndsey Lorett: The argument goes so quickly like

265
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:36.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

266
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:54.270
Jocelyn Corrales: I know how you. I know, I know know how you feel when you mentioned to me that you're leaving with your in laws and it's a different family, you know,

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried living with your own parents

270
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.750
Lyndsey Lorett: So, the situation is

271
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:12.810
Lyndsey Lorett: I

272
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.340
Lyndsey Lorett: I have a daughter a 10 year old daughter and

273
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.120
Lyndsey Lorett: I was a single mom for

274
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:32.280
Lyndsey Lorett: Eight years we lived with my parents saving money to buy a home. Um, I got my identity stolen and

275
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:38.430
Lyndsey Lorett: All the money I worked so hard for and saved was just gone.

276
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:48.030
Lyndsey Lorett: Golden. Yes. And, um, so it was like starting over for us. And then when I met my husband.

277
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.070
Lyndsey Lorett: It was the first guy I brought into her life.

278
00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.390
Lyndsey Lorett: I didn't date, very much. She was my main focus

279
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:20.340
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. So we moved in together. And she was living with us. And when he passed away. It was in the middle of the school year, and she had just started at a new school and I just didn't want to pull her out of that environment and she a really special bond with my parents.

280
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.240
Lyndsey Lorett: It's just a difficult situation, it's

281
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:34.980
Lyndsey Lorett: My, my in laws don't want me taking my son to Farmington and my parents don't want

282
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.060
I want your parents.

283
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.010
Lyndsey Lorett: They don't

284
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:39.540
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

285
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.240
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like you're torn in between because if

286
00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.410

293
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.050

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.660

306
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.120
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes. And because they she hasn't spent very much time with all over

308
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Going to be jealous or

309
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:31.920

310
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:41.310
Jocelyn Corrales: And I know she's already you know she's already 10 years old and I think she would understand if you would tell her you know tried to talk to her.

311

Jocelyn Corrales: About your situation so that she would understand so she would not be angry or, you know, have some bitter feelings about unit taking here taking care of her. Currently I guess she know about your medical situation.

Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, yes.

313
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:07.290

314
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:19.650
Jocelyn Corrales: At least you can do that at times, but try to be, you know, distance as you have mentioned, you always communicate with her through messenger video and that's that's a good thing.

315
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.190
Jocelyn Corrales: That's a good way of connecting even if you're not physically there.

316
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.260
Jocelyn Corrales: She would feel that you really care for her because you you're in constant communication with her.

317
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's good.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.560
Jocelyn Corrales: To be able to clear your mind.

321
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.170
Lyndsey Lorett: You're gonna laugh at me.

322
00:27:54.390 --> 00:28:00.120
Lyndsey Lorett: Okay, so, um, I take transit own at night sleeping aid.

323
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.970
Lyndsey Lorett: And if I

324
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:09.480
Lyndsey Lorett: Have been trying to go to sleep, and I can't. Um, I watched Dr. Pimple copper

325
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.420
Lyndsey Lorett: Because it just, it's like nothing, and it just

326
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Takes it takes

327
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.570
Jocelyn Corrales: It takes your mind away from from everything

328
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.240
Lyndsey Lorett: It's disgusting. Sometimes, but

329
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.410
Lyndsey Lorett: You know it.

330
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.750
Lyndsey Lorett: It just helps

331
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.710
Jocelyn Corrales: It my words.

332
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.060
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried reading a book or you're not into reading

333
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:49.410
Lyndsey Lorett: Um no I I am into reading. Um, but I'm having

334
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.760
Lyndsey Lorett: Like some memory issues.

335
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Because we're in lockdown basically

336
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.040
Lyndsey Lorett: We're watching a lot of TV a lot of

337
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:19.200
Lyndsey Lorett: Consistent nose and like my brain is overloaded on information like I can't remember what happened last week and then they might think I'm crazy. So adding another thing in there is just difficult

338
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:20.370
Mm hmm.

339
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:35.670
Jocelyn Corrales: I don't think it's good watching too much TV, but maybe you can try the routine to another activities, instead of watching too much TV, maybe you could try if you're into reading before and you're you like reading

340
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.350
Jocelyn Corrales: You could try reading instead

341
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:43.290
Jocelyn Corrales: You could try reading instead of watching you know sometimes when you watch a lot of TV, it's actually sometimes

342
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Stressful or something like you feel heavy afterwards, you know,

343
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Just sitting all day watching TV.

344
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.170
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, it's

345
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.490
Lyndsey Lorett: I mean, I love a good movie. Every once in a while.

346
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.410
Jocelyn Corrales: But, but

347
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.820
Jocelyn Corrales: All we need to hold me

348
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:11.130

350
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.050
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

351
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.580
Jocelyn Corrales: I know

Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. So you're not able to do some walking

362
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.910
Lyndsey Lorett: No, and I think it's so important.

363
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.710
To get that

366
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.310
Jocelyn Corrales: A rigorous or extensive type of walking

367
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:52.830
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, it's just, you know, walk around like a 30 minute walk with

368
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:57.210
Lyndsey Lorett: Looking beings and talking and point things out to him and

369
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.420
Lyndsey Lorett: It's not like we're power walking things

370
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:04.200
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

371
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.810
Jocelyn Corrales: What exercise. Are you allowed to do

372
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.320
Lyndsey Lorett: I am not supposed to do anything. I know you're supposed to vacuum, but

373
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.330
Lyndsey Lorett: Oh my images, they don't like to clean and

374
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:29.130
Lyndsey Lorett: My son is crawling. And so, and they have like so many animals and there's so much hair.

375
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.810
Jocelyn Corrales: But when you vacuum. It's not stressful to you.

376
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Wow, it's painful also

377
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Their, their vacuum is from like probably the 1950s.

378
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.190
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh wait, that's very heavy

379
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.300
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, so I have just sweep first and then back you

380
00:32:51.330 --> 00:33:08.310
Jocelyn Corrales: I think that's a good idea. Then vacuum, you know, just vacuum. The important portion that needs to be vacuum, like, you know, for example, if you have carpets or the sofa just vacuum those areas and you know for the floor, you can just

381
00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.920
Jocelyn Corrales: sweep and mop the floor. There's no need to vacuum it yeah it's

382
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:14.370
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah.

383
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:20.910
Jocelyn Corrales: It because if you're telling me that it's, you know, a 1950s vacuum. I think

384
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.630
Lyndsey Lorett: I go

385
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:22.860
Lyndsey Lorett: Heavy

386
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:32.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I guess it's. I know, I know. It's very heavy and it's going to be very stressful for you physically because as you have mentioned, you're not allowed to do some

387
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:33.690
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes.

388
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.250
Jocelyn Corrales: So I began this acting

389
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.390
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, but but but doing but sweeping the floor is fine.

390
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, I just didn't take a couple hours and clean the house one week.

391
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:49.830
Lyndsey Lorett: And I hurt for a couple days after my pain level goes up, and I have to take

392
00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.830
Lyndsey Lorett: More ibuprofen. Um, but

393
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:58.890
Lyndsey Lorett: It's doable and it makes me feel better that he's not gonna choke on a bunch of hair.

394
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:05.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Hahaha okay so you do cleaning you do cleaning up the house once a week.

395
00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:09.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. And how many hours. Would you do that in a day.

396
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.310
Lyndsey Lorett: To clean the house. It usually takes about three or four hours.

397
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.880
Jocelyn Corrales: So you mean about three to four hours.

398
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.170
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, it's really dirty, it's dirty.

399
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:36.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried you know because you just mentioned in the end. That's also very stressful. If you're going to clean the house for the whole three to four, eight, please, four hours. That's very long. Have you tried cleaning it on a

400
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:45.030
Jocelyn Corrales: On an installment basis. Like, for example, you do this portion. Like, for example, the living room. You do that for today.

401
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:58.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Then the other areas for tomorrow. So instead of working out for the whole street four hours, you're going to clean it for just maybe 30 minutes to one art and the next day you do another portion again.

402
00:34:58.770 --> 00:34:59.670
Jocelyn Corrales: So they don't get

403
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:04.080
Lyndsey Lorett: Wrapped all over. If you don't get all the hair like

404
00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.440
Lyndsey Lorett: in random places and do it.

405
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.880
Jocelyn Corrales: It's resonating

406
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:15.150
Lyndsey Lorett: For me, because my in laws, go to my doctor's appointments and they know that I'm not supposed to push it back to them.

407
00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:22.560
Lyndsey Lorett: But then they don't do it. And I can't stand, not having it done.

408
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.250
Jocelyn Corrales: What pets. Do they have. Do they have cats.

409
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Because they're over

410
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.310
Lyndsey Lorett: Yes, they have.

411
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.220
Lyndsey Lorett: Australian Shepherd. I think it's

412
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.160
Lyndsey Lorett: A lot. Yeah, the dogs got a lot of hair.

413
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:38.970
Jocelyn Corrales: And then

414
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.510
Lyndsey Lorett: There's about four or five cats that come and go.

415
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:44.790
Lyndsey Lorett: And

416
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:45.840
Bear.

417
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.700
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, and go, I didn't have animals growing up, so it's it's a

418
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.450
Lyndsey Lorett: Huge change for me, but I'm trying

419
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.760
Lyndsey Lorett: I am try my brother in law does help me clean

420
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.560

425
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.130

Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, that's why he he also queens.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:09.150
Jocelyn Corrales: That's okay.

458
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:14.250

462
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:32.400
Lyndsey Lorett: I am really worried about it though, because I obviously had multiple surgeries and I you know I know what to expect.

463
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.710
Lyndsey Lorett: But they're doing a full abdominal reconstructive surgery.

464
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:42.720
Lyndsey Lorett: And it's supposed to be like a 12 to 18 hour surgery.

465
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:49.830
Lyndsey Lorett: And I'm just, I'm, I'm really scared. I've had so much go wrong with this.

466
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.150
Lyndsey Lorett: It's a big anxiety for

467
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:54.540
Me.

468
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.300
Jocelyn Corrales: So you're always worried about

469
00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:02.280
Jocelyn Corrales: You're always we're thinking about the surgery of what would probably happen.

470
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.840
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, and I know it's such a bad thing to think

471
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:19.590
Lyndsey Lorett: That things about it because then they might country I know that that that's important and true and I don't know how to shift that mindset. Great.

472
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:30.060
Jocelyn Corrales: Actually, I couldn't blame you. Because the truth is, there is really a possibility of that going to happen. But, you know, the positive about it is that

473
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:36.660
Jocelyn Corrales: There's a big policy about possibility of food recovery. So

474
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:47.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Instead of thinking about the negative because in every situation that we have, you know, especially during surgery. There's, there are bad things and they're also good things, you know,

475
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:58.530
Jocelyn Corrales: There are so many thoughts about that, you know, you can think about so many bad things about it. But try thinking about the good things about it.

476
00:40:59.220 --> 00:40:59.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

477
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:05.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Check your doctor. Yes, trust your doctors. I know you trust your doctors

478
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.480
Jocelyn Corrales: A deal. And I know you give your 100%

479
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:16.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, in them that they're going to take care of you and that you're going to be better. After that, I think they have assured you

480
00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.780
Jocelyn Corrales: That you will recover, although not

481
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:23.400
Lyndsey Lorett: Well they say they did nothing to expect one or two things.

482
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:24.870
Lyndsey Lorett: To go wrong.

483
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.150
Lyndsey Lorett: Because in surgery.

484
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.720
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, but I know it'll be taken care of.

485
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:49.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I know. Yes. This included in the race. You know, that's a possibility. That's true. That's why I told you there are also possible negative things, but try to think about it positively of what it would contribute if you're if you know it would be successful. You know, you

486
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:58.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Would say, yeah, yeah, we would we would. Let's say it's 100% but you know when when we at least. Yeah, you could get back to your life, you could, you know,

487
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:00.810
Jocelyn Corrales: Normally

488
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.300

489
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.900

490
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.530

496
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:39.960
Jocelyn Corrales: I tried to think of the positive things instead of the negative things because the more you negative. It's like

497
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:50.550
Jocelyn Corrales: The more negative, you are, the more you attract negative energy and the more you think about it, the more you become anxious. Why, why not try to be positive about it. It's like

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:56.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I trust my doctor. I'm going to be better and I look forward to that.

Jocelyn Corrales: A group.

583
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:26.460
Lyndsey Lorett: Pretty close with the people in the group. So I would know. But they were struggling with

584
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:29.070

690
00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:58.080
Lyndsey Lorett: Mm hmm. So that I feel secure because

691
00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:05.280
Lyndsey Lorett: When he's not even close to out of something drew start is OCD kicks in.

Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. Okay.

695
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:25.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so what you've mentioned to me wake up early at 8am to 830

696
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:33.000
Jocelyn Corrales: And that's a good time to wake up. It's not bad at all. I don't think it's late still early

697
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:42.060
Jocelyn Corrales: When you consider yeah what I consider late is when you wake up at around 1110 or 11 in the morning, that's legal already

698
00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:45.210
Lyndsey Lorett: I don't think I've ever slept that long.

699
00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah because yeah because of anxiety that you have mentioned.

700
00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:51.090
Yeah.

701
00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:57.240
Jocelyn Corrales: So what I said just for the meal times

702
01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:03.660
Jocelyn Corrales: You only eat two meals in a day.

703
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.130
Yes.

704
01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:11.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Due to her due to your condition.

705
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:12.150
Yeah.

706
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:19.860
Jocelyn Corrales: So what I say, just as although you're taking shakes already try to

707
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:29.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Eat one more in between because you have, I think your doctors also concerned about your weight and you need a lot. I think what why he wants you to take a lot of protein because they're planning.

708
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:39.060
Jocelyn Corrales: To do surgery on you. That's also part of, you know, it's a very vital, it's very vital for your recovery.

709
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:42.330
Jocelyn Corrales: And healing. That's why you need a lot of protein.

710
01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:46.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so I think, try to you know I don't eat.

711
01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:53.640
Jocelyn Corrales: A full glass when you do your meal in the morning. Is it a full glass.

712
01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:58.680
Lyndsey Lorett: It is I blend it up with like the spinach and the fruit and stuff.

713
01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:09.330
Jocelyn Corrales: So just to try to increase your meal in a day because he only take twice, once in the morning. Once in the evening in

714
01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:29.640
Jocelyn Corrales: In between the day you know you also mentioned you feel hungry. Why, let's try a piece he eat half of his eat half of that meal in a day in in the day. And do you do you rest in the middle of the day. Like, for example, in the afternoon late afternoon or around one o'clock.

715
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.620
Lyndsey Lorett: No, I have, I have a little boy. There's no resting

716
01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, he doesn't take naps.

717
01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:41.220
Lyndsey Lorett: Though he does, but I usually hold him while he's taking a nap.

718
01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.130

Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, or, yeah.

721
01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:54.450
Lyndsey Lorett: We could. I guess we could try that.

722
01:01:56.730 --> 01:02:07.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Have. Have you tried before taking a nap. Would it be better if you take, you know, half of the half glass shake before just before you take a nap so that

723
01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:15.270
Jocelyn Corrales: When your son naps and when you're taking arrest. Also, you would feel that much pain.

724
01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.800
Lyndsey Lorett: Yeah, he's tried right

725
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:24.180
