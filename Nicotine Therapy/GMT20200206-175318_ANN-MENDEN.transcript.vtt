32
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:36.840
ANN MENDENHALL: And I noticed in your pre screen that you had a couple of oldies and I was wondering when they were. And you know how long you're in the hospital and all that.

33
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.190
Joshua Johnson: Um,

34
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.100
Joshua Johnson: They were a while back.

35
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.300
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, when we just say the most recent one was

36
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.120
Joshua Johnson: Two years ago, okay.

37
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.380
ANN MENDENHALL: And so, you haven't had to go to the ER since then.

38
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.070
Joshua Johnson: I've been to the ER quite a bit, but not for God.

39
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.700
ANN MENDENHALL: OK for any substance related things are there for other

40
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.360
Joshua Johnson: Yeah for Suboxone

41
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.510
ANN MENDENHALL: For Suboxone to get some okay

42
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.340
ANN MENDENHALL: So I'm currently. Whoops.

43
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.890
ANN MENDENHALL: So when did you start the Suboxone

44
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.490
Joshua Johnson: About two and a half weeks ago.

45
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.390
Okay.

46
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.110
ANN MENDENHALL: And have you, do you have a primary care that was prescribing it or just strictly from the ER.

47
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.270
ANN MENDENHALL: Er, okay.

48
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.740
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, this will be a lot better. Um, you know i mean you know what a drag it is to go to the ER and have to wait forever or you're feeling terrible so

49
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.170
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, how much have you been taking. How much have they been giving you

50
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.850
Joshua Johnson: Two tablets.

51
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.730
ANN MENDENHALL: Of the buprenorphine Suboxone

52
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.110
Joshua Johnson: Right.

53
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, okay.

54
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.300
ANN MENDENHALL: And is it the eight milligram to milligram

55
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.580
Joshua Johnson: Yeah, yeah. That's what I figured.

56
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.640
ANN MENDENHALL: How have you been feeling on that.

57
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.610
Joshua Johnson: I'm okay. I'm still having a lot of bad dreams at night, like the drug dreams.

58
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.690
Yeah.

59
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.600
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, you know, they, they may take a little while, you know, the further because, you know, two and a half way I'm your last use was December.

60
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:45.810
ANN MENDENHALL: But if you've only been on the Suboxone for two and a half weeks. So what did you do between December 17 and when you started the Suboxone you're on anything methadone or anything.

61
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.550
Joshua Johnson: No, I was completely clean

62
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.390
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so you were just kind of toughing it out.

63
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.530
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. Did you go cold turkey when you when you quit.

64
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.920
ANN MENDENHALL: I did. Wow. It's not easy.

65
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.020
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay so Suboxone certainly should be helping from there. But, you know, one of the things that I work in,

66
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:19.860
ANN MENDENHALL: A drug and alcohol rehab facilities. I actually work in in three of them. It just north of San Francisco and you know I I talked to my patients there and

67
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.970
ANN MENDENHALL: Whether it's alcohol, whether it's opiates math.

68
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:41.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Coke, you know, whatever. Sleep is it really takes a while to, sort of, you know, regulate because, you know, especially when you've been on, you know, amphetamines of some sort, you know it's it's really in a kind of jacked up to where it's going to take a little file.

69
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.130
ANN MENDENHALL: But I can make some recommendations to about that we can talk about that later to

70
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:58.530
ANN MENDENHALL: Help you know easy transition get into kind of good sleep habits that may help you know it. Do you have a primary care provider.

71
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.750
Joshua Johnson: I don't. Okay.

72
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.440
All right.

73
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:13.320
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, and so your, your nightmares have been drug related, have they did you have them at all when you were using or is just started since you've stopped.

74
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.510
Joshua Johnson: It started since I stopped.

75
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.370
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. All right. And are you woken up every night.

76
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.590
Joshua Johnson: Yeah, okay.

77
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.090
ANN MENDENHALL: Multiple times.

78
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.940
Joshua Johnson: Um, at least a couple times a night.

79
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.030
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, yeah. Well, we will, we can talk about that, about, you know, possibly

80
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.110
ANN MENDENHALL: What might be helping their what could help.

81
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:44.340
ANN MENDENHALL: So when what symptoms did you have when you withdrawing just the standard

82
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.590
Joshua Johnson: Um, yeah, okay.

83
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.040
ANN MENDENHALL: What we're most significant for you.

84
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.120
Joshua Johnson: The rest of slave not sleeping and nausea. Okay.

85
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.050
ANN MENDENHALL: Well can you were coming off two things. And so that that makes it even harder for sure.

86
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:12.990
ANN MENDENHALL: And but you've had no history of suicide attempts.

87
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.520
ANN MENDENHALL: No. Okay.

88
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.300
ANN MENDENHALL: And there's kind of a risk assessment that

89
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.460
ANN MENDENHALL: Um,

90
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.670
ANN MENDENHALL: Do you have any family history of suicide or suicide attempts.

91
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.290
Joshua Johnson: No. Okay.

92
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:46.980
ANN MENDENHALL: And have you ever had in this what they call suicidal ideation meaning like plans or thoughts of killing yourself.

93
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:48.930
Joshua Johnson: Okay.

94
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.250
Okay.

95
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.350
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, that's good.

96
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.550
ANN MENDENHALL: One other thing, although you I don't see you as a risk factor, but do you have firearms or access to them.

97
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.260
Joshua Johnson: No. Okay.

98
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:16.890
Okay.

99
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:18.780
ANN MENDENHALL: Good. Well, I'm

100
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Glad that doesn't sound like that's an issue for you and you kind of caught this in time.

101
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Now one of the question. We do ask though, excuse me drink of water here.

102
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.380
ANN MENDENHALL: Is

103
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:47.490
ANN MENDENHALL: What kind of consequences. Have you experienced in this could be legal, like, you know, arrest you eyes, anything like that. Or it could be work related or relationship.

104
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.050
Joshua Johnson: I've lost everything my family. I went to jail.

105
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.900
Joshua Johnson: They always like freedom.

106
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.600
Yeah, that's pretty tough.

107
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.310
ANN MENDENHALL: Well,

108
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:17.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Hopefully, the longer you stay sober and maybe you can kind of, you know, prove to your family that you really committed to your recovery. Maybe you can start building some of those bridges. It takes a while because you know

109
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.630
Joshua Johnson: I actually already have the let me come back home. So

110
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.250
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, that's wonderful.

111
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.030
Joshua Johnson: Yeah.

112
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.790
ANN MENDENHALL: Good. Well, it sounds like you have a loving supportive family and they're able to to see that you're really trying

113
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.730
Joshua Johnson: Yeah, my parents actually run out recovery home.

114
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.320
ANN MENDENHALL: They did what

115
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.270
Joshua Johnson: They actually run a recovery home.

116
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.480
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, okay. So like a sober living home.

117
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.910
Joshua Johnson: Six months. Living Program.

118
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.820
ANN MENDENHALL: So they really understand

119
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:56.640
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, yeah, I'm really glad to hear that because I worry about people who don't have anybody who's a good strong support, particularly family and I do run into that a lot so

120
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:07.440
ANN MENDENHALL: That puts you like, you know, light years ahead in terms of, you know, being able to sustain your recovery and not relapse. So I'm good.

121
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.840
ANN MENDENHALL: I'm going to just jot that down.

122
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.560
ANN MENDENHALL: You're living at home.

123
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.700
ANN MENDENHALL: Any other substance use, like benzo

124
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Weed alcohol.

125
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.170
Okay.

126
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.080
ANN MENDENHALL: And what's the longest amount of time you've been sober.

127
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.960
Joshua Johnson: A year. Okay.

128
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.600
ANN MENDENHALL: And how long ago was that was that.

129
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.060
Joshua Johnson: Five years ago, okay.

130
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:57.180
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And have you ever been in any detox war residential treatment facilities.

131
00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.130
Joshua Johnson: No. Okay.

132
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.200
ANN MENDENHALL: How about any na or anything like that. Yeah, okay.

133
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.970
Joshua Johnson: Good. I go weekly

134
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.310
ANN MENDENHALL: Good. Do you have a sponsor.

135
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.410
Joshua Johnson: Not yet. Okay.

136
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.280
ANN MENDENHALL: My son is

137
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.430
ANN MENDENHALL: Sober for now seven years from alcohol. He's 30 just turned 34

138
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:30.150
ANN MENDENHALL: And I will say that I think the single most important thing that got him really going and is kept him sober. Is he had a really

139
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:40.830
ANN MENDENHALL: Has still the same sponsor. So I really encourage that. When you find, you know, and I think, you know, some people go, oh my god, I gotta find just the right person or, you know, this isn't going to work.

140
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:48.600
ANN MENDENHALL: And don't get too hung up on that because you can always switch you know you can ask somebody, would you be my temporary sponsor if you kind of

141
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:58.440
ANN MENDENHALL: Think they might work, but you're not sure. And then that kind of gives you an out if you decide, oh, this, this is not a good match. You can thank them and move on. So,

142
00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:59.070
Joshua Johnson: Again,

143
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.030
Just a thought.

144
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:08.460
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And do you have any other site diagnoses. You know, like

145
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:09.900

Joshua Johnson: Things ID and depression.

147
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.620

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.200
Joshua Johnson: Yeah.

164
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.400
ANN MENDENHALL: What was that for

165
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.870
Joshua Johnson: Because my my leg was messed up.

166
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.310
Okay.

167
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.710
ANN MENDENHALL: That must have been a tough one to heal from

168
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.720
Joshua Johnson: took a long time.

169
00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.360
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, any other surgeries. That's it.

170
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.620
Joshua Johnson: That's it.

171
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.220
Okay.

172
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.680
ANN MENDENHALL: And family history.

173
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.500
ANN MENDENHALL: Are both your parents living

174
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.300
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, okay.

175
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:42.750
ANN MENDENHALL: Let's see your mom's alive. Does she have any health concerns or a substance use issues.

176
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.110

177
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.800

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.140

Okay.

183
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:49.170
ANN MENDENHALL: And I think the fact that they run a sober living house is is really wonderful and I find it. The recovery treatment centers where I work, most all of the people that work there are in recovery themselves and the other medical provider and myself or maybe only that that

184
00:16:50.520 --> 00:17:09.060
ANN MENDENHALL: I really watch them talk to some of the residents. And I think when you've got that experience like your parents have you can really understand on a deeper level what people are going through. I mean, it really relate. And so, you know, that's, I think that's super important.

185
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:18.000
ANN MENDENHALL: Is I think a lot of people come in, you know, when they're starting their recovery or they're going into treatment and they feel a lot of guilt and shame and

186
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:32.550
ANN MENDENHALL: And actually, I look at it the other way. It's like, yes. All right. You really took a big step to do this and the past is the past. And, you know, let's just go from here. So I'm glad you're here.

187
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.660

273
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:17.580
ANN MENDENHALL: I think you'll like it. People have, you know, share their experiences and we have people who've been sober, you know, and in the program for eight months. And, you know, up to people who, you know, just got sober and people who have had similar experiences who've had

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:14.580
ANN MENDENHALL: You know a lot of my people have been there for like five or six months or longer. I give a month prescription. So this is a short one, but it's not going to always be like that. Just to kind of let you know.

304
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.370

305
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:51.870

307
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.380

ANN MENDENHALL: And

336
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:26.640
Get this ready

337
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.810
ANN MENDENHALL: Now,

338
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.260
ANN MENDENHALL: Do you have any current drug allergies.

339
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:00.630
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

340
00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:36.870
ANN MENDENHALL: Now vitals, obviously we're not in the same room. So this is kind of minimal thing but a couple of things. How tall are you,

341
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:38.940
Joshua Johnson: Six one

342
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.020
ANN MENDENHALL: And how much do you weigh

343
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.710
ANN MENDENHALL: 240 40

344
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:53.880
ANN MENDENHALL: And

345
00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:01.050
ANN MENDENHALL: So I'm I want to get your heart rate to. So, do you know how to find your pulse in your neck.

346
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.570
Joshua Johnson: Carotid artery. Yeah, okay.

347
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.500
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, so I want you to go ahead and find it let me know when you have it.

348
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:24.120
ANN MENDENHALL: Yet I go, okay. And so what I'm going to do, I'm going to have an accountant, but the way I'm going to do this is all count 321 and I'll say start. And when I say that you start counting the number of beats you feel. And when I say stop then you give me that number.

349
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.200
ANN MENDENHALL: And then I

350
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.240
Okay, so

351
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.370
ANN MENDENHALL: 321 start

352
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:44.970
Stop.

353
00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.760
Okay.

354
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.350
ANN MENDENHALL: That's about all we can do there. And then

355
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:13.380
ANN MENDENHALL: For the exam that is sort of also not a whole lot that we can do.

356
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.910
ANN MENDENHALL: Alright, so, um,

357
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:50.250
ANN MENDENHALL: Let me kind of go through this and see if there's anything else we need to get

358
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.690
ANN MENDENHALL: No medical history. He had the two

359
00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.540
ANN MENDENHALL: knee surgeries.

360
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.010
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, the other thing I was going to ask you about

361
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:15.780
ANN MENDENHALL: Do you have any siblings.

362
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.880
Joshua Johnson: Older brother.

363
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:18.900
Okay.

364
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.730
We put

365
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.390
ANN MENDENHALL: And

366
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:32.940
Joshua Johnson: Yes.

367
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.290
ANN MENDENHALL: Your older brothers alive.

368
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:35.880
Joshua Johnson: Yes, yes.

369
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.630
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And does he have any medical problems that you're aware

370
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:41.820
Joshua Johnson: No.

371
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:42.540
Okay.

372
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.440
ANN MENDENHALL: So, you know, in terms of the

373
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:11.100
ANN MENDENHALL: The nightmares. You know I what I was going to talk to you about. I think being on the Suboxone a little bit longer, you know, hopefully will will really help that.

374
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:19.620
ANN MENDENHALL: Also, the things that I really recommend because I've been in primary care as well for number of years is

375
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:31.770
ANN MENDENHALL: Establish a kind of a routine at night. So try and go to bed and get up at the same time each night. Each morning that kind of get your body used to that kind of timing.

376
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.460
ANN MENDENHALL: As the evening, you know, as you get closer to kind of bedtime, try and have the lights a little bit lower.

377
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:47.400
ANN MENDENHALL: It's really highly recommended to not do any screen time for at least an hour before you go to bed. I mean even longer is better.

378
00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:59.820
ANN MENDENHALL: The blue light from the TV and from your computer screen or even from your phone kind of disrupts your, your sleep rhythms your circadian rhythm and so it can make it harder plus

379
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:08.940
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, with everything going on in this country right now. It's like, and I i watch too much. So I end up going to bed going oh my god

380
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:20.640
ANN MENDENHALL: So, you know, trying to maybe read a little before you go to bed, you know, get used to doing something like, you know, drinking some you know cameo or sleepy time

381
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.470
ANN MENDENHALL: Tea or something like that.

382
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:32.370
ANN MENDENHALL: And reading often is really helpful. But I guess I should also ask, Do you have trouble getting to sleep, or is it just staying asleep.

383
00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:34.890
Joshua Johnson: I don't have trouble getting to sleep.

384
00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.910
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, it's more staying asleep. Yeah, okay.

385
00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:46.470
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, that's we should see how they

386
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.310
ANN MENDENHALL: Help

387
00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:52.800
ANN MENDENHALL: The listener thing.

388
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:55.170
ANN MENDENHALL: And this one.

389
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:06.180
ANN MENDENHALL: Awesome side effects. I mean, you know, for nightmares, but it can cause some side effects itself. And so I usually like to wait a little bit longer into

390
00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:10.920
ANN MENDENHALL: You know recovery. Before we start doing that. But if the nightmares are becoming

391
00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:18.660
ANN MENDENHALL: You know so difficult that you're not getting enough sleep, you know, then maybe we can talk again and see about prescribing something because it

392
00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.280
ANN MENDENHALL: Sounds like you don't have a primary care and you know I

393
00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:39.600
ANN MENDENHALL: We don't take over the primary care. You know, like for somebody who has, like, you know, high blood pressure or something like that, you know, they have to go to their doctor but you know I think what you have is probably somewhat tied to your recovery. So

394
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:41.640
ANN MENDENHALL: How does that sound.

395
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.080
Joshua Johnson: That sounds great.

396
00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:54.840
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, yeah. So try those other things and just sort of, you know, and the other things that I really recommend is deep breathing. If you're feeling anxiety and generally when you know we're going

397
00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:16.350
ANN MENDENHALL: To recovery both depression and anxiety are huge. And I think, anxiety, you know in in our culture at this time is rampant. I mean, we all are anxious to varying degrees. And so, you know, to me it's finding the way that you know it's going to work for you and

398
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.220
Joshua Johnson: You know, I've noticed

399
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:27.510
ANN MENDENHALL: Myself recently I've been kind of more anxious and then I kind of see what's going on. I mean, there's a lot of reasons. You could be anxious, but I go, Yeah, I have a new puppy and I've

400
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:40.290
ANN MENDENHALL: Been getting out and you know going for longer walks and I'm not getting quite enough exercise so I you know bump that up for a few days, took her to the beach where we could walk and she could just digging. See, and felt a little better.

401
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:50.280
ANN MENDENHALL: Meditation, which doesn't have to be something exotic. All it is, is, you know, sitting up in your bed in the morning and just focusing on your breath. So just sort of

402
00:43:50.760 --> 00:44:02.100
ANN MENDENHALL: Feeling your breath come in your nose and go out your nose each nostril go in and it doesn't have to be in water out the other don't have to count it even counted. If you want to be just as simple as possible just sort of

403
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:16.680
ANN MENDENHALL: Keeping your focus on that and you'll have a million thoughts racing in that normal. That doesn't mean that you're not doing it right. You are doing it right, but just bring your attention back to your breath, and I have meditated on and off for

404
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:28.800
ANN MENDENHALL: Decades and when I am meditating regularly. I just feel my whole life being a little calm or so it's just sort of

405
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:38.610
ANN MENDENHALL: Things like that are just really healthy ways that you can kind of deal with your own anxiety because there's really a lot of people come into our, our treatment centers and

406
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:48.060
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, they really want a pill, like you know Ambien for sleep or they want, you know, a benzo like Xanax or Valium for their, their

407
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:56.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Anxiety and I'm like really against those because it's like putting a bandaid over a black hole, it doesn't

408
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:12.540
ANN MENDENHALL: Do anything. And once it wears off and it you know the anxiety comes back once you quit taking something like Ambien, you know, then you can't sleep anymore. Even worse. So learning how to sort of self sooth, even in times that are difficult

409
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:19.050
ANN MENDENHALL: And stressful, even very important. So no matter where you are, you can just sit. If you're on a bus or

410
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:19.920
Joshua Johnson: Something just

411
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:26.670
ANN MENDENHALL: sit quietly and close your eyes and just, you know, use that time to just do some kind of deep breathing.

412
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:41.190
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, and nobody really knows what you're doing but you know I you see it more and more. I mean, I noticed that when I'm you know on a bus or a train or something like that. And it's, you know, just a good habit to get into. And I think it will really support your recovery, too.

413
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:42.300
Okay.

414
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:50.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay well i i think that we kind of covered everything from, from my point of view, do you have any questions for me.

415
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.170
Joshua Johnson: Um no I don't.

416
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.790
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, well, do you like to be called Joshua or Josh

431
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:37.290
