00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stranger.

2
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.210
*Michelle *: In here hanging in here.

3
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's going on.

4
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.620
*Michelle *: Not much really kind of in limbo right now waiting. See what happens. And

5
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.520
*Michelle *: We got

6
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.980
*Michelle *: Well, we got an extension because of what's going on with the virus and stuff. Now we have to be out of here by April 30

7
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is not where you want to be.

8
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.190
*Michelle *: No.

9
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

10
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.720
*Michelle *: At least it gives us a little bit more time to

11
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.910
*Michelle *: figure stuff out, I guess, excuse me.

12
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um,

13
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you send out for your to pay off your ticket.

14
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:22.110
*Michelle *: I got the ticket paid off. But now I am, what I'm waiting for is for it to process through the court in order for me to pay the MVD the DMV.

15
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:36.750
*Michelle *: Their fee to get my license reinstated and it said on there like it's supposed to take like seven to 14 business days and it's been well over that and it's still like online. You know, you got to reinstate says not eligible

16
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.320
*Michelle *: So, and I've tried to call the courts. I've tried to email the lady I spoke to a while ago that

17
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.410
*Michelle *: Yeah, because when I first had paid it off. She told me I wouldn't have to wait the 14 days and then I

18
00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:00.840
*Michelle *: That because the DMV told me I needed this code or whatever. And she told me I wouldn't need the code that it was process overnight. Just give it one day, and that was a while ago and it still didn't process.

19
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.700
*Michelle *: Some I needed to like to show that

20
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're taking it back to that maybe

21
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.910
*Michelle *: You know,

22
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:20.280
*Michelle *: I need to show that the courts have been paid in order for me to be able to even for the because the DMV won't let me pay that fine unless it shows the courts have been paid.

23
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.410
Right, so

24
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Say, just kind of waiting till it goes through

25
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.440
*Michelle *: You know, you know,

26
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then your mood. Okay, so you have to do that in order to get your license in order to get the van.

27
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.150
*Michelle *: Yeah.

28
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.570
*Michelle *: From what

29
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.900
*Michelle *: He did say, though, is they said, as soon as I pay that fine my. It's like my driver's licenses.

30
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.320
*Michelle *: Fine. Like, I'll have a be I'll be legal to drive that was the understanding that I that I got from the lady at the DMV.

31
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.130
Right.

32
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:03.180
*Michelle *: Which I think that's pretty cool. My dad still thinks I should get my Oregon driver's license, but I feel like that's just more time and money that I don't have

33
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.070
*Michelle *: You know when I have a driver's license, even though it's from Arizona. It's still legal. You know, for me to drive and

34
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.680
*Michelle *: You know,

35
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know it's good, isn't it good till you're like 65

36
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.420
*Michelle *: Well, yeah, it doesn't expire till 2054 on

37
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.750
*Michelle *: You know, yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So maybe it's something you can put in your future plans, when you do get moved. You know what I mean, but

39
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you know, economically, it's not feasible right now. Anyways, yeah. So I get it, I get where you're coming from, you know,

40
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Until things have been hello with your neighbors and landlord.

41
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.640
Yeah.

42
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.320
*Michelle *: Yeah.

43
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.430
Good.

44
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

45
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.000
*Michelle *: I haven't heard anything

46
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which isn't a bad thing.

47
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.140
Right.

48
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are things with your baby and your partner.

49
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.500
*Michelle *: already seeing in a year.

50
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.150
*Michelle *: And

51
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.660
*Michelle *: See different day. Same old, same old just different day kind of thing.

52
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:37.590
*Michelle *: She's still know it's like it's weird with the two, they just like when it comes to like him putting her down for a nap time or bedtime or whatever she just like she acts differently. We're like, when I go in LA. Now on her and put her down for a nap or bed. She just x different

53
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.900
*Michelle *: Units like she gives more harder of a time to him. Then she does me

54
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.210
*Michelle *: Right let's Australian

55
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, she does, because she knows who's in charge.

56
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:59.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, he if you know he's a pushover with her, then that's exactly what she's going to do you know if you're the one that is

57
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The one in charge, as far as she goes and she knows it. Then of course is going to give you less issues then she'll watch she gives him.

58
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:17.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Kind of the dynamics of what kids learn about their parents, it's, it's kind of funny when you when you watch it, actually, you know, and realize that, you know,

59
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.620
*Michelle *: They're starting to starting right just kind of barely tips on around the potty training scene.

60
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.120
Yeah.

61
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.680
*Michelle *: She's not into it at all.

62
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.100
*Michelle *: Like every time we put her on there. She just right back off. She's so tall, it's like

63
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.700
*Michelle *: She just hops right off.

64
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of there are like. Now, I don't want to do that. However, she

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.280
*Michelle *: To

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.640
*Michelle *: To

68
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.740
*Michelle *: I mean, she's four months.

69
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.250
*Michelle *: Two years old to implement or whatever you might call it 2026 months.

70
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: 12

71
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.810
Months.

72
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.150
*Michelle *: 26 months, I think. Yeah.

73
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.840
*Michelle *: I don't know cuz 24 months is too. Right. Yeah.

74
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.800

75
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Two.

76
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.840
*Michelle *: She, too. Yeah.

77
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, yeah. So you've got yourself a little bit of work to do with their version.

78
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.760
*Michelle *: Yeah.

79
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.950
*Michelle *: It'd be nice if you get a potty train though because they preserved so friggin expensive.

80
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They really are. It's outrageous.

81
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

82
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.870
*Michelle *: everything that's going on right now it's it's it's hard to come by him.

83
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know a lot of things in in the store. It's hard to come by. Right now, huh.

84
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.080
*Michelle *: Yeah, because we live in such a small town. It's like

85
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.200
*Michelle *: limited options, you know,

86
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.250
Yeah.

87
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.370
*Michelle *: Yeah.

88
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that'll change in a few weeks.

89
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.550
*Michelle *: I hope so this is this is ridiculous.

90
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:22.920
*Michelle *: I mean, they've got, like, at least here in our little town the Walmart, they've got it like the entrance all blocked off.

91
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:34.290
*Michelle *: And you have to stand in line and they've got these little markers, where you have to stand six foot apart from people. And then as people are coming out. Then they let people come in and it's like

92
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.610
*Michelle *: I mean, we live in a small town as it is, you know, it's just

93
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.310
*Michelle *: I don't know, I mean,

94
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.400
*Michelle *: I think

95
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.460
*Michelle *: Maybe like

96
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.660
*Michelle *: A week ago, they, they just released that we have our first first case.

97
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.050
*Michelle *: In our in our area in our town.

98
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.350
*Michelle *: We haven't heard anything further on it.

99
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.300
*Michelle *: I mean, what

100
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:13.590
*Michelle *: I don't really feel. I mean, I mean, you never know, really, but we don't really, we don't talk to anybody. We don't go around people, and people around us and

101
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

102
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.210
You know,

103
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:26.760
*Michelle *: You don't see us. I mean, I know you could just probably like catch it, going to the grocery store. I mean, who knows all these cash. I just, you know, the clerks and stuff.

104
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.140
*Michelle *: But

105
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.030
*Michelle *: They've all gotten

106
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.560
*Michelle *: Plexiglas.

107
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.520
Up in front of them.

108
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.330
*Michelle *: Most of them are wearing gloves.

109
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.230
Me.

110
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.000
*Michelle *: Yeah.

111
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's like that Miss stores around here too.

112
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know people at the, the new glasses up there's people wearing gloves and masks and

113
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:49.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

114
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:59.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You walk around, you know, you walk around somebody instead of next to somebody. I mean, it's just, yeah. It's crazy. It's a, it's a big change.

115
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.880
*Michelle *: You know, yeah.

116
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.740
*Michelle *: And they were

117
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.870
*Michelle *: Mostly, like, for the most part, though, aside from everything being closed here. People are just

118
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.440
*Michelle *: Not, not doesn't seem like they're like staying at home or really or whatever, you know,

119
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:30.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's my understanding that you can go outside. As long as you don't go around other people, but you can take walks around the block. You know what I mean.

120
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do it that way but

121
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you just want to distance yourself from anybody else that's walking at the same time.

122
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:41.670
*Michelle *: Right.

123
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.060
You know,

124
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.890
*Michelle *: And

125
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.980
*Michelle *: We live in such a small town, people probably don't really take it serious

126
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's sad too. Yeah.

127
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:03.510
*Michelle *: Because I know. I mean, I see people walking on the street and kids are out riding their bikes, like they would, you know,

128
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:04.470
Mm hmm.

129
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:06.990
*Michelle *: Yeah.

130
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:23.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The only differences. It's an early summer. There's no school, there's no Yo, yo, all these things that normally are going on or actually closed and, you know, life and society of just kind of stopped, but in a kid's world. It never stops.

131
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. It's always going so

132
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I can't imagine

133
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.590
*Michelle *: Yes, so I just been kind of sitting in long been watching that stupid tiger King show

134
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.160
*Michelle *: I don't know if you've seen that

135
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:48.780
*Michelle *: Ah, it's on Netflix everybody's talking about it like it's all over social media.

136
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.380
*Michelle *: Tiger king with Joe exotic it's

137
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.230
*Michelle *: Quite the story and

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.170
*Michelle *: One of them.

139
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.090
*Michelle *: This lady like 20 years ago or whatever she

140
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.840
*Michelle *: I mean it's clearly obvious. She killed her husband, they just don't have any prove it.

141
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.070
To me.

142
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.300
*Michelle *: Pretty crazy

143
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, check it out.

144
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:24.660
*Michelle *: Yeah, it's good. I wish they would have done more of it without just being focused on the

145
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:33.570
*Michelle *: weirdo Joe exotic the gay guy, you know, if they weren't so focused on him, I would like to know more about like

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.110
*Michelle *: The whole case of, you know, the lady, you know, add them to a tiger, man.

147
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:49.470
*Michelle *: I mean, back in the 80s. I know they didn't have late but they said the case is still open.

148
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:51.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

149
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:52.620
Yeah.

*Michelle *: Yeah.

151
00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:04.770
*Michelle *: It's pretty crazy. I just, just for that alone is what interests me. And it really. I mean, I could care less about Joe exotic and his whole life.

152
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.780
*Michelle *: Whatever weird shit. He's got going on.

153

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Funny.

155
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So he's like the main character of the story.

156
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.970
*Michelle *: Yeah, it's like they tried to say it was a documentary, but it

157
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.480
*Michelle *: Doesn't seem like a documentary to me at all. It's kind of just like a storyline of

158
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:42.780
*Michelle *: What's happened and throughout the years between this Joe exotic person and the Carol Baskin, I guess they've had this long ongoing feud because he's just

159
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:53.160
*Michelle *: All over social media doing all this weird crazy shit to kind of like antagonize her and she's got these millions of, you know, she inherited millions from or that doesn't

160
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.220
*Michelle *: And she's taking them to court and

161
00:12:59.280 --> 00:12:59.760
*Michelle *: Just

162
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.410
*Michelle *: Yeah, weird kind of weird.

163
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.510
*Michelle *: I mean, it was I liked it. I thought it was cool.

164
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Fascinating.

165
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.750
*Michelle *: Yeah yeah

166
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What else have you been doing

167
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.750
*Michelle *: That's it. I'm packing up here and there and

168
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.550
*Michelle *: Watching that

169
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not a whole lot to do.

170
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

171
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.240
*Michelle *: Play on the kid. I mean, while we got

172
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:38.370
*Michelle *: Given the wall and we'll go to this park and let her swing on the swing.

173
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:41.760
*Michelle *: Good.

174
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. And no, no, no, nothing from your landlord. Did you get a letter or a text or

175
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.700
*Michelle *: No, nothing.

176
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.310
*Michelle *: Even had heard nothing I have Alex go and pay the rent on the third but

177
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:06.150
*Michelle *: She didn't say anything. She was just, you know, just calm and here's a receipt, you know,

178
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

179
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.610
*Michelle *: Yeah.

180
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.330
That'd be nice.

181
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:29.430
*Michelle *: Neighbors have been doing work on the house next door. I'm not. No one lives there, but they've been fixing it up for a while now, but now it's like doing something

182
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:44.040
*Michelle *: Hammering and others, and they've completely like remodeled the inside of it. And they've just started finishing it looks like outside it repainted the whole outside. They've done all the landscaping for the outside just completely redone all of it.

183
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:52.500
*Michelle *: Oh, wow. Yeah, we've been working on it for a while they're here every day at eight o'clock in the morning.

184
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: God

185
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Quiet Time from 11 to seven.

186
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like, what about what about those was they don't get up til 10

187
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right here.

188
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.300
*Michelle *: And we've been getting up at eight lately. She's been

189
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:21.510
*Michelle *: So weird. I don't know, she's going through like some kind of Roseburg or whatnot. She's talking like crazy like so much more than she has and ever like she's like

190
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:36.180
*Michelle *: She's really really talking a lot lately. She's been going to bed, like, well, we'll go in there and lay down with her and start at like 838 O'clock will lay down with her and she won't go to sleep until about 11 o'clock.

191
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:47.130
*Michelle *: Doesn't matter. Like, what time you know every. It doesn't matter what time she goes to bed, though she is up at about 738 o'clock.

192
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:54.510
*Michelle *: And I feel like you know i don't i don't feel like she's getting enough sleep, really. I mean,

193
00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:06.180
*Michelle *: And then naptime is a nightmare because she doesn't want to take a nap. And if we don't let her take a nap. Even if she goes to bed at eight o'clock 730 she's still up at 730 in the morning.

194
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

195
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:14.040
*Michelle *: I don't. I mean, I don't know, but I feel like she's not getting the normal amount of sleep. She should be getting

196
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.000
Yeah.

197
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, she's getting older and he's you know going to require a little less sleep and more activity.

198
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:30.900
*Michelle *: Right. Yeah, no, that's for sure. I just still feel like she's not sleeping how she should be. I mean, I don't know.

199
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.420
But

200
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The ones that scare me are the ones that go to bed, a

201
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Fight sleep until 11 or 12 and then get up at four or five in the morning.

202
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And destroyed the house.

203
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:48.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

204
00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:56.820
*Michelle *: We put the baby gate up in front of a mirror in front of her door cuz she she was doing that for a while you get down.

205
00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Again anything's

206
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:00.660
Hmm.

207
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mom's dad is still sleeping. I'm gonna go play

208
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.480
*Michelle *: Times over it. She climbs over the gate.

209
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:24.870
*Michelle *: But for the most part in the mornings at least she she'll just kind of probably cuz she's still half asleep so waking up and grumpy and she'll kind of just kind of wine at the gate until one of us gets up to come. Call your way.

210
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: TO COME GET HER.

211
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Breakfast time

212
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.080
Yeah.

213
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:46.740
*Michelle *: And she hasn't really money versus to good like usually she's a really good breakfast eater, but lately. She hasn't been wanting to like eat like breakfast usually like a couple bites of whatever it is we feed her and then she's

214
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.990
*Michelle *: She doesn't want

215
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.160

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: On the snacking but not the meals.

She will

222
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.960
*Michelle *: She'll snack all day long. If you let her like she's I mean sometimes I trip out on the amount of food that little girl with the way she puts away some food.

223
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.170

226
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She's going through a growing sport.

227
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:36.990
*Michelle *: Yeah.

228
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.460
*Michelle *: You know,

229
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.560
Probably

230
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.080
*Michelle *: Yeah.

231
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.280

248
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:11.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, just one of those things where it's like, it doesn't really matter if it happens, it happens. I can't stop live in because of it, you know.

249
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:26.370
*Michelle *: Yeah, you just can I met a lady, not too long ago who helped me out with some clothes for Araya because I had, like, I mean clearly out of gross for and everything. Nothing we have for her fit.

250
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:43.200
*Michelle *: She gave me some clothes with Araya, and she's you know asked me, kind of, you know, personal questions about my family and stuff like that. And now everyone always trips out you know when they uh yeah I have like my grandparents and my dad and chat, but they just

251
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.590
*Michelle *: It doesn't matter whether I have a child or not, you know, my name is not Dave and

252
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.170
*Michelle *: They won't help

253
00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:03.660
*Michelle *: You know, like, it doesn't, then they always check out when I, when I say that they never believe me, or they think of like, well, what did you do to make them not want to help you. And it's like, I haven't done anything. They just don't want to help.

254
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:13.710
*Michelle *: We don't have that time type of knit family where you know my granddaughter's struggling and her baby you know they need help, you know,

255
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.860
*Michelle *: I have the money for a first and last deposit, but

256
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.070
*Michelle *: It just, they don't care.

257
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:20.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

258
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:30.480
*Michelle *: They don't care if I if I was my dad, my name was Dave. I mean, they would do everything in their power to cater, you know, to help him and do whatever they, you know,

259
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.110
*Michelle *: But it doesn't work like that for me.

260
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't think it probably doesn't work like that for a lot of people, you know,

261
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.410
*Michelle *: I just feel like

262
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:59.580
*Michelle *: A large part of me would love to just figure out what I could do to leave and never look back and never talked to them again because it is rippling it does this me off because it's not right. I don't feel like right

263
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:07.710
*Michelle *: Right at all. And if it was the other way around. If it was me and my grandchild. I would. Damn right, like, you know,

264
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

265
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.800
Yeah.

266
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.560
*Michelle *: I just don't feel like that's right

267
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.820
*Michelle *: Just, you know, people to suffer. You know, I mean, when, when you have more than enough means to help

268
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I agree.

269
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:34.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, definitely. But, you know, the massive part about it is it's their choice there. You know what I mean, they get to

270
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Live by their own morals and values. And we've just, you know, you just got to kind of

271
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Deal with it, you know.

272
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.640
*Michelle *: Yeah.

273
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:47.760
*Michelle *: I deal with it.

274
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Got a little bit of resentment there.

275
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.110
*Michelle *: I do, I do.

276
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.870
*Michelle *: Yeah, most definitely. Yeah.

277
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:09.750
*Michelle *: I do because the amount of shit that they've done for my dad. I mean, even when we lived in California. Back in the late 90s, before we moved up to Oregon might

278
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.100
*Michelle *: The whole reason why we moved up to Oregon is because she bought a house or my dad.

279
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.500
*Michelle *: bought him a house.

280
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:23.640
*Michelle *: She paid for a vehicle for him because he was leaving. I mean, we left everything in California.

281
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then went up there.

282
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:39.600
*Michelle *: And she she bought the house, she bought him a vehicle. She paid for him to get his contractor's license. So you can do construction work and got them a job with a contractor who was building their house, their retirement home.

283
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:40.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

284
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:55.320
*Michelle *: And as as as the years have gone on anytime. He's lost his job or needed money or needed work on his vehicle or needed a vehicle. She has literally paid for everything and still does. To this day,

285
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.420
To this day,

286
00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

287
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.720
*Michelle *: And I just feel like

288
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:07.680
*Michelle *: That's not right.

289
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.020
*Michelle *: You know, and it's not like they don't they don't need the help I mean

290
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.960
*Michelle *: I have an uncle that her youngest son, my uncle Glenn.

291
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.500
*Michelle *: Is straight up a millionaire.

292
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.300
*Michelle *: He is a millionaire. He works and computers and

293
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:32.340
*Michelle *: He owns the house that they live in. They pay late

294
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.210
*Michelle *: They pay all the like the house electric and all the, you know, all those themselves and

295
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:50.250
*Michelle *: But they don't pay rent and they don't pay like the mortgage on it and he pays for all that, and which is why they you know i mean they're completely set up.

296
00:24:51.330 --> 00:25:07.650
*Michelle *: And even before then they they were set up on the mountain before they moved into town and their retirement home. I mean, they had. I mean, it was a million dollar home on top mountain they've always had money. I mean, it's never been a question of, where's the money or who's got the money.

297
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you know,

298
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.250
*Michelle *: But it's like

299
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They just don't care.

300
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:21.780
*Michelle *: They don't share it and they don't share it with she doesn't share it with anybody else. But my dad and once in a while. My dad's brother, Chris.

301
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.150
*Michelle *: And

302
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:30.210
*Michelle *: Even when we were growing up like Christmas and birthdays and

303
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:45.120
*Michelle *: I mean, we had Christmas where we got together and we food, but we didn't do they never did presence. They never did birthday presents you know it's not it's. It was never like a real grandchild grandparent relationship. You know what I mean.

304
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:45.480
Right.

305
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:56.760
*Michelle *: Like, like they weren't grandparents, you know, even really parents really. I mean, aside from catering to my father, his entire life and paying for everything.

306
00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:57.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

307
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.770
But

308
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.320
Yeah.

309
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:08.910
*Michelle *: And even even uncle Glenn he's never done Christmas presents he's never done birthday presents. He's just been off in his own world.

310
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:20.220
*Michelle *: We only see him, maybe once a year, when he comes up for Thanksgiving. And he doesn't really socialize with the family. It's like he's just basically there to visit his mom and Mr. Bill

311
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:21.660
*Michelle *: My

312
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.340
*Michelle *: Grandma husband.

313
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.320
*Michelle *: That's crazy. Yeah.

314
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If their religious belief, they

315
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't sometimes. Oh, no, no.

316
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:39.000
*Michelle *: No. Oh no, my, my grandmother. I mean, my even my dad that's why my dad is the way he is my knee my grandmother's like

317
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:47.220
*Michelle *: Like she believes in Jesus and and whatnot. I mean, she's not like super religious like we're out front with it. It's more like

318
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:55.350
*Michelle *: You know, but she believes in God and you know she's not as vocal like my dad about it is, you know, but

319
00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.470
*Michelle *: It just

320
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:01.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

321
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good way to do it on your own.

322
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.060
I mean,

323
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:16.440
*Michelle *: I guess I mean I you know I don't even know. And I don't, I don't really know it's it's it's really a weird plant family dynamic because like

324
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.530
*Michelle *: When my cousins when when my Uncle Chris had his two girls.

325
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:30.390
*Michelle *: when they were younger, back in like the early, late 80s, early 80s or whatnot, like she was closer to them.

326
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:39.090
*Michelle *: Because I wasn't around. I was still with my mom at that time I got hadn't got custody at me and then it's like after

327
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:48.810
*Michelle *: Chris Got the divorce from Tracy and the girl stayed down in California, and they all kind of migrated up to Oregon. It's like after that she just

328
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:56.880
*Michelle *: She didn't she didn't care to get close to me like she did with Stephanie not Ashley.

329
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:07.560
*Michelle *: And then, you know, Stephanie nationally just kind of never came around anymore. And she that relationship with the two of them kind of faded out and

330
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.810
*Michelle *: Is no longer

331
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.370
*Michelle *: You know,

332
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:16.110
*Michelle *: Yeah.

333
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.680
*Michelle *: When I was younger, when my dad.

334
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:20.010
*Michelle *: Was

335
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:32.580
*Michelle *: Kind of crazy we I used to see them a lot Tracy's to babysit me when I was when my dad right around the time I GOT CUSTODY OF ME WHEN WE done there. We were closer to them.

336
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.790
*Michelle *: And then we moved up to Oregon after that it was just

337
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.080
*Michelle *: Their, their own lives and we're, you know, we were

338
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:45.870
Yeah.

339
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, sorry. That sucks.

340
00:28:51.690 --> 00:29:02.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to see the inequities and you know the differences. You know, it's gotta be tough and I totally understand the reasoning behind the resentment, you know,

341
00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:06.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But be careful with with resemblance

342
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.040
Right.

343
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:09.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

344
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:12.780
*Michelle *: You

345
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Manage that when you go

346
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:16.830
Up there.

347
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.100
*Michelle *: Um,

348
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.780
*Michelle *: I just kind of keep to myself really

349
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:38.550
*Michelle *: I mean, nine times out of 10 when I'm there. My dad's there with me and I'm just there because of my dad. You know, like, it's not like we hang out there like, that's my grandma. You know, it's not like that. The only time I'm there is when my dad's there.

350
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:49.800
*Michelle *: And when I in usually they're often like a study is where they hang out and where we usually stay in the living room because they don't even want to be around the RIAA

351
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:56.070
*Michelle *: You know, like, Yeah, it's weird. It's really weird huh

352
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is weird.

353
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:08.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But just know that that's their problem. And they're missing out, you know,

354
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You can't change anybody else. You just got to kind of

355
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:30.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, accept them for who they are and you know the place that they have in your life and and it sucks. So I'm gonna be wrong. It sucks but you know it is, you know, it just is that way.

356
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:31.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No.

357
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.170
No.

358
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:53.580
*Michelle *: You. I just, I mean really. I mean, sometimes your time. It really bothers me is when my dad's like oh yeah bill just helped me pay off my by Phil just helped me buy a boat will just help me do this. I'm just like, wow, I must be nice.

359
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

360
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.680
*Michelle *: Well, the first and last deposit

361
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right about just a gallon of milk.

362
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.600
*Michelle *: And bread. Yeah.

363
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

364
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, on a lighter note, you should be getting a stimulus. Right.

365
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.760
*Michelle *: Um, I, I honestly don't know.

366
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.570
*Michelle *: I have no clue. I

367
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:36.540
*Michelle *: Mean, I've tried to do a lot of research on it to see whether we would even qualify and it doesn't say anything about you know people on you know cash assistance, it talks about people on social security and

368
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:43.770
*Michelle *: Stuff like that. But it doesn't say anything about on state welfare benefits and and

369
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:54.360
*Michelle *: And from what I also read in there and the small small print that anybody who has back child support won't see it either. They'll still take it.

370
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, see, I didn't know that.

371
00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:04.380
*Michelle *: Yeah, if you have back child support, you won't see if any of it, they will take it all just like they would your income tax return.

372
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:06.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh,

373
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I didn't know that.

374
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:21.270
*Michelle *: I had Alex file separately and claim Mariah, just in case they do take take it you know i mean i like i said that even if we qualify. So far, we haven't heard anything all we've seen

375
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:30.120
*Michelle *: In the emails or whatever online. Is it says that they have accepted the return, but it doesn't say anything about whether they've

376
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:41.580
*Michelle *: Processed it or the weather. We're going to get a check or whether it's going to be deposited in when it's going to be deposited. There's just nothing else. It's just that. Oh, the IRS got your, your

377
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.540
*Michelle *: Your claim or whatever you want to call it.

378
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well how long ago did you guys file.

379
00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.450
*Michelle *: I mean they just opened up that portal on that website. What, like, a week ago.

380
00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.800
*Michelle *: Yeah, so about a week, maybe a week and a half ago now.

381
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, it shouldn't be long. Give him.

382
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:04.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Give it a couple weeks.

383
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.790
*Michelle *: That's even you and I mean who knows if we'll even see it. See it

384
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well I you this. So you're the one that goes back child support, not your partner.

385
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so he filed and claim the baby. So he should get it.

386
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:23.550
*Michelle *: Hopefully,

387
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.470
*Michelle *: Yeah.

388
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.590
*Michelle *: I hope so because we could really use it as it wasn't

389
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, let's see. That would be like 1700 dollars.

390
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If he doesn't have anything and he's the one that file that he would definitely get it.

391
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:57.330
*Michelle *: And all I know is that he has. I mean, I don't know if they would take it be for finds own because he has finds that he owes the state of Arizona for like unpaid traffic tickets and crap like that.

392
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: garnished

393
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:03.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As he gotten anything said that saying that they were keep us taxes for

394
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.840
*Michelle *: his driver's license for it.

395
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.340
*Michelle *: So I'm pretty sure garnishing your wages would be the next step.

396
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know.

397
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:28.740
*Michelle *: I mean, I don't even know how how it all works because I know Rob isn't collecting child support. So I don't see how they can keep stacking it up if he isn't collecting it because I'm not paying it

398
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:39.660
*Michelle *: And even if the state was paying it Rob isn't collecting it so i don't i don't know how that even works like how it's all backed up. I mean,

399
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:51.330
*Michelle *: From back in like 2014 when it, when we last went to court. I was ordered to pay $200 a month to him. And they were just automatically taking it out of my checks in Arizona.

400
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:53.940
*Michelle *: And

401
00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:05.490
*Michelle *: I went to work up here and then went back to work down in Arizona, and when I did that income tax return the state of Arizona to every single penny of it.

402
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.940
*Michelle *: And I didn't see any of it. And that was a good almost $2,000 and I had

403
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:13.890
*Michelle *: Incomes on

404
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:19.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It. So when you weren't working. Did you file with the child support.

405
00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:24.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Income adjustment or any paperwork for them to lower it

406
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:25.200
Nope.

407
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.050
*Michelle *: Nope, I just left it.

408
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.310
*Michelle *: I am not I just left it.

409
00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:33.930
*Michelle *: I

410
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:45.870
*Michelle *: Rob kept telling me to go back to core and tell it like now that you're not working. They'll probably just need to pay like 25 bucks a month level, blah, blah, blah.

411
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.830
*Michelle *: No, I just left it because I figured like

412
00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:00.060
*Michelle *: In Oregon. I mean, I, when I worked in Oregon and they didn't. They weren't garnishing my wages, then so I figured if I went back to Oregon. I could at least job up

413
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:11.880
*Michelle *: And not have to pay a dime of it because he. I mean, he told me from the get go, I don't need is 200 bucks a month, that's nothing. I don't need it. I don't need it. But you wouldn't tell the courts that he didn't need it.

414
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.140
*Michelle *: And when I asked him to go back to court to tell them, he didn't need it.

415
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:27.660
*Michelle *: He just own you know probably making 25 bucks a month, blah, blah. And I don't feel like I should have to pay him a fucking time, honestly.

416
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:48.150
*Michelle *: He anytime I lay in the last year, anytime my bass to see my son. He tells me know or he ignores me anytime I call my son. He never answers the phone anymore. Anytime I text or asked him to have telling call me. He never responds, he just flat out ignore us everything and

417
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.120
*Michelle *: I feel like at this point, like

418
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.150
*Michelle *: I'm just spinning my wheels.

419
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:54.690
*Michelle *: Like not

420
00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:01.620
*Michelle *: wasting my fucking time and my breath. And I don't and that's, I don't feel like I should have to pay if any of it when we have joint custody.

421
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:13.800
*Michelle *: We have joint custody. You say you don't need it. You clearly they make a lot more money than I do. I have a child as well. I mean, I feel like we're even if I'm, if I can't see my fucking kid and

422
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.430
*Michelle *: I don't feel like I should pay a penny. Sorry.

423
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:26.130
*Michelle *: I just don't feel like that's right i mean it would be a whole lot different. If he was like if I was able to see him and spend time with him, but

424
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:38.670
*Michelle *: Christmas was like the strong back for me. I mean, I went out of my way. I spent more money than I had and I didn't pay a couple of my bills to go out of my way and pay for presence for telling and

425
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:47.250
*Michelle *: When I asked, Helen. When Rob was going to drop them off down here, or when my dad could come pick them up. It was like, oh yeah, we'll figure something out and then completely ignored me

426
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:58.890
*Michelle *: And when I called and I texted what's going on with Christmas. He's only got a week left of this Christmas vacation. It's Christmas break, nothing, nothing, not a word. Not a peep out of them.

427
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow. Where does he live

428
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.000
*Michelle *: He lives in pistol River. It's like an hour away from here.

429
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:14.010
*Michelle *: Half an hour away from Brookings and my dad has been the one that's been transporting him all this time he hasn't had to drive.

430
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.670
*Michelle *: But to drive to Brookings which is where he tries to go to work every day.

431
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.860
*Michelle *: Where he drives to go pick up his groceries and stuff. So it's not like it's out of his way.

432
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:23.730
Right.

433
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:26.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here, yes.

434
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So your dad still gets to see him.

435
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.930

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cool. Well, it's good that he has a relationship with your dad right now.

440
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.090
*Michelle *: You know, really hasn't had a relationship with my dad.

441
00:38:51.570 --> 00:39:00.750
*Michelle *: At all. Since Rob. I don't know what what's going on with Ron, I feel like he's up to something like he's probably getting ready to move back to Arizona, because before

442
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:07.530
*Michelle *: We settled down here in Crescent City really the whole plan was for us to all move back to Arizona.

443
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.730
*Michelle *: And

444
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:16.710
*Michelle *: He wanted to work this job where he would be gone six months out of the year and or three months at a time and then he wanted

445
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.500
*Michelle *: I personally just thought he was just blowing smoke up my ass and just telling me what I want to hear.

446
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:35.100
*Michelle *: He wanted to just get me down to Arizona, so he could work this job. And he was just basically telling me, Oh, I'll get you a car, you could drive the car, you could stay in the house, I'll pay for everything you just take care of telling while I'm gone at work and

447
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:46.320
*Michelle *: I feel like it was all just a bunch of baloney. You know him blowing smoke up my ass and just want. And again, I like I told him. Yeah. You know, I don't mind moving back down to Arizona.

448
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:52.200
*Michelle *: Tell him really wants to be back to Arizona. I really want to get away from my shitty family late

449
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:58.290
*Michelle *: I mean, that was the plan. And it was like after I'm done with my schooling. Yeah, we'll move to Arizona well

450
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:09.090
*Michelle *: I mean he just kept on bombarding me of when when we're going to move to Arizona. When are you going to be going through schooling. When are you going to be done with your diploma, because at first it was like after I finished my diploma.

451
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:21.480
*Michelle *: We can move. And then I was like, well, I found out about the CNA program and then I figure. Well, after the CNA program, then we can move so that way I can get a decent job because Arizona's working wages are

452
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:28.710
*Michelle *: dog shit compared to hear that word. You know what I mean, like, I'm sorry 725 an hour.

453
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:33.840
*Michelle *: Here at a time when I can make almost 15 and our have here.

454
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:41.310
*Michelle *: With no sales state tax you know tax on shit and eight 9% sales tax. You're out of your mind.

455
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That know how to put the cost of living at all and

456
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:56.400
*Michelle *: Not to mention that, but with Alex to like he's got as unpaid finds their they don't allow you to serve time to pay your fines off. In fact, if you go to jail, they pay you.

457
00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:09.900
*Michelle *: They make you pay them $89 a day to sit in their jails. So not only yeah you're racking up more fines going to jail and sitting in jail, you're not like paying off your science, you're getting more fines, because they charge you.

458
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.370

*Michelle *: The jail lobby County, dude. It's messed up.

460
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:20.580
*Michelle *: So then I was like, well, I don't mind moving back to Arizona, but I don't want to live in Mojave County.

461
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.290
*Michelle *: You know, like

462
00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:32.130
*Michelle *: Yeah, no tolerance, you know, a little flaky of marijuana and you're going to jail and you got confines up the ass and I'm not doing that.
