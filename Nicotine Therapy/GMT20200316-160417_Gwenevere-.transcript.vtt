That happen.

16
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.630
Mia Petersen: I think I just have been really unstable lately.

17
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:45.930
Mia Petersen: So we talked last Thursday. And I think so. After that, I just, I didn't go on a bender, but I'm way off on the medication. I've been taking more than I should have

18
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.850
Mia Petersen: I should have reached out again and then I was like guilty about that.

19
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: When

20
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you end up taking more

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.510
Mia Petersen: On Friday and Saturday and Sunday.

22
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.970
Mia Petersen: I think I'm really well. Yeah.

23
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

24
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.620
Mia Petersen: Much money.

25
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

26
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.510
Mia Petersen: What else bit of and your money I wind on Saturday.

27
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:36.870
Mia Petersen: And I just was like, dude, this is, this is crazy. So back on track. Today I got back. Actually, I got back on my medication, yesterday I just felt so yesterday I took 53 quarters or yeah point seven five milligrams

28
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.350
Mia Petersen: Today I took that

29
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.800
Mia Petersen: And I really like yeah how much

30
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: How much did you take in, because I thought I heard, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday you taken more

31
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.870
Mia Petersen: Yeah, it must not have been Sunday.

32
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.710
Mia Petersen: Okay, yeah, I think it maybe was Thursday. OK.

33
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.560
Mia Petersen: So now I'm behind three days because I basically took twice as much

34
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.320
Mia Petersen: Why do this because I do this without. I mean, I don't have a plan.

35
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.580
Mia Petersen: I don't know why. Like, I know, but then I like lie to myself and I'm like just figure it out later. And it's like there's no figuring it out later.

36
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:30.300
Mia Petersen: So a couple of things came to mind on Sunday when I was just like in a troll. A little under a rock feeling shitty about myself.

37
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.330
Mia Petersen: When I think

38
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:44.490
Mia Petersen: I remember this happening to me last summer, when I gone down. I can't remember what my dosage was but like I had gone down and it was around the time we took that trip.

39
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:53.610
Mia Petersen: And I was just so uncomfortable. And I think it was just a point of clarity of sobriety where I was like a real world so

40
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.810
Mia Petersen: I feel like that might have been some of it for me going down to the point seven five like

41
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.840
Mia Petersen: I enjoy the clarity, but I just really am overwhelmed by been silver ish or, you know, close

42
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's stay with the real world sucks.

43
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It's Monday.

44
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to see what's different between that and

45
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, what's different.

46
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.160
Mia Petersen: Well, no much i mean

47
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.910
Mia Petersen: I'm just trying to pull it back together.

48
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, okay. Let me give you an example of what I mean.

49
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.170
Yeah.

50
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm just, it's just now coming to mind that I didn't really hear from you what you want from today but

51
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So, for example, a Monday may have expectations attached to it. It may have commitments.

52
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You had this with me. I don't know if you'd have to go into work, you may have recourse, you have to write may have calls you may have some

53
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, just check and see how

54
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: How it's different than you, for it's probably going to be easier than Saturday and Sunday, but your started maybe Thursday night this over medicating

55
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What was going on around Thursday and Friday with you and the real world sucks, was that when I have to take care of these kids for three weeks came up

56
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.450
Yeah.

57
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.540
Mia Petersen: There was that and

58
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:16.050
Mia Petersen: We as a workforce. We're trying to figure out, like, you know, are we going to work, remote which centers are going to go remote. So my boss was leading that and she was just really stressed out, she ended up yelling at me on Thursday, and I was just like,

59
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.860
Mia Petersen: I just hit like a breaking point. It was after we admit and

60
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.060
Mia Petersen: I was just like, where did we meet on Wednesday.

61
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.790
Mia Petersen: Right away.

62
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.420
Mia Petersen: Was definitely

63
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: On the 11th. We met on the 11th and you. I don't know if you went to grew up on on the 12th i don't i don't know either.

64
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:45.870
Mia Petersen: Group on the 12th. But yeah, we've met. We've met on the 11th and I was kind of rough then and then like ticked I just got yelled at this

65
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:59.130
Mia Petersen: She was just stressed, but you know I don't do well with that I take them through personally and there was just a lot of stress around. And I'm like, trying to take care of the kids and I'd send a with me. And I'm like,

66
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:12.900
Mia Petersen: Trying to work and just all of that was was a lot and I was just like, overwhelmed. I've just felt really depressed these past few weeks, felt really overwhelmed.

67
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:27.660
Mia Petersen: I just really haven't felt myself and I think all of that combined was just like, I've been feeling like I want to use for so long and then working out and and trying to like distract and I just

68
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.870
Mia Petersen: It just kind of like all I was just like, I can't, I can't deal with this.

69
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.020
Mia Petersen: And I think part of it is, I might need to increase my antidepressants.

70
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

71
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We can, yes. That's yes, we don't have to overanalyze that but I want to talk about what you could have also done

72
00:07:52.950 --> 00:08:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do retail therapy do for you. Let's see what what you the solutions you selected to use. What did it do for you.

73
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:13.440
Mia Petersen: Well, I bought some stuff for the home office. So that made me feel a bit more prepared and organized and but then I also just bought a bunch of other stuff.

74
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:29.100
Mia Petersen: And then I was like, way. I haven't budgeted for this. I got planned for this. Now I have to ask less for money. So I was like, great. So then I asked us for money and he's like, No problem. That's fine. You can come pick up a check and then

75
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.740
Mia Petersen: So that was okay. That's really not but

76
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.950
Mia Petersen: More just feeling like

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.550

00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. Go with that just finished the free association want to feel better with what around what when hat like I want to feel better.

mia petersen: Yeah.

100
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.770
mia petersen: I want to feel when I think I want to feel better about myself like I've been really

101
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.160
mia petersen: Unhappy lately, and then I start to doubt myself.

102
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:29.850
mia petersen: And I know I don't like that. I don't want to go back to that you know that constant self doubt that I was used to live with, which is still pretty new for me.

103
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:42.120
mia petersen: I had that constant, but then it starts to creep in and I'm like, am not good enough things aren't good enough that the perfection. Okay.

104
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. I got it.

105
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.130
mia petersen: Now,

106
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: If we keep doing the same thing. If we don't start to do some different types of interventions. If we don't shift things up a little bit.

107
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: There, right, we might be continuing this so i i get you did what you used to do is you. You did reach for something outside of yourself and you have forgotten the year enough that you could literally throw your hands up and say just locking myself in the bathroom, just to take a bath.

108
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, um, but you didn't remember or this was the tipping point with being yelled at, or whatever the chip, whatever. Right.

109
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What you may get to find out.

110
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it is to them. And so that's remember it last time I was talking about boundaries and how to set the limits with the kids and

111
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to find out a little bit more clearly. Can I do this in a way that I don't lose myself that I don't get overwhelmed, maybe what's happening is

112
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not doing it. You're getting overwhelmed and not setting limits, possibly. I'm not there to watch. I'm not there to here, but you would know.

113
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's um

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.870
mia petersen: I have something level that I can go

148
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your shoulders like this, your hands and you move it forward about arm's length and they should go straight out.

149
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.220
Right now.

150
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Close your eyes will go to

151
00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Strain and you want to have

152
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe from fingertip to shoulder away from the objects that she has some distance your eyes aren't strange of your arms out

153
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.210
mia petersen: Oh, like this. Yeah.

154
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And so that the hands just touch the

155
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:42.510
mia petersen: Other way around

156
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.850
mia petersen: The phone not in front of it is that

157
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Pop Tart.

158
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.320
mia petersen: It's like a, it's a little yeah

159
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So with this is what we're doing. As long as you can see, which cup. I'm pointing to that. I'm not going to want you looking directly at my finger. But you'll just be getting the pace. You see, that's it. That's fantastic. Now, did your eyes hurt when you were doing that.

160
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.490
mia petersen: No, that's okay. I think I'm just having

161
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.370
mia petersen: Is that good like like this.

162
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, as long as that's fantastic. Okay.

163
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.560
mia petersen: Now I've got my points to look up. Okay, perfect, perfect.

164
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do a little bit of targeting around this. I know.

165
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Normally, we, we, kind of, you know, Socratic dialogue and wander around, but I think it's time let's let's do some other stuff.

166
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.900
mia petersen: It's done time

167
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because it's present. So what do we have, I'm going to

168
00:18:52.890 --> 00:19:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: skip all the psycho education. Let's just go to a target you just got you got triggered and you had a thought a negative cognition and you clarify. I'm going to say it, but then you correct me. Okay. The one I heard was

169
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not enough.

170
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Amount of what I do see

171
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: See me doing all these things.

172
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not enough. Now, that's me. I want to know what your what your thinking is

173
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.720
mia petersen: You have that's pretty close right like

174
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:39.810
mia petersen: You know, it felt that way. Like when my boss yelled at me, it felt that way yesterday after less was like you can spend money and then he's like, you spend too much money and

175
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.090
mia petersen: I feel that way when I let myself down by self medicating

176
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:54.510
mia petersen: Right, I feel that way. Like I just in general at work right now like I've worked really hard. It's not being recognized

177
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.290
mia petersen: Okay, Justin.

178
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.300
mia petersen: Find a specific

179
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Weight right there.

180
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know.

181
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: When you weren't recognized and more than not recognized you were yelled at scolded. It wasn't just I wasn't recognized it was

182
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Not just minimized. But something negative happened so

183
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to know the meaning you made it that and I'd like it in this I am when she

184
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.410
mia petersen: yelled at you.

185
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To remember what sponsoring belief about you is going on underneath all of that to take it nice and easy, slow, slow, slow, we want to try and get the core belief about the self, she's yelling at you.

186
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember what you were thinking about yourself.

187
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.600
mia petersen: Not

188
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.580
mia petersen: So many things. I'm not smart enough, I'm not right.

189
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:18.480
mia petersen: I'm not respected. I'm not thought of is competent right I am incompetent.

190
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

191
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.530
mia petersen: And I am

192
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.000
mia petersen: You know, incapable

193
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:28.380
Okay.

194
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: We want one.

195
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I am incompetent.

196
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That does that grasp it more than I'm not smart.

197
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:44.550
mia petersen: I think so. I think so. Like, I start to then it's like, I doubt my decisions.

198
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:58.890
mia petersen: Start to doubt my my intellect or my document or my experience or my judgment, right, like, Oh, I guess I don't have good judgment. I didn't make a good judgment call there.

199
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can refine it so close your eyes and you say, both of these statements out loud. See which one seems more colder.

200
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Negative

201
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm incompetent.

202
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Try that one.

203
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.860
mia petersen: I am incompetent.

204
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't trust my judgment.

205
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.910
mia petersen: I can't trust my judgment.

206
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.770
mia petersen: Think it's the judgment really

207
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel in your body as you say that

208
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.110
mia petersen: Mr. Nick is like

209
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:44.250
mia petersen: A result I like yeah I don't have good judgment. I came with trusted decisions because I will miss out, make the wrong decision.

210
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't be trusted.

211
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you probably know. So right there. And those are the core central parts of the body, the stomach and chest and let's give it

212
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: An emotion label. What do we call the emotion, you're feeling as you sit. When I can't be trusted.

213
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.440
mia petersen: Disappointment.

214
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.130
mia petersen: Disappointment. A lot of

215
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.750
mia petersen: Shame.

216
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.920
mia petersen: Shame. Shame to myself. Yeah.

217
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: They live in this in that central stuff right there where your stomach and chest right down the center of the body. That's where you know they're registering. Okay. And let me see, to the degree

218
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That you believe that to be true. Right now, one to 10 I can't be trusted 10 is it's absolutely true, were you out with that believing. That's true.

219
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.080
mia petersen: Maybe like a seven.

220
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.220
Okay.

221
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you would like to be thinking right now.

222
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: About yourself.

223
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:13.920
mia petersen: I can be trusted. I do have good judgment and

224
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.730
mia petersen: I'm competent

225
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.710
mia petersen: I do have

226
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

227
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.020
Judgment.

228
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: See which one lands. We want it nice and sweet. Which one lands more succinctly, you may register in the stomach and chest sort of the dissonance, as you say it. So just try it on. I do have good judgment. See how it feels, if that's

229
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.860
mia petersen: I think you have good judgment.

230
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, versus

231
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: unconfident

232
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.670
mia petersen: I am competent

233
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:04.590
mia petersen: I think it's, I can be trusted. I can be trusted. There's a lot around that that trust.

234
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.450
mia petersen: At like

235
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.860
mia petersen: Anything. It's not one

236
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so how true from one to seven how true right now is I can be trusted. First thing that comes what number yet.

237
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.230
mia petersen: For okay and be like a three or four

238
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You might do 3.5

239
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:27.750
Yeah.

240
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.980
Two 3.5

241
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.610
mia petersen: It's like right here when I yeah

242
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So right there. Go to the chest. Let's let it inform the next piece and then we'll move into the iterations of the bilateral stimulation here and let's go to

243
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Really turn that awareness to the chest and see. Let's go back and have a meaningful bridging to early experience or a very intense experience you've had a recent trigger

244
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if there's links.

245
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:01.710
To history.

246
00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you see maybe a memory earliest age or most intensive can't be trusted.

247
00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up for you.

248
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:34.950
mia petersen: Gosh, I'm having trouble finding a specific instance, but I'm seeing my dad. I'm seeing my dad being like, like he used to have this expression or he would tell me and my sister just hover.

249
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:45.390
mia petersen: And in a really started voice to be like hover, don't touch a fucking thing you kids always ruin my stuff you ruin everything I have

250
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.220
mia petersen: And

251
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.830
mia petersen: I'm trying. Well,

252
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.590
mia petersen: There's this one time. My sister stole my dad's truck.

253
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:16.350
mia petersen: Like in the middle of the night I drove to her friends and wrecked it is I got blamed for it. And I told my dad. I was like, I didn't do this, I promise and do this. And he's like, You can't be trusted. You can't be trusted, your fucking liar. You're a liar, like your mom.

254
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.150
mia petersen: And I got into a lot of trouble right now is very upset.

255
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:27.030
mia petersen: And it's hard for it's hard for me to access that memory.

256
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.400
mia petersen: Almost like

257
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:31.950
mia petersen: Okay.

258
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's look at that stay with that you're okay. You're right. We don't have to push hard at it.

259
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that distress level zero to 100 how distressing.

260
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it right now to bring it up. Are we at zero to 100

261
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:58.230
mia petersen: I'm not. I'm having a little bit of symptom here. It's interesting. My back is hurting

262
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.350
mia petersen: It's hurting

263
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like 7070 or 50 or 30

264
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.620
mia petersen: Or 2030 house can say like

265
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.130
25 3025

266
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.040
mia petersen: Yeah, let's go there.

267
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.360
Okay.

268
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's go with that. So,

269
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a, it's actually on the lower end, which says to me, we might be able to do just the distance, but I want to remind you

270
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That the work that you and I are doing is a little different. This is attached focused, which means I'm going to want you to include either. Maybe all included. Or you can include them anytime you want to your protective figure that's the adult self.

271
00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: motherly parental figure encasing a shield very almost like armor a nurturing figure the adult you okay

272
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:07.290
mia petersen: Okay.

273
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And is also wise figure which you included with Dr. Rob real so her hair wise elder so you can bring in. And also, you and I are here together.

274
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So, your eyes will be open. There might be times when I asked you to talk through the iteration I may not. But this first one, there might be an increase in distress that would be normal and you're okay. The goal is to bring it back down. Okay.

275
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'd like you to do is I'd like you to picture the worst image of that event.

276
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can't beat. I can't be trusted the negative cognition and I want you to open your eyes and want you to look at those two projects. At this rate, okay.

277
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Any a little faster.

278
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Worst image.

279
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's straining your eyes. You can sit back

280
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's Breathe in. Breathe in nice belly breath, bring it down low, low, low,

281
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Go let your mind go blank.

282
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, what you notice

283
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.320
mia petersen: Still just thinking about that. Okay.

284
00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:57.660
mia petersen: So we're going to

285
00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.440
mia petersen: Notice that it was okay.

286
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to go with that. So you're still thinking about it, pull up the worst image of it and that negative cognition. Okay.

287
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure you're, you're not straining your eyes that you've got a good distance here. Okay.

288
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: This one's going to be a little longer.

289
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:22.710
You want to keep your hands.

290
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be other sounds, life goes on, just circling come back to that image in that negative

291
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget to keep breathing.

292
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you now.

293
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:16.050
mia petersen: Some distance there. I see adult bells. A who's, who's comforting and in control and

294
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:23.370
mia petersen: I do feel the need to escape the first time was coming up was that was where I started using

295
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:37.890
mia petersen: Because my dad would yell at me and it was physically her to sell me verbally abusive and I would get in my car and drive down the road and get high and calm down and come back.

296
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.400
mia petersen: So I didn't have any place else to go. So

297
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to go with that. This is

298
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, or scrimmage and go with that.

299
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.630
Breathing. Nice.

300
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale together nice belly breath right down to the bottom of the lung.

301
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, nice and slow. All of it out the mouth.

302
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.530
Your mind.

303
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting it all go

304
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice what comes up.

305
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.270
mia petersen: Feel better, but I feel like

306
00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.290
mia petersen: This is a little bit like

307
00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:02.820
mia petersen: I think that's what it is, where it's like, I don't, I don't feel completely in my body.

308
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's spend some time with the figures, we're just going to do that. This is going to be a slow iteration. And in fact, I want you to also

309
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Also tune into me.

310
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever sort of rapport trust relationship that we have in this therapeutic relationship on right here.

311
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

312
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: To be present with that you're not alone.

313
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice that you communicated starting to sort of leave right you weren't sort of present with that and then pull up the images protective figure

314
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Nurturing and wise.

315
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: See this starting to change. Notice there's something more that's needed

316
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.120
And I will

317
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:05.610
mia petersen: It's better

318
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: To do some installing with that these iterations. So I want you to hold those fingers and that's all we're going to do. Okay, so the SLOWER. OKAY. THE WHOLE Dennis worry I work hard, right, pulling in and out awareness really picturing them these is going to be a slug generation.

319
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Paying attention body these images.

320
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.600
Tune in to both of you can

321
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring them together into the belly breath.

322
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And then slow as you can. Let's make this the longest breath you've ever exhale and

323
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Quiet witnessing just see what comes up.

324
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.790
mia petersen: Better I can be present and

325
00:36:54.180 --> 00:37:01.710
mia petersen: It makes me a little sad to think that I just never had that but converting to picture little Mia surrounded

326
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're going to go without to it again, just what you just did go nice and slow, which you were doing.

327
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Put your hands together across the nation min ago

328
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to keep moving. But I'd like you to share what's coming up for you. You're talking

329
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:55.380
mia petersen: Feeling better feeling happiness, you know, security.

330
00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.460
mia petersen: Feeling like I can

331
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.460
mia petersen: It's hard for me to look at and talk

332
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: No, that's okay.

333
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:10.110
mia petersen: Feeling like I just relieve tension is leaving my shoulders.

334
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.320
mia petersen: I can feel my shoulders.

335
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale.

336
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Course, the sounds we integrate into the practice.

337
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being aware both what's going on outside of you and inside

338
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing

339
00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.250
mia petersen: I feel like a return to my body and I can

340
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:56.670
mia petersen: Now again, feel like actually feel my shoulders and feeling like a weight has been lifted.

341
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.730
See

342
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check in on something.

343
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.840
mia petersen: Like you know it's like it's like a sorry to interrupt.

344
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:23.340
mia petersen: Like when you're carrying something really heavy for a long time now, like a weight is lifted, but like, Oh, well, wait a second. Like there's like a

345
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:33.660
mia petersen: Like when I was disassociate I didn't realize how tense. I was because I couldn't really check in. I was just like, out of the body. Okay.

346
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is it right now.

347
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be trusted.

348
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.130
mia petersen: Still

349
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.290
mia petersen: Not quite there.

350
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. What number are we at

351
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to please me. I really want to know what's going on for you.

352
00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:22.320
mia petersen: I feel I can be trusted more but I'm still very uncertain night picture little vs a child like kind of like okays the coast clear, can I come out like that's kind of how I feel okay and be a dangerous subsided. Right. It's not quite but

353
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.550
mia petersen: Don't know quite there.

354
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to go deviate. Just a little bit. I want to take a closer look at some of these

355
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Figures that you've created. Okay, I

356
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to check in on. I'm just a little bit.

357
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

358
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You have identified a protective figure us the adult self like motherly parental figure in casing a shield barrier almost like armor.

359
00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Inside that

360
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, are you when you picture a little Mia, are you able to actually visualize this because if it's not enough. You might need to refine this a little bit.

361
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.470
mia petersen: So I think

362
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:22.710
mia petersen: That's really good point. I don't. Yeah. So I see me as a separate

363
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.170
mia petersen: And then I don't really know what's behind that armor there.

364
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:31.800
mia petersen: I think

365
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.210
mia petersen: That one's hard for me because I'm sure that as parents

366
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm

367
00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Here. That's why we're coming back to this one. It's not uncommon that as I've been watching the first time you guys explore it.

368
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Come up with it tested. We just did it didn't quite click it's okay that informs it because

369
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: This is critical. This is about trust. So getting this one spot on that you can feel sleepy.

370
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and I don't want to miss miss the refinement on this one.

371
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Scan your environment. Again, so go quiet inside allow imagination. Allow anyone in your life. It can be fiction, it can be real that you have been witness to the quality of protection that little Mia.

372
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.300
Really could have benefited from this got that.

373
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.980
mia petersen: I kind of I picture you and then I also picture my best friend's mom.

374
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.350
mia petersen: Fantastic who is

375
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.660
mia petersen: Christy

376
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.490
mia petersen: And

377
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.150
mia petersen: Christy always, you know,

378
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:00.390
mia petersen: Christy made sure that

379
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:09.000
mia petersen: The boundaries were clear, you know, she had boundaries for us. She made sure that the kids were safe. She put our kids first

380
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.390
mia petersen: And I spent a lot of time they're growing up.

381
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:25.440
mia petersen: Christie took care of herself. She always made time for ourselves so that she was physically and mentally healthy, but she always took care of us to and made sure that we had what we need.

382
00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:35.940
mia petersen: Needed and she was generous with us to what she definitely she would let us know. You know what the expectation was

383
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:46.800
mia petersen: And what the consequence was if we didn't meet the expectation, but she would also she didn't yell, she would explain it to us and say hey you know

384
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.700
mia petersen: Like I remember she would always look at encourage us to look at the other side of things.

385
00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.760
mia petersen: And even now as an adult, I know she's

386
00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.000
mia petersen: Always very supportive.

387
00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.580
mia petersen: Right, like she's, she's like, I'm so proud of you. You're doing so good with the kids.

388
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.660
mia petersen: She summarized Meyer a lot

389
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So, could be convenient. Since you mentioned me also. So take a look at me because I happen to be here. See what pieces.

390
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: We can sort of make use of right here. Take what Christine meant to you back then. See what's also present here with me. Good name some of that.

391
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.960
mia petersen: Yeah, like that's what I like about you too is that you're very

392
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:49.350
mia petersen: Playful but you also have firm boundaries and you're very protecting and like I was thinking about that this weekend, like you always

393
00:44:49.830 --> 00:45:00.000
mia petersen: You know, you're like, I want I want everything for you. I want the best for you. But you also aren't you know like some other people in my life. Or like, oh, just go for it.

394
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:10.680
mia petersen: You're like, no, that's not good for you, you, you, that's not going to make you happy. In the long run, right. So I think about that in terms of parent of being

395
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:23.790
mia petersen: Supportive right but also saying, nope. This is not what we stand for system horn. And do you know I expect better you I'll help you get there.

396
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.480
mia petersen: Okay, I think we're I mistaking that

397
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.520
mia petersen: I've seen the armor, but I don't see that substance behind it.

398
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To stay with this is, this is what I

399
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Backed me here. The rest of them.

400
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:44.670
mia petersen: Like this is what I expect you know this is what is

401
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.660
mia petersen: The guy lost my train of thought.

402
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It was important because it's playful protective

403
00:45:54.120 --> 00:46:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a sense in here because it sounded very similar to to Christie's she would explain things about her expectation

404
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And you knew she would her. I think she was consistent

405
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:10.050
mia petersen: She has

406
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What we expected. And you knew what to expect. She wasn't yelling it but you knew if I do this, then this will happen if I don't do this. Why then, this might happen, you were able to hear it clearly. Okay.

407
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:24.210
Yeah.

408
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You can find some words.

409
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: For

410
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Christie.

411
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: For me,

412
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And then let's get some imagery with it, see us an action because there's a real melding you use very similar wording.

413
00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: With both of us just now.

414
00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture a little Mia.

415
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to and we're probably going to do some weaving and and this will probably be doing a slow iteration, but I really want you to get into the imagery. So, and register your body as the litmus test to find out if it really is true. Okay.

416
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that may be shifts, like, yeah, that was it.

417
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So you get an Omnia, and

418
00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: There's sort of false accusation. There's some my fault. I mean, Blaine, lots of trouble.

419
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: physically abuse psychologically abused and then

420
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this other type of person, a protective type that looks like this. Like Christie and when

421
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: They do these things.

422
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Types of people are these people

423
00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:10.830
mia petersen: I guess.

424
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.940
mia petersen: You know, like protector coming up with the protecting figure

425
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective mom.

426
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.100
mia petersen: Yeah.

427
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom and getting it captures playfulness self care care putting children's safety first also includes being very clear about what expectations are. And then all of those other pieces.

428
00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:38.910
mia petersen: Yeah.

429
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Before we do the next generation. I just want to check in, because everybody's got their kids, kids at home based

430
00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Parenting before we do the next one.

431
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.470
mia petersen: Yeah, let me just asking. Thank you.

432
00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:03.450

Gwenevere Abriel: So pull that back up in in that space of

436
00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to that worst image.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:47.370
mia petersen: I'm envisioning my dad's house and I'm like standing behind the protective figure and my dad is yelling and he protected for years coming in and is by that barrier and almost taking me out. Does that work.

438
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Was open your eyes. And I want you to pull that image up, keep it in your awareness.

439
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

440
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: To a couple of short ones coming up for you right now.

441
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:39.510
mia petersen: It's hard for me to leave. Right. Like I could envision being taken out, but not that long term security.

442
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you can see being

443
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Taken out of the house.

444
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:52.710
mia petersen: Yeah, like I want to leave the house. I want to say almost like I want to move in with this person.

445
00:50:53.910 --> 00:51:10.560
mia petersen: I'm like, I want out. I want to redo but I keep seeing that like this pool like know pull, man. I see my dad be like, I'll be better, I'll be better and person like kind of teaching and say no, then getting sucked back in

446
00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: See, see me ask this protective mom quality what she wants to she wants to ask

447
00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:28.590
And if it comes up in some other way. That's fine too.

448
00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:58.650
What's coming up for you.

449
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:11.400
mia petersen: Much better. Much a lot a lot more of a release so was able to ask for permission. Leave that house. I grew up in and go to my room.

450
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:17.190
mia petersen: Yeah, so like, you know, my special room and everything's

mia petersen: Nice. Yeah.

452
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing into it.

453
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's add paying attention to the body.

454
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.850
mia petersen: Stay in the room.

455
00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:16.440
mia petersen: Picture going outside the sadness is gone. I'm not having a lot of

456
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:30.630
mia petersen: Reaction in my body. I feel in my body. I don't feel the tension the headache is gone. I have like a headache, like a like a radiating dole that seems to be gone. I feel a lot better.

457
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:33.450
mia petersen: Feel safe.

458
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that go with what you just said in that room. See if there's got to really be sure if there's any charge left in that body. This is the time we've got minutes left.

459
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: She gets what she needs in that room get the imagery everything you need in that room scan the body. If there's any charge left and then open your eyes. When you're ready. Oh, here we go.

460
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:16.950
What's

461
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.040
mia petersen: Called

462
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:21.780
mia petersen: Tighter

463
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.270
Almost done.

464
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Please scan the body.

465
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.030
In that room if that's where you still were

466
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together nice belly breath in.

467
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The mind go blank.

468
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: See what

469
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.140
mia petersen: I feel

470
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:46.020
mia petersen: Much less sad. Like I feel like I've been walking around for weeks, which is sadness, like a tiered out very easily have been very sensitive. I don't feel that right now. I feel much more calm and secure, I think, is probably a good word for it.

471
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:51.690
mia petersen: And

472
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:55.590
mia petersen: That's it.

473
00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:58.740
mia petersen: That's it.

474
00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What about any charge left

475
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you got to be super careful of wanting to

476
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Have an expected outcome from today that there's a difference between it actually happening and an expected outcome. And I might be exaggerating that vigilance that I have on it, but that's me because I mean it's true for you. It's just checking in on there.

477
00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is one way to do it, check when you, when I invited earlier. Was there any charge left in the body. Any tension okay in that room.

478
00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:45.750
mia petersen: Yeah, when I was in my room and I just kept telling myself. You can stay here forever okay to leave you can stay here forever. Okay.

479
00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:46.830
mia petersen: So then

480
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You can stay here.

481
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: We want that transcribed. You can stay here forever.

482
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:54.120
Yeah.

483
00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:10.770
mia petersen: There's a tendency is for me to then say, nope. You have to go back. This isn't real. You have to go back and so if I just say it over and over, like you, you deserve to stay here. You can stay here. Right. Instead of thinking

484
00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see how true i can be trusted is okay, from one to seven, I'm sure, is that right now.

485
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: First number that came to mind.

486
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.450
Takes

487
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:31.500
It moved up

488
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.870
mia petersen: Yeah, completely different in hell.

489
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:38.280
Like

490
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:54.270
mia petersen: Before was like I can be trusted. I was like, no, I can maybe I can. I don't know this one. The first was like, yes, I can be trusted. Not all i'm not 100% certain, but more certain. Yeah.

491
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Went up it was at 3.5

492
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:00.720
mia petersen: Yeah.

493
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You know with this and then I want whatever's left to go in the container or in the distancing metaphor, but

494
00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know why it's not a seven first response.

495
00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:19.710
mia petersen: Still unsure.

496
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:22.980
mia petersen: I'm still unsure of myself.

497
00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:28.080
mia petersen: No, I'm unsure how other people see me.

498
00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

499
00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so not at seven because unsure of how people see me.

500
00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:53.310
mia petersen: It's not I'm unsure of myself but side, I am not sure how others see me and I got live on that external validation. Still, I do.

501
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it makes sense that right that would it really triggered.

502
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Something big with what your Boston. Okay, let's go to taking whatever's left whatever is floating around. That's sort of unsettled or uncertain maybe would be something that might be distressing for you, and let's put it, let's put it in a container.

503
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that you can lock up and let's see if we can actually get a little bit of distance. I'll have to go in here to see

504
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember what your container was

505
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:42.690
mia petersen: I don't remember. Oh, I remember being that little change box I have like a little miniature seeds that are used for my garage sales. Yeah, and it's opaque and it locks up

506
00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: pretty opaque powerless and size shoe box with metal lining. So stuff can't get out live like a miniature safe can shut it lock with a key and the keys in the pocket.

507
00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:02.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that somehow that box.

508
01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Is in a car.

509
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Driving the opposite direction. And you see it in the rear here, just notice getting further

510
01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And further away.

511
01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no danger.

512
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.020
Yeah.

513
01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncertainty is far away.

514
01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just you.

515
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Your ability to trust yourself to tune in to be present in the messages, your body and your mind.

516
01:00:49.290 --> 01:01:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Using all of your brain, not just the perceived threat. Yes, those will come habitually you can calm the body and use all parents, your brain to modulate initial reaction.

517
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.710
mia petersen: Oh no, what happened.

518
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.760
mia petersen: Bad one

519
01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll let you go, you're ready.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yes.

524
01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:32.220

Jessica G: My baby.

541
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.690
What's the

542
01:02:53.190 --> 01:03:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: For everybody. It's a little different. So I won't invite the topic. If it's not something pressing for you. What is this virus. It's in our lives now with heightened awareness. What is this like is it affecting you a great deal. Do we want to talk about that. What would you like to do

543
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:15.960
Jessica G: I'm actually, that's one of the topics that I have written down.

544
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:23.820
Jessica G: The other day. Okay, so I've been fine.

545
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.360
Jessica G: I've been fine and then the new day.

546
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:40.710
Jessica G: I seen a couple of the tiny little cockroaches in my kitchen. Uh huh. And, and that triggered, just like this huge meltdown for me.

547
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:48.030
Jessica G: Like I had just seen the briefing from Donald Trump, where he

548
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.020
Jessica G: He labeled data.

549
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:57.900
Jessica G: What is, what did he say a national pandemic, or something like that.

550
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:09.750
Jessica G: And I'm so seeing the little cockroaches. I started cleaning, cleaning and moved everything the stove and then I started crying and freaking out. Okay.

551
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is the meaning that those bugs have for you. They have a bigger meaning.

552
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, seeing those particular bugs. What does that mean to you. What's the first thing that comes to mind.

553
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:25.170
Jessica G: I'm

554
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:26.820
Jessica G: Just like

555
01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:29.910
Jessica G: Like dirty.

556
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.820
Jessica G: Dirty

557
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:35.100
Jessica G: Like

558
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:51.660
Jessica G: Who knows, like what diseases they carry stuff and they're invading their intruding in my home and and like I work so hard to keep my home clean but it's, you know, I'm not perfect and

559
01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:02.190
Jessica G: So that just triggered like this whole thing and it was the day. Actually, the day that they had just um

560
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:12.210
Jessica G: That I had just the some cases popped up in New Mexico, like we were fine. I was everywhere else. But it wasn't any New Mexico, so that we knew of

561
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:26.880
Jessica G: And then I guess they did some testing and some people it was like in New Mexico now. And so that's the day that like I started seeing the roaches in my head just started spinning and I started crying and I was pretty hysterical.

562
01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So see something it's intruding there intruding you cleaned and the hysterical that you described.

563
01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Did it continue even after you cleaned or while you were cleaning. I'm going to text my 11 year old here. I got one at home to

564
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You want six out

565
01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.240
Jessica G: Of them I'm wash hands.

566
01:05:58.530 --> 01:05:59.010
Jessica G: Yeah.

567
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So were you

568
01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Upset, but you're calling meltdown. Were you upset, while you're cleaning

569
01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:18.030
Jessica G: Yes, I was crying.

570
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What was this. Do you remember Katarina thoughts. Do you remember the, was it I'm dirty now. Okay, so what was it,

571
01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:35.550
Jessica G: I think just, I was just worried about, like, what's gonna happen. I'm

572
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.080
Jessica G: Everyone's like cleaning out the stores.

573
01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:49.200
Jessica G: I have this trip plan. Do you know my mom had a trip planned and it's just

574
01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:52.020
Jessica G: My son was asleep.

575
01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:58.140
Jessica G: Those were my thoughts.

576
01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: My son was asleep. I had a trip planned.

577
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:11.490
Jessica G: Yeah, like I had a trip plan to go to California to see my mom. And now we're not gonna be able to go and

578
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:19.320
Jessica G: Just a bunch of stuff was going through my head like what's gonna happen.

579
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:27.090
Jessica G: And then now there's like a bunch of videos and no I shouldn't be watching on what there's like videos on Facebook about

580
01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:42.840
Jessica G: That it. This is a bioterrorism attack. And then we're going to go into martial law, and this is the beginning of the new world order and and I'm into all that stuff into my I've always been into all that kind of stuff, like the conspiracy theories but

581
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:48.450
Jessica G: They were just conspiracy theories and now there's a possibility that it might be true.

582
01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.340
Jessica G: And

583
01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.440
Jessica G: I don't know, I just, I was just freaking out.

584
01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:11.310
Jessica G: But I cried. I cried for a little bit like for 30 minutes I was freaking out. And then my older brother showed up and then I I kind of felt better. Like, I felt like secure. Like, I don't know. It was weird.

585
01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Something about his being there helped to get you out of that.

586
01:08:17.730 --> 01:08:20.970
Jessica G: Yeah I he walked into the door.

587
01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:31.590
Jessica G: And I just ran to them and I hugged them. And he was like, What the heck, like, you know, cuz we have like the current this kind of relationship where like we

588
01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:33.810
Jessica G: We kind of like

589
01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.630
Jessica G: tease each other.

590
01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:43.530
Jessica G: And so for me to like run up to him and hug them he kind of freaked out. And I was like, there's cockerel

591
01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:52.560
Jessica G: It. He looks. He looks at my son's dad, and he's like, oh, like he knew that I was having like an episode.

592
01:08:56.190 --> 01:09:01.200
Jessica G: And right away. He jumped into, like, okay, what can I do like let's go buy you some some

593
01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.510
Jessica G: Some poison is out at what. What's the word for it.

594
01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:22.110
Jessica G: Like this powder that you put to kill the bugs and then like, you know, you just got to keep it clean, and he was trying to help me, but I didn't tell them that like the underlying issue was that I was freaking out because of the coronavirus

595
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and even underneath that

596
01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So notice how something's getting in in dating coming in the house. I'll tell you were kind of wording it before right coming in.

597
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's been a theme.

598
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This week so far is that notion. So just spend a little bit of time and just see what the emotion is with the idea that something's coming in the hall.

599
01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Something could come in the home.

600
01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you feel what's the emotion, how you label that

601
01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:11.490
Jessica G: I feel

602
01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:13.020
Scared.

603
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.560
Jessica G: I'm so scared. I feel I'm prepared.

604
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.100
I see.

605
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I do wonder

606
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How is it that people if you go to this extreme of the conspiracy. Whoops, in front of me.

607
01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:37.920
Jessica G: Sorry, I'm

608
01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Waiting

609
01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:46.140
Jessica G: Yeah okay because the kids migrated upstairs. Oh.

610
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.050
Jessica G: Okay.

611
01:10:53.370 --> 01:11:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So the sort of conspiracy theory that's one sort of wide swing to to say this is the end of the world kind of thing is this, it's gonna get really bad and

612
01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you call that conspiracy theory. Do you have a label for this is what

613
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:17.340
Jessica G: I'm

614
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:21.750
Jessica G: Like the beginning of the new world order.

615
01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And how does anyone prepare for that.

616
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:49.650
Jessica G: I don't know. And now all I could think about is like everyone thought that the the Doomsday peppers was like we're crazy, but I bet you they like us. They're hiding now and their bunkers and stuff.

617
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm sure they're just so happy in there.

618
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

619
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the other extreme, or the other extreme of New World Order what. So if this is New World Order over here and we went all the way over and swung it over here. What would that look like

620
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.430
Jessica G: Everything goes back to normal.

621
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

622
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:23.460
Jessica G: Or what do you mean

623
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's, let me see a little bit more. So this is

624
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to bunker. And I'm assuming there's other behaviors that go into New World Order size the bunker. What else you have to do.

625
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:47.850
Jessica G: Own for the new world order. So like all basically our society is going to collapse and

626
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:59.610
Jessica G: I don't like all the money and everything all currency isn't going to be worth anything anymore. We're gonna have to like

627
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.700
Jessica G: Abide by specific set of rules. Basically, I guess.

628
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what would be the exact opposite of bunkering down

629
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:24.660
Jessica G: The opposite of that would be like the coming of Jesus.

630
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't think that

631
01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's stick with things that

632
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You could conceivably do yourself can't make the coming of Jesus. I don't think plus right so let's just go with the opposite of bunkering down. Are you wondering, are you in a bunker.

633
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.530
No.

634
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.060
Jessica G: No.

635
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. But some people are

636
01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So the opposite of that. Why, why isn't it everyone bunkering down because it's

637
01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.050
Jessica G: Not that serious.

638
01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: They're bunkering down because it's not that serious.

639
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.780
Jessica G: Oh, why is everyone on why is everyone bunkering down all because

640
01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.490
Jessica G: Because there's a pandemic happening that's killing people are great.

641
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Now why are some people not bunkering down and doing the opposite of that.

642
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:38.670
Jessica G: Some people are not hunkering down because they don't have a bunker to go to maybe

643
01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What might be another reason.

644
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.500
Jessica G: Um,

645
01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.520
Jessica G: Because

646
01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.030
Jessica G: There is a need to bunker down

647
01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so the people that do believe there's a need, the people that don't don't believe there's a need, right. So it's probably based on their worldview, the way they view this virus.

648
01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that people that are not offering down and don't see the need

649
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Our I'm believing

650
01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: The same

651
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing on Facebook as an example to quit believing it.

652
01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, what do you think they the opposite of this new world order total opposite. We're just doing extremes here. Do you think they believe

653
01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: People that are building a bunker believe there's a need

654
01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a threat.

655
01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a danger.

656
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.450
Jessica G: Build it

657
01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:08.970
Jessica G: Was

658
01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the people that are not building a bunker. What do they believe

659
01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:24.660
Jessica G: Um, that is not, it's not as grave, as some people are making it out to be like the government isn't trying to

660
01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.400
Jessica G: Hurt us.

661
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:33.840
Jessica G: They're just trying to help us. Okay.

662
01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:38.550
Jessica G: Government or we can trust them. Okay.

663
01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Government is trustworthy.

664
01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:41.190
Yeah.

665
01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.780
Jessica G: I mean, from what I'm seeing like like I know there's people that absolutely hate Trump

666
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.670
Jessica G: But

667
01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:53.880
Jessica G: The way I see it, like

668
01:16:57.090 --> 01:17:03.120
Jessica G: He's our president he's there and there's nothing that we can do about it besides vote.

669
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:10.620
Jessica G: So I basically just listen to what he has to say and kind of, you know,

670
01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.660
Jessica G: Just hope that he's trying. He has our best interests at heart.

671
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.400
Jessica G: I guess.

672
01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:46.530
Jessica G: And hope that the medical officials really are setting up I'm testing sites and are taking precautions for for us not to contract over the virus. And if we do, then I hope that they're like

673
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:48.630
Jessica G: They have

674
01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:57.060
Jessica G: At least some kind of idea of how to treat it.

675
01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:01.200
Jessica G: And they're doing the best they can basically that's

676
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:05.550
Jessica G: Kind of my mindset now. Okay.

677
01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: If you hold the position of hope. The way you just defined it.

678
01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it's a good investment to be

679
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Watching

680
01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The Conspiracy theory on Facebook. Is it good for your mental health.

681
01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:32.850
Jessica G: It.

682
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Would be good for your mental health.

683
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: To take the position of presidents doing the best he can. You're doing the best you can.

684
01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be a good investment if your mental health.

685
01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:53.640
Jessica G: Just

686
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:57.480
Jessica G: Proceed with life. Okay.

687
01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:04.680
Jessica G: Deal with life and keep doing what I was doing and just try to

688
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.620
Jessica G: You know, stay clean wash my hands wash my son's hands.

689
01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's a pretty important one, right. So, Washington. So an extreme although you didn't say it, I was thinking I'm

690
01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone in the opposite of Bunker down might be going out and deliberately making contact with someone who has been diagnosed with right

691
01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That right

692
01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be an extreme

693
01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're, you know,

694
01:19:51.960 --> 01:20:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You found it on your own. No, I have to assume because there's only so much you can do because well unless you want to pick up drive to Washington DC or you want to do some advocacy unless you want to do that. There's only so much you can do in your home.

695
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: But the stuff that you're letting in that Facebook information.

696
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You might consider not not not letting that happen like maybe that's where the hygiene is needed the bugs. Bugs were here long before you were here has nothing to do with you. Those bonds will survive out survive us. They just will

697
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the invasion part the helplessness. That happens because there's nothing you can do.

698
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not about it, you're cleaning the house.

699
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, you know, we get rats to, you know, we have proper that's near water, they're going to come walking by.

700
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, we're here before, so probably be her after us.

701
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:10.170
Jessica G: And then I found out that I'm are downstairs neighbors.

702
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:15.930
Jessica G: And so usually when they come. It's because somebody moved

703
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:21.870
Jessica G: Like out of an apartment or something. But it was just like I seen like three of them, and then

704
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:26.970
Jessica G: I went crazy cleaning and then I haven't seen them anymore.

705
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:29.910
Jessica G: And the same thing happened.

706
01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:34.410
Jessica G: A few months ago I seen a mouse.

707
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.450
Jessica G: He I think the mouse all man I went nuts. I

708
01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:57.450
Jessica G: started crying too. I started crying. I called my brother and he showed up with a bunch of like trapped and stuff and set them up. And so that's why he kind of knew what was going on with the cockroaches on it. Linder, I think cockroaches cycle. Okay, that's what's happening.

709
01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But even, you know, there's meaning.

710
01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Underneath it right

711
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not just about the mouse. So what you do with the meaning of the mouse.

712
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And it sets it sets this negative. So I just curious, is, is there any history between dirty in your life. Is there some some history going back around dirty.

713
01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.240
Jessica G: Um,

714
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:50.700
Jessica G: I know my my room. When I was younger I used to be such a mess. Like, you couldn't even see the floor.

715
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:54.480
Jessica G: It was always just really dirty when I was younger.

716
01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:58.950
Jessica G: And I just, I couldn't bring myself to clean it.

717
01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:07.530
Jessica G: I first got my own room when I was 12 years old I was when I first had my own room and then

718
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:17.970
Jessica G: It would just be really, really dirty and then the lights would always like die out. So it'd be like this like dark

719
01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:28.380
Jessica G: Like the light bulbs were like, I don't know if they would like burn or something. Would it be like a really don't, don't lie and then

720
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:40.680
Jessica G: There was this one time where I guess they left the balcony open because where we live, the apartments that we lived in were next to like this open field. And that was a bunch of bunnies.

721
01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:49.620
Jessica G: And so one morning I woke up, and so he ran over my like ran on top of my feet and it was a little bunny.

722
01:23:50.460 --> 01:24:03.990
Jessica G: And I started freaking out. And so my brother was like trying to keep my brother, my mind. We're like trying to catch it when my brother was trying to catch me and my mom were standing on top of chairs and he was like freaking out to. He was so

723
01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:16.980
Jessica G: Busy he's more scared of them there we were, but like he had to catch it, because I don't know. My mom told because you're the man, you have to catch it. And so he like

724
01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.850
Jessica G: geared up with his baseball here and the

725
01:24:22.050 --> 01:24:25.350
Jessica G: encoded with the baseball glove and threw it outside.

726
01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a Bunny. Bunny was inside the house.

727
01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.270
Yeah.

728
01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:32.400
Jessica G: In my room.

729
01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this this

730
01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: This room.

731
01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The prior to

732
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You are sharing a room with

733
01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.630
My mom.

734
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And how was the room then

735
01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:56.640
Jessica G: I'm the room that I shared with my mom.

736
01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.090
Jessica G: Clean she kept it clean.

737
01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: anything negative happened in that room.

738
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:18.090
Jessica G: No. Okay.

739
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.650
Jessica G: No.

740
01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.100
Jessica G: I was just always see like

741
01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:29.130
Jessica G: It was just always like spiritual stuff like

742
01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:38.070
Jessica G: And it was the same with anyone else who slept in the room like what am I my uncle was he was living with us and he

743
01:25:39.930 --> 01:25:51.450
Jessica G: He said that there was a little girl. There was always this little girl that was in that apartment with that we would see and he seemed a little girl like on the edge of the bed and nice to see her all the time too.

744
01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.770
Jessica G: But other than that, that's it.

745
01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How long have you been seeing the little girl on the edge of the bed.

746
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:06.810
Jessica G: Um, it was just when we moved into that apartment.

747
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.170
Jessica G: And then see her anymore after that.

748
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:23.610
Jessica G: And like everyone seen like everyone seen her like she was sitting in the middle of the kitchen floor. She picked her head around the corner like everyone was senior

749
01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Did anyone not Seaver

750
01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To seem like

751
01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:50.370
Jessica G: Yeah, I just told many times that I noticed those when they would mention it or they would like freak out.

752
01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're, you mentioned a spiritual thing. The girl on the bed or the kitchen floor is the spiritual thing.

753
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:01.020
Yeah.

754
01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have another way to describe that aside spiritual thing.

755
01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.320
Jessica G: Supernatural

756
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:29.880
Jessica G: Spirit to spirit.

757
01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever asked her what she wanted.

758
01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:36.870
Jessica G: No.

759
01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What would

760
01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Your spiritual belief system.

761
01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it interpret that she's still there doing that.

762
01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.430
Jessica G: Um,

763
01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:00.960
Jessica G: I don't know if she has unfinished business or that her soul stayed in this realm.

764
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:04.890
Jessica G: When I was supposed to travel.

765
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:09.090
Jessica G: Somewhere else she got stuck down here.

766
01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:26.760
Jessica G: Do you believe in all like in spirits and ghosts and stuff.

767
01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't typically share my my beliefs.

768
01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: We can talk a little bit about it. But one of the reasons why people don't get to hear a lot of stuff like kids family, blah, blah. Sort of. That's why there's no pictures can't see anything.

769
01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:43.470
Jessica G: Yeah.

770
01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get in the way, believe it or not.

771
01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you might start to see a limitation with us, and all of a sudden I can't trust because she has this. And then there's this different expectation

772
01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can still find a way to make it useful, though.

773
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what would it be like, Well, what do you think so far, like right now. Are you concerned.

774
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: About something I'm thinking

775
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:14.700
Jessica G: Yes, well not not not concerned.

776
01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:16.650
Jessica G: More like I'm

777
01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:18.060
Jessica G: Like

778
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:21.000
Jessica G: Like, gosh. Does that make me

779
01:29:22.110 --> 01:29:26.160
Jessica G: Does this mean that I'm like delusional or

780
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:28.530
Jessica G: Like you know

781
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.620
Jessica G: Oh, I see. Crazy.

782
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I I'm not sitting here thinking you're crazy.

783
01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.090
Okay.

784
01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:44.160
Jessica G: But, but am I know what does it mean that like I believe the knowledge that I guess is my question.

785
01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're going to get a fuzzy answer from me, but I'll give it to you. Nonetheless, okay.

786
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.050
Yeah.

787
01:29:56.070 --> 01:30:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I think what what's been useful is seeing

788
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether these beliefs are adaptive or not. So let's take the New World Order part

789
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how I was kind of putting things in its opposites.

790
01:30:13.230 --> 01:30:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's, it's, it's an opportunity to say

791
01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it working for you. So an example might be. I'm so afraid that I'll meet another

792
01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Ghost another soul. It stayed here in this realm. I'm so afraid that I

793
01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: won't leave my bedroom, go to the bathroom. Go to the hall, go to the kitchen. Watch. Right. I won't go outside will get a job won't let my child meet other children won't take him to the park on shop. So then you and I might be saying, hmm.

794
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this working and maybe changing the relationship with that fear with

795
01:30:56.370 --> 01:31:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: These, these spirits of the other realm, like changing the relationship with them so that you can function because I'm interested in functioning. I have no setup. About the only agenda that I have and I'm very transparent about it is a ground shame.

796
01:31:14.190 --> 01:31:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a really strong opinion about that one.

797
01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But other than that, I mean, I basically say that one's a troublemaker. That's the one that I've watched for so many years that fuels addictive behavior self-reproach depression.

798
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been so damaging to so many of my clients that I pretty much tell everybody. I don't. That's the one thing I don't like is Shane.

799
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I haven't seen it benefit anybody haven't seen it be adaptive for anyone. So other than that. I'm like,

800
01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it working for you.

801
01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:51.300
Or is it not working for you.

802
01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:53.880
Jessica G: Okay.

803
01:31:55.290 --> 01:32:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I just don't because everybody. I mean, think about how many different people have different spiritual beliefs, philosophical, some people don't identify at all their atheist or agnostic, or whatever. I mean,

804
01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I just want to know whether this is working for you or it's not. That's, that's really the only thing I just want to make sure that you're feeling supported

805
01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all.

806
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:21.210
Jessica G: So let me

807
01:32:25.890 --> 01:32:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, now this this part around the New World Order right

808
01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: This part around that the roaches represented dirty the dirty. One was what what caught my attention. The feeling invaded on caught my attention.

809
01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that makes you that's where that sadness was there was something about dirty and it coming in.

810
01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That may have something to do with that crying and that panic you described.

811
01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:07.080
Jessica G: Well, okay. So my room is always really really dirty like I could never keep it clean. And then also, my mom.

812
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:09.540
Jessica G: Was like a

813
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:23.640
Jessica G: Like a clean freak like the type don't wash the walls with bleach and she always wanted everything to be clean and she was always screaming, you know,

814
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:40.860
Jessica G: And now that I'm older. I understand why she did it. You know, and now I clean everything all the surface is everything where everybody touch in the door knob.

815
01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you share the same motivation for why you play in the same way.

816
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.710
Jessica G: I'm not sure.

817
01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:54.330
Jessica G: I don't know.

818
01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.660
Jessica G: What her motivation was, you know,

819
01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: She did it. I was just curious if you know what

820
01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:10.080
Jessica G: Well too cute to be clean, to be clean, to not have any like

821
01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:16.020
Jessica G: Infections in the house or anything like that. Any kind of flu.

822
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

823
01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Has that worked, has it. Do you think that that's kept the flow. Do you think that you're less

824
01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Prone to flu you there's been less frequency of slow

825
01:34:37.530 --> 01:34:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Terms when you sort of cross compare

826
01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:49.830
Jessica G: I think so. Yeah, I think so. My, my son has only gotten sick.

827
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:58.050
Jessica G: I would say two times and me, I get upper respiratory infections because I've eight

828
01:34:59.310 --> 01:35:07.170
Jessica G: Yeah. And so like the coil and the pin burns and it just, it's not good. I know it's not good for me.

829
01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.980
Jessica G: Like I'm planning on stopping

830
01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:15.750
Jessica G: I'm putting the intention out there.

831
01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.590
Jessica G: But other than that, like,

832
01:35:20.850 --> 01:35:22.620
Jessica G: We don't really get sick.

833
01:35:24.330 --> 01:35:39.900
Jessica G: We don't really get sick and my son is comfortable and you know he could roll around on the ground, he wants to. So I guess. Yeah. So as it works. It works. And then I feel

834
01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.280
Jessica G: What's the word I'm

835
01:35:48.330 --> 01:35:49.080
Jessica G: Productive

836
01:35:49.530 --> 01:35:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

837
01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:51.840
Jessica G: When I clean

838
01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:53.670
Jessica G: So,

839
01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:58.860
You

840
01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, even though it's your practice to keep things clean. There were bugs.

841
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway,

842
01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:09.810
Jessica G: Yeah.

843
01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:11.970
Jessica G: Yeah.

844
01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:13.770
Jessica G: There were

845
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything more to those funds because it got to cry. And for a while.

846
01:36:30.930 --> 01:36:36.360
Jessica G: I was just freaking out. I think it just triggered because I have that whole like

847
01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:50.760
Jessica G: Okay, so I had just got done watching the video I had just found out the schools were closing. You know, like all like everything was just hitting young ones and then I came downstairs.

848
01:36:53.490 --> 01:37:07.710
Jessica G: I turned on the kitchen. My and then like I seen it getting by. And I stopped there I killed it right away. And then, so I turned over here. This way I have met some food on the stove.

849
01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:23.040
Jessica G: And less like some food there. But we had just eight we had to say earlier. So this was like an afternoon and I had it cleaned it up yet. So it was so I seem like another little one scattered

850
01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:26.490
Jessica G: And then, um,

851
01:37:29.190 --> 01:37:32.370
Jessica G: And then I seen another one like the same area.

852
01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:34.830
Jessica G: And so that's

853
01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:45.090
Jessica G: That's when like I felt like I needed my head started spinning and and I started freaking out. And I was like, I know.

854
01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And I guess what I'm trying to get out, see if you can figure out what that says about you just put a clean a clean and clean.

855
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a bug. There's a second one. That's the belief about you.

856
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think I am what

857
01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.920
Jessica G: I'm not a good mom.

858
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.610
Jessica G: Cuz I'm dirty cuz that's dirty.

859
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that seem like you just found that seems really true, like we just found what's underlying the reaction. Why the crying because then you have to sit with I'm not a good mom.

860
01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:29.820
Jessica G: Yeah.

861
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That seeming like that's at the heart of the

862
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.350
Jessica G: Soul. Okay.

863
01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And then of course you see yourself normally right wanting you you identify, I believe, quite strongly with

864
01:38:52.950 --> 01:39:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to be a good mom I work very hard to be a good mom right you're sacrificing a lot to be a good mom and it's in your face. You see something that doesn't match that got a bug.

865
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.140
Jessica G: Yeah.

866
01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: With a little bug has a lot of power, we'll

867
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a little bug try and look for snack.

868
01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:24.060
Jessica G: Yeah.

869
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But he doesn't

870
01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that opinion of himself. He's just

871
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:35.880
Looking for food.

872
01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean if you take it from the perspective of the book.

873
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: In fact, he's probably a little pissed off at you because you keep cleaning everything up.

874
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:58.020
Jessica G: Yeah.

875
01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, do you think that I'm being ridiculous.

876
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

877
01:40:07.290 --> 01:40:09.000
Jessica G: No, it's true.

878
01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But it wasn't at that time was it

879
01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:13.950
Jessica G: No.

880
01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:23.220
Jessica G: I don't really take that into consideration.

881
01:40:25.050 --> 01:40:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: What I wonder has. It has to do with the good enough stuff. What I wonder is, how else was your mother caregiver.

882
01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: A good mom.

883
01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:01.140
Jessica G: She worked really, really hard.

884
01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard work.

885
01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And how are you feeling right now what just happened.

886
01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see very much on until

887
01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just one of the problems with these things. So I don't know what's

888
01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming up. Is that what's what's going on. Yeah. Okay. All right. It

889
01:41:31.710 --> 01:41:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is sad, the emotion that's happening.

890
01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:38.640
Something else.

891
01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:41.490
Jessica G: Yeah, I think so.

892
01:41:51.810 --> 01:41:52.290
Okay.

893
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:56.100
Jessica G: Because you worked really hard.

894
01:41:58.290 --> 01:42:02.520
Jessica G: And I never appreciate it, that I only felt

895
01:42:03.690 --> 01:42:06.330
Jessica G: Only see now, I was always alone.

896
01:42:07.410 --> 01:42:09.150
Jessica G: Always by myself.

897
01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:20.730
Jessica G: And everything I learned how to do everything by myself. But because she was working so hard to cut a roof over our head.

898
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:24.780
Jessica G: You know, and then

899
01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:30.570
Jessica G: Like I felt like I didn't appreciate. She left

900
01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.330
Jessica G: She was never came back.

901
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

902
01:42:39.690 --> 01:42:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that, did I just hear you try to blame yourself.

903
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:58.470
Jessica G: Yeah, I guess not blame myself but just

904
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:02.820
Jessica G: Just I'm

905
01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.810
Jessica G: Just regret, like I regret.

906
01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:09.240
Jessica G: I regret.

907
01:43:10.530 --> 01:43:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well,

908
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanna, I want to protect you a little bit here. Okay, want to be careful because there's a lot of other perspectives to take

909
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Your mom had to work hard.

910
01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were left alone.

911
01:43:33.570 --> 01:43:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You needed her to be

912
01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:41.040
Jessica G: Yeah.

913
01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But you feel regret.

914
01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Is confusing, that that would be the approach.

915
01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:58.200
Jessica G: Yeah, I still regret, because I wasn't very nice to her and I blamed her a lot and night.

916
01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.220
Jessica G: I guess I just

917
01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:09.840
Jessica G: I don't

918
01:44:11.130 --> 01:44:13.230
Jessica G: Know what the word I'm looking for a

919
01:44:17.610 --> 01:44:19.410
Jessica G: I just judged her a lot

920
01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.130
Jessica G: Later.

921
01:44:24.450 --> 01:44:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see, let me see what's underneath this. See if you can finish this sentence I don't often leave

922
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Because of me.

923
01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I think she left because, see if you can say that sentence in your own way.

924
01:44:47.490 --> 01:44:48.750
Jessica G: I think she left because

925
01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.520
Jessica G: She wasn't happy here.

926
01:44:55.710 --> 01:44:56.160
Jessica G: She

927
01:44:58.350 --> 01:45:00.300
Jessica G: Didn't want to lose her boyfriend.

928
01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:03.540
Jessica G: He was seeing another woman.

929
01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and and how do you feel that under this hypothesis that she left

930
01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: To be with a boyfriend what emotion.

931
01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:24.270
Jessica G: At this point I just feel angry.

932
01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:25.590
Yeah.

933
01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:27.750
Jessica G: I used to be.

934
01:45:28.770 --> 01:45:34.710
Jessica G: Like for the longest time when I was like I was always

935
01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:52.380
Jessica G: I always told myself that I was okay with it because she was happy. And she did what was best for her. And as long as she was happy I was happy. And that was something that I found myself anytime, anyplace Brad ago

936
01:45:53.490 --> 01:45:54.930
Jessica G: I was found myself being

937
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:59.730
Jessica G: While she's happy and and that's okay you know

938
01:46:01.170 --> 01:46:03.420
Jessica G: We were very good kids to her.

939
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I see. Jessica, that's making me concerned again.

940
01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What does your behavior, have to do with your mother.

941
01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Leaving

942
01:46:21.210 --> 01:46:25.560
Jessica G: Well, I guess, whenever she left. I was already misener

943
01:46:26.850 --> 01:46:27.870
Jessica G: I was already

944
01:46:29.970 --> 01:46:30.450
Jessica G: Like

945
01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:34.560
Jessica G: Doing whatever I wanted to do.

946
01:46:36.150 --> 01:46:36.810
Jessica G: And then

947
01:46:41.670 --> 01:46:44.310
Jessica G: Like staying over at a boyfriend's house.

948
01:46:46.290 --> 01:46:50.520
Jessica G: Because by that time I had already started smoking heroin.

949
01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Jessica take a peek at me.

950
01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The reason why I keep directing the conversation is because my concern is that somehow you think thank your behavior has anything to do with her leaving

951
01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm concerned that you think it does.

952
01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It has nothing to do with it. Nothing.

953
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That rebellious teenager, the one that did her own thing survived a difficult environment survived.

954
01:47:39.810 --> 01:47:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Being alone when you needed her. And I'm not trying to say that being a single mother is easy, but you're skipping over an important part, which is the anger and the sadness and you're forgiving like almost too soon.

955
01:47:57.030 --> 01:48:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We got to first be pissed off, and you can be as pissed off as you wanted here, right, because you're missing the part that you were acting out right heroin, whatever you describe as I can remember the words you use, but, you know, going out and whatever.

956
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You are literally surviving Jessica.

957
01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what you needed was it good and

958
01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It would have been convenient if there was enough resource for your mom to be home and teach you

959
01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: How to cook, how to handle certain relationships, how to how to grow up. I wish he was there.

960
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You have every right to be mad. That's what the teenager got to do the teenager got to be pissed off.

961
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

962
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: But in here today. My concern how surgeon

963
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's somehow what you did or didn't do have anything to do with her leaving

964
01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It didn't

965
01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything that you're a little boy could do fish, you were to leave.

966
01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, you found it.

967
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: The truth may be uncomfortable about your mother's decision. But if we look at it right in the eye and we say, I just wouldn't make that same choice. Your mother. Not good, not bad. She made the decision.

968
01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That way, she knows how now. I haven't met her. She may be missing some skills around self love self efficacy and maybe she needed it through a man, I don't know. Sounds like it because I'm listening.

969
01:50:00.690 --> 01:50:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: But we have to say, What am I going to pretend like that's not real. Am I going to blame my client, I know I'm not and I keep hearing tiny, tiny, tiny sparks of it and I'm concerned, it was not your fault.

970
01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish she hadn't done it. But I also don't know I don't know what was going on. I have no idea.

971
01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But you blaming you, that right that I want to keep my eye on that concerns me

972
01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You were born.

973
01:50:42.570 --> 01:50:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: To do you her job right protect feed clothes right to be your mother, and it wasn't there. The way you needed it.

974
01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You have every right to be sad and angry and all those things.

975
01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And name it just what it is and then time pass and maybe then forgiveness, but maybe you forgave before

976
01:51:10.890 --> 01:51:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to be really pissed off and angry really grief because it's one of the things that you've identified in therapy that you wanted to understand why did she leave

977
01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:22.590
Yeah.

978
01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, as I say, it had nothing to do with you. Is there a part of you that doesn't believe me.

979
01:51:34.050 --> 01:51:34.560
Jessica G: I just

980
01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:40.590
Jessica G: I just know I just

981
01:51:47.730 --> 01:51:48.780
Jessica G: Yeah, I feel like

982
01:51:53.100 --> 01:52:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because it's intolerable for a little girl to have believed that a mother that you're blaming yourself because it's something you can control, sweetheart.

983
01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: We can control with this woman did it's unfathomable okay it's but it's not something you can control, you can't control those bugs coming in either retired.

984
01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but it's about helplessness. That's the theme here, we can't control it. So what do we do. We all do the same exact thing we do perfectionism, we do. I'm just going to beat myself up. I'm the problem we blame ourselves.

985
01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: When we can't control these things outside of ourselves.

986
01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We all do it. And yes, it all gets fancy with all these different stories, but most humans when we're tiny little people. The number coming up. We're growing up. We control what we can we blame ourselves.

987
01:52:57.870 --> 01:53:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We all do that if we don't have just the right parent right here about 30% of the time is about what good enough is statistically if they gotta get about 30% of the time.

988
01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't have to be perfect and neither do you. Okay, but about 30% so but if this parent if this caregiver doesn't say back to you, baby girl.

989
01:53:19.410 --> 01:53:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: My leaving has nothing to do with you, baby girl. This has nothing to do with your smoking weed having sex going out whatever I don't even know what the things are. If you don't have a parent saying it to you and showing you this has nothing to do with you.

990
01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You're left with having to answer.

991
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And most people

992
01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: They either get mad and say, how could you. How could you or they turn it in.

993
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And they say I did something I wasn't enough. If only I had maybe she wouldn't have left.

994
01:54:02.250 --> 01:54:03.240
Had nothing to do with you.

995
01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.090
Jessica G: Well, she said.

996
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:08.730
Jessica G: To her life was help

997
01:54:10.650 --> 01:54:12.390
Jessica G: With how miserable.

998
01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's her problem to work out darlin

999
01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Not yours you you received the fallout from that.

1000
01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And it has this effect this hurt because it looks hurt. I know you say anchor for to look hurt and sad.

1001
01:54:35.670 --> 01:54:47.490
Jessica G: Yeah, sure. I was like this little girl. This little girl that she you know is raising loving she's there with her. And I'm just like,

1002
01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh I be so hurt.

1003
01:55:00.690 --> 01:55:07.170
Jessica G: Like, it's not the little girls. Well, like, don't get me wrong, and she's helping her be

1004
01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:10.770
Jessica G: Not being in a situation

1005
01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:18.780
Jessica G: that otherwise would be kind of messed up or not ideal, I guess, but

1006
01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't, don't worry about her. I want to know how you feel robbed.

1007
01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.280
Jessica G: Because that's happening.

1008
01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't get it this other person gets it. You don't have to make excuses for the little girl I of course she's just as innocent as you are as your son is

1009
01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This is about you sitting with your feelings.

1010
01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You've missed out on an opportunity to feel them.

1011
01:55:56.070 --> 01:56:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And to express them in a direct way we can at least for now least talk about what's real in here.

1012
01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a little bit more about the anchor.

1013
01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.350
Jessica G: Baby

1014
01:56:13.950 --> 01:56:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh god.

1015
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I just realized what time it was maybe

1016
01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a little like open up that can of worms.

1017
01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.670
Jessica G: We'll just put it in the box.

1018
01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, put anger in the box, stick it in there and we'll bring it out later. So just make a little, a little moment here for yourself around what you noticed that came up for you. That was important for you.

1019
01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:44.130
Jessica G: There. I've never even admitted to myself first it out loud before

1020
01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the thing needed to be said, what's the thing you hadn't said before.

1021
01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:51.330
Jessica G: I love it.

1022
01:56:53.370 --> 01:56:55.440

Jessica G: It was nice. It was

1027
01:57:25.590 --> 01:57:26.760
Jessica G: Made me feel

1028
01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.520
Jessica G: okay with being hurt.

1029
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:38.760
Jessica G: okay with being added in, like I was in wrong for having emotion.
