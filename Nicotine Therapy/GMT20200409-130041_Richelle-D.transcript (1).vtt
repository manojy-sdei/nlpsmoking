Richelle Direny: Because it was hard.

83
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.660
Richelle Direny: And I'm sure it was hard when he was

84
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:42.300
Richelle Direny: Going through treatment and everything and to see him in pain, how much that was for you to watch him go through all of that and not being able to

85
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.080
Me and

119
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:22.980
Richelle Direny: That can help you to get away, and it's okay if you cry if you wake up in the morning and there was something that if it's sitting in drinking a cup of coffee together in the mornings, even when

120
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:34.740
Richelle Direny: You know, coming up to the end, if that was something that you guys enjoyed, you know, just still just remember that and, you know, just remember those memories and just continue

121
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:49.200
Richelle Direny: You know, it is your new normal. And it's going to go on for some time and it's okay, it's okay. The question is, you know, you don't. Well, not the question. It's you continuing

122
00:12:50.820 --> 00:13:03.510
Richelle Direny: You know, to carry on his memories and the things that maybe dreams or aspirations, or whatever that he had is to continue carrying it on with your grandchildren and with your children and continuing to do what you need to just live

123
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:17.940
Richelle Direny: But it is hard if you if you get up every morning and you know you want to cry for, you know, it's a season season for everything. If you want to cry for a little while. It's okay to cry. If you want a nasty cry. It's okay.

124

00:13:42.720 --> 00:14:00.660
Richelle Direny: Unit. Okay, I give you the permission, I write the prescription. If you want a nasty cry for the next week because for 37 years of your life you have spent it with him and you were there with him right up until the end, it is okay. It is a part of the healing process. It is

130
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.690
Richelle Direny: OH, OKAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU IN THE HOUSE AND YOU WANT TO TALK TO HIM. It is OK.

131
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:15.180
Richelle Direny: You don't care what any adult do not put in your mind, what are people going to think if they walk in this House and hear me talking to him.

132
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:28.350
Richelle Direny: Don't worry about that because sometimes that puts added stress and pressure on us because we're wondering how people are going to think and what they're going to say, or are they going to think I'm Kurt. If you want to talk to him.

133
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.290
Richelle Direny: If you as you making this coffee and you. What was his name.

Richelle Direny: Oh, it looks like Leroy. I got this room new coffee and it's it's it's tippy top or if you want to do that. It is OK if it's what helps you to get through that moment, if it's what helps you to get through that heartbreak in that moment, it is ok.

137
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:12.300
Richelle Direny: That is your, is your means of healing. It is not mine. It is not your son's, it is not anybody else's. It is your means of healing, because for 37 years

138
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:18.720
Richelle Direny: You have had him. You guys have had ups and downs, you have had arguments. You've had last tours.

139
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:31.080
Richelle Direny: You probably said in them 37 years like if he say one more thing to me, I'm a gather up these kids and i'ma leave him because he getting on my God. But if that's what it is for 37 years you did that, it is okay.

140
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.450
Richelle Direny: I think you froze.

141
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.770
Rhonda Shears: Yeah.

142
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.120
Richelle Direny: Now, yeah, or you're back now.

143
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.590
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you're back.

144
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:48.750
Richelle Direny: So think about it for 37 years now. It's been a year since he's not you haven't. If you've been married for 37 years. How long have you guys been together.

145
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.680
Rhonda Shears: And they're

146
00:15:53.160 --> 00:16:01.650
Richelle Direny: 3830. Okay, so for 38 so what, a year into knowing him. You guys got married.

147
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:03.510
Richelle Direny: Yes.

148
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.790
Richelle Direny: So yeah, that's fine. So

149
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.580
Richelle Direny: Um, and after

150
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:10.380
Richelle Direny: You've

151
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:21.810
Richelle Direny: told him about the cup of coffee, whether it's good or it's bad. After you've cried you've released that pain that you're feeling in that moment.

152
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:31.680
Richelle Direny: After you've done that you could just say to him, but I know know you Leroy as much as I love you and I miss you. I know you're no longer in pain.

153
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.950
Richelle Direny: I know you're no longer suffering.

154
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:41.040
Richelle Direny: And I get comfort in knowing that you're no longer in pain and you're no longer suffering.

155
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:43.950
Rhonda Shears: Okay.

156
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.700
Rhonda Shears: Okay, I'm gonna try that and say,

157
00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.200
Rhonda Shears: Just

158
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.970
Rhonda Shears: After you have done.

159
00:16:51.570 --> 00:17:02.580
Richelle Direny: It just just wholeheartedly if you cry if you do all of that, because part of it you know selfishly, we want a person to be here with us.

160
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:12.960
Richelle Direny: selfishly, you don't want them to ever leave. But then, you know, there's that part. Because like you said we there's that part of you that said

161
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:19.500
Richelle Direny: But then I know he's not in pain anymore. I know that he's not, you know, suffering.

162
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:30.180
Richelle Direny: Before the end he didn't even remember who we were, because of the the the cancer of how much it was impacting him and that piece alone.

163
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:39.240
Richelle Direny: I'm sure is hard because you see him, you're talking to him, but he because of the illness and what it was doing to him. He what he didn't know who you were.

164
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:40.920
Rhonda Shears: Yeah.

165
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.330
Richelle Direny: And I'm sure the MIT. The first time he did that, what, how was that for you. The first time he didn't recognize who you were.

166
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.440
Rhonda Shears: Hard real hard.

167
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.350
Rhonda Shears: Real hard and

168
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:07.980
Rhonda Shears: I kicked out where I'm at here just pass that that maybe it's just something that it was a matter intake and some of the medicine that now underdog labor.

169
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:18.420
Richelle Direny: And so the doctor told you that it was because of what the cancer was doing and the liver. It made me forget you.

170
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.520
Richelle Direny: So,

171
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:29.700
Richelle Direny: Knowing you know so basically you're grieving started when he you were standing there.

172
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:37.140
Richelle Direny: The woman who is married him who's lived with him for 30 something years who bore two children for him.

173
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:52.290
Richelle Direny: And knowing that this individual is sitting in front of me and have no clue who I am, has no clue who is and every single day throughout the day. That was your reality and it was your new normal.

174
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.250
Richelle Direny: Now his physical body is no longer here with you.

175
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:11.730
Richelle Direny: So even though you cry and even though you're grieving that will go on for some time. It's like I said, there's no no one can tell you after five years, you should be done with this. No, because 30 set for 38 years

176
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.140
Richelle Direny: You've known this person.

177
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:24.270
Richelle Direny: So how can I now forget their very existence, after a year or two or three or four when I've known this person for so many years.

178
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.220
Richelle Direny: Your. Can you hear me because I know you're okay.

179
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.840
Rhonda Shears: Yeah, I can hear you.

180
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:39.030
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you know it's okay to go through all of this. But again, when it's all said and done, to kind of

181
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.610
Richelle Direny: kickstart or go through your day. It's just reminding yourself.

182
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:55.740
Richelle Direny: Leroy. I know I love you and I would love, I would have loved you to be here with me for us to continue making memories. But now I know

183
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.880
Richelle Direny: You're no longer in pain, you're no longer suffering, you're no longer

184
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.380
Richelle Direny: Having to deal with the treasuries of this world.

185
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.670
Richelle Direny: I would have loved for you to be with me.

186
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:25.680
Richelle Direny: And you know, you understand what I'm saying. When I even use the word selfishly, I know selfishly, I would want you here with me for us to go through it all together as we did in the years past, but I know

187
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:39.960
Richelle Direny: Physically, the pain you're no longer in because watching him in that pain, watching him if he was in pain, and it was overwhelming and intense for him and knowing there's not much you could do for him with your physical self.

188
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:55.440
Richelle Direny: You know that he's no longer doing that. So, you know, I would recommend just try doing that, um, you know, just try doing that for a few days and then the next time that we meet again you could tell me what was that like

189
00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.790
Richelle Direny: When you, when you did that. How did you feel, how did they help to

190
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:11.310
Richelle Direny: How did it help you get through the moment as it came and how did you get through your day. Okay.

191
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.450
Okay.

192
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.250
Okay.

193
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:17.790
Richelle Direny: Now,

194
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.050

200
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.160

323
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:40.770
Richelle Direny: Your groups at 12 o'clock. So yeah, it's definitely recommended that you sign in, like maybe 2030 to 20 to 30 minutes prior because I know that they have a lot of traffic going into virtual clinic and that you can you can get Simon that way. Okay, so, um,

324
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:47.220
Richelle Direny: Yeah, so that's kind of how we'll do it. I am going to so since this

325
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.390
Richelle Direny: Let me see what they have you registered here as well.

326
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:35.130
Richelle Direny: And now you weren't having any thoughts. I know, yesterday you denied you don't have any thoughts of self harm or anything like that. Do you

327
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:40.110
Richelle Direny: Now know you don't have any history of any thoughts of that nature.

328
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.520
Rhonda Shears: No, no.

329
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:53.100
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay. And, you know, one. And like I said, just like how you called in yesterday, and you kind of need that extra support because you were just having a really hard time, you can always do that. You just just call in

330
00:38:54.630 --> 00:39:06.870
Richelle Direny: And, you know, just ask for a session and I'll look at my calendar and just let them know you know and then we can just meet just the way we do it doesn't even have to be a long session. It's just like just to have that added support. Okay.

331
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:18.360
Richelle Direny: Okay, so what we'll do is, like I said, next week, but we'll have our regular intake appointments session at nine o'clock, where I'm just going over your history and everything else. Okay.

332
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.590
Richelle Direny: Okay, do you arm and how are you feeling

333
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.730
Richelle Direny: Now, I was saying, How are you feeling, how are you

334
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.700
Rhonda Shears: I feel good.

335
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:45.390
Richelle Direny: And if you know if find that if you find that you're having like a whole lot of trouble. Even with sleeping and, you know, you can always talk to Dr. Davis and about that.

336
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:55.320
Richelle Direny: You know, just talk to her, and she kind of hold to her own assessment to see if there's anything for you to help you with some sleep because that's another thing.

337
00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:09.330
Richelle Direny: Another stressor can even come up is limited sleep not getting enough sleep, and I know, like I said, it's one thing to, you know, be going through the grief and loss like you're doing now. It's another

338
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:19.710
Richelle Direny: Because of the fact that we're quarantine and I hear a whole lot of people who are introverts is what they call it, they like to be home. They like to stay isolated.

339
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:33.540
Richelle Direny: They said that now it's like now that you're told that you can't leave the house. It's a problem. So now, especially for you that your, your home, you really can't leave and you're having to stay connected with your family with via

340
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:45.030
Richelle Direny: Via whether it's FaceTime, or this this platform. Sometimes it feels like you know another loss like something else has been taken away from you.

341
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:51.450
Richelle Direny: But just know that you know just continue doing it. It's not going to last very long.

342
00:40:52.020 --> 00:41:01.500
Richelle Direny: You just find different creative ways because when it's all said and done, they're also protecting you. Because I know that they say you know there's different population and

343
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:22.350
Richelle Direny: That, you know, especially being an older person if for you. It could be a little bit more detrimental to you, then it could be for your son, his their wives or their, their children. So it's just you know they're protecting you because they want to continue making memories with you.

344
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:24.210
Rhonda Shears: Yes.

345
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:38.580
Richelle Direny: Okay, so what is something that when we meet in a week. What is something that you're going to try each day to help you to get through each day as you get you continue to adjust to your new normal. What is something that I recommended that you do.

346
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:40.950
Rhonda Shears: Have a good crack

347
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:56.040
Richelle Direny: Have a good cry. And if you want to just talk to him and do it if it makes if it's something that helps you to get through that. Whatever helps you to get through that moment.

348
00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:08.040
Richelle Direny: You know that's healthy and it's authentic and it's, you know, have a good cry. And if you add the end of the cry and you know you finish just say, you know,

349
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.380
Richelle Direny: I am

350
00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:20.550
Richelle Direny: You know, I miss you. I really do miss you. I miss that we're not going to be able to make new memories, but I

351
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.390
Richelle Direny: happy that you're no longer in pain.

352
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:38.130
Richelle Direny: You're not having gone. He's you're not happy. And you have to tell yourself you're you're helping yourself. It's not that you're happy that he's no longer here. You're happy that he's no longer suffering.

353
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:46.980
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's it. You're just you're happy he's no longer suffering and because it is even if he continued.

354
00:42:48.420 --> 00:43:01.740
Richelle Direny: And I think the hardest part. And I've seen this. The hardest part is having someone there with you that you're helping that you have all these memories with you've built on life with but they look at you and they have no clue who you are.

355
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:17.250
Richelle Direny: That is understand that is the hardest part is knowing I'm looking at you. It's like you are my mother, you've done this for me. But you look at me in your life. Get away. I don't know who you are, that by itself is hard.

356
00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:19.140
Rhonda Shears: Yeah.

357
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:20.460
So,

358
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:39.060
Richelle Direny: Just, just just have a good cry and just say, you know, I miss you, but I'm happy that you're no longer in pain, you're no longer suffering. Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, if you don't have any other questions or anything like that. Like I said, you can always reach out and going to be here.

359
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:49.050
Rhonda Shears: And can you and are you able to look and see if she caught my medicine in yesterday accident or whatever.

360
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.410
Rhonda Shears: There was two prescriptions.

361
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:55.740
Richelle Direny: Okay, hold on.

362
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.980
Richelle Direny: I can see

363
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.070
Richelle Direny: You said yesterday, right.

364
00:44:46.050 --> 00:45:03.840
Richelle Direny: I don't think I'll send what I'll do is I'll send her a message because I don't think it's what they do is when you're when she's speaking to you. I think she does it right then in there, she sends it in. So I'll send her a message, just to confirm that they did. Okay.

365
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.640
Richelle Direny: And if she did, um, Let me confirm your phone number that I have here on file for you.

368
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:39.870
Richelle Direny: And so, and that's that's the same number, that if you like. If you need that extra support you need a session or what have you.

Richelle Direny: Right, and it is nice to explore

401
00:48:52.350 --> 00:49:10.320
Richelle Direny: So the other day I i because we have been like a my family. We've been home. Well, they've been home longer than me. I just recently started working from home. So they've been home a little bit longer. They've been home over a month now especially my children. And so the other day.

402
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.010
Richelle Direny: The other day I asked.

403
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:25.620
Richelle Direny: I said, oh, you know, I thought is looking real beautiful because like you know here in Florida, especially, it's, it's, for the most part it's very sunny.

409
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.260
Richelle Direny: And I said, Let's go take a walk.

410
00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:19.950
Richelle Direny: Around the community. Let's go take a walk and it was nice. I mean, like I said, I said look gorgeous. But until you go out there, realize how hard it is

411
00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:36.630
Richelle Direny: It was gorgeous but. And so here, because of the quarantine they closed down pretty much all like the recreational areas the parks that everything. So you really truly can all you could do is just really walk or ride a bicycle. If you have a bicycle.

412
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.450
Richelle Direny: We did that. And so, you know,

413
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:56.280
Richelle Direny: You know, my little one says, oh, let's go and get yesterday, I want to go to the park. So then I had to be the bearer of bad news and say, well, the park is called honey. We can't go to the park can't do anything. So this is where being home.

414
00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:05.220
Richelle Direny: You have to you, you find creative ways to entertain everyone or you decide

415
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:11.070
Richelle Direny: Go watch TV. Watch your tablet. Look at the phone to something. Just leave me alone.

416
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.870
Gerald Ford: Oh,

417
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:16.230
Richelle Direny: That's just kind of how but you have to find a way

418
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.740
Richelle Direny: To get through it. You said you live with your mom now right

419
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:20.640
And look,

420
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:28.710
Gerald Ford: For us right now. Right now I'm bashing and DAYTON WAS AT MY GIRLFRIEND.

421
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.400
Gerald Ford: So we've been together since we've been 14

422
00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:33.450
Richelle Direny: So,

423
00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.640
Gerald Ford: Like 30 some years.

424
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.410
I met your girlfriend.

425
00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.160
Gerald Ford: I mean, we've been nice.

426
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:44.550
Gerald Ford: Yeah, we never met apart.

427
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.580
Gerald Ford: 25 and essentially for

428
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.350
Richelle Direny: You guys have the both of them together both it is with your girlfriend.

429
00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.300
Richelle Direny: Of 30 some years, yes.

430
00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:54.900
Richelle Direny: Awesome.

431
00:51:55.890 --> 00:52:06.150
Gerald Ford: And, um, I actually, you know, I haven't cheated on my girlfriend since I've been like 20 years old, you know, and I'm a little person, you know, and

432
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:16.230
Gerald Ford: I DON'T KNOW. I JUST BEEN NO I trying to go to my mom's to, you know, when I when I get really worried about

433
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:43.170
Gerald Ford: You know, getting them bad thoughts, you know, and plus my mom is like, ah, so you know, I want to spend, you know, as much time with her as possible because you know this last year, you know, she can really start to see, you know, it's hard for me. I mean, I feel bad because, you know, I get that.

434
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:52.020
Gerald Ford: You know, aggravated, you know, because the sun, the silly questions. You know, I'm not thinking you know about her age.

435
00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:58.440
Gerald Ford: I was like, Mom, you know, when I feel bad about that, you know, like later on.

436
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:05.430
Gerald Ford: Now she does. Good Friday eight but she has a brain tumor.

437
00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:06.780
Gerald Ford: And

438
00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:08.940
Gerald Ford: Yeah.

439
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:28.560
Richelle Direny: I mean, and you know what, I think it this time. It does forces, it forces all of us to not just look at take an introspective look at ourselves.

440
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:40.830
Richelle Direny: But I'm just at everything. And you know, I thought about like when you when you're talking in group. And I thought about, like I said I was going to go and just kind of Google for you, like when we talked about

441
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:47.850
Richelle Direny: You know, separate Celebrate Recovery because now, especially with the quarantine. A lot of that stuff. I know here in Florida.

442
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:53.850
Richelle Direny: A lot of that stuff is online on you know people who have had Celebrate Recovery groups.

443
00:53:54.420 --> 00:54:08.460
Richelle Direny: The church that I go to. They have Celebrate Recovery groups where their group of men that would meet, but now they have shifted to like an online platform. And then I'm sure that's you know will be helpful. So it's for you to get connected with

444
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:23.640
Richelle Direny: Church organization or whatever, whatever, you know, feels like you feel like that will meet your need to be able to get that additional support therapy is one thing because therapy really just kind of gets to the root of

445
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:30.330
Richelle Direny: Or substance abuse counseling, if you will, gets to the root of what

446
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:37.770
Richelle Direny: What are your stressors. What are the things that are going on within you. Those unresolved issues.

447
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:50.880
Richelle Direny: Those things that you've lost control of those things that you're still carrying with you from the past that makes you use, whether it's drinking, whether it's your if you have a heroin addiction.

448
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:58.290
Richelle Direny: alcohol addiction pill addiction, whatever it is, whatever it is, those unresolved things from your past or from your yesterday.

449
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:20.100
Richelle Direny: That makes you use these other chemical substances or entities to help you suppress those things that wants to get resolved that wants to leave you, but you suppress it with these outside, you know, substances. That's what counseling will do

450
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:31.080
Richelle Direny: You know Celebrate Recovery and being a part of a group, it helps you as well. But it helps you a lot more within that moment of getting through.

451
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:42.720
Richelle Direny: individual counseling does too. But I kind of take that approach of, you know, not allowing your yesterday, being able to acknowledge that yesterday did happen.

452
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:47.340
Richelle Direny: You are a part of all of the events of yesterday.

453
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:49.770
Richelle Direny: But how can you

454
00:55:50.880 --> 00:56:03.810
Richelle Direny: Be aware of it, know that it did happen, but not allow yesterday to have such a great impact on your today not counseling allows you to

455
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:09.000
Richelle Direny: Be aware and acknowledge and learn from your yesterday.

456
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:27.480
Richelle Direny: But not make the same decisions yesterday, today, that's what counseling, does it keeps you in the aware. It keeps you in the know. It keeps you in the understanding and learning identifying those tools to help you to get through it all.

457
00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:34.290
Richelle Direny: Celebrate Recovery. It is definitely from more of a

458
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:41.190
Richelle Direny: Tree. Celebrate Recovery as I know it takes more of a Christian perspective.

459
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.990
Richelle Direny: A more

460
00:56:45.930 --> 00:57:04.980
Richelle Direny: Godly spiritual angle of being able to get and which is where, you know, even in my reading, which is where the foundation of a lot of those these anonymous programs like alcohol anonymous. That's where the foundation of it came from. I know that a lot of like, you know, a lot of

461
00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.260
Richelle Direny: People have kind of come away from

462
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.530
Richelle Direny: The foundation of what it was founded on

463
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:25.530
Richelle Direny: The belief, people have come away from that and kind of, it's been convoluted watered down and kind of taken to suit them in the way they wanted to. So it's kind of like it's kind of like want to charge and saying, God, You've been invited here, you know, that's

464
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.760
Gerald Ford: Right, right.

465
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.760
Gerald Ford: Right. It's crazy. It is draining just

466
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.440
Richelle Direny: Like how do you go to church and be like God. You can't come can't come. It's my house.

467
00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:36.810
Gerald Ford: Like

468
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:44.760
Gerald Ford: On person that says you know where we don't talk about that. But I mean, right in the same you know

469
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:57.000
Richelle Direny: It is, it is. But hey, you know, it's what makes people feel good in the moment, but it's only in the moment, if you want it long term. You got to kind of allow him to come back to his own house.

470
00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:05.850
Richelle Direny: So it's, it's, it's the that's what it was founded upon so Celebrate Recovery kind of holds that truth.

471
00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:16.290
Richelle Direny: And allows you to walk daily in that truth that this is your wound. It is your scar. It is what it is.

472
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:30.570
Richelle Direny: But what are you going to do. Are you going to live according to the law of this car, or how you got this car, or are you going to learn from it and using these Celebrate Recovery says using these biblical perspective.

473
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:35.400
Richelle Direny: To help you to get through each

474
00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:46.440
Richelle Direny: Moment of your day or just get through each day and just understanding that, and I know that that's a little bit of what you touched upon in group, the other day.

475
00:58:48.240 --> 00:59:02.850
Richelle Direny: About finding your truth and walking in your truth and helping you to get through those urges of wanting to use or those memories of the losses that you've had, and all the things that you've you've gone through

476
00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.350
Richelle Direny: They've happened. You can't

477
00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:14.190
Richelle Direny: Do anything to change it. But you can definitely learn from it. It's happened and you've used

478
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:24.660
Richelle Direny: Different chemicals to help you get through it because that's what in that moment, that's what you thought was best. That's what the world told you

479
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.160
Richelle Direny: It was okay for you to do it. Um,

480
00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:30.900
Richelle Direny: But when they tell you

481
00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:40.620
Richelle Direny: You can use these things to get through these hard times what they didn't tell you was all of the things you're going to lose in the process.

482
00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:42.450
Richelle Direny: All

483
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:50.310
Richelle Direny: The losses, you were going to encounter in the process. It didn't tell you that it and tell you that

484
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:58.500
Richelle Direny: You're gonna your wound is going to be real deep and that the healing process is going

485
00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:08.400
Richelle Direny: To be hard in tell you that it just told you it's okay. You can do this. You can see that it's okay I you could get through it somehow. But they can tell you

486
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:17.010
Richelle Direny: That maybe you, you're going to be involved with the law is it didn't tell you all the things that was going to come after it didn't tell you that

487
01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:19.800
Gerald Ford: Right consequences or their

488
01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.360
Richelle Direny: Entire you know the consequences will tell you know

489
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.070
Gerald Ford: Still there.

490
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:32.340
Richelle Direny: They're still there. There are there, you're going to get through them. Um,

491
01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:42.570
Richelle Direny: They're all they're going to be daily reminders, but you can't. It's learning to not allow it to be your shackle

492
01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:45.900
Richelle Direny: You understand

493
01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:49.800
Richelle Direny: You can allow your yesterday to be your

494
01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:55.680
Richelle Direny: Your cuffs. Your handcuffs. The ones that that ties are your hands and feet down

495
01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:09.510
Gerald Ford: And that's where I'm kind of start to, you know, I'm still. I mean, I'm really a sociable person and you know that's where if I'm not at work, you know, that's why I'm

496
01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:30.360
Gerald Ford: You know, on time. I need, I need to meet people, you know, to start out learning to live again, you know, without now without somebody saying we need to know. Yeah, before we do this or maybe taking it myself.

497
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.140
Gerald Ford: That because before you know

498
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:46.890
Gerald Ford: just waking up, you know, you just want to, you know, said just just do what, you know, you know, that's all I want to learn. No, that's just

499
01:01:47.430 --> 01:02:01.680
Gerald Ford: From being around the same very few people, you know, which I don't blame nobody for that but myself because I didn't want to be around what I was around. I wouldn't be around it, you know.

500
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:21.300
Gerald Ford: That's what you know I need said to branch out more and get more uncomfortable so I can get comfortable. No was talking to people and you know it is more so open, you know,

501
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.210
Gerald Ford: And, and, you know, admit

502
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:27.570
Gerald Ford: Admit some these stones, you know,

503
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:28.800
And

504
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.260
Yeah.

505
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.210
Gerald Ford: And I've learned

506
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:53.820
Gerald Ford: Last year to just about the group's know this know talking to somebody that understands the game, you know, instead of, you know, like, like your family, the people that know they care about you and stuff. They don't understand, you know,

507
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:56.910
Gerald Ford: You know the

508
01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:09.570
Gerald Ford: The guilt and know just different kinds of pain know just just saying no. I mean, for me, it makes me feel weak.

509
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:12.810
Gerald Ford: I

510
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:21.690
Richelle Direny: It's in. So as you're saying it you so it's a matter of perspective with everyone. It's that

511
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.570
Richelle Direny: You know, it's kind of

512
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:36.360
Richelle Direny: You know, there's a saying there's there's no sin, greater small all sin is the same. And you think, well, how is our murder or the same as a

513
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:55.650
Richelle Direny: Are rapists. Like, how dare you say that, like that's worse than that one. No it no sin is great off everything wrong is wrong no matter how you want to, but I think we find ways to comfort ourselves to say well mines is not as bad as yours. We find that as comfort and so

514
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.420
Richelle Direny: You

515
01:03:58.650 --> 01:04:00.360
Richelle Direny: I think once we understand

516
01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:03.240
Richelle Direny: The concept of

517
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:25.140
Richelle Direny: If I am a liar, it's viewed and it has the same weight as you who is, if, if, as soon as the same right if I'm a liar and you're just the an addict if from a godly perspective, I look at both of them as if God says, Well, they're both equal

518
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.350
Richelle Direny: Once we understand. I can't look at you.

519
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:38.730
Richelle Direny: With any kind of condemnation. I can't look at you and judge you. I can't look at you and do any of that because it says, both are equal.

520
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:48.480
Richelle Direny: So then therefore whatever guilt, you're feeling I should feel that same guilt because they're both wrong. You understand what I'm saying.

521
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.250
Richelle Direny: But I think we that

522
01:04:50.340 --> 01:05:03.390
Richelle Direny: We don't look at things like that. I look at it as you're you're an attic and I'm just a liar. So my thing is not as bad as you know know they're all of them is bad. All of them is bad.

523
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.550
Richelle Direny: Well, not to say all of them is bad if if

524
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.010
The consequence.

525
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:32.430
Richelle Direny: At the end is death. If we look at it like that. The consequence of a liar, a drug addict a thief, a murderer. If all of us though the the crime is different, what the consequence is death then

526
01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:48.570
Richelle Direny: My insecurities my guilt. My all of it should be the same. I should. Boy, you're added out on a liar. But they said that we both go into the consequences is still the same. You feel bad. Don't feel bad. I feel bad.

527
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:56.310
Richelle Direny: If we start aligning them to look at everything is the same. I won't be so I'm not going to

528
01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:07.080
Richelle Direny: I'm not going to feel so bad. If I understand that everything is it's like it's everything is equal. You understand, but I don't think that

529
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:20.400
Richelle Direny: We look at, we're not trained to think of things like that. We're not trained to look at life like that. And so therefore we all go into our individual isolation and self pity and we

530
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:38.850
Richelle Direny: are our own worst enemy, simply because it's everything is viewed that my thing is bad. And if anybody finds out that I'm an addict, then they're going to do this and they're going to say this and they're going to do that. And, but if I look at myself as I'm a liar.

531
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:52.020
Richelle Direny: And you know, I lied about this and I love it. But if I look at it ultimately how my creator looks at all of it. It's the same. And if my creative says all of you can ask for forgiveness and you will be forgiven.

532
01:06:52.920 --> 01:07:06.120

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:42.030
Richelle Direny: And get through each small term goals successfully in order to get to that long term goal.

654
01:20:49.680 --> 01:21:01.230
Richelle Direny: I don't want to say impulsivity. I don't want to say that, but it's like so you use work to help distract you. You use work to keep your mind on something to distract you to keep you busy.

655
01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:09.840
Richelle Direny: This is how long have you just this kind of life of a

656
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:19.620
Richelle Direny: Addiction. When would you start when would you say honestly and. And when I say honestly anytime you ever hear anytime we're meeting and I say honestly

659
01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:55.230
Gerald Ford: We'll see.

660
01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:09.570
Gerald Ford: I struggle with, you know, that a man because before I, you know, not so my brothers and stuff was older than me as far back as I can remember from like

Gerald Ford: Six or seven. You know, I remember my brothers know bone weed smoke in my face, you know, giving me

662
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:30.060
Gerald Ford: Shotguns know and send those over there. And then, you know, was the 80s now so

663
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:31.980
Gerald Ford: They grew up in the set.

664
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:50.850
Richelle Direny: You've been exposed from a child. But when did you develop. So your addiction started when you develop your a dependency on it when it became depends when you became dependent is when you couldn't get through your day without

665
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:59.520
Richelle Direny: Doing something like if you will copy, you have to do this, like, when did you develop your dependency on it, not when your

666
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:16.410
Richelle Direny: Goals, but your dependency when you said to wake up, I need this, I need to do this and you're you're constantly chasing this high this feeling of numbness or this out of whatever it is that you were using it for. When did you develop that

667
01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:18.090
Gerald Ford: When did that thought.

668
01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.550

670
01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:43.530
Gerald Ford: You know, since I was young, you know, but there was never a problem for me.

671
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:45.690
Richelle Direny: I actually

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:51.210
Gerald Ford: I actually got into like when I was

673
01:23:53.010 --> 01:23:53.580
Almost like

674
01:23:56.550 --> 01:24:07.560
Gerald Ford: Me, My friend and I joke more drunk out whole world was 21 and I ever did after I was 20 anyway. Me and my friends.

675
01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.170
Gerald Ford: Was drinking one night.

676
01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.130
In and

677
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.040
Gerald Ford: I was to talk to take them home. So we all walk

678
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:19.410
Gerald Ford: We all walk

679
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:29.130
Gerald Ford: In our neighborhood. You know, there's a lot of fighting. No, no man anyway.

680
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:35.400
Gerald Ford: Right, we just gave her banner. I was walking with my friends home.

681
01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:40.290
Gerald Ford: Welcome home in those, you know, if I were

682
01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:50.400
Gerald Ford: A mile and a half away from me. But we welcome. Oh, man, we got so big site one night and

683
01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:54.630
Gerald Ford: I got time probation for this fight.

684
01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.010
Gerald Ford: And

685
01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:02.430
Gerald Ford: It was actually you know we was walking around just flat box and then and

686
01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:21.150
Gerald Ford: Then happen to be like a birthday party going on two houses in a row. So they all came outside or like six of us to house full of people come out and like six of us, you know, and I mean it was just

687
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:23.880
Gerald Ford: You know, like

688
01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.340
Gerald Ford: How many people are get

689
01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.940
Gerald Ford: Against four or five. Anyway, I got

690
01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:32.700
Gerald Ford: on probation for that and

691
01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:42.390
Gerald Ford: Actually they put me in an outpatient program for for smoking weed and

692
01:25:45.150 --> 01:25:57.330
Gerald Ford: I mean, I found out, then the know was hard for me to put down the week. But I mean, again, and never cause problems for me in my life. Until then,

693
01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:04.620
Gerald Ford: My, my counselor there she was going to put back then and there was a six month

694
01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:10.620
Gerald Ford: You know, my son. I like a year, and there's like six work and

695
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:18.360
Richelle Direny: How old were you then when you recognize that you had became, you have to develop them addiction to the marijuana. How old are you,

696
01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:26.970
Gerald Ford: I was 21 but that's that's where it all changed, though. Like I said, she made me quit smoking weed.

697
01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.920
Gerald Ford: For probation. And what I did is

698
01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:43.890
Gerald Ford: You know she was making me drop twice a week. And what, what I did was I put the way down and I hate I hated pain pills.

699
01:26:45.090 --> 01:26:50.400
Gerald Ford: And the way they made me feel everybody at work was already taken home you know

700
01:26:51.630 --> 01:27:08.820
Gerald Ford: So I took the way down and you know I would go to my counseling thing you know job for her every, every week and I'm not, I put the weed down and I would start you know taking

701
01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:17.010
Gerald Ford: A Viking and or to, you know, to replace sort of place we'd you know

702
01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:18.510
Gerald Ford: And

703
01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:35.790
Richelle Direny: So, so, okay, so hold on before. So you're saying that right around that time is when you recognize it's when it became because even though you're saying that because I want you to just before going any deeper. I want you to take like take baby steps in

704
01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:48.630
Richelle Direny: Under understanding meditating upon it. You understand, because it's like when you're learning something new. You can't take in everything at once you got to take it in slowly and kind of like make it, you know, go around.

705
01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.210
Richelle Direny: At the age of 21

706
01:27:52.530 --> 01:27:59.910
Richelle Direny: Given like it was kind of like things started happening. Starting at the age of 21 when you were starting you came into awareness like

707
01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:05.190
Richelle Direny: Actually kind of me. I can smoke, my little blonde like what she mean I can

708
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.000
Richelle Direny: Do this.

709
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:14.280
Richelle Direny: And then you are realizing like you understand. So from the age of 21 is when you started it, but this is the point I'm making

710
01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:16.800
Richelle Direny: How old are you now.

711
01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.540
Gerald Ford: I'm 44

712
01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:25.500
Richelle Direny: So that's what 23 years

713
01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.940
About 23 years

714
01:28:28.050 --> 01:28:28.380
Gerald Ford: Yeah.

715
01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.760
Richelle Direny: For 23 years is what we're going to say

716
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.910
Richelle Direny: You have been on this road.

717
01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:42.720
Richelle Direny: You have been addicted to something. No matter what you were addicted to something right

718
01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:50.580
Richelle Direny: Now you have your at this point in your life after 23 years of perfecting

719
01:28:51.210 --> 01:29:07.200
Richelle Direny: This life. Now, I'm not saying that it was a pleasant life and that you look forward to doing it and you love it as you love your children or your girlfriend. I'm not saying that I'm saying for 23 years you became a master at what you were doing.

720
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:28.140
Richelle Direny: For 23 years, your body has gotten used to this right for 23 years you've been feeding your body. Your body knows nothing else, your mind, your body knows it knows nothing else but this because for 23 years you have been doing this.

721
01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:30.210
Richelle Direny: Now,

722
01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:39.690
Richelle Direny: You're saying, Okay, I can't do this anymore. Like when I look back at my 23 years. I don't really have

723
01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:55.620
Richelle Direny: anything to show for it. I see all that it's done for me in this 23 years I've ruin lives. I've ruined myself whatever came out of that while you were in this life of addiction. Right.

724
01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:11.040
Richelle Direny: You have to remember why I keep stressing 23 years if you were supposed to break down how many days and hours and minutes is in 23 years

725
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.740
Richelle Direny: It's going to take

726
01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:37.620
Richelle Direny: A while before you can change your mindset and how you think it's gonna take a while for you to really learn how to deal with crisis, how to really learn how to deal with frustration, you're gonna, it's going to take a long time for you to retrain yourself on how to live this life.

727
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:42.450
Richelle Direny: Outside of your addiction.

728
01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:52.830
Richelle Direny: Because for 23 years how you have been dealing with a life and everything is through at you, was with

729
01:30:53.880 --> 01:31:02.820
Richelle Direny: Whether it's marijuana, whether it's with alcohol was pills with heroin with anything that you can use to deal with it.

730
01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:22.920
Richelle Direny: For every loss you've experienced in life, whether it was due to drug addiction, whether it's was due to regular illness, whatever it was due to someone, someone else's negligence, how you dealt with that grief with that loss how you've dealt with all of that.

731
01:31:24.210 --> 01:31:41.370
Richelle Direny: Was through whatever form on drug number that's that's the tool you it's like you need to fix the door on the door pools, you go and get your toolbox you reached into that toolbox and you find whatever tool that can fix that door right

732
01:31:42.450 --> 01:32:00.180
Richelle Direny: What you did is that you had your toolbox and your toolbox and how to deal with her pain, frustration, anger, whatever it was, is that you reached for whatever drug of choice that will help you to get through that moment right

733
01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.250
Gerald Ford: Yeah. Yes.

734
01:32:03.570 --> 01:32:11.640
Richelle Direny: That's what you did was 90 getting that toolbox and I need to pull out something, whether it's heroin. That's what if that's if that is that gonna help me right now.

735
01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:20.550
Richelle Direny: That's what I'm gonna do. If it's alcohol, if that's what to do right now that that's, that is what fits the bill for me to get through this moment.

736
01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:24.420
Richelle Direny: Now you're realizing like

737
01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:30.090
Richelle Direny: Okay. These tools are not helping me because they're causing more destruction.

738
01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:36.840
Richelle Direny: So now you have to find a different way.

739
01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:41.730
Richelle Direny: A healthier way. So then therefore

740
01:32:43.230 --> 01:32:50.490
Richelle Direny: It's gonna be hard. So that's why I said it's going to take baby steps to get there. It's gonna take a long time.

741
01:32:51.450 --> 01:33:01.830
Richelle Direny: You, you're not going to be able to jump to your long term goal you won't be able to, you're just because what you're doing is setting up yourself for destruction. You're literally I'm telling you, I'm gonna be

742
01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:13.140
Richelle Direny: real with you, you're setting up yourself for failure. If you don't start taking baby steps because you have to grasp the concept that for 23 years. This is what I've been doing

743
01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:22.830
Richelle Direny: For 23 years. This is how I've learned how I've taught myself how I've convinced myself how everyone has helped. This is how I deal with it.

744
01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:33.870
Richelle Direny: But now I'm at this place where something in me insane that I can't continue like this. So now I have to retrain myself to do it differently.

745
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:46.590
Richelle Direny: And how you're starting to being in a program is helping that being in counseling is helping that being a part of a Celebrate Recovery is helping that you're saying that

746
01:33:46.860 --> 01:34:03.540
Richelle Direny: I can't do this enough myself. I need a higher power. And if you're saying that for you, your higher power is God Almighty, and he is helping you along the way, those are your, your, your baby steps that you're learning to retrain your body, how to do it.

747
01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:13.410
Richelle Direny: I learned this concept of what I'm saying to you, and it's still for me. It's a really it was a small or maybe you could think of it. Well, that's a small thing, how you going there.

748
01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:21.840
Richelle Direny: But then I learned how to apply it to all things I learned it from I tell everyone. I don't know if you were in the group when I had shared this where

749
01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:28.200
Richelle Direny: After I had my last child during my pregnancy, my legs. I don't know if your girlfriend when she was pregnant.

750
01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:38.970
Richelle Direny: Her legs will swell up her ankles, they will swell up at some point in the pregnancy or have you seen women that are pregnant that their feet swell up at the end of the evening, their feet swell up

751
01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:45.120
Richelle Direny: And so you would have to sit down or elevate your foot for the swelling to go down. Right.

752
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:47.850
Richelle Direny: It was something that where the baby is

753
01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:53.070
Richelle Direny: In your, your wound, whether they're sitting or whatever they're doing it makes your legs swallow.

754
01:34:54.660 --> 01:35:07.020
Richelle Direny: After so this was happening for during a period of my time during the pregnancy. So after I gave birth. I'm expecting. All right. Well, they need to stop like I am, I'm not pregnant, no more than why you need to stop.

755
01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:13.920
Richelle Direny: So I asked the doctor, I said, Well, listen, Doc, I mean, I'm no longer pregnant, but my legs keeps falling up like I don't understand.

756
01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:23.430
Richelle Direny: And he says, Well how long during the pregnancy was it's pulling up and I said I was going on for a while for quite some time. And so he just

757
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:34.830
Richelle Direny: With no emotions with no nothing. The man says, Well, what do you expect it's not going to stop overnight. It's going to take a while. You got it. It's gonna take a while because your body has to get used to.

758
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:46.020
Richelle Direny: A new norm of not having that's not being pregnant. So it has to get adjusted to this new norm. So over time, it will stop swelling up

759
01:35:46.440 --> 01:36:00.990
Richelle Direny: So sad so done. So I learned this concept that you can apply it to everything else if your body is used to being addicted to something for so long it's going to take a long time.

760
01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:03.270
Richelle Direny: For it.

761
01:36:04.170 --> 01:36:20.010
Richelle Direny: To get adjusted to not depending on these things any longer. And so once you understand that if you have a craving. If you're compelled to do something understand it's your body now fighting with you saying, hold up.

762
01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:37.170
Richelle Direny: I mean, you got me used to this. And now you want to get me unused to it but you got to fight through those urges. You got to fight through all of that. And so now you have to put in the work. And whatever it is that you have to put in. So if that work is

763
01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.640
Richelle Direny: Free if that work of putting in his arm.

764
01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:58.410
Richelle Direny: Like you said, maybe working or going to an extra meeting or having counseling or whatever it is that you need to do to help you to get through it if talking to help you to say hey you know what

765
01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.920
Richelle Direny: I saw this person today.

766
01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:13.200
Richelle Direny: And I saw them doing this and I was compelled to do that. And that was a trigger for me. How do I get through that. Those are the things that you're going to have to retrain your brain should do.

767
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:23.010
Richelle Direny: To get through it. So if you can get to your long term goal of ultimate long term sobriety. You understand you understand that.

768
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:24.600
Gerald Ford: The concept, people do.

769
01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:28.980
Gerald Ford: But I definitely do. But, you know, again, you know, like

770
01:37:29.190 --> 01:37:44.070
Gerald Ford: Like you just said, you know, you do this for so long and you're used to doing it well. Just like in some of these programs, you know, to be brutally honest, you know, like if you do mess up it

771
01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:59.220
Gerald Ford: You know you're scared to admit messing up because you know you're worried about getting thrown out of the program, you know, or you know consequences of

772
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:11.220
Gerald Ford: That, you know, just like my life. Now you know show no I'm not a member and Charlie was low and my life, except for never been in prison. You know, I've been

773
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:20.700
Gerald Ford: Helpful for finding stuff for you know little shit a little fight when I was young, but you know

774
01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:34.140
Gerald Ford: And and i got put on probation, like a little over a year ago from overdosing and, you know, they found some drugs right every day. So, you know,

775
01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:39.870
Gerald Ford: I've been struggling with this probation. Also, you know that you know

776
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:43.560
Gerald Ford: That is very strict, you know,

777
01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:59.910
Gerald Ford: In and you know I want this, you know, for me, not for him, you know, and you know, just like you said, you know, I mean, people will just it's it's easy to say just just don't do it right.

778
01:38:59.910 --> 01:39:00.390
Now,

779
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:02.430
Richelle Direny: Easy.

780
01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:10.980
Gerald Ford: Right, you know, again, not been doing this for over half of my life.

781
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:14.580
Gerald Ford: You know, or

782
01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.710
Gerald Ford: You know, and

783
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:21.900
Gerald Ford: And there's consequences to tell them the truth. You know, I mean,

784
01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:29.520
Gerald Ford: You gotta worry about, like I said, like going to jail or, or, you know,

785
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:33.240
Richelle Direny: Sometimes you get

786
01:39:33.930 --> 01:39:40.410
Richelle Direny: Your truth of who you tell your truth of that. Now granted, when it comes down to a probation officer, it's a little bit different, um,

787
01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:50.430
Richelle Direny: But you have to know who you're telling your truth, too, because sometimes something I could depend on so I could come and say, Hey, Joe. So what's your truth.

788
01:39:51.300 --> 01:40:00.180
Richelle Direny: You have to be able to hold on. Why are you asking me that, and why are you asking me the way you're asking me, because maybe my motive.

789
01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:17.520
Richelle Direny: To asking you that is not to help you but to tear you down and you have to be mindful of that, you have to be on guard, because that's the real true depending on why a person is asking you. Oh, so I wonder, did you slip up today.

790
01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:31.500
Richelle Direny: You have to stop and say, should I even engage that conversation. Should I even answer that because if you're looking for me to fall. Now, I've never Now granted, I've never been involved with the law and I've never been. Now I've worked

791
01:40:32.850 --> 01:40:47.730
Richelle Direny: In aspects of it to understand certain things. My understanding of when people are on probation. I've always heard people who have gone through probation has always said probation is not really meant to help you. It's like a setup.

792
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:51.390
Richelle Direny: It's almost like they're waiting for you for

793
01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:53.040
Richelle Direny: They're waiting to see you fall

794
01:40:53.670 --> 01:41:00.480
Richelle Direny: It's like, oh, let me see if I could catch them in something. So it's not necessarily to help you. They think it's people think it's to help you. But it's not

795
01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:16.110
Richelle Direny: I've heard people who have been incarcerated and, you know, been on the, the same kind of road you have that always said that probation is not really there to help you. It's there. It's like a setup for your great ultimate fall. So with that little piece of knowledge.

796
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:31.410
Richelle Direny: You're if you're choosing to take the role of either serving time and putting it behind you or going on probation and trying your hand at working through whatever you're doing while you're on probation.

797
01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:51.240
Richelle Direny: You, you have to figure out how do I get through this probation and be successful to come back whatever the setup that they have set me up for this trap that they have set up for me, you understand. So like you said what at what you said. What I really liked Gerald is that you said

798
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:59.400
Richelle Direny: You're not your road to recovery is not for anybody else but for you.

799
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:03.660
Richelle Direny: And you have to always keep that in mind.

800
01:42:04.050 --> 01:42:19.380
Richelle Direny: This is for me. So if I'm your pro he'll officer icon. If I've found me your P. O. And I come to you and I'm trying to catch you in alive. And you know, that's what I'm always going to try to do is catch you in a lie.

801
01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:23.550
Richelle Direny: You have to take your time before you answer me.

802
01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:26.520
Richelle Direny: You understand

803
01:42:28.410 --> 01:42:36.660
Gerald Ford: Why, and you know, and you're supposed to be brutally honest, you know, I mean, for, you know, I mean, just for yourself, respect, you know, but

804
01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:46.320
Gerald Ford: Mean that makes you know that contradicts, you know, the way that you know if you want to live right and

805
01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:47.610
Richelle Direny: It does.

806
01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:54.390
Gerald Ford: Understanding what you're saying to you know just pick and choose what what you're saying what

807
01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:01.020
Richelle Direny: You're not gonna eat by no means you're going to lie because then you're alive. You're the truth will find you out.

808
01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:12.180
Richelle Direny: But it is very control when it comes on to the legal system by, it is it is contradicting it's set up to just find you in something, but

809
01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:18.030
Richelle Direny: The brutal truth and the real honesty here is

810
01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:21.330
Richelle Direny: They put you on probation.

811
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:39.990
Richelle Direny: You know what it's all about. You know what they set up so now is for you to work every day intentionally knowing these are the terms of my probation and in order to get off of it. I have to follow it by the letter of the law, you understand

812
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:41.250
Richelle Direny: It's hard.

813
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:49.020
Richelle Direny: I'm not gonna say that's why I'm not gonna say, by any means. It's not because these are the parameters that they put on you.

814
01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:54.960
Richelle Direny: It's very hard because it's kind of like they said the mind is willing

815
01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.020
Richelle Direny: But the, the body is the body is weak. The flesh is weak.

816
01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:12.510
Richelle Direny: Your mind is willing to follow the law, the way it's written. But hey, it's like I feel like there's a force pulling me to do other things.

817
01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:31.530
Richelle Direny: So you have to now come in alignment with what your mind is telling you, Gerald, you got to do A, B and C. And you only have to do A, B, and C for six months, you got to find a way to try to get through every day of the six months so that you don't falter.

818
01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:47.190
Richelle Direny: Because the truth is it's easier for me to say it now, but the truth is x at the end of six months. You're going to feel so much better. We're able to get through these difficult times to get out of how long is your probation.

819
01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:53.700
Gerald Ford: Was first them for for a year, but I'm going on.

820
01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:55.320
Gerald Ford: A year.

821
01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.260
Gerald Ford: A year to five years, you know,

822
01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:16.020
Gerald Ford: But as long as you did everything is supposed to do. And in a year you was YOU'D BE ALL, THROW I get everything and and I messed up and got a dirty. When I after I but you know I went in patient, not that long ago.

823
01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:23.910
Gerald Ford: And I did good for a while and for I came back to you guys, you know,

824
01:45:25.290 --> 01:45:37.110
Gerald Ford: You know, I just wasn't ready, you know, I got off the medicine they want and give me medicine there at the at the rehab. You know, they said that work. But, you know,

825
01:45:38.370 --> 01:45:49.470
Gerald Ford: Because I i can't mess it up but you know that it's just, it's just, you know, I mean, they never set, you know, just like this. I mean this helped me

826
01:45:50.280 --> 01:46:10.260
Gerald Ford: Understand just us talking like this. I've never, you know, they've never took any program. But as I've never know sat down and talk like this and and had this little things you know explain, you know, like, it's like you're in the right now.

827
01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:20.700
Richelle Direny: It and I've never been through, but I can just imagine how hard it is, it is a true and I hear people who have been through it.

828
01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:31.770
Richelle Direny: That I know that are used to work with kids who are on probation and for even them. It was a struggle because sometimes your environment.

829
01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:45.090
Richelle Direny: Is not necessarily conducive to to support change your environment plays a big factor, the people you're around is not conducive to help you to support change.

830
01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:59.670
Richelle Direny: So there's so many different factors. And so it's kind of like you're fighting you're going against the grain, all you feel like you're all by yourself going against the screen you have this big wall in front of you how. Go ahead.

831
01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:12.120
Gerald Ford: Right. I mean, I mean, he hasn't. I mean, he is the Lord knows as prick that I've ever met him. I mean, even my counselor at

832
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:25.830
Gerald Ford: The impatient. You know, I want to, you know, she like she talks a lot of probation officers, you know, like, you know, I know, pretty good. She talked him like five minutes. He's like, man, you read

833
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:28.710
Gerald Ford: This guy.

834
01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.190
Gerald Ford: You know, and

835
01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:34.890
Richelle Direny: And I, you know, honestly, I don't even know all maybe

836
01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:47.490
Richelle Direny: I've seen that. Yes, they are. A lot of them. It makes no sense. And I heard like adult peels or worse than you know what the juveniles, but it's some of them. It's like it's almost like

837
01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:52.470
Richelle Direny: It's like they have like a personal vendetta against you.

838
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:56.430
Richelle Direny: Some of them. It's just, it makes sense why there's so it's a

839
01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:03.990
Gerald Ford: CHANCE AT ALL. You know, I mean no understanding. I mean,

840
01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:05.790
Gerald Ford: Yeah.

841
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:20.160
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like that that finger pointing. They're doing this finger pointing thing. And if you're supposed to ever go find out how their life is they're probably doing the same or worse, but you know it's neither here and there, I get it, but

842
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:33.390
Richelle Direny: It's it's it's it's it's a harder thing to hear, but it is the reality is that they are who they are and you really, you have no control how

843
01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:45.900
Richelle Direny: How they act you have zero control how they act and who they are, but it goes back to while you were living this life. No one told you the consequence of your action.

844
01:48:46.710 --> 01:48:56.880
Richelle Direny: So it says somewhat like dealing with a probation officer is your daily consequence or your however often you have to interact with him. That's one part of your consequence that you have to live through

845
01:48:57.930 --> 01:49:17.820
Richelle Direny: You just have to find ways daily. How do I get through this. How do I identify my triggers get through my triggers so that I don't fall to have to continue dealing with this individual. So your motivation. Your motivator. How can I get rid of this person out my life.

846
01:49:20.730 --> 01:49:21.690
Richelle Direny: That's your motivator.

847
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:30.120
Richelle Direny: I remember listening. I used to tell these kids there when I used to work with kids who had to deal with the, the, the, the legal system.

848
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:33.810
Richelle Direny: And because they were in the legal system. They have to deal with me.

849
01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:41.910
Richelle Direny: So then I would come in. They're like, I don't even want you in here. I don't want to talk to you. I said, well, that's show business. You're the one that got me in your life. So if you want me out your life.

850
01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:54.420
Richelle Direny: You need to do what you need to do to get me out your life and what pleasure I will come out. You're like, straight, I would tell him I said, You want me out of your life, do what you need to do, and I will put pleasure. Our culture life.

851
01:49:55.650 --> 01:50:03.090
Richelle Direny: And literally, it was they want to hear that. But guess what they did what they needed to do.

852
01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:06.330
Richelle Direny: For me to get out of their lives.

853
01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:23.550
Richelle Direny: So I would tell them, you do not want me in your house, but you are the reason why I'm in your house and the longer it takes for you to understand that concept. The longer I stay in your house. So guess what

854
01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:33.630
Richelle Direny: I would love to come at your house. By this time, just to what you need to do to get out to for me to get at your house.

855
01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:38.160
Richelle Direny: And data. And that's just how you have to look at it.

856
01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:59.760
Gerald Ford: And I do understand that. But again, you know, we're talking about, you know, my whole reason for being on probation is my addiction, you know if I could just just poof shut off you know I word, you know, and I mean I just said there's there's just been no

857
01:51:00.210 --> 01:51:02.700
Gerald Ford: No, I'm not making excuses because I

858
01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:04.650
Gerald Ford: Know what what I've done.

859
01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:19.470
Gerald Ford: And everything like that. But you know, it's just like you said, I mean they don't give a shit if you just go ahead and go do a year in jail you know and and not have to do you know

860
01:51:20.370 --> 01:51:33.990
Gerald Ford: Because bottom line. He doesn't care if I get off. But now he's gonna be doing my job if I didn't make it a bottom line is, he don't care upon him. We have a president, you know, I mean,

861
01:51:35.250 --> 01:51:43.140
Gerald Ford: You know, if I went to prison for a year, then, then, then you know this ship would all be behind me, but I don't know that that's just

862
01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:53.190
Gerald Ford: I mean, that's just one of the things that I'm struggling with. Now, now I'm actually haven't seen you for a little while so

863
01:51:53.640 --> 01:52:09.210
Gerald Ford: Uh, probably in a little bit of trouble with home which, you know, I really don't. I mean, I can do with that. I want to get my, you know, I want to get my head right and you know just just get, you know, I just want no I just

864
01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:10.440
Richelle Direny: So state.

865
01:52:10.710 --> 01:52:18.390
Richelle Direny: So this is what I would recommend for every group for every session for everything. I just stay

866
01:52:19.650 --> 01:52:20.370
Richelle Direny: I suggest

867
01:52:22.710 --> 01:52:33.660
Richelle Direny: You want to like you said, these are the things that you want. So therefore, just stay focused on your goal. What is is that you want just a focus on that.

868
01:52:34.290 --> 01:52:58.080
Richelle Direny: And if you stay focused on that. You'll be surprised that you're closer to your long term goal without recognizing all the work that you've done. Don't say so. So don't be so focused on the probation. The not using the not wanting to use because the more you stay focused on your gold.

869
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:09.210
Richelle Direny: Your realize that you've met you've met such strides and you have been doing everything that you've needed to do.

870
01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:19.260
Richelle Direny: without recognizing man I did all of this. It's what you're saying focus on is what you're, you're, you're, you understand it's like you're you're following the life

871
01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:27.540
Richelle Direny: If you follow the light, you have to stay focused on the light. But if you look to the left. Guess you lose sight of the light right

872
01:53:30.690 --> 01:53:30.870
Richelle Direny: That's

873
01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:46.830
Richelle Direny: All it is stay focus on the light and staying focused on the light is going to keep sending out different clues to continue. Keep going to the light. Keep going. Don't look to the left nor right just stay focused on the light because the light is your ultimate goal.

874
01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:54.270
Richelle Direny: Because if you're staying focused on the light, you're doing everything you need to do to maintain your sobriety.

875
01:53:54.870 --> 01:54:06.390
Richelle Direny: Because you're staying focused on your goal. You're not allowing all of these distractors. I'm not going to say temptation is not going to be there along the way it will be it will be. I promise you this

876
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:09.060
Richelle Direny: Temptations will be there along the way.

877
01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:19.710
Richelle Direny: It's are you staying focused on the light and how do you stay focused on the light going to your meetings going to counseling taking whatever

878
01:54:20.190 --> 01:54:35.640
Richelle Direny: Prescription the way it's it's it's prescribed to you if it is that you for you. You want to get back into church. You want to, you know, develop your relationship with God, which is of ultimate importance if you stay focused on that.

879
01:54:37.230 --> 01:54:41.820
Richelle Direny: Everything else will kind of fall in place. It's the question is what are you staying focused on

880
01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:48.420
Richelle Direny: If you stay focused on, I want to get through this quick then you lose the purpose you lose the goal.

881
01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:58.710
Richelle Direny: Because I'm so focused and I want to get through this. I want to get through this. I want to get through this. You lose sight of your goal, but if you stay focused on the light

882
01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:11.880
Richelle Direny: Then you will ultimately get where you need to go. And that's how you doing your realize that you're you're making. It's kind of like you ever see a baby. The baby walking when a baby is learning how to walk.

883
01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:19.380
Richelle Direny: And you tell the baby and you say, no, look at me, look at me. Come to me. And as they're looking at you. What are they doing

884
01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:24.600
Gerald Ford: In China, you

885
01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:34.110
Richelle Direny: know nothing about what I'm saying to you a baby is learning how to walk, they're looking at you and they're walking right

886
01:55:35.670 --> 01:55:37.050
Richelle Direny: Do they know that they're walking

887
01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:41.970
Gerald Ford: I would say so.

888
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:46.590
Richelle Direny: They don't know because they're just focus on you. They're just excited.

889
01:55:47.610 --> 01:55:56.520
Richelle Direny: They're staying focused on you, and they're making those steps, they're going. The minute that they stop and look around what happens

890
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:57.210
When

891
01:55:59.190 --> 01:55:59.850
Richelle Direny: They fall

892
01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.570
Richelle Direny: Because they realize oh crap. What am I doing, and fear sets in.

893
01:56:06.150 --> 01:56:12.000
Gerald Ford: Make sense, it does start looking around and then reaching for something, the whole

894
01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:14.970
Richelle Direny: Fear second

895
01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:19.680
Richelle Direny: And then you fall, but then you put them back up on their feet.

896
01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:28.470
Richelle Direny: And you say, now look come today come. They're all with statement there, right there. Walk to you they're walking to you.

897
01:56:29.610 --> 01:56:37.740
Richelle Direny: And then they've reached their goal. But the minute they stopped focusing on you and they look around to reach I fall

898
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:42.390
Richelle Direny: Because now I become fearful of what's really going on.

899
01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:46.710
Gerald Ford: Understood.

900
01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:55.710
Richelle Direny: Stay focused on the line. Stay focused on your goal, because if you stay focused on your goal, you've accomplished so much

901
01:56:56.850 --> 01:57:12.000
Richelle Direny: And don't even realize how much you've accomplished until you get to your goal you look back at the finish line. And you're like, Dang, that's all that I left back there. You sure did. Because you stayed focused on your, your, your goal you stay focused on the line.

902
01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:19.890
Richelle Direny: If you take nothing else take that safe zone in your life. What is your goal and stay focused on that.

903
01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:21.960
Gerald Ford: You

904
01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.850
Gerald Ford: Know, with you guys and I appreciate this.

Gerald Ford: Morning on

Richelle Direny: That's okay. We is VS 15 minutes past session. Okay, so
