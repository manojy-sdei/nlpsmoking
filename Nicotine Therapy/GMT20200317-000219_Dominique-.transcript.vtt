9
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:21.360
Martin Price: You know the stuff we work with is just takes gobbles up so much space that you got to be on their network, you know, so

Martin Price: Yeah, I am friendly.

16
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.640
Martin Price: You know, got out of that relationship. So that was

17
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.270
Martin Price: Yeah, she was and she just was unable to tell the truth that anything

18
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.730
Dominique Pozo: That was a big step on your part. What, what really kind of kick started you and in that direction.

19
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.710
Martin Price: It's just like it just became more and more about, you know, my mortgages. Do I gotta getting

20
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.900
Martin Price: Whatever got a family car, this and that and it was like

21
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.830
Martin Price: It just wasn't about a relationship anymore. It was just about her needs, you know, on her.

22
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.610
Martin Price: Trying to supplement her paycheck. So

23
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.330
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

24
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.540
Martin Price: You know i i. So, I was fairly proud of myself. I, I wrote her a letter, actually, and then

25
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.770
Martin Price: We talked on the phone. After that, and then she kept trying to like

26
00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:03.120
Martin Price: Call get all the therapist and try and get a hold of me through the therapist and then got a different phone and called me from that. And I'm like, you know,

27
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.960
It's well

28
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.320
Martin Price: You're just like to

29
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.360
Martin Price: Read here, whatever. It's like it's, you know,

30
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.750
Martin Price: That's about it. Zero funding for me to be just an ATM to somebody. You're not even if it's not like my daughter, my wife or something.

31
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:33.810
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, totally. So how did you leave it because I know you had left her a bunch of money for her school did you come up with some sort of payment plan that you wanted to have in place.

32
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.510
Martin Price: No, I went and saw a lawyer and will probably submit what's called a demand letter.

33
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.040
Martin Price: But

34
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.820
Martin Price: Who knows what will come of it. I

35
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:56.220
Martin Price: I just have to wait and see. Like for me, just you know obsessing about it and everything like that. I just got so tired of it that I mean it was easier just to kind of like

36
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:16.140
Martin Price: I guess it could have been. I could have, like, stuck with her and like editor editor ending up owning my house. I had done her. She just like kept working the whole single mom three kids taking care of her mom beat in her previous marriage, just on and on and

37
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.690
Martin Price: You know,

38
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.670
Martin Price: Since like a

39
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.530
Martin Price: Broken record.

40
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.780
Dominique Pozo: Well, this is a big A big step for you. How do you feel now, having done that.

41
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:36.870
Martin Price: Um, I was really upset about it for several weeks just really kind of like brokenhearted or, you know,

42
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:48.840
Martin Price: Just like, Oh, she didn't have feelings for me at all not she just one of the money, but it's kind of weird. After you talk to somebody on the phone for literally every day for a year.

43
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.730
Dominique Pozo: Trading jacks and everything and

44
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.160
Martin Price: You get

45
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.520
Martin Price: I don't know what it was. I don't

46
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.090
Martin Price: It's like, I guess I wanted to be in a relationship so badly that

47
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.980
Martin Price: I wasn't looking at it objectively.

48
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:22.380
Martin Price: And so I feel I'm doing a lot better now. And plus, I'm really tapering back on the Cupid orphan that for me feels really good. You know, I feel like my spirits kind of coming back.

49
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.580
Dominique Pozo: Oh, great.

50
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.610
Martin Price: Because I feel like it kind of numbs you It numbs your emotions, you know, I mean,

51
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.480
Martin Price: Which for the past two weeks I was grateful for.

52
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.400
Dominique Pozo: Right, right. Kind of like

53
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.130
Martin Price: I need to deal with it.

54
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.140
Martin Price: And not use like the buprenorphine.

55
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.170

59
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.560
Dominique Pozo: Well, well, what would you like to focus on today. We've got, we still have plenty of time.

60
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.250
Martin Price: I don't know, I feel much better and stronger.

61
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.490
Martin Price: talked to Dr. Kim Dale this afternoon, and we're going to try a much cheaper medication and

62
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.880
Martin Price: Because I talked to another guy about

63
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.720
Martin Price: Said via text or whatever. And he said it was pretty easy for him. Just to taper down and stop it.

64
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.130
Martin Price: Was it was, it wasn't that hard for him to just stop.

65
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.020
Dominique Pozo: You know, and

66
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.260
Martin Price: So I switched to swimming, but it's like

67
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:50.190
Martin Price: You know, for me, like, I need to like focus on that taking care of myself and not

68
00:07:52.470 --> 00:08:02.670
Martin Price: You know, kind of my whole cycle is I get a lot of anxiety and my way of dealing with things like exercise really hard. And then my joints like my hips and everything.

69
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.340
Martin Price: ache and then I do medicine and

70
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.020
Martin Price: Then I started taking up swimming and that's really helped a lot.

71
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.120
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

72
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.690

73
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.750
Martin Price: Especially in the morning when I wake up I wake up really early like at five. I'll just like

74
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.930

77
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.350
Martin Price: So I don't know what to tell you.

78
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:59.220
Dominique Pozo: Well, I have I'm having a kind of a really loose idea of doing a little art around that and having like a mind bubble and then having various bubbles and kind of drawing out the

79
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.270
Dominique Pozo: Like maybe main five bubbles. If there's five

80
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.350
Dominique Pozo: bubbles that have your mind going in circles. What are those

81
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.950
Dominique Pozo: Are you willing to to do that and give that a try.

82
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.650

Dominique Pozo: So, so just dry your head.

88
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:11.760
Dominique Pozo: Just dry your head and then a few little dots going in different directions, and then a bubble around just empty bubble and then fill five bubbles with what are the main the five main things that you're

89
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.460
Dominique Pozo: Using dealing with

90
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.090

Martin Price: Lot of like fear of the future, what the future holds.

95
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.560
Martin Price: And

96
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.040
Martin Price: Then one of them was like betrayal.

97
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.190
Martin Price: finances are like

98
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.150
Martin Price: You know, big worry for me right now.

99
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.950
Martin Price: And then you know tapering off the medicine.

100
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.470
Martin Price: And forgiveness is one of the bubbles to like forgiving myself.

101
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.460
Martin Price: As well as her for being such a money grubber

102
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.400
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Forgiveness both ways.

103
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:11.670
Dominique Pozo: So now for each one. It can you write one number one and number two, either within the bubble or next to it. Just know that it relates to the bubble and what are two actions that you can take to address the bubble

104
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.210
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, to for each

105
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.880
Dominique Pozo: Okay, which ones are you kind of more drawn to

106
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.180
Martin Price: Well, fear of the future.

107
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:21.960
Martin Price: This like in just a moment. And, you know, all you have is today.

108
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:22.710
Dominique Pozo: You know,

109
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.500
Martin Price: Just try and not

110
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.970
Martin Price: Think about the future so much and don't

111
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.360
Martin Price: Worry about it. Just try and stay in the prison.

112
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.760
Dominique Pozo: And how will you do that.

113
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.410
Martin Price: I try and catch myself like going to that fearful place, you know,

114
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:44.910
Martin Price: And

115
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.310
Martin Price: say a prayer.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.470
Martin Price: Yeah yeah

118
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:16.590
Martin Price: And then, you know, like forgiveness. I think like it's been trying to forgive myself, you know, as well as others her and because I don't want to become bitter you know about it. I just want to look at it as a lesson.

119
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.530
Martin Price: You know,

120
00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:31.080
Martin Price: Let it guide me and future relationships. You know, like, don't, don't be so generous from the beginning.

121
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.070
Mm hmm.

122
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:33.600
Dominique Pozo: I

123
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:41.580
Martin Price: I got, you know, I've been married for so long that I just my whole mindset was

124
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.600
Martin Price: You know the guys supposed to work and take care of the woman, you know,

125
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.300
Martin Price: So that it just came very natural to me again.

126
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.710
Martin Price: And she portrayed herself as being really

127
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:00.750
Martin Price: You know,

128
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:10.290
Martin Price: The men are previous marriage and let's put the clothes on our back and you know isn't all this dad and

129
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.590
Martin Price: You know, I don't even know how much of it was true.

130
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.780
Martin Price: But so I was like the perfect

131
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.360
Martin Price: Partner for her because

132
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.820
Martin Price: I felt really sorry for

133
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:43.110
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and I, I wonder if you if you break that down in percentages. How much have you actually felt sorry for her say imagine there's a big pie.

134
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:53.790
Dominique Pozo: And do pie slices, how much you felt sorry for her, how much you know felt good for you to be needed. How much you know of that was part of a worthiness piece and

135
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:04.860
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know if it was half and half. But towards the end. And it was just all all about guilt and

136
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.350
Like

137
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:20.280
Martin Price: Feeling sorry for, you know, it wasn't like, you know, I, of course, I love to be called every day, you know, and all that, but then she started getting mad at me because I never called her

138
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:27.480
Martin Price: And she started you know saying I had plenty of time to text my buddies and not her. She got into this really weird.

139
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.460
Martin Price: Kind of

140
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:39.120
Martin Price: mode where I wasn't trying hard enough. And I was like, I wasn't trying hard enough, because I was getting so tired of the

141
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.530
Martin Price: Whole dynamics of the relationship, you know,

142
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:44.340
Huh.

143
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.150
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

144
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:54.420
Martin Price: And if I brought up money, you know, and how, like all she ever did was ask for money, she would get mad defensive and

145
00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:03.720
Martin Price: You don't know what it's like and all that stuff. So wasn't healthy relationship for me it didn't serve me

146
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.530
Dominique Pozo: Doesn't sound like you were receiving much empathy and

147
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.340
Dominique Pozo: Understanding

148
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.140
Martin Price: In the beginning it was pretty good. The first six months were really good and then

149
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:19.860
Martin Price: Then it was like when I let her the money for the business. That's when it seemed to kind of start going downhill from there.

150
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:20.820
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

151
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.110
Martin Price: I'm just really, you know, trying to put it behind me and

152
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.130
Martin Price: Like work on taking care of myself.

153
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.690
Dominique Pozo: It sounds like you learned, like you got a lesson from that of what you

154
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.450
Dominique Pozo: Probably won't recreate next time.

155
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.970
Martin Price: Right, right. I don't want to go there again.

156
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.950
Dominique Pozo: Okay. What's another bubble that has your attention.

157
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.350
Martin Price: Um,

158
00:20:50.700 --> 00:21:02.670
Martin Price: Well, like the the tapering off the medicine. You know, I wrote slowly and then it feels like my spirit is emerging, you know, so I just kind of feel like

159
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.300
Martin Price: Surrounded by natural

160
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:08.310
Martin Price: Energy

161
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.260
Martin Price: Anybody's come back or something.

162
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.180
Martin Price: And I'm adding like as much of a thong.

163
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.320
Martin Price: It's only been a few days, so I can't you know

164
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.310
Martin Price: It's not like I've conquered it but

165
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.140
Martin Price: I just

166
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.230
Martin Price: I'm feeling pretty good with that. And I guess I'm saying

167
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.790
Dominique Pozo: That's great, this is

168
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:43.950
Martin Price: I mean it's not until you stop taking it entirely that should get, you know, you can go through a lot of depression and everything, but

169
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.680
Martin Price: Right now, it's really not too damn

170
00:21:47.190 --> 00:22:00.660
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Well, good. Well, at least you know we'll even when you stop taking it, you can still come to group and we can still have sessions to keep giving you the court in case you know in case it may not happen, but just in case something kind of crashes for you.

171
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:01.980
Martin Price: Yeah, I

172
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:12.660
Martin Price: Have never tried to stop taking this step before I like pain pills. It was pretty hard to stop to stop it to recover from those

173
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.820
Martin Price: I don't know about this stuff. We'll see.

174
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:26.070
Dominique Pozo: So it sounds like there's some apprehension around like even though you're feeling good. Now you're appreciating it. There's a little apprehension about what's on the horizon. When you do

175
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.520
Martin Price: Yeah, cuz I still it's really long lasting in it.

176
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:39.960
Martin Price: It takes a few days to get out of your system, you know, and but that's why, you know, it just seems like everyone's saying, do it, do it fairly slowly.

177
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.550
Martin Price: You know, don't try and do it all in one day or something, you know, and

178
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:56.220
Martin Price: So I was just, you know, pretty surprised that I actually felt better taking last, you know,

179
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.480
Martin Price: So that's kinda interesting right there, you know,

180
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.510
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, well it's I think it's really

181
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:10.230
Dominique Pozo: Encouraging to notice that your energies coming back and you're feeling kind of an innate vitality returning

182
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.170
Martin Price: Yeah, like my spirits coming back to

183
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.550
Dominique Pozo: What we're to action steps around the tapering did you have

184
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.300
Martin Price: It was just one was to do it slowly and

185
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:33.330
Martin Price: Well, I put down feels like my spirit is an emerging you know I prayed a lot. I just keep praying

186
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.440
Dominique Pozo: Some more about to prayer, the prayer sounds like a really big resource for you.

187
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.680
Martin Price: Yeah, I like pray a lot. Yeah.

188
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.610
Martin Price: Like repetitive prayer when I go to bed and

189
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.750
Martin Price: It's just kind of weird, you know, it's like

190
00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:56.790
Martin Price: I'm so immersed in my own little drama, you know, and there's all this huge

191
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.240
Martin Price: stuff going on in the world.

192
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:03.360
And

193
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:15.900
Martin Price: people losing their life savings and getting sick and all that. And I don't know, I just feel like I need to kind of open up and be, get out of my little

194
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.850
Martin Price: Shell

195
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.260
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

196
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:28.500
Dominique Pozo: Something like that makes sense. At this time, when so much has been asked of us if we are healthy and strong and others are struggling. It makes sense.

197
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:28.920
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

198
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.410
Martin Price: I don't know. I think you can like

199
00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:40.470
Martin Price: You know, I just don't really want to be on this medicine for years, you know. Yeah.

200
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.420
Martin Price: I don't

201
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.130
Martin Price: I don't know. I'll do my best.

202
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:48.780
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

203
00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:54.990
Dominique Pozo: What's another one.

204
00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:07.920
Martin Price: Well, that was close to it, financial difficulties was a bad one, like I'm trying to refinance my house and keep working, and maybe increase my hours to, you know,

205
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.070
Martin Price: You know, maybe I can get like 45 or 50 hours a week and

206
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:23.700
Martin Price: Then I'll be doing pretty well. I make I do pretty well fun you know make good money, but I just gotten really bad debt and

207
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:31.650
Martin Price: Know it wasn't just that ex girlfriend. It was like setting my daughter to this.

208
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:41.340
Martin Price: Great place for schizophrenia and just all kinds of stuff like that. It's amazing how quickly you can burn through money. I didn't, I just couldn't believe it.

209
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.270
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

210
00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:51.030
Martin Price: So that was another job gargantuan lesson for me is to, like, you know, I'm 60 years old and I need to start focusing on retirement.

211
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.570
Martin Price: So I think that like one of the one of the balloons is betrayal and

212
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.560
Martin Price: You know, like it was sort of about don't take it personally and

213
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.970
Martin Price: Try not to go to anger and resentment, you know,

214
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:21.960
Martin Price: It's kind of weird. Like right now I just feel like it's you know 1500 miles away, and there's nothing I can do about it and

215
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.170
Martin Price: You know, it's not going to help me to sit there and obsess about it or

216
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.520
Like

217
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.720
Martin Price: Turn like turn my resentment towards her, or whatever.

218
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:45.810
Martin Price: So yeah, I'm pretty surprised. Like right now I just feel pretty calm, collected. You know, it's a pretty good.

219
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:54.480
Dominique Pozo: You know, I think I may have mentioned it in a group before maybe an even in our session that, you know, anger, if it's expressed in a

220
00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:03.420
Dominique Pozo: in a responsible way. It's actually a very healthy emotion that often, you know, speaking to a boundary that's been crossed

221
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:12.780
Dominique Pozo: So, you know, I just don't want to skip over your anger. I think resentment can be toxic make someone. Second, of course, if you're obsessing over how angry you are. That's not going to really

222
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:23.940
Dominique Pozo: Make your life any better yet, I just want to validate that if you've experienced that your boundaries been crossed in some way. The anger, it's healthy. It's a healthy expression.

223
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:32.610
Martin Price: Yeah, it's weird because my spiritual counselors, just like do you just gotta pray for every time you feel like that shadow

224
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:41.400
Martin Price: You know, you're going to the to the dark side of the shadow, you need to pray for and everything. So that's what I've been trying to do and

225
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.190
Martin Price: I don't know what's Ryan anymore.

226
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.020
Dominique Pozo: I just wanna

227
00:27:46.620 --> 00:28:01.710
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I don't want to make anger this shadow emotions because it's not. It's a very human emotion. What do you when you tune in, regardless of what I say what your spiritual counselor says what feels true for you. Most true and see if you can get your mind out of the way.

228
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.150
Martin Price: And just

229
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.390
Martin Price: Is pretty disgusted with her, I guess, you know, so

230
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:24.780
Dominique Pozo: I'm gonna just validate that and actually give some space for you know that you feel disgusted. And maybe that that leads to a bit of repulsion. And, you know, turning away from and that's okay. It's totally valid.

231
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.240
Martin Price: Yeah, it's like I i just

232
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:43.980
Martin Price: For a while I had, you know, I really was like missing her and I wanted to like stop blocking your messages and talk to her and telling like tell her I still cared about her and that she, you know, but

233
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.860
Martin Price: I just realized that it was never ever going to turn into it.

234
00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.040
Martin Price: There's no future in the relationship, you know,

235
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:58.740
Martin Price: So it's kind of

236
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.430
Martin Price: It's time to move on.

237
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:16.440
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and I think it's, it's totally if you really feel a genuine desire to pray for her beautiful. I just, I think, forcing something that's not really authentic seems

238
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:28.770
Dominique Pozo: Kind of like a waste of energy. I'd rather focus on you know where you do want to put your energy and sounds like you're moving forward and and definitely not skipping over what happened like

239
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.840
Martin Price: Yeah yeah I've definitely

240
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:45.990
Martin Price: Done enough counseling about it and thought about it enough. It's just kind of like, well, the past is behind you, you made a mistake, you know, on there's no sense beating yourself up and it just makes you depressed.

241
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.200
Martin Price: Yeah, I don't know what else to do.

242
00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.780
Martin Price: I guess I'm just not an angry space right now I don't

243
00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.440
Dominique Pozo: Know, that's fine, I, I'm actually wondering

244
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:14.880
Dominique Pozo: If you could now if I don't know if there's more room on your paper. But is there room in the chest area. Do you have, like, I know I said, draw your head is there room to go below and draw a little bit in your chest.

245
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.360
Martin Price: Chest, but I can

246
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.260
Dominique Pozo: Okay, and just draw that. And what is your heart space need

247
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.320
Dominique Pozo: You know, you're feeling body, your heart space, what would be really good medicine for your heart right now.

248
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:36.240
Dominique Pozo: And if you want to write or draw or if you have ideas just jot them down.

249
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:44.640
Martin Price: Well, you know, at first I was going to say to have someone love and care for me, not just for the money, you know, but

250
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:55.020
Martin Price: It's also about, you know, I am beginning to learn to appreciate my own company. You know, I kind of learned to love myself so

251
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.330
Martin Price: And you realize that

252
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:06.750
Martin Price: You know, I get the best I could. I tried to help somebody and they just got this sense of entitlement and just wanted more and more and more, you know,

253
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.070
Dominique Pozo: Yes, yeah.

254
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:19.620
Martin Price: But yeah, there's still a part of me that would like to be in a, like a healthy relationship, you know, and

255
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:26.100
Martin Price: I have to admit I've been insanely dating sites and stuff like that. But wait.

256
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.460
Martin Price: And then just been real patient about it.

257
00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.140
Martin Price: Cuz with my life. It's kind of become this like, work, work, work, you know,

258
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.850
Martin Price: It's like a

259
00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:46.710
Martin Price: My finances are kind of a mess right now. And so it's like that's the one thing I can do that.

260
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:54.000
Martin Price: Helps me, you know, very tangible results.

261
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.350
Dominique Pozo: Oh,

262
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.420
Dominique Pozo: What's the one thing you can do

263
00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.070
Martin Price: To work.

264
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:00.540
Martin Price: Toward paid

265
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.430
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah yeah

266
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.280
Martin Price: Yeah, and it's like a real

267
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:11.250
Martin Price: It's not like a relationship or like you put energy in and

268
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.110
Martin Price: You hope you get the same good energy out of it. You know, it's like

269
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.220
Martin Price: With work. You put the energy and and you get paid for it. It makes sense.

270
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:38.280
Dominique Pozo: I'm hearing two things I'm hearing one, the need for connection that you're doing. Yeah. And then I'm also hearing this need for, you know,

271
00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.110
Dominique Pozo: More intimacy with yourself as well. So having

272
00:32:44.220 --> 00:33:01.680
Dominique Pozo: Connection with yourself more and then with somebody on the outside. So I'm just curious how how that could look moving forward in a more balanced way. So it doesn't all go directly, you know that your attention energy doesn't get all directed towards somebody else.

273
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:03.660
Martin Price: Yeah.

274
00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:04.740
Martin Price: I need to

275
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.020
Martin Price: Not just

276
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.860
Martin Price: Jump out of the frying pan into the fire.

277
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.520
Yeah.

278
00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.670
Martin Price: I need to take my time and

279
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:32.550
Martin Price: You know, it's, it's just like on the weekend. What I guess what I'm trying to say is on the weekends I just basically work or I go work out, or I cook. I mean, I don't have a very exciting existence.

280
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.950
Martin Price: It's like kind of being in demand camp out at the construction site and

281
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:48.480
Martin Price: You know, it's just like literally being you know like in the West Texas oil fields or something. It's just a

282
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.800
Martin Price: Lot of guys a lot of construction going on and

283
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.310
Martin Price: You know, very

284
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.470
Martin Price: Rough and Tumble life lifestyle.

285
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:15.450
Dominique Pozo: Right, so I can see how having some connection with you know somebody through these dating sites, it's you know it's offering you some pleasure which is totally a very human need

286
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.100
Martin Price: Huh, yeah, to have a companion. I mean, I've made some friends here but not

287
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.270
Martin Price: Like a real close one.

288
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.060
Martin Price: Like my best friends still in Santa Fe and

289
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.250
Martin Price: And I've been going back like once a month or something, but it's

290
00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.000
Martin Price: You know, I need to. Yeah, I need some like

291

Dominique Pozo: Yeah, definitely.

293
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:41.130

295
00:34:48.420 --> 00:35:02.130
Dominique Pozo: I'm going to really encourage that, you know, when I hear you say it's like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. I think, you know, starting with some, you know, that will, I believe, meet some needs the connection outside of work some joy.

296
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.480
Dominique Pozo: You know, pleasure on different levels with a with a buddy.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:07.470
Right.

Dominique Pozo: I

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.010
Martin Price: Just really haven't done one yet.

300
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.340
Dominique Pozo: How do you think you can

301
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:19.920
Dominique Pozo: Make a little more space for that to happen in your life.

302
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.220
Martin Price: Or opportunities like

303
00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.790
Martin Price: You know I'm in a new town and it's like

304
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:36.690
Martin Price: On a construction site. And it's like, so how do you meet you know I get along really well with the guys at work. They're mostly younger than I am.

305
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.880
Martin Price: Yeah, I just don't know.

306
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.600
Martin Price: Be good for me to make a friend.

307
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.470
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's, that's what I'm hearing. Yeah.

308
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.430
Martin Price: I'll keep trying.

309
00:35:50.790 --> 00:36:02.910
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think you're great Martin. I just want to really acknowledge that you've made some big changes you taking steps and I I totally have faith that you know you're moving in certain directions with a lot of

310
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:05.100
Dominique Pozo: Intention

311
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.110
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean,

312
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:12.270
Martin Price: Getting out of that relationship was the first step. And then, you know,

313
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:19.770
Martin Price: Focusing on recovery and tapering you know from medicine and

314
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.020
Martin Price: I don't know, it's just like I kind of part of me. I do just have to kind of

315
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:36.060
Martin Price: bear it. You know, really it's just kind of a hard time

316
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.560
You know,

317
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.210
Martin Price: That I wish I could be in Santa Fe. Let me put it that way.

318
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.560
Martin Price: You know, and so it's just, I'm trying to make the best of it.

319
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:59.010
Dominique Pozo: Well, that's a good thing to keep in mind that you'd rather be in Santa Fe and maybe in time, you can make that shift again.

320
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:06.870
Martin Price: Yeah. And yeah, I guess. I know a guy that he really likes to bicycle and I'd like to do that.

321
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.780
Martin Price: Maybe I can find some hookups that way.

322
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.910
Dominique Pozo: Well, sounds great. Yeah.

323
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.290
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, something like that.

324
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:14.790
Martin Price: I mean,

325
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:30.240
Martin Price: You know, all in all, and making it through each and every day. I'm can't say that I'm happy joyous and free, but I'm doing you know better. And I'm taking steps to improve my

326
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:31.830
Martin Price: Life.

327
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:47.400
Dominique Pozo: So what would be the three main kind of gifts you can give to your heart. I've heard a number of things. I just wanted to steal it. If you could write down three main things that you could give your heart space moving your

328
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.630
Martin Price: Spirit in in

329
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:57.840
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, your, your heart, your spirit that that inside part that actually where that joy and happiness and freedom emanates from

330
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.520
Martin Price: Really like gratitude, be grateful.

331
00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:40.050
Martin Price: Mm hmm. And then self love and

332
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:46.950
Martin Price: Prayer and spirituality and I have been going to a lot of these kind of evangelical

333
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.580
Martin Price: church services, you know, and I like those cool yeah so

334
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.200
Dominique Pozo: What do you like about them.

335
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.010
Martin Price: This, I don't know, it's just like a power of being in the group.

336
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.470
Martin Price: And

337
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.270
Martin Price: Right I you know they have like a band and

338
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.750
Martin Price: It's very Christian, you know, but it's

339
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.970
Martin Price: I don't care. I mean,

340
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.190
Dominique Pozo: Uplifting

341
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.200
Martin Price: Yeah, it is. And I, I really like the sermons and

342
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:25.440
Martin Price: And I didn't, you know, go into a few na meetings and stuff like that.

343
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:27.870
Martin Price: But they're kind of

344
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:34.200
Martin Price: Getting more few and far between, because the facilities are in are closing, you know,

345
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:40.320
Dominique Pozo: Right. I was just wondering if you would be able to still go to these services. These church services.

346
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:44.580
Martin Price: Yeah, well, that I had to do online this weekend, you know,

347
00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.720
Dominique Pozo: Things.

348
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:46.260
Dominique Pozo: But they

349
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.610
Martin Price: Did their band gatherings and more than 50 people so

350
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.160
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, but they still did it online.

351
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.170
Martin Price: Yeah, they did it online and then

352
00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.890
Martin Price: Any meeting yesterday afternoon to somebody, listen.

353
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.120
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Great.

354
00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:10.710
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I know it's gonna be a really interesting time moving forward just seeing how to stay connected and

355
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.530
Dominique Pozo: Not get to isolated.

356
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.340
Martin Price: Right, right. Because isolation for me is really bad. That's

357
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:24.840
Martin Price: I actually, you know, work for me is is healthy for me because I, you know, keeps me around other people

358
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:41.370
Martin Price: Yeah. And because I isolation is like a really, if you're like trying to sort of recover and, you know, make your life better and everything like that. I don't, I don't think it's about staying at home and being alone, that's for sure.

359
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.290
Martin Price: Yeah, not for me anyway.

360
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:43.830
Yeah.

361
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:45.630
Dominique Pozo: So,

362
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.770
Martin Price: I don't know anything.

363
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:58.410
Martin Price: You know I know intellectually like all the recovery things to do and everything like that. And I just have to like

364
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.200
Martin Price: Keep keep up my spiritual practice and prayer.

365
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:13.770
Dominique Pozo: So what did you do write down three specifics around your heart.

366
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:19.410
Martin Price: Was gratitude self love and prayer set in prayer spirituality

367
00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.190
Dominique Pozo: Great. That's a really solid things to focus on

368
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:24.030
Yeah.

369
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:47.640
Martin Price: I think if I can. He perspective, you know, I'm not starving. You know, I've got a good job. My daughter's doing a lot better with her schizophrenia and, you know, all those things and stay in gratitude, rather than just, you know, same, to hell with the world, you know,

370
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.460
Martin Price: God must hate me to

371
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.620
Martin Price: Put me in a relationship like that or something or

372
00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.570
Martin Price: I just don't want to go there, you know. Yeah.

373
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.490
Martin Price: So are you in Hawaii now.

374
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:12.960
Martin Price: I am, yeah. What is it like 10 in the morning or

375
00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.810
Dominique Pozo: Oh no, it's almost three in the afternoon.

376
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.380
Martin Price: Oh, yes. Okay. All right. You're like four hours behind us, or something.

377
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.190
Yeah, we're

378
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.540
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

379
00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:34.320
Martin Price: Yeah, that we had a guy that was supposed to go to the Virgin Islands today, to go like snorkeling with his buddies, but he would had to be in quarantine for 14 days before they'd let him, you know,

380
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.650
Martin Price: travel freely around the islands, so

381
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.600
Martin Price: I wish they lubrication

382
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:49.020
Dominique Pozo: I wish they would do that here you know I we I feel super vulnerable here on the island and we there's yeah it's just

383
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.910
Martin Price: Because there's so many people flying in and out.

384
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:58.530
Dominique Pozo: Well, the it's dropped a lot tourism has dropped a lot, although there still are people flying flying over and

385
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:11.760
Dominique Pozo: I, yeah, I really wish they would make it much harder to get in here because at the moment we're I think we're doing okay. There's only only been a couple cases here.

386
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.370
Dominique Pozo: I don't know.

387
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:16.650
Dominique Pozo: What yeah

388
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:22.170
Martin Price: Well, they kind of were going crazy about it here. So it's like a day to day thing so

389
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:25.200
Martin Price: Is staying in gratitude is really important.

390
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.510
Dominique Pozo: Definitely me

391
00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:39.240
Dominique Pozo: About the forgiveness piece that one. I didn't, I didn't hear any of your actions are on the forgiveness.

392
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.310
Martin Price: It was just, it was forgiveness of myself.

393
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.230
Martin Price: You know, for

394
00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:50.010
Martin Price: Kind of like letting her guilt me into

395
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:51.240
Martin Price: Like

396
00:43:52.470 --> 00:44:08.550
Martin Price: To keep giving your money and then stay in this relationship that I wasn't, you know, I liked her. But I, you know, just just became this huge guilt thing you know and and that just became what she was all about. So I'm, you know, to me it's like forgiveness of myself for

397
00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:12.660
Martin Price: Letting it go on for so long.

398
00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.440
Dominique Pozo: You know,

399
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.420
Martin Price: You give me your money and

400
00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:17.280
Martin Price: And

401
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:28.650
Martin Price: Just, again, to me it's like I'm trying not to become bitter. I don't want to like live the rest of my gaze Peter about this thing that happened, you know, it's

402
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.780
Martin Price: I just kind of want to like accept it as the past and

403
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.450
Martin Price: Try and look towards the future, you know,

404
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.100
Martin Price: That's the only way I can

405
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.670
Martin Price: I don't want to sit there and dwell on it every day.

406
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:51.480
Dominique Pozo: That sounds healthy, you know, not being in denial and kind of bypassing it yet also not giving it so much energy

407
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.820
Martin Price: Yeah, I went through a lot of them.

408
00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:04.530
Martin Price: Probably been for like a month there. I was really enjoying really low periods, you know, very depressed and

409
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.130
Martin Price: I don't know, I just got tired of being that way.

410
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.660
Martin Price: So hopefully my little spirits coming out.

411
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:22.620
Dominique Pozo: Well how powerful that you can just choose to not do that, you know, some people that are suffering from depression. They can't pull themselves out. Or at least that's what I hear. So

412
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:35.970
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. You know how I think what a it just speaks to your resilience and you know your capacity to actually control your mind to a point to not not really sink in and get stuck there.

413
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:42.030
Martin Price: Well, I knew that the medicine helps with depression. For me, that's for sure.

414
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.000
Martin Price: Uh huh. So yeah, and

415
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:57.180
Martin Price: Like I remember it like once I stopped before it probably took you know bad two, three weeks before you even start to sleep, you know,

416
00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:07.830
Martin Price: Uh huh. It can be pretty pretty heavy duty. So we'll see what happens. I'm kind of just like on a little pink cloud today, I guess. And so

417
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.810
Martin Price: Well, enough about that.

418
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:24.600
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, enjoy that. And it's, I think those pink cloud days they are little openings to keep reminding self of the things that are helpful because you can access them when you're in the pink cloud. And then you can go back and remember

419
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:30.270
Martin Price: Yeah, yeah, just to know that it's like depression is temporary.

420
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:32.130
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

421
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.730
Martin Price: That's just about kind of sums it up for me today.

422
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:47.190
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Well, I just want to honor your time and you know we did start late. We started like

423
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:53.790
Dominique Pozo: About 10 minutes late, and we still have it's only 657 so

424
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.480
Dominique Pozo: Let's do you want to look at the calendar, we can start with that.

425
00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.850
Martin Price: Yeah. Or like, do you like other meditation or something. I like doing that.

426
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.530
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's do that for sure.

427
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.970
Dominique Pozo: Do you want to look at the calendar first so you don't have to think after the meditation.

428
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:15.720
Martin Price: Yeah, I mean, we could do you want to do two weeks from tonight means

429
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:22.620
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, this works great. So I'm gonna just put it into my calendar.

430
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:28.440
Dominique Pozo: Let's see.

431
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.350
Dominique Pozo: So that would be the 30th.

432
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.000
Martin Price: Yeah.

433
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:37.110

Dominique Pozo: My computer is so slow today. It's just, everything's. There we go. Just went in. Okay, great.

438
00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.870
Dominique Pozo: Okay dokey.

439
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.050
Dominique Pozo: Okay, let's do a meditation, so

440
00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:08.340
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so just go ahead and close your eyes, if that feels good for you today and

441
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.810
Dominique Pozo: Just taking a few deep breaths without

442
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.570
Dominique Pozo: Without trying to do anything.

443
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.340
Dominique Pozo: Or move you mind anywhere just focusing on the breath.

444
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:37.230
Dominique Pozo: Really noticing that inhale. And what happens as you inhale, what parts of your body.

445
00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:40.860
Dominique Pozo: are raised and lifted up.

446
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.340
Dominique Pozo: And then as you exhale, what happens

447
00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.130
Dominique Pozo: With the exhalation.

448
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.270
Dominique Pozo: And then starting to scan from the top of your head.

449
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:27.870
Dominique Pozo: Kind of moving down your forehead and the back of your skull and noticing what you feel and sense in your

450
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:36.090
Dominique Pozo: facial area, your facial muscles, the bones in your cranium and your jaw your mouth.

451
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:50.880
Dominique Pozo: And down into the throat.

452
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:00.300
Dominique Pozo: Your neck a front of your through

453
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.760
Dominique Pozo: Down into the chest.

454
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:38.160
Dominique Pozo: And then really using that exhale to drop any muscles that you might be feeling tension in from your cranium to the upper chest right now, just use that exhale and drop

455
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:43.800
Dominique Pozo: Drop any of that tension down towards the ground, allowing gravity to just have it.

456
00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.270
Dominique Pozo: And then moving from the chest down to the belly.

457
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.620
Dominique Pozo: I'm feeling the belly release with the exhale

458
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:32.310
Dominique Pozo: And then move in your attention to the low back.

459
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.780
Dominique Pozo: Just noticing what's going on and not low back down into the sacred

460
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.220
Dominique Pozo: And the pelvis.

461
00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:02.520
Dominique Pozo: And then moving your attention to the hip flexor, so those are the muscles around your glutes.

462
00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:10.170
Dominique Pozo: And just with the exhale. Just imagine that you're just giving them a little more relaxation

463
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:22.800
Dominique Pozo: so your hips can kind of drop and spread open and really allowing for some space and breath to move into the hips.

464
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:29.280
Dominique Pozo: If you can imagine that, you know, if you can imagine breathing deeply into the hip space.

465
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:47.490
Dominique Pozo: And then sweeping down from the hips to the knees.

466
00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.300
Dominique Pozo: Just paying attention to what you feel.

467
00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:56.730
Dominique Pozo: On both upper legs.

468
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.380
Dominique Pozo: And then from the knees down to the ankles.

469
00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:14.190
Dominique Pozo: Just noticing the sensations on both shins.

470
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:17.430
Dominique Pozo: Into the feet.

471
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:57.000
Dominique Pozo: Taking a big, full body. Inhale, from head to toe. Just imagine you're inhaling filling all the space of your body and then exhaling out and as you exhale, it's like rays of light coming out in every direction. Go ahead and do that a few more times. So, inhaling from head to toe.

472
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:02.490
Dominique Pozo: Filling that inner space with fresh breath.

473
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.010
Dominique Pozo: And then exhale, in

474
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:13.530
Dominique Pozo: Completely

475
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:28.380
Dominique Pozo: And just imagining that you're this vessel, you're, you're like a vessel that is receiving input and

476
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.700
Dominique Pozo: Energy and

477
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:42.330
Dominique Pozo: sounds, smells visual images, all the time, your vessels, you know, receiving that and then your vessel can also release anything that it doesn't want

478
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:49.620
Dominique Pozo: So just clearing and kind of sweeping your vessel clean and making room for what you do want

479
00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:01.650
Dominique Pozo: Great. So really using that breath to sweep your, your vessel clear

480
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:03.960
Dominique Pozo: Making space.

481
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.530
Martin Price: Me sleepy.

482
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.530
Dominique Pozo: Oh, good. Great. Okay.

483
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:31.560
Martin Price: Well, thank you. And then we'll see in a couple weeks.

484
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.780
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Sounds good. Well, I'll see you in group.

485
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:34.710
Martin Price: All right.

486
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:44.190
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Okay. Take care. Martin. Yeah. Good job. I think you're doing great. I just want to say, okay, thank you. Okay. All right. Bye bye.
