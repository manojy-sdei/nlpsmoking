Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I kind of do my own schedule as much as I possibly can. It just seems to be better. You know that way. So when I emailed you and switched our appointment. It's because I just started a new group at that time at 10am

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.950
Amanda: Yeah, and I said I barely noticed today. I was like, wow, but I didn't know right away because I, you know, like I was trying to get to that meeting.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.360
Amanda: I was trying but I found out right away.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.430
Amanda: Well, I wanted to tell you that I did shy data. Remember how you said not to be try

74
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.880
Amanda: To say, oh, I don't mean to be rude.

75
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:37.050
Amanda: Yeah. OK. So the other day I remember I told you I didn't go into the storage and stuff like that like trying to get

76
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.270
Amanda: Our stuff out. Yeah, so

77
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.380
Amanda: I got it on the 21st of last month and I really didn't

78
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.730
Amanda: I really hadn't thought about paying my storage until the 21st of this month.

79
00:06:48.270 --> 00:07:02.490
Amanda: Right. And then I was like, Oh, why should we pay a year or three pay $50 with a 75 someone was supposed to pay $15 a month and then I got insurance. So it's only going to be like, you know, $26 a month. So then

80
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:12.330
Amanda: I don't know why I said let me look at my little envelope but it told me that I had paid $38. I was like, wait a minute. So, and I call it to the store to place. And he goes,

81
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:22.380
Amanda: Oh, let me talk to Serena and I'll call you back in about 15 minutes. I said, Okay, well, uh, you know, take your time however long you know just get back to me. You said okay

82
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:31.470
Amanda: That was at 1030 at four o'clock. I didn't hear nothing back. So then I call back and syringe answer is yes. Totally snotty with me from the very beginning.

83
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:43.050
Amanda: Since we already paid the $27 and I was. She goes, You're a sign your contract. I go, I understand that. She goes, you haven't looked at your paper all month. I said, Why would I pay my rent paid. Why would I care.

84
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.610
Amanda: And she goes, Well, you're, you're creating you're locked in. And I said, Well, if you're going to fucking job.

85
00:07:48.510 --> 00:08:01.980
Amanda: And I was like, you know, I'm just assuming I'm going to call corporate so then she was. Go ahead. Don't hung up on her. And I call over there. And I said, You know, I'm, I'm already a little irritated and if I come off Ruth. I don't mean to you. I said that lady was completely rude to me.

86
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.210
Amanda: And he understood, like right when I said it like

87
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.390
Amanda: I don't think I was not able to kind of could have been

88
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:19.800
Amanda: Yeah, they told him that I was naughty with her, but she came at me like that. First, and I could have been more route, but I just I just hung up on her. Someone's going to get anywhere with her.

89
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.550
Right.

90
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.560
Amanda: So,

91
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.500
Amanda: They're gonna fix it now, but

92
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.020
Amanda: I shouldn't even had to go through all that

93
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.010
Amanda: It literally he had done his job right. I wouldn't be in this mess.

94
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:32.760
Right.

95
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.800
Amanda: Um, but yeah, I should still over viewed it too, and I could have caught it. Then, but

96
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.820
Amanda: It says he was new. It was fresh excuse taking forever took me an hour and a half to rent a storage shed.

97
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.880
Amanda: Oh wow, that's a long time.

98
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a long time.

99
00:08:50.100 --> 00:09:01.380
Amanda: So I was. I wasn't trying to be rude. I just think okay with you. I'm going to show you how to do the code. I said, No, thank you. And how did you because I was really tired of being in there. So yeah, I didn't look at that envelope so partially it's my fault too.

100
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.710
Amanda: But why would I look at my how much is do when I'm booked covered almost like she

101
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.210
Amanda: seemed like it was my fault.

102
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.960
Amanda: And I know you

103
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so what happened with corporate

104
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.440
Amanda: She actually just called and said that if I can email her to $15 that go change the price.

105
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.580
Amanda: And I have my paper saying that I got it for 15

106
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.530
Amanda: So,

107
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.290
Amanda: It took them three days to call me too.

108
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I bet.

109
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.450
Amanda: So as long as they and I put on there, a lot that I don't want to

110
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:46.650
Amanda: Like, I don't want to get charged late fees because I'm trying to pay it on time. But she said they won't try to me and no late fees in

111
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:57.600
Amanda: And everything's we take care of as soon as she won't get back to me till Saturday, because I told her that I was encountering right now and they close at six days.

112
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.050
Amanda: We're gonna have to go to counseling and I will email it to her after I was done.

113
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.430
She said, Okay.

114
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

115
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.010
Amanda: Luck. A good

116
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:14.910
Amanda: That I'm not trying not to pay the rent that could have a lower I have to walk upstairs for the storage. I could have paid $30 to be on the ground.

117
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:15.870
Right.

118
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:17.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

119
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.210
So,

120
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:29.460
Amanda: But I took care of that. And I did your suggestion, instead of going in yelling at the second person when it really wasn't as well. But I wouldn't mean I wasn't trying to yell at him. But that's how it came off.

121
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

122
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.900
Amanda: Yeah, try to get myself.

123
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.550
Amanda: Off the phone before I get

124
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.950
Amanda: Irritated because

125
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.910
Amanda: You just say stuff when you're mean and you shouldn't

126
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You say things when you're mad.

127
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:52.710
Amanda: Again, like Angelina, she just oh my god I try to get up on I think I literally had to hang up on her.

128
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm sorry you experienced that.

129
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, definitely. It's just

130
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.860
Amanda: I think if everybody just working so much and

131
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.190
Amanda: Just go go go like robot.

132
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:18.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah. Very much so. And that's, you know, exactly right. You know, if we could put herself in somebody else's shoes that we would understand. You know what I mean.

133
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She was working too much. So I said, You're irritating me I hang up right now like

134
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.690
Amanda: A call back a little bit or something. It's just weren't getting anywhere with that conversation.

135
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, it just

136
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:35.550
Amanda: We would have gone through a window for the next 20 minutes. Still got nowhere. She didn't believe anything I was saying.

137
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:47.430
Amanda: That she kept telling me that ganja. And I didn't even know who the girl was. I didn't know what I said why not a switch in the middle of this. Where did she come from. Nobody even told me about that girl.

138
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right about Danielle.

139
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.370
Amanda: Yeah, I've never heard that name before till the other day last Thursday.

140
00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:09.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Danielle does a lot of, I don't know what all she does, but I do know that she works a lot with the insurance companies to make sure that you know you guys are covered. I do knows that she does that, and I know that she backs the doctors up and

141
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:19.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, make sure that prescriptions get filled if something happens that she's on the phone with the pharmacy. I mean, she does a lot of, you know, a lot of stuff.

142
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:27.420
Amanda: She had said that, I think that the reason why I didn't go with her is because she wasn't seeing individual patients at that time.

143
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:36.900
Amanda: Because all I do. Rebecca. Call me if I was supposed to be over there but I figured it out because I chose a 730 group that's why we have

144
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.860
Amanda: Danielle.

145
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.840
Amanda: I didn't know us wants to be with my counselor and my doctor in the group. Nobody told me that either.

146
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:43.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

147
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:56.310
Amanda: When I chose 130 that was a makeup group and then I liked it. So I've just decided to stay in it because it's easier for me to get you. I didn't know that you're supposed to be with your counselor and your doctor in group to

148
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.870
Amanda: Yeah now told me that

149
00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:58.650
Yeah.

150
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.770
Amanda: Angelina supposed to be telling me all this stuff. It's like, I tell you, she doesn't help me.

151
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.590
Amanda: frustrates me

152
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.090
Amanda: I know that

153
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:18.480
Amanda: Until Angela chill Danielle called me and told me that that's why they think that I'm supposed to be with her because that's the group. I chose

154
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well now we've got it worked out.

155
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.760
Amanda: Yeah, now I'm all better

156
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, it's all good. Now you're with the right people at the right time.

157
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.430
When you're so young.

158
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:39.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now you know that, you know, check your email periodic, you know. Yeah, but my plan is to keep you at this time going forward.

159
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. All right, so that we don't get

160
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get these issues anymore as matter of fact, let me just triple check

161
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.580
Amanda: I think I can even do something when you email me, I can make a different sound.

162
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh yeah, you probably can.

163
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.260
Amanda: I think I can.

164
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.900
Amanda: Because I'm telling you my phone goes on. It just went off right now it goes off constantly about emails like

165
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.420
Amanda: I just might need to change it or something, cuz

166
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:17.520
Amanda: I

167
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:27.420
Amanda: Want to be able to know it's an email. Go check it. You know what I mean. It's important I sometimes go with Twitter. It's Harbor Freight it's just

168
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.790
Amanda: Kind of, I don't even look at it for three or four days because there's so many now.

169
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.270
Amanda: I don't even think of him to get like a month.

170
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.800
Amanda: Oh wait, my phone when we

171
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:43.860
Amanda: Are Rebecca's unmute

172
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I was on mute.

173
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.190
Amanda: Sorry. Yeah, I was like, wait, I put my phone on mute.

174
00:14:52.650 --> 00:15:01.290
Amanda: Yeah, when I get my, I have a bar right here. And I have barstools so I'm going to get my computer. So when I go over there. I could just turn it on and

175
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.720
Amanda: But I had boxes. All right there and had boxes in front of that the other day and

176
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.790
Amanda: I want to get it to where I could just go sit at my computer and all this stuff is right there.

177
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

178
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:15.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yet

179
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.550
Amanda: I don't know if my phone is gonna get hot.

180
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do guy your computer setup over there.

181
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.770
Amanda: Yeah, it's like I just have to turn it on and then

182
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.520
Amanda: I don't have it on because I'm not

183
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:46.770
Amanda: Because they didn't have a place for it all the time. So, now, now that the bars cleaned up. I want to put it there, close it. So I could just opened it all the time at boxes all blocking right there. Now that I don't have it like that. I could, um, it'll be easier for me to be there.

184
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:56.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, good, good, good, good, good. That'll make a difference to when you get your, your, you know, space, the way that you want it to be.

185
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Here, just to be able to go and sign on.

186
00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.030
Amanda: Know, Casey look over here, all those boxes you see him.

187
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.450
Amanda: Yeah, those are empty boxes.

188
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, OK.

189
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:17.910
Amanda: Now I'm done. But I had boxes all over here and all in the front we barely could just walk through, but now. All that's gone now. So now I could start cleaning and getting

190
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:24.180
Amanda: Put my little office right there to where I could just always be on my computer, instead of my phone.

191
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:26.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good.

192
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.770
Amanda: Yeah, I think that's what and I think you don't move so much with the phone because I don't ever see you moving

193
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me I'm I'm I'm on a laptop. Yeah.

194
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:41.430
Amanda: Yeah, that's why. And I noticed when I was on my laptop. It was different. It wasn't moving like those other people in group.

195
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.150
Yeah.

196
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:48.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's different when you're on your phone, it picks up everything. You know, it really does work to be

197
00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.680
Amanda: My earbuds on because

198
00:16:53.370 --> 00:17:01.410
Amanda: I have neighbors and they're out there walking their dogs and I just want them to hear everybody or what you're saying, or side is always have my earphones on

199
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, which is a good definitely a good idea. You know what I mean. You don't want anybody to know your business.

200
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.120
For sure. No.

201
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:18.210
Amanda: I'm a very quiet person. I mean, you, the only reason why you notice if I tell you, but they can't go around listening don't really say nothing.

202
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.690
Amanda: And people can't hurt you.

203
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:22.830
Yeah.

204
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.410
Amanda: You things against you.

205
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:28.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Use things against you. That's right.

206
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:38.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But also you don't want to stay completely secluded. You know what I mean. You want to, you know, at least try to

207
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Advocate couple of, you know, have a couple people.

208
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.880
Amanda: Well, I have friends and stuff like that. They just wanted to know my business, unless I want to tell them

209
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you're right. Totally.

210
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.570
Amanda: wrecked my it can only hear this part of the conversation.

211
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:05.850
Amanda: But it's no good if you can hear the other part. That's why I have my earphones on what I mean group where I'm with you because

212
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:14.520
Amanda: I mean, I just told him right now because they called me over there. I was like, well, I gotta go to count in right now. Okay, a little bit every day. No, just, they don't need to know everything about me.

213
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's true. Definitely. So what have you been up to. What have you been doing

214
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.600
Amanda: In your downtime, just that.

215
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're not

216
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

217
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.080
Amanda: I have literally just been cleaning from

218
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.930
Amanda: Morning tonight, literally.

219
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:45.210
Amanda: Just like I couldn't clean the bathroom was so dirty like FINALLY GOT THE DISHES, DONE. IT'S JUST YOU GET ONE ROOM done and then I literally my dad brought steps I unpack those boxes into little boxes because they were having a could carry them upstairs.

220
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:52.230
Amanda: Every box. He brought I had a downside to tell most three to four one box. They had to go to have six because they were movies.

221
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.450
Amanda: So I literally spent all my time repacking the boxes, he brought me.

222
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:12.150
Amanda: Then I had other boxes that I had that I needed to take out of here, because under the bed. There's two boards and then our beds there. So we had to stop under there. So I had to put those into smaller boxes because I put them in tomato boxes.

223
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:22.170
Amanda: Nobody to have to help me going up and down the stairs I could do two at a time by myself. We have a bigger box you can pack a heavier box.

224
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:30.600
Amanda: Right, so I just kind of made them all the size of tomato boxes. You know those office boxes that you guys get need to take off the lid.

225
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

226
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.830
Amanda: That's how it is tomato boxes, just like that.

227
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:42.630
Amanda: So whatever could fit in there is what I did. If not I fit it in another one. It's pretty much my whole shit is the mailboxes.

228
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

229
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:48.360
Amanda: Don't have to depend on nobody to help me. And then my wife's lake is

230
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:55.680
Amanda: To can banish hasn't been here for three years now. Wow. The car to go up and down stairs.

231
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

232
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So this or your apartment is it

233
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is it upstairs, your permit.

234
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.970
Amanda: Know my apartment level, but my storage is upstairs.

235
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:10.770
Amanda: Okay, that's why I'm complaining about the $15 I really wouldn't complain about it. But like I said, I would have got it downstairs unit.

236
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.800
Amanda: Yeah, yeah. For the $30

237
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:21.240
Amanda: But now that all that's done, like, you know, I would add a clean and mop and do all that, but

238
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.300
Amanda: Let me know in the last time I just in my room. I had so much of that link from the ceiling fan.

239
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.770
Amanda: Yeah, that I need to that I needed to clean off. I don't like the walls.

240
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:40.920
Amanda: I smoke in my house and I know it stinks. I can't smell it, but I'm pretty sure if somebody doesn't smoke something here. They could smell it.

241
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.070
Amanda: Yeah, and I don't like that you know I smoke. I still don't like it. So I haven't cleaned the walls.

242
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.180
Amanda: Like now i'm going to start cleaning, cleaning, just because

243
00:20:53.190 --> 00:21:00.690
Amanda: The sweat from the like the air conditioner. The, the humidity makes it the walls run down or whatever.

244
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.410
Yeah.

245
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.260
Amanda: That's what I get to start doing now.

246
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The condensation

247
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.600
Amanda: Yeah. And then my wife takes hot showers like whenever she's hurting at night.

248
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:20.700
Amanda: Yes, the shower with the hot water and I could see it bad in the bathroom that i is probably from the other people too. Who knows.

249
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:27.510
Amanda: Yeah, I haven't seen the walls in a year. So I usually do it every six months, but we were just so crowded in here.

250
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:37.320
Amanda: I would move everything to make it look good to ritual a decent, but then in order to get something you had to move 10 things

251
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.280
Amanda: And now it's not like that anymore.

252
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now you're getting space you're cleaning your area. Yeah.

253
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you're able to to get the walls.

254
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:55.620
Amanda: Yeah, be able to do that all the time. I could just go wipe them down real quick, not where it has to be a whole day to do it.

255
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.580
Amanda: Yeah i i have for Captain one big dog.

256
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

257
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:11.010
Amanda: I can handle cat hair. I can handle it. I can handle any credit here on me. So when I leave the house I go to my bathroom and get dressed walks out the door.

258
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:24.690
Amanda: Then when I come back I changed back into different clothes because they have cat hair on me all over again. So when I want to do laundry. I have to change my shirt to do laundry, so I don't get cat hair on my laundry.

259
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:25.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

260
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.420
Amanda: And they're not allowed in the bathroom or the kick in my bath in my closet.

261
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.850
Amanda: So it's like a journey for me to do some to do laundry.

262
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:45.360
Amanda: Yeah, yeah. I mean this close, but if I want to go finish the laundry. I'll have to change or take a shower not touched nothing and just do the laundry.

263
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:52.050
Amanda: Now you got to talk to. It's like I have to do steps when it normally wouldn't take away that long.

264
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.400
Amanda: Without a one cat hero. Who are my clean clothes.

265
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's right. We all have our own little

266
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Our own little routines and our own little torts. And you know what I mean, things that we have to do.

267
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:18.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely on a day to day basis. You know what I mean if is what makes you comfortable than us. You keep up with your, with your stuff, you know,

268
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:31.950
Amanda: I've seen this girl come to work with cat and dog hair all over herself. I was like, Do you really expect to make sandwiches, like that. I said, I can't let you work up to send you home or go get a different shirt because I would see the cat hair lighten the food.

269
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.900
Amanda: Yeah, offer for

270
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:39.780
Amanda: I said, just because you have animals doesn't mean everybody has to know that either like

271
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.000
Amanda: She would come out like if she used her sure as one of the lit rollers.

272
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:52.440
Amanda: I just think that I wouldn't want. I wouldn't want to go get food like that. So I don't do it to other people.

273
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah I don't blame you.

274
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't play me that's being really conscious about other people. You know what I mean.

275
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.810
Amanda: I don't want it done to me. So why would I do it to somebody else.

276
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think that that's pretty pretty respectful if he asked me.

277
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:18.960

278
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.040
Amanda: I literally have to run back to the bathroom at my clothes off.

279
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:34.650
Amanda: That because the dog doesn't the dogs not allowed on the furniture. If I can get the cast, not to be on the furniture, I'd be great. But I don't know how to train them not to do that.

280
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.620

Amanda: I told you that we were homeless. Right.

290
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:34.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

291
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:44.430
Amanda: So my son left or I had a place at the time. And then I couldn't stay there anymore. And I told him to come get his dog. And he said, Oh, well, you said you were going to help me.

292
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:59.250
Amanda: I said I did when I had a place I don't have a place now COME GET HER because what you said. I said, Anthony come get your dog. SO HE DIDN'T COME GET HER. So I ended up staying with her and then I really couldn't go anywhere because it wouldn't let me have my dog so

293
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.750
Amanda: It was at her, give her up to the dog pound so we decided to stand apart.

294
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.270
Amanda: So we did that for five months, six months and I told him that he couldn't have her back.

295
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.050
Amanda: Okay, I'll take her. I said, now you'll take her

296
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.100
Amanda: Three times to get your dog because then I went to stay at my cousins, but then my dog and his dog got in a fight.

297
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:28.380
Amanda: So they asked me to leave, which I understand what they said. Get rid of it, which just send it back draft and so I tried. He didn't get her then either

298
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:37.200
Amanda: I said, You haven't paid me for food, you haven't done nothing I've asked you three different times together. And now you want to back. I still didn't kiss my ass. You're not getting her back.

299
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:42.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And got they're all these all this, these issues for that, you know, to keep the

300
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.980
Amanda: I could have gave her to the dog pound and he went to God or anyways.

301
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.940
Amanda: You just don't give away your family like that you try and do it if I couldn't do it, then I would have given her up, but

302
00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.060
Amanda: Because I had seven cast when I left here. See, and I have one of them now.

303
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.990
Amanda: One of the ones I have is what I've had him for five years already.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:33.480
Amanda: Maybe was better. My dad said that he got into Steve casspi because if she had died with me. I probably would have got charged with something

330
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did she die of St.

331
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.650
Amanda: That's what they said. But

332
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:44.400
Amanda: I didn't know she was sick today before and I saw her into gave her her shots and in less than 24 hours she died.

333
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:46.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

334
00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.750
Amanda: So I don't, I don't really know what happened.

335
00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did you ever see the autopsy.

336
00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.990
Amanda: Yeah, they don't even say that she got her thoughts.

337
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:00.810
It says

338
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.400
Amanda: It just, it says a lot of separatists shared abrasions here.

339
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.240
Amanda: I don't think anybody ever really really explained it to me. But I seen the autopsy. But they said like

340
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.440
Amanda: That's a closet that she went with a blank and she rolled over into stop reading

341
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.310
Amanda: And I think that more than I

342
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.190
Amanda: Then I understand.

343
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.990
Amanda: puncture wounds on the side of her leg like by her ankle.

344
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:28.980
Yeah.

345
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:30.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like

346
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.640
Amanda: Like a snake that you, I don't think it was, but like those two exact like right next to each other.

347
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.080
Amanda: Yeah, I saw with my own eyes when I looked at her right after

348
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.240
Amanda: They did the autopsy.

349
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:51.720
Amanda: You know, the water from Santa Fe. I went to a funeral place. And that's what I saw on her, but it doesn't show that in the autopsy either

350
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:53.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

351
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.250
Amanda: Yeah, it took me six months to get it.

352
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh my god.

353
00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:06.390
Amanda: To the long time for me to get that autopsy report and I see on TV that they get it back in like three days.

354
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, I know that.

355
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:10.410
Amanda: So long.

356
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sometimes it takes a lot longer than other times I

357
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely, I have my

358
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:25.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My last grandson died of SIDS and it took us

359
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:38.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Probably it took us a couple months to to get as autopsy because I didn't believe either that he, you know, I wanted to make sure that it wasn't foul play or, you know, you know,

360
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.930
Amanda: Actually if I sent you the archives. You can tell me what it says.

361
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:45.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

362
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:46.980
Amanda: I know, yeah.

363
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.250
Amanda: They all send it to you through email or maybe through Adobe you have Adobe

364
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I believe I do. I'm sure I didn't miss

365
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:08.880
Amanda: 100 Joby you it's on my phone, but it links to everything I have but you take a picture of it and then you could send it through Adobe so i don't i mean i have a printer in a scanner. I do but

366
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:15.180
Amanda: I could just scan them through my phone. I just take a picture of it and it send you the whole big picture. You could print it out.

367
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.600
Amanda: Or I could send it to you in the mail. It doesn't matter, but

368
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:27.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Whatever is easier for you. I can definitely you know, take a look at it and decipher it for you, for sure.

369
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:36.000
Amanda: And then they want to sit there and tell you they want me to go to grief counseling and tell me how she died. And I said, You want to tell me how she died. But you don't even know how should I

370
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:41.580
Amanda: Did I don't I don't understand. I said, I don't think I need to talk to you right now.

371
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.290
Amanda: Because how do you explain to me when they don't even know what it is.

372
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:47.040
Yeah.

373
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I

374
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:49.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Don't know.

375
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.900
Amanda: Making me. Let me listen to you.

376
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:52.860
Amanda: Yeah.

377
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:57.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, they don't you know they don't know what they do is they rule out

378
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:08.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A bunch of stuff when it comes to, you know, a baby passing away like that. Like they make sure that there's you know nothing in the baby's throat, they make sure that the there's nothing in the toxicology nothing in the blood.

379
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They make sure you know they check the body they make sure that there's nothing you know know when they can't find any cause of death. It's rule. The since

380
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.260
Amanda: Its rules after the

381
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Baby just went to sleep and and passed away.

382
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But

383
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't know.

384
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:40.980
Amanda: It's just weird because it was, um, so it was, I guess the paternal grandparents. It was his. It was his parents and it was his mom and dad who always had the kids and the brother was living there too.

385
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:47.130
Amanda: And I'm not opposed to smoking weed. Whatever, I don't care. I don't do it. I used to do it a long time ago, but I don't do it.

386
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:54.690
Amanda: He's a grown adult the mom and dad went to watch a movie which they never go to see the movies. But this one day they did.

387
00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:06.420
Amanda: So then Eric. Eric. Eric sionko you put the boys down to watch a movie left greener over there in the in the parents room and he went to Israel.

388
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:13.770
Amanda: Obviously to smoke weed and paint, but he's going to tell that. But I know what he went to do. And he came back and she wasn't breathing.

389
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.590
Amanda: Why would you leave her by herself.

390
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:18.690
Amanda: Period.

391
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.990
Amanda: Oh, you're leaving with the boys or something.

392
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.260
Amanda: Right. And it's that one day that

393
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.230
Amanda: The grandparents go out to a movie.

394
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.950
Amanda: It's just weird all of its weird to me.

395
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:33.030
Yeah.

396
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And he sent a signal.

397
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.230
Amanda: Mexico because he said that they were gonna kill him. I said, Who didn't do nothing.

398
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:49.770
Amanda: But I don't know. I find out the truth. He said he used to hear things in his head that people were trying to kill him.

399
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:52.410
Amanda: uncle said that

400
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

401
00:33:54.630 --> 00:34:01.530
Amanda: He's not he's not crazy. He's, he's intelligent, he went to college and, well, why would you hear things you didn't feel guilty.

402
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.930
Amanda: Why would stuff happens. You like that, if nothing if you didn't do nothing wrong.

403
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.110
Amanda: Right, so I don't know.

404
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:20.640
Amanda: Maybe a death make somebody crazy. I don't know why I don't know why would do that. If you didn't do nothing wrong. It shouldn't bother you. You were just watching the baby, you're passed away.

405
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that anybody

406
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:32.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That it happens on their watch, so to speak, is going to experience a huge amount of guilt.

407
00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.070
Amanda: Over it. And I think that's what happened.

408
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:37.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

409
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.030
Amanda: And it's funny that you say that because whenever I wrote the car in November.

410
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:46.500
Amanda: October. It wasn't my fault or nothing but

411
00:34:47.820 --> 00:35:00.660
Amanda: Maybe I could have done something different. But as soon as I got out of the car. I turned to Chelsea and I started crying and I told her that I was sorry that I heard her because she had cut right here. And then on her arm. And I felt like that because I was the one driving

412
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:01.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

413
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:18.750
Amanda: She was like, it wasn't your fault, but now I know what people say. Because I have a scar right here cuz I was in a horrible accident and the kid's dad. He was like, Oh, I'm so sorry I hurt you, like you didn't mean to do it. But now I know. Maybe that's why he felt like that because

414
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

415
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.150
Amanda: She died, he was watching her.

416
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:28.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it can definitely bring out on a lot of a lot of guilt, you know, whether it's his

417
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Place kill you know

418
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right guilt. If you should be experiencing or if you shouldn't be.

419
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, what have you had a baby. The fact of the matter is a baby was in his care.

420
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it happened. And you know I wouldn't want that.

421
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I wouldn't want that on anybody you know

422
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.320
Amanda: Let me either.

423
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:52.830
Amanda: And then maybe my dad said, you know, maybe you know cuz I was drinking and stuff like that and

424
00:35:53.850 --> 00:36:01.920
Amanda: I had already gotten the kids had gotten in trouble for I was intoxicated with the kids didn't click with my kids till after

425
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:10.140
Amanda: July after like a week after that. But so what if I had been drunk and she did that I would have got charged with that.

426
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:10.920
Yeah.

427
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Possibly, yeah.

428
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.570
Amanda: I could see her making 150 million reasons, but I'll still never know.

429
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:34.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, and that's really true. And so, you know, when we have situations like this, we have to just kind of live in the in the question, you know, and know that there's there's certain questions that never going to be answered. We're never going to have the right answers for him.

430
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:40.470
Amanda: Because I've always want. I always wanted a girl, but he just wasn't meant to be so.

431
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.250
Amanda: That I've come to that conclusion.

432
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.990
Amanda: It took me a long time to get there. I mean, I was really angry at first, but

433
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:50.070
Sure.

434
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:52.500
Amanda: But anyway.

435
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.060
Amanda: I have a 27 year old. He's in the Marines.

436
00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.130
Amanda: And then

437
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.250
Amanda: Anthony has a 95 so that's 25 Asian 24

438
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:12.540
Amanda: Raina was 2322 and then angels have one data hit my dad. Yeah.

439
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.650
Amanda: She's 20

440
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, OK.

441
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:20.190
Amanda: And all of those are from the same guy only the last for

442
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:23.640
Amanda: The first one is it

443
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.740
Amanda: Has a different depth.

444
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:28.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

445
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.320
Amanda: And that's what trips me out. The two boys, what do I owe him everything. The other one doesn't.

446
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.360
Amanda: And an angel hitting telling my dad that they're offering that they're all the same brother and

447
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:40.680
Amanda: Same parents

448
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.220
Amanda: They're all different

449
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:46.770
Amanda: Trips me

450
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.060
Yeah.

451
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Y'all have their own different personalities.

452
00:37:52.200 --> 00:38:00.180
Amanda: I would never dream of doing that stuff to my dad what my daughter did to him. I've ever done that I never did. I never disrespect to my dad.

453
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.690
Amanda: I never got spanked as a child, either.

454
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.750
Amanda: Everybody says how they got spanked or dad to go good at tree branch or

455
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

456
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:16.140
Amanda: I didn't. I never got spanked. But I didn't do stuff like that either.

457
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.130
Yeah.

458
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.490
Amanda: I didn't want to kiss my dad off.

459
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understand, definitely.

460
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:32.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you think about it, too. You know, back in, in those days, things were different, you know, there was a

461
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Huge respect for the parents.

462
00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.060
You know,

463
00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it could it could happen without the weapons.

464
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:42.900
I know

465
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.280
Amanda: Definitely my dad said he was scared of his dad to like

466
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.630
Amanda: They were boys, you know, they mean like it was just

467
00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.900
Amanda: I guess this new age, but I can be the new age because my other kids aren't like that to my dad only she is

468
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.000
Amanda: My dad.

469
00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:05.160
Amanda: My dad adopted my kids not her. But he adopted the other ones after my daughter died.

470
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:14.280
Amanda: The death turnovers parental rights to to go to my dad to get a medicine custody. They stayed in office 1111 months.

471
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

472
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.820
Amanda: To get them out of that group home.

473
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:18.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

474
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.630
Amanda: You know how they give you a chance to get back and

475
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:27.450
Amanda: She just the judge told me stuff and I just went off. Mine got terminated right away.

476
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:35.400
Amanda: And get I just went off. So the only the only hope. I had was for him to do it. It was taking too long. They were still

477
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:45.930
Amanda: They were coming and stuff, but it was just how they have to inspect everything. This way if we let them go. If you signed up for his rights yeah automatically with my father.

478
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:49.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Guy. Yeah, okay.

479
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.750
Amanda: So that's what we kind of get it now. Can we gave up on me, just we need. We wanted to get them out of there.

480
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

481
00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.920
Amanda: It's not only after that year. They're going to still come every two years, and

482
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.930
Amanda: They're just being in your business all the time. Any little thing they'll take them right back.

483
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:12.630
Amanda: Yeah, so we just started be better to be not be there. And my dad was willing to take them. So he adopted him.

484
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:19.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it sounds to me like it. That was probably the best thing that could have happened at that time, for sure.

485
00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:31.200
Amanda: I think so because he never stopped us losing them and they asked him, What if your daughter comes back with her kids. He goes, I'll give them back to her. The only difference between her and us she got

486
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:33.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It.

487
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.600
Amanda: Yeah, cuz he got drunk with me, too.

488
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:42.780
Amanda: It wasn't like they were drunk when I was growing up, everybody drinks because I got caught.

489
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:44.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

490
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:51.540
Amanda: I'm not saying I was okay or anything but everybody's been drinking with their kids for years.

491
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.090
Amanda: Yeah now funny because mine.

492
00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:02.010
Amanda: And I'm not saying I did deserve it, because I, they could have a seat. And I probably wouldn't even know what to do. I don't remember. I was so drunk.

493
00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:02.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

494
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:08.310
Amanda: So I mean I deserved it. But still, how many, how many kinds of it happened before.

495
00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right.

496
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:17.160
Amanda: So, but he said he's like if she if she can she can get it back. And I did get them back.

497
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.080
Amanda: We would just stay share with them. So I live in Jersey for so long.

498
00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.790
Amanda: My mom had already died.

499
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.130
Amanda: She died two years after my daughter died so

500
00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.020
Amanda: I came back to our cookie till 2017

501
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

502
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.340
Amanda: Gone. I've been gone since 99

503
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:37.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

504
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:39.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's a long time.

505
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:51.570
Amanda: There was nothing here. I was doing drugs. I was just drinking and there was nothing here for me anymore. My kids weren't here, my mom already died. My sister was here. That's all I have to be my sister.

506
00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:57.180
Amanda: When she was on her own life. I had to do my life. So I went back to my kids.

507
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.840
Amanda: I see tears you this entire time with my kids.

508
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice.

509
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's good. And so now that you're back in Albuquerque. How are things now.

510
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:20.130
Amanda: It's better because there's more jobs. There's more to do with just I was already convicted felon and not that many jobs out there and we know everybody in that town know this.

511
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.640
Amanda: Now like I can't see. I'm not a felon or

512
00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.940
Amanda: They know where I've been, you know, they might

513
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.860
Amanda: Have towns related to us.

514
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.940
Amanda: So there's just no jobs out there.

515
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.780
Yeah.

516
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure.

517
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.960

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:49.860
Amanda: To buy a house and stuff.

521
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:56.550
Amanda: Will probably buy a house out here but pay for it because the houses out there are cheaper than over here.

522
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:03.510
Amanda: Like I was paying my mortgage payment for $560 a month for three bedroom, one, two and a half acres

523
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:04.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow.

524
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.220
Amanda: I pay $730 for a one bedroom apartment.

525
00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.100
Amanda: Yeah, would know yard.

526
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's crazy, isn't it.

527
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.080
Amanda: Yeah, I can make

528
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.090
Amanda: I can make that payment and one of these payments and still back to own something

529
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:24.510
Amanda: So,

530
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.590
Amanda: Just when it's time to go back. Or we could travel go to cruises

531
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:39.960
Amanda: Here under week go back on the weekend, whatever whenever that time comes, we'll figure that out. But I don't want to end the big city.

532
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.400
Amanda: I don't want to stay in the city. When I'm older. I mean, I'm already 43 but

533
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.890
Amanda: My wife's only 32

534
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.760
Amanda: It takes you guys an hour half an hour to work every day.

535
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Half an hour.

536
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.960
Amanda: She works 30 miles away from here.

537
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow, what does she do

538
00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.720
Amanda: She's a store manager at Subway.

539
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:11.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh yeah, yeah, I think you told me. Oh, yeah. Everybody else got

540
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: laid off, but her right yeah

541
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So she's got to be there. So she's there all the time.

542
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.400
Amanda: Yep. But now they're getting busy. They're back to a

543
00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:31.110
Amanda: He referred, they would make like 110 sandwiches, a day seven $800 that was when they were slow during the winter.

544
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:37.920
Amanda: They would double that in the summer, but now she's already making for the last three days. She's make that amount.

545
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, wow. Oh, I believe, it'll. A lot of people are probably

546
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: ordering food for pickup. Oh.

547
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:52.200
Amanda: Yeah, that's the only thing they can do. But how can we order pick up if you don't have a job.

548
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:59.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you don't have a tough time. Well, don't forget that a lot of places have been you know compensating

549
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:12.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Pay, you know, people still we're getting a lot of people are still getting paid even though they're not working because of this because it's not their fault. People are getting it's easier to get unemployment, you know what I mean.

550
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.280
Amanda: And then the same thing. But I mean, still I mean if

551
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:33.990
Amanda: I was going to be in Hartford to this really hasn't affected me I'm thank God it has it because I'm not working and Chelsea has been working so in reality, this hasn't done anything to us, but other people aren't going to work and their jobs aren't able to pay them.

552
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:40.020
Amanda: So they're getting it. If the unemployment paint. The only getting half of what they were getting to begin with.

553
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, yeah.

554
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:43.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's real.

555
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.570
Amanda: I would say all the money I could

556
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:55.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I thought that with unemployment, they were also people who are also also getting like a $600 so they get their unemployment was 600 right

557
00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:07.170
Amanda: Yeah, I think that's what it was saying like, because that's the way it is because they were currently working at the time he had never done that before. But yeah, I think that's what it is. It's a $600 a week plus what they would get

558
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.790
Amanda: So I guess it's kind of the same amount of money but

559
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:14.070
Amanda: I

560
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mean

561
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:23.010
Amanda: I see everybody at the at the bars at the liquor stores. I'm like, how do you have money for this. If you

562
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:29.520
Amanda: Yeah, well, I'm on vacation. I don't have to work but it'd be crying, How to Make Your mortgage payment.

563
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:30.510
Yeah.

564
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

565
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want leave

566
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:45.150
Amanda: Before trips. I mean, I'm glad to Chelsea has been able to go to work in both like my aunt work for the casino. So she gets paid no matter what. But they're able to afford that.

567
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.600
Amanda: Right, some places aren't able to do that.

568
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, especially small businesses, for sure.

569
00:46:52.530 --> 00:47:00.450
Amanda: You know, a lot of them are closing down out here and no matter what if they close or they're open to more fit them out whether

570
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.190
Amanda: Yeah, so

593
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that that

594
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.080
Amanda: Secret help yesterday or the other day, three years ago.

595
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, you know. You tell them ahead of time, you know that you're not meaning you know don't take offense and that you're not meaning to come off for you in order mean

596
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right off the bat, and it helps take him off.

597
00:48:52.470 --> 00:49:00.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Off the defensive right off the bat, you know, they understand that you're frustrated in that you're, you know, you're irritated in that moment and

598
00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:11.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It does help for the most part, there are people out there that it doesn't. They don't care. They're going to be, you know, the way that they are, but, you know, at least you try

599
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.610
Amanda: You know what I mean, I don't. You can't get to everybody. I mean,

600
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.450
Amanda: Yeah, and that's, I was saying with that guy I know he was new, but

601
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:26.610
Amanda: I've been you. And I've been stressed and nervous and, you know, I've been in that position, but I was already frustrated. That's right. Look at my paper.

602
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:37.470
Amanda: And now that she told me right now. She was all you need to get online order Christ for $27. I said, No, that's not what I supposed to yet. So I guess he didn't do his job right.

603
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:46.920
Amanda: Because she said, I did get the one person says, No, I did it. That's all I have to factor over or email her that one that I got 15

604
00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:51.060
Amanda: Right. Maybe he didn't do his job right. I don't know, something went wrong somewhere.

605
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:58.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Something, but you know what you when you stand up and you send her the information and show her

606
00:49:59.070 --> 00:49:59.850
Amanda: You know what I mean. Yeah.

607
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.640
Amanda: Keep her job quit right away so

608
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.450
Amanda: And I've always been like that. I've always stood up for myself. It's just the part about me being rude. When I do it,

609
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.690
Amanda: Mean to be, but I'm frustrated and I already talked to five people and

610
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:25.380
Amanda: That's where my problem with everybody started with route all the time. But right now, I mean I can be. But that's not I'm ready to start now like

611
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:30.540
Amanda: Right, sorry that you have to be at the other end of it, but after talking to somebody. Yeah.

612
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:33.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I totally get it. No worries.

613
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:37.800
Amanda: But now that I say now that I said that I think it really it really did a

614
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:45.930
Amanda: It made a difference because if I was not. He didn't take offense to it. He didn't catch attitude where we're in a bigger mess.

615
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:46.740

686
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.420

LG Stylo 5: No, no good, Rebecca. Good.

690
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything's been good.

691
00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:03.960
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I think about an odd. I think about it all the time. But, you know, that'll mess up my life. It

692
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.470
LG Stylo 5: took a long time to figure it out. Yeah, I mean,

693
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:08.700
Yeah.

694
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

695
00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:16.950
LG Stylo 5: But i'm i'm good all stay away. That's a box and helps me. I mean, I

696
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.880
LG Stylo 5: Wasn't for that. I don't know what else do

697
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:28.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, so it's a good thing that you're engaging in the map program. Right.

698
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we've just got to figure out ways that you can combat those thoughts when they start coming. You know what I mean.

699
00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:49.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I mean, you obviously you know that you play the tape forward. Nothing goods gonna come of it, but I think that what we kind of need to focus on a little bit is when

700
00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Life gets crazy and stressful and it's in the forefront. You know what I mean.

701
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.140
LG Stylo 5: Right, yeah. I started stressing out and

702
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:04.920
LG Stylo 5: Sometimes like stressed and

703
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:16.920
LG Stylo 5: That's when I started thinking about it and that, but that's the easy way out. Yeah, I mean I did, I did it all my life and I ended up where I ended up and it took me a long time to figure that one out.

704
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:17.850
Yeah.

705
00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that

706
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:33.360
LG Stylo 5: I did, I did 20 years and I came back out and I was back in prison. Six months later. Well, in the deal. They gave me another 15 years

707
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:44.250
LG Stylo 5: That one I guess, well I got high, the whole time on that one, too. And that's where I found some boxing in there and that's when I started using that

708
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:46.980
LG Stylo 5: That helped me. I mean,

709
00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:47.910
Yeah.

710
00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:57.780
LG Stylo 5: You know, I grew up around my father, everybody. My uncle's were heroin addicts or it was kind of crazy.

711
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it had to been definitely and you just got to know that you know

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have given enough of your life to the system. And it's time that you get to, you know what I mean, it's time to get to start living really

714
00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:30.690
LG Stylo 5: Right. No. Well, no, August 12 I have four years old, so it's nice out here.

715
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:32.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is where you should be.

716
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.450
LG Stylo 5: You should

717
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.040
LG Stylo 5: Be in there for more

718
00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:46.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, oh yeah, definitely. And so we've got to work on how we're going to combat those thoughts that come in your head, because we want to be able to combat them when you have them.

719
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

720
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:51.750
LG Stylo 5: With that

721
00:58:52.200 --> 00:59:05.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I said we want to be able to combat those thoughts when you have them when they come in your head. We want to be able to combat them get rid of them. We want to be able to slap them away and tell them there's no place in your brain for them. Right.

722
00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because right now. I mean, there really isn't Joe, you've got a you know you've got a wife, you've got grandchildren, you've got a family that needs you up front and President

723
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, right. That's what life is about

724
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:22.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not about the rest of the dumb shit they went with us and it's over.

725
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.470
LG Stylo 5: Right, it's all about me.

726
00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:34.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's right. Most important thing. And so when you have those thoughts when you're stressed, the first thing that

727
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:45.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That I want you to pay attention to is your stress. First off, you need to pay attention to when those thoughts come, obviously we know they come when you're stressed out. Right.

728
00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:46.140
Right.

729
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But you want to continue to play the tape forward.

730
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:59.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So, you know, with and this is hypothetical because I'm not in your brain. So I can't tell you the types of thoughts that you have, but

731
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:06.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I sure would like to, you know, these are kind of kind of what my scenario goes to, like,

732
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is too hard, you know,

733
01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:19.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I, it would be nice if I could you know indulge a little bit or if I could use a little bit. I would be relaxed, I would feel better, you know, make these things easier.

734
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:28.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But got to add that, but to the end of end of it when it's when your thought is done run through right

735
01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:33.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right at the end of it, add the bug.

736
01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:45.900
LG Stylo 5: Right. Yeah. Because like me, you know, once I started out and stop, I'm a pig. So it just takes that one time and i know that i mean that's what happened last time in

737
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.090
LG Stylo 5: The streets of bread would go, you know, I mean, it's either get

738
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:56.100
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, they're in there too, you know. I mean, a very where

739
01:00:56.790 --> 01:01:08.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it is. And if you, if you, you get in your mind that it is part of your, your historic past

740
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:10.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

741
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's part of your history.

742
01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't have to be part of your future.

743
01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doesn't have to be part of who you are now.

744
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

745
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:30.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you think about you think about addiction. Think about it actually being that voice inside your head because it lives in your head right

746
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right diction lives in our head.

747
01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:42.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's a voice and so you identify that voice so you know when it's when it's trying to play that little manipulative sneaky bullcrap and

748
01:01:43.140 --> 01:02:04.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, give you those thoughts, because that's what happens when we're stressed out when when even when we're happy. You know what I mean. It can try to weasel its way back in, even when we're happy and any thoughts that take you back to using just one time is too many thoughts.

749
01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.220
Right.

750
01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:11.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so we've got to get to this point where you identify when your addiction is talking to you.

751
01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:23.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you can, once you identify that that voice inside your head then you then you'll know you'll know the manipulative tactics that it uses to try to bring you back.

752
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you know, because you

753
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thing that

754
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:30.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you never forget is that it has one job.

755
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And its job is to take you out.

756
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Its job is

757
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. I mean, that's the bottom line.

758
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.040
LG Stylo 5: Know exactly to destroy everything that's what it is.

759
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Totally. And so, you know, you've got to make sure that you combat those thoughts with but

760
01:02:48.030 --> 01:03:00.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm not going to allow you to take control of my life, not going to allow you to take control of you know what I've gained here in my family, you know, and the love that they have for me. I'm valued and I need to be here.

761
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

762
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:12.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. Um, boredom is is also really kind of a slippery slope. So I hope that you're trying to stay busy on your days off.

763
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:22.800
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I work on the yard. I worked out in LA Mina always be busy. I can't stop and I mean I always have to be moving so

764
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good.

765
01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. That's important because I don't mind you know is, is

766
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where is what they say.

767
01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't hands is Devil's playground. I don't mind is the addictions playground.

768
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so

769
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:45.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You get bored you know you those thoughts are coming. You've got to get up and start moving and do those healthy things that you've started doing right

770
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:54.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you know, definitely. And so you want to really pay attention to those thoughts when they come in your head, Joe. Okay.

771
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:56.160
LG Stylo 5: Right.

772
01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:58.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Identify that voice.

773
01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:12.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right, it sounds funny, you know, some people laugh at me when I tell them this, but I, I actually have my voice identified. I have a face to the voice right and

774
01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:13.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have a name for him.

775
01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when I know that he's trying to work hard in my head.

776
01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know exactly what it is and I'm able to fight him and I'm able to combat them.

777
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:25.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

778
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:39.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you think about it in that in that manner. All right, and just don't forget you can never forget that it has one job in we're using one time is too many, you know that.

779
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:41.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Word right

780
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.450
LG Stylo 5: But exactly

781
01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:45.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you think about

782
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're stressed, you have thoughts. What other times, do you have the have thoughts.

783
01:04:53.970 --> 01:05:03.120
LG Stylo 5: Well, sometimes just popped into my head, I get up first thing in the morning and I think about it. Yeah, I mean, I did it all my life so

784
01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:22.230
LG Stylo 5: Yeah and you know all them years I was over there it I got high just to get out of there. You mean oh yeah well you could understand that, but it does take you out just like out here. Yeah, I mean, you take the easy way out. It gets you off for the day, I guess.

785
01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:24.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

786
01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.420
LG Stylo 5: They're bad or I guess your high

787
01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:34.380
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, but you know i i got tired of it. I mean, I finally figured

788
01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:37.320
LG Stylo 5: It just ruins everything and

789
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:53.640
LG Stylo 5: You know, I ain't the only one you know I'm the one using it hurts everybody else around me to your me my family and you know before I was, I guess selfies heading. I didn't really care. It didn't matter. I mean,

790
01:05:54.750 --> 01:06:07.920
LG Stylo 5: That was there. I thought I was never going to get out before I went, you know, I mean I got hired. I guess that way. I didn't have to worry about things and I don't know.

791
01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:12.570
LG Stylo 5: It's hard to explain, I guess.

792
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it.

793
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:16.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I get it.

794
01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, you know, it's, it's something that has been a part of your life for a long time, but it is no longer a part of your life.

795
01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:30.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that is, you know, really, that when you have those thoughts.

796
01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:35.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is what you've got to bring to the table. That's what you've got to bring to that voice.

797
01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're part of my past, you're not part of my now and you're not part of my future.

798
01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:55.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, and really kind of have the the attitude that it has robbed. You've already from so much. You know what I mean, and just really when you have those thoughts.

799
01:06:56.730 --> 01:07:01.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell it you know you. Tell that voice. You're not allowing it to take any more from you.

800
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:03.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

801
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're going to, you're going to meetings. Right.

802
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:10.440
LG Stylo 5: Right.

803
01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:12.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you go to meetings.

804
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:22.980
LG Stylo 5: With you. That's the only meetings. I've been going with I used to, I mean I but the good thing I didn't like about that other program and I told my people.

805
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:29.880
LG Stylo 5: Is because I it was a health care for the homeless here in Albuquerque. And that's where she got me in the program.

806
01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:37.440
LG Stylo 5: But, uh, the only thing that I like is I used to run into a lot of people from prison in there that I knew. I mean, and, uh,

807
01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:50.130
LG Stylo 5: And like now I got that. And it's better like this for me because I want to stay away from all that you may run into people that I was there for, for years, and they're all mixed up on on

808
01:07:50.640 --> 01:08:00.360
LG Stylo 5: On heroin and they're still getting some Bach there they're either on the metadata or because I've tried method on to it didn't work for me because you could still, I mean,

809
01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:09.930
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, the Suboxone that that's what works for me because I used to run into all the time there. I didn't like that.

810
01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:15.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I'm not talking to in person, you can actually go to meetings online.

811
01:08:16.230 --> 01:08:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right and the meetings online are like 200 strong. So each meeting that you go into is big. So you can just listen. You don't have to participate if you don't want to, but just being present, just being present and listening to what's going on in the meetings feels your head with recovery.

812
01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:48.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, what I had full of recovery is a bad place for addiction to be so it quiets down, it stops those thoughts.

813
01:08:49.470 --> 01:09:04.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. So even if you were if you started engaging in meetings online to where you're not seeing those people that you used to use with you're not seeing all those people, but you're hearing what's going on in the meeting online just like you're doing with me.

814
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:07.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. Okay. Is that your wife.

815
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:11.100
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, she's, she's right here.

816
01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know I can see her in the mirror behind you.

817
01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:15.390
LG Stylo 5: Okay.

818
01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:18.600
LG Stylo 5: I'm laying on our bed.

819
01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:23.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I Joanna. Nice to meet you.

820
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hi.

821
01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:31.950
LG Stylo 5: Good. Oh yeah, I mean we have to take care of something, but

822
01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.340
LG Stylo 5: I don't know. I GOT THE TIME WRONG. I mean,

823
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's okay.

824
01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.150
LG Stylo 5: I didn't wanna I didn't want to miss a meeting with you because I had a meeting with with Chris last night to

825
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dr. Coleman

826
01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:46.620
Yeah.

827
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:50.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: He's a pretty fantastic. Doctor, I think.

828
01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:52.080
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, he's cool. I like

829
01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, he's definitely cool

830
01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:04.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so I'm going to encourage you to go to engage yourself in online meetings, not in person meetings but online.

831
01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:18.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. And even if you just go in and getting and listen, you can turn your video off. Nobody has to know that you're there, but you keep your volume on so that you can hear what's going on.

832
01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:19.680
Right.

833
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.280
LG Stylo 5: I'd like to try that Rebecca

834
01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:27.480
LG Stylo 5: Here, what's going on here. I mean,

835
01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:28.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

836
01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.060
LG Stylo 5: You know I've done it all I've done every drug, there is. Yeah, I mean,

837
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.790
LG Stylo 5: So,

838
01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:50.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, the first step is to is to sign on, and to and to listen. If you don't feel comfortable with engaging, then don't the first or second time get familiar with it, get comfortable with it and then

839
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:57.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, in a few weeks. When you get more comfortable with going. Then I'm going to ask you to start participating

840
01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.590
LG Stylo 5: Okay, right.

841
01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:04.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, but just start the process to get comfortable with doing it online.

842
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:13.350
LG Stylo 5: And when you go into the meeting there that there's that many people there. The people see you. Everybody will see you or

843
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: If you have your video on

844
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

845
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:24.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right then, yeah, you'll be able to see, but you're talking about people from all over the world, you're talking about people from all over

846
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:35.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's, you can either engage in meetings in your small community, which I'm sure they're online to or you can go to a bigger meeting where it's all over the world.

847
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:36.300
LG Stylo 5: Right.

848
01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:47.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would suggest the bigger one myself where you're getting you know other people from different countries from different states, you know that you can listen to and communicate with

849
01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And make, you know, to me, and make connections with

850
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:53.760
LG Stylo 5: Right.

851
01:11:54.930 --> 01:12:11.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And then you can build a support system via online virtually. You know what I mean. And when you have those thoughts, Joe, and you can't get them to shut off in your head. Get your butt into a meeting. There's one every hour 24 hours a day online.

852
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:13.350
LG Stylo 5: Okay.

853
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:19.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. And it's kind of, it's kind of amazing because it's like a layer of protection.

854
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:29.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you don't have to go to face to face meeting, you don't have to worry about seeing those people that you know you know are trying to cheat the system or that are still using or

855
01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:38.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, you're doing it, just like you are with me right now in the privacy of your own home, you're protected. You know what I mean, you're behind the screen.

856
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:50.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you get to choose whether or not you want to engage with some people or you don't want to engage with some people. That's the great part about virtual a virtual na meetings.

857
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is that you get, you have those choices when you're face to face. You don't so much have those choices there in the room with you.

858
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:58.470
LG Stylo 5: Right, right.

859
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But in this format. You do have that choice.

860
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:06.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So that's what your homework is for this week.

861
01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.760
LG Stylo 5: Okay, that'll work.

862
01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. That makes sense.

863
01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:24.990
LG Stylo 5: Yeah, I'm sure he knows how to G. I'm like I told you I burn a very small homes. It's been a while. But I still I'm not used to all. I mean, yeah, but yeah. She'll. She'll find it.

864
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:28.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Very much.

865
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:29.910
LG Stylo 5: She's always on the phone.

866
01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:43.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, definitely. Tell her you know her help is greatly appreciated. To get you connected. You know, so that you continually have recovery going through your head.

867
01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.310
LG Stylo 5: Right.

868
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:46.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that will help with those thoughts.

869
01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:48.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

870
01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.440
LG Stylo 5: That'll work.

871
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:53.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so where are you and your wife headed to. Can I ask
