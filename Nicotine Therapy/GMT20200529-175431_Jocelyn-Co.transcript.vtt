2
00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.639
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, it's going I'm running around like a chicken today.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.000
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, very busy, right.

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.830
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah yeah

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Me check char.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Just me.

7
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Okay. Could you please tell me your name and your date of birth, please.

8
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.280
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes Arielle mirrorball my date of birth may 30 1980

9
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: As

10
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.710
A chart.

11
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Just wanted to make sure

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.270
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sure, no problem.

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so what we're going to do today is that we're going to talk about what do you usually do in a day, your activities of daily living, what

14
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.330
Jocelyn Corrales: works out for you. What does not work out for you. So let's start bead what's working out for you for a day activities of daily living.

15
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.460
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Like the things that I am doing

16
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: What did you say what's working out for me for daily living.

17
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, for example.

18
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Waking up. What time do you wake up and are you able to eat well are you able to eat on time.

19
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:36.420
Jocelyn Corrales: And with regards to sleep. Are you able to sleep early or what time do you usually go to sleep. And if you're working, what time do you go to work. What time you need to work in something like that.

20
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.830
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay, so right now I'm actually not working. I'm a stay at home mom. So I actually go

21
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.680
Galaxy J3 Orbit: To bed at different times. But it's always later I wake up super early in the morning. I'm always up at about five o'clock by 15

22
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:03.810
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I take my boyfriend to work and then I come back home and I'm just with my daughter for the rest of the day. And then I we I pick him up. We share a car right now so

23
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:17.640
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, so I pretty much I wake up early with him. And then my daughter sometimes she'll stay up a little bit later. So sometimes I won't get to bed until like I would say like 1130 sometimes

24
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.180
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Every now and then we'll have I'll be able to go to bed early like at nine or 10 every now and then, but not always. It's usually a little bit later than that.

25
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.460
Galaxy J3 Orbit: The average, I would say 11

26
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay 11

27
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Or 1130 1130 okay but do you think he's late and gets

28
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.600
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And as far as like eating and stuff.

29
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:56.790
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I don't eat very much and I definitely don't eat on like a schedule but I feed my daughter on a schedule, social, you know, I'll give her her lunch breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. And I think that I just snack throughout the day, a lot but

30
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.590
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'll have like a bowl of cereal. Sometimes when I wake up, it's just sometimes. But usually I don't eat until about lunchtime.

31
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.950
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And so I'll eat lunch and dinner for the most part it's

32
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.830
Jocelyn Corrales: Basically what I do. So, you surely didn't eat breakfast, but sometimes you do stay take snacks for breakfast.

33
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.060
Yeah.

34
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then I definitely always like something small for lunch and they usually most at night, only the most for dinner.

35
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.270
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then I get to bed pretty late so

36
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.260
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's pretty much throughout my day and I'm home with my daughter playing with her, or I'm cleaning usually

37
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.910
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then

38
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.730
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I make dinner at during the evenings, sometimes there's another person here who makes dinner. Also, so

39
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.710
Galaxy J3 Orbit: We're doing something now.

40
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And that's basically my day when I'm at home.

41
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Every day, usually takes take care of your daughter. How old is your daughter.

42
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.820
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She's four four and a few months, I guess.

43
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.460
Jocelyn Corrales: And when your daughter eats you also eat with her.

44
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Usually sometimes

45
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sometimes I'll just sit with her while she eats

46
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.170
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And I won't eat.

47
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.050
Jocelyn Corrales: At least feeds regularly.

48
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.060
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yeah.

49
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Because I want a beer. So you're actually some who doesn't look at

50
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:40.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Someone you know, does the person beside her, or this person feeding. He's not eating. Sometimes you don't eat, but you know there are times that the also at this she gets to eat.

51
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh yes, maybe that's maybe that's also the reason why something should take snacks to the shoot also is she's also encouraged to eat.

52
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Well, yes, all throughout the day.

53
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.830
Jocelyn Corrales: And usually your snacks are you

54
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Eating healthy meals.

55
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.720
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm actually, for the most part, yes.

56
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I don't use like we have every night with our dinner we eat a salad. Every night with her.

57
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.750
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's, that's an always thing.

58
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:30.600
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And in the morning, it's always really big for me for my daughter, even when I'm like going shopping for groceries or food and stuff for her.

59
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.670
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm always really careful about what I buy for her so

60
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.960
Jocelyn Corrales: I think the second

61
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.920
Galaxy J3 Orbit: We buy like the lean beef and stuff like that. So we eat pretty healthy, we try to

62
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Netscape and you're not eating like junk foods or chips or something like that.

63
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:53.670
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No fast food or anything, sometimes will like order a pizza. I know that's not very healthy so that's that's sometimes we'll do that.

64
00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:03.750
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No junk food, really, I would say like ice cream. And sometimes I'll buy chocolate. So that's what it told me I would say every, every now and then we can all get like

65
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.860
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Pizza. Or like, you know, receive or something like chocolate. You know what I mean, every now and then it's not it's not too often.

66
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.030
Jocelyn Corrales: For the job always

67
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

68
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.830
Mm hmm.

69
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:30.510
Jocelyn Corrales: But not always. Okay. Are you currently in pain or are you experiencing pain right now, or sometimes

70
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:39.840
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No pain. Sometimes I mean I have like these weird things going on in my, I think it's called Cystic Ovarian Syndrome. I'm not positive.

71
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:51.210
Galaxy J3 Orbit: But that's I've had that for a long time and I just kind of deal with it. I feel it every now and then, but I don't feel it every day. I just probably usually about once a month, I feel like the most

72
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, maybe June or when you're having your period.

73
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.720
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, that's when it's the worst.

74
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.170
Jocelyn Corrales: And what do you usually do when you have pain.

75
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:22.830
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, well, now I have my doctor has me on this. I think it's called the procreation, and no oxygen strips so it really, it's supposed to be another form of a pain reliever. So I it really helps a lot. The pain is is very minimal. When I do feel it.

76
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.090
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And if it's really sharp. It only lasts for like a few minutes and then it goes away. So

77
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Thank goodness

78
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Really bad. Yeah.

79
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.540
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So I just kind of deal with it. I don't try to like

80
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.830
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I don't try to take anything extra or anything like that. I just I just kind of deal with it.

81
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:55.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. So with regards to are you with regards to being active do you exercise.

82
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:02.190
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I do not exercise I would really like to start, but I know exercise I go for walks

83
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.870
Jocelyn Corrales: In the evening with my dog.

84
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.180
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And my daughter, my boyfriend will all go for a walk.

85
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:15.990
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Down in the Arroyo and stuff. I think it's pretty good exercise for walking in sand, but I don't I don't do that daily. It's more like a few times.

86
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.470
Galaxy J3 Orbit: If yeah maybe like a couple times a week.

87
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you can do exercise, but just there at home.

88
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.020
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, I would.

89
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, maybe some

90
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Yoga or probably some just stretching exercise.

91
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.740
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, that's a good idea.

92
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.460
Galaxy J3 Orbit: But

93
00:08:53.490 --> 00:09:04.740
Jocelyn Corrales: You could still continue on doing your walking, especially morning walks. Maybe you could do it when you try to walk your dogs every day. Maybe you could do it on a daily basis in the morning.

94
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I would be nice.

95
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.750
Jocelyn Corrales: When it's not very happy after you, you know, after you drive your boyfriend to work. What time does he surely work.

96
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:20.250
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's actually a good idea because my daughter is still sleeping at the time and I can go, I don't know.

97
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:29.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sometimes if there's someone here I can probably leave and take him for a walk in the morning after I take my boyfriend to work. I get back home at about six o'clock in the morning, probably like 630

98
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.620
Jocelyn Corrales: And your daughter.

99
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.440
Jocelyn Corrales: And your daughter is still asleep by that time.

100
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She is. Yeah.

101
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could go on a walk properly and just maybe five to 10 minutes walked in, go back

102
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.290
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

103
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.430
Jocelyn Corrales: A long time

104
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.600
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It sounds like a good idea. It is really nice. In the morning right now.

105
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.910
Jocelyn Corrales: It's not

106
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.290
Jocelyn Corrales: It's not very hot.

107
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know exactly

108
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.820
Jocelyn Corrales: You mentioned you have dogs.

109
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.790
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, I have one dog, actually.

110
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, this one. I thought I lost

111
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:23.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, the people that we live with. They have one dog also. So I have one. And they have one. So there is two dogs here right now.

112
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:24.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

113
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.120
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm just the owner of one of them.

114
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.390
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so maybe you could do some yoga and basic exercise at home.

115
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Basic yoga and the complicated one, since you're still starting

116
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.540
Right.

117
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.450
Jocelyn Corrales: Morning walk

118
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:14.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, and what are the things that you do in a day, like, What are your hobbies, other than, you know, the doing chores.

119
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.580
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah I hobbies, I would say.

120
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.810
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I do like

121
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.590
Galaxy J3 Orbit: The arts. I like to do the arts and crafts with my daughter. I guess that's kind of one of the things that I like to do with her.

122
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:31.740
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then

123
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:44.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Or go to will go to the park. Sometimes, and we'll hang out in the grass and we'll do like we have these little tennis rackets now. So we'll hit the ball, you know, with each other. She likes

124
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:53.670
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Doing that I really enjoy doing that stuff like taking her to the park or the arts and crafts. I have a lot of fun doing it with her so painting.

125
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.260
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Or painting rocks yesterday.

126
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.030
Jocelyn Corrales: So I don't know I getting that

127
00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.360
Jocelyn Corrales: I like

128
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:17.490
Jocelyn Corrales: Something, yes. At least you're doing something productive with your daughter doing graphs and you know it would also sparked her interest in doing some arts in you know in learning grants and at the same time shows you develop her what her skills and she also learns

129
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:24.090
Jocelyn Corrales: By doing crafts and you know you can have you tried doing

130
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:36.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Educational crafts, like, you know, like shapes and colors. It's the same time when you're doing crafts. You heard the colors, the shapes and the letters.

131
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Really good.

132
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.960
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She's super, super good already with her. She's, she's four

133
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.100
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And she's really really good with her colors and shapes already. I'm really proud of our sheet.

134
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:57.030
Jocelyn Corrales: And you could actually already start with numbers. Like, for example, you see this one, and he's number one. Or you could actually Joe at the same time one so that she would identify the numbers.

135
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.920
Jocelyn Corrales: But it's like you're incorporating, incorporating education read your crap.

136
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.340
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, I absolutely do. Yes.

137
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:13.110
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's really good. She didn't she can counter. Think about 14 but she's using after that show

138
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.070
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It starts getting about confusing. It's like 13 or 14

139
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:24.270
Jocelyn Corrales: That's my sob. She's still very little, maybe want to send this it's it's it's good for her. It's okay.

140
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:34.890
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm starting to try to show her how like what they look like, and how to write them. You know what I mean, because she knows how to count but she just does what she's starting to learn what they look like.

141
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.680
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe she can learns, you know, she says she's still four years old. It's very difficult for her to start writing letters so

142
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:59.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe we should start with shapes in the lines. It's more appropriate for each you know if it develops her fine motor skills by writing or just following the lines or maybe you could put some dots so that she could follow our trace along those lines that you made.

143
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: The briefing. Yeah, okay.

144
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.090
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Got us to be off the table.

145
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.040
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's good that she's also helping with you, preparing

146
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.680
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, she loves to do that too.

147
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:23.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm.

148
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.400
Jocelyn Corrales: You can actually do when you're doing chores.

149
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.350
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, you let her do some chores.

150
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:35.280
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She'll be like sleeping with she has her little mini broom. She's got a small one, so she'll help me sleep and stuff sometimes

151
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:40.320
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's good.

152
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.310
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Hey, baby.

153
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:10.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Exercise and you mentioned sleeping, but to build. What's the reason why you sleep at their own leader.

154
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:11.790
Jocelyn Corrales: At a later.

155
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.720
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Time I haven't really time getting my daughter to go to sleep early

156
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So I feel like I'm just because sometimes I would love to go to bed early

157
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.350
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I just want to quit sometimes

158
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.570
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Eight or even even earlier.

159
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.570
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm on the phone, maybe, hang on.

160
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Let me take a nap in the afternoon or a long nap in the afternoon.

161
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:39.570
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No I don't take naps must my daughter takes a nap. I don't take naps.

162
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:53.040
Jocelyn Corrales: And are you having although your daughter is the one or two is the reason why you're not able to sleep well. But when you try to go to sleep. Are you able to sleep. All right. Are you not having any problems sleeping.

163
00:15:53.850 --> 00:16:01.950
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, I don't think I have problem staying asleep. I'm pretty good about that. Some nights. I'm like, tossing and turning, but it doesn't happen very often anymore. I think I'm

164
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:02.670
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Pretty well.

165
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Well, that's good. That's good to hear.

166
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.740
Jocelyn Corrales: It's something better. And something good that you end up having troubles.

167
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.290
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, going to sleep.

168
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.190
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's rough yeah I fall right to sleep. I don't usually have a problem with that.

169
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.460
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm always like, super tired at the end of the day.

170
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:30.030
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, because of the many activities that you do and that's good. And do you do gardening.

171
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.440
And actually,

172
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:44.130
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I definitely do. I didn't even though I was planting these Morning Glories in the front yard and I was doing my work on. I started this like vegetable garden, I guess, in the back.

173
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:59.880
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know we did carrots, radishes and kale. We have cucumbers out there, onions, everything and the rabbits. I don't know if it's like squirrels or rabbits or something running around and it's in the front yard and the backyard, but they ate everything they

174
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:00.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Like so he

175
00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.940
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Pulled everything out of the ground, one by one.

176
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So I tried

177
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:10.230
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Three different I give up on the vegetable garden but I tried like three different times to plant the flowers in the front yard and they

178
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Eat they

179
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.380
Jocelyn Corrales: Eat the flowers. Yeah.

180
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.070
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

181
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Those, those

182
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Big rabbits or have you seen them.

183
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:29.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: They're kind of small, actually the rabbits are kind of small. So, but I've seen a few like squirrels and chipmunks running around. So I think it might be some of them to just like

184
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:35.340
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You can see these little holes like they're just pulling the whole route, though the ground. It's really funny but that's

185
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.420
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Kind of fun. I

186
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:45.990
Jocelyn Corrales: haven't tried planting, you know, have you tried planting inside apart. Instead of letting it underground do

187
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.690
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I think just recently.

188
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:57.660
Galaxy J3 Orbit: One of us. Hey yo honey in this House actually put some seeds from the flowers and one of the parts in the backyard. Oh, yeah.

189
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.440
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And so we're watering that to see

190
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.700
I don't think they'll get to this.

191
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

192
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Because maybe what we can do, since you're

193
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:18.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Having some troubles, we, you know, there are actually some kind of pests, you know, rabbits in the skills to your vegetable so athlete.

194
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:27.090
Jocelyn Corrales: You could actually place or put them in a pop your plants instead of planting on directly on the ground land.

195
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:42.000
Jocelyn Corrales: On a pop and those spots you could actually put it, put them, you know, have a bench particular for the plants are plots and you put those spots on those elevated area so that they won't be able to claim up on that area.

196
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. Maybe you could put some, you know, some elevation on that area.

197
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.750
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah yeah

198
00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:00.270
Jocelyn Corrales: It's crazy, because you're already excited to see those plants and then the next thing you see they're all gone.

199
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.580
Galaxy J3 Orbit: so disappointed in three

200
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.490
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Different times. But then, finally, I was like, No, I'm just not gonna

201
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.400
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You already know, but

202
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:16.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's try if it works out because I think you mentioned someone in your house already tried planting on the

203
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Park.

204
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:36.210
Jocelyn Corrales: If it's worth it works out on a part. Maybe you could do Park planting and maybe because, you know, sometimes even if it's on a part. Sometimes they're able to climb up on it. So maybe put it on an elevated portion probably small bench where you could place the box on top.

205
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Good idea. Yeah.

206
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.900
Jocelyn Corrales: The care plan up pops gardening.

207
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.380
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You gotta cut it one by one at a time to be. You got to do one at a time, skinny.

208
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.670
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She's doing her arts and crafts right now, actually she

209
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.660
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Just

210
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.610
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Was really hard here on the other side.

211
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.090
Galaxy J3 Orbit: There you go, see, oh, did it.

212
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.940
Jocelyn Corrales: So let's proceed, we

213
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Hear mental health with you guys to your mental health.

214
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Specially regards to how you

215
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.860
regulate your mood.

216
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Your

217
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:32.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Your moods, or when you're feeling cranky. How do you manage it, or when you are stressed. How do you deal with it.

218
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um,

219
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.530
Galaxy J3 Orbit: See this. Hold on, maybe

220
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:45.900
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sometimes it's another one of those. I just deal with it or it's recreational THC. I use recreational

221
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.510
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Marijuana so that's

222
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:49.110
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Kind of how it

223
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.830
Without

224
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.340
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Me coming here you can see I'm trying to do.

225
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:57.750
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sorry.

226
00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.040
Jocelyn Corrales: That's fine.

227
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Too.

228
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.350
Jocelyn Corrales: To deal with your moods and exciting to take

229
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Recreational teaching

230
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.900
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Granny bought a few mother in the store. I'm sorry doesn't hold on just

231
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.350
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay.

232
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.640
Jocelyn Corrales: It's okay. No worries.

233
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.990
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay, I'm sorry about that. He asked me that question one more time.

234
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:33.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. So with regards to your moods and anxieties you deal with it by taking recreational teach see

235
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:42.630
Jocelyn Corrales: When you're angry. What do you usually do, you can just retry to, you know, separate yourself from the crowd or you sometimes you get

236
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:50.520
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, I'm one of those people who will like leave. So if I get really mad about something actually just yesterday.

237
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I get so mad and

238
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.980
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's so hard. This is one of the things that worked on in counseling is learning when to not say something I'm one of those

239
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:09.210
Galaxy J3 Orbit: People that like if I know that there's something wrong and I have to like pointed out, I have to say something about it, instead of just like sometimes I might want to just keep my mouth shut. I don't do that. I

240
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.980
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Say something so

241
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.510
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I when I'm angry, I will sometimes just like

242
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:33.930
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I will lose it. And I'll start saying things that I shouldn't say, but I don't like call me, call me like that, but usually I'll leave like I will leave as soon as like if there's like an argument that happens as soon as the noise. I'm like, Okay, I'm out of here. Maybe I can see here

243
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:36.390
Galaxy J3 Orbit: How we deal with it. I'm like,

244
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.830
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm sleeping.

245
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:52.320
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. I think it's better, you know, trying to you instead of you know, seeing those things, those hurtful things sometimes when you when you try to argue with someone else, especially if it's a family member.

246
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Sometimes he could leave someone you know

247
00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:07.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Something, although it's just words, but sometimes those words could be very hurtful sometimes he would also affect the because, you know, later on, you would realize you'd said something that's very hurtful for that person.

248
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.710
Jocelyn Corrales: So I think you can see. Yes.

249
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.920
Jocelyn Corrales: Once it's out of your mouth. You can take it back. It's

250
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Even if you say sorry you know it's

251
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.210
Jocelyn Corrales: It's already done the damage has been done.

252
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:26.790
Jocelyn Corrales: And I think that's good that you're you try just try to leave and just, just try to keep quiet. Keep calm, close your eyes and

253
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

254
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.470
Jocelyn Corrales: When you're angry. Close your eyes.

255
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.700
Jocelyn Corrales: And we've

256
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:33.270
Got like

257
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:49.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Breathe in, breathe out. Do that for maybe 1530 minutes then once you're relaxed, then you try to talk because it's very difficult to know when you are you, you know, sometimes there's no point in talking or arguing when both

258
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Both parties are

259
00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.130
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Angry or

260
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:56.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, when both angles are angry and, you know,

261
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:10.470
Jocelyn Corrales: And you try to settle things with those type of mood me, you know, nothing will get settled. So even even gets worse. It's better

262
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.270
Jocelyn Corrales: It's better to be quiet and, you know, think about

263
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:21.900
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, so many things strike to think about it first. Then after relax and, you know,

264
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Doing better with that.

265
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.060
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Counseling helps me a lot.

266
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.650
Galaxy J3 Orbit: That's you.

267
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.680
Okay.

268
00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.420
Jocelyn Corrales: You mentioned that sometimes you get angry, but you're trying to deal with it.

269
00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:58.770
Yes.

270
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.910
Galaxy J3 Orbit: During like it with that I'm not

271
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:10.470
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm not so angry all the time. I'm learning skills with my counselor on how to manage that. So I'm doing a

272
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Lot better with it.

273
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.670
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're on the precipice on

274
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:27.420
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm sorry, say that again.

275
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.300
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're still on the precipice of, you know,

276
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:31.830
Jocelyn Corrales: Developing it

277
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:40.110
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, yes, I'm doing good. I'm doing good. She's taught me the skills. I'm just in the process now of learning how to use them.

278
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:47.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. Yeah, it's like application, but you know it does. It doesn't happen overnight, but at least it's a process.

279
00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.110
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, absolutely.

280
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. So with regards to your spiritual self. Do you consider yourself.

281
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Spiritual not

282
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:16.230
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm not very spiritual and I would like to be, but that's actually another thing that my counselor is working with me on is how much my spirituality has to do with my recovery. So we've talked about that a couple of times, I kind of right now.

283
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.810
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And Robert ritual right now.

284
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.830
Jocelyn Corrales: That's okay. We can do it slowly. Let's, let's

285
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's, you know, sometimes it can be very helpful for you. Sometimes

286
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:39.330
Jocelyn Corrales: quiet reflection or prayer would actually be you know sometimes good for you like doing some self reflection or going going out of the nature, you know,

287
00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.770
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Going on. I love that.

288
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:41.550
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

289
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.380
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Going on his back, kinda like

290
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:52.470
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah. Is that kind of like spirituality, a little bit too because one of the things that we do is like on the weekends, we've already gone twice this year the summer.

291
00:26:53.220 --> 00:27:02.520
Galaxy J3 Orbit: But we'll go up to the hemis mountains here. I'm in Albuquerque. So we go up to the mountains and in the Lake Forest area and

292
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.690
Galaxy J3 Orbit: We'll go camping.

293
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Will be out there. I love it out there. It's so peaceful and quiet and you know the nature and all of that. I love doing.

294
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:10.950
Jocelyn Corrales: You know,

295
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:16.200
Galaxy J3 Orbit: The nature walks and all of that stuff. So that's something we do sometimes, like on the weekends.

296
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:28.080
Jocelyn Corrales: nature walks on we get usually when you try to connect with your spiritual self. It's like more of a meditation, especially when you are with nature.

297
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:38.850
Jocelyn Corrales: You try to be alone. You know, you try to relax, feel the vibe of nature, you know, something like that. That's also spiritual connection.

298
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.060
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, that's how I do that absolutely do that.

299
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.320
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I guess I do have a little bit

300
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:53.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could do. You could also do some yoga this way. I also suggested yoga because sometimes doing yoga is some Moses.

301
00:27:53.880 --> 00:28:02.160
Jocelyn Corrales: Is also some kind of meditation and a are you also religious like are you in any religious SEC or something like that.

302
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:12.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm not extremely religious like I don't go to church and stuff on Sundays. I was like to start my daughter. It's kind of one of the things I do is to daughter to church.

303
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.810
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I haven't started yet. It's not something that I have

304
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.040
Galaxy J3 Orbit: To do, but

305
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.200
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um,

306
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.650
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, my family is Catholic

307
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I just, I wasn't baptized

308
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:38.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so maybe you could try

309
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:50.520
Jocelyn Corrales: For a while, okay, maybe you could try because you mentioned, you're not going to church every Sunday, maybe you could try

310
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Attending online services.

311
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.320
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're you're attending one right now.

312
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:05.280
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, I'm not. But I'm thinking about doing it right now like virtually just because of what's going on right now.

313
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true.

314
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:17.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Because you mentioned that you would like to connect with your spirituality also saw that. That's also one thing. Also, can I see your spirituality being, you know, religious, you know, you pray

315
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:25.890
Jocelyn Corrales: you meditate and because you're not able to go to church because you mentioned you what to bring your daughter to church sometime

316
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:33.030
Jocelyn Corrales: You should also be prepared yourself, actually. So at least try to, you know, attend church services.

317
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.130
Jocelyn Corrales: First

318
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:41.190
Jocelyn Corrales: Especially right now because of the coven or some dynamic, you're not able to go out through that allowed to go to

319
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:47.520
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Church for the meantime, but maybe later on when everybody or everyone's allowed to go out

320
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe when you're ready, maybe you could take your daughter to church.

321
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.440
One of my

322
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:00.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Job.

323
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.520
Jocelyn Corrales: So we'd be girls to your social relationship. How is your relationship with

324
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Your family.

325
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Or your boyfriend. First you leave with your boyfriend and girlfriend.

326
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:30.900
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm

327
00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:39.540
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Just oh I see my know if you make some other so cute. And I'm just to say

328
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:51.810
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, I actually live with my boyfriend and his parents right now.

329
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.070
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Through the collective team.

330
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.410
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So, um,

331
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I mean with my relationship with my family's pretty good.

332
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.370
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Every now and then I'll hang out with my mom or something like that, but it's it's fairly good

333
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And your relationship with everyone in that house is very good also

334
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:29.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, it's, it's, it's good. Usually, I think that actually right now. That's an interesting question because it's a little rocky right now I'm

335
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:30.450
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

336
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.740
Galaxy J3 Orbit: With them, but things are usually, usually good

337
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: We're going through a time right now.

338
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.330
I guess.

339
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Is your boyfriend currently working or not because of the call, but

340
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, he still goes to work.

341
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.850
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, he works for solar installation. So it was all yeah

342
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.290
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Ones that stayed open

343
00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so you have to send him to work and get him back forward.

344
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:06.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Okay. And are you planning on transferring probably after to send me

345
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.440
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, I am going to be looking for a job. Actually, I'm already starting to do that now.

346
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.550
Jocelyn Corrales: Because they're starting to get

347
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:15.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Up.

348
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.530
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, so

349
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.100
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm pretty soon we'll be getting back into our own house and everything like that.

350
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.440
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good to hear.

351
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.370
Yes.

352
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:41.010
Jocelyn Corrales: At least it's less complication or less complicated relationship, you know, at least you get to you get to maintain a good relationship that you have with your, you know, boyfriend spirits, probably because if you mentioned that it's kind of rocky right now.

353
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.810
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, you might destroy those good relationship that you have. So it's better to

354
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.690
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know, absolutely. It will help for sure.

355
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe just because

356
00:32:54.750 --> 00:33:01.710
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe it's rocky right now because probably the pandemic is one of the contributory thanks you know every

357
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.100
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know,

358
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:15.540
Jocelyn Corrales: Everyone. Yeah, everyone is stressed because not everyone is about allowed to get out and, you know, seeing a home is very boring, maybe they're not used to eat, you're not used to eat in everybody's not used to it. And it's like, you know,

359
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.470
Jocelyn Corrales: It's really challenging actually

360
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.610
Galaxy J3 Orbit: A mother. Yes.

361
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, it's really challenging

362
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:28.290
Jocelyn Corrales: It's not only you. There are also some patients experiencing experiencing that one, you know, especially if they

363
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:44.340
Jocelyn Corrales: They're used to going to work and that right now. They see each other the whole day every day, you know, something, something like that in you know there are things that you discover from each other and you know it's it's really challenging. That's all, that's all I could see

364
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.150
Jocelyn Corrales: You know,

365
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.460
Jocelyn Corrales: It's hard, but you know

366
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's try to work it out. It's

367
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Just temporary once

368
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:52.500
Galaxy J3 Orbit: We get through it.

369
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:54.390
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You can get through it.

370
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.830
Jocelyn Corrales: I know you could do.

371
00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:04.440
Jocelyn Corrales: It's really challenging. It's not only you. I think everybody's experiencing it. So it's not really some normal thing. It's

372
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.390
Jocelyn Corrales: The slightly say the new normal is, you know,

373
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.320
This

374
00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:12.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

375
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.790
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She got some good one. I

376
00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.210
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Like to get all stinky.

377
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:40.110
Jocelyn Corrales: So you are currently not working, but you you are actually planning on working

378
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:41.820
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes.

379
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.270
Jocelyn Corrales: But previous before the pandemic. Where are you still working.

380
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:53.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, right before the pandemic, I wasn't. What about a, I don't know, a couple months before the pandemic, I was working. Yes.

381
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:13.590
Jocelyn Corrales: And right now, are you currently earning even if you didn't have work. Yes.

382
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:19.800
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, I do. Have I applied for benefits as

383
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: A non working mom so I did get some help with food.

384
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.190
Jocelyn Corrales: I mean, it's called

385
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.430
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Like SNAP or food stamps or something like

386
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.790
Yes.

387
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:39.180
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And then I also get a small amount for cash assistance every month. So it's, it's very little, but it still helps me a lot.

388
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Just me.

389
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.400
Jocelyn Corrales: And do you manage your own finances or

390
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Your boyfriend manages

391
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.410
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay, yeah, it's me. I

392
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:53.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I do all the finances.

393
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.010
Jocelyn Corrales: And also for your boyfriend.

394
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:57.270
Yes.

395
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.630
Galaxy J3 Orbit: For the most part, yes.

396
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.000
Jocelyn Corrales: And you get you do you pay the bills.

397
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:24.210
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes. I mean, he works, and he makes work way more money than what I get every month. So I'm the one that like calls and paid the bills and with whatever we got in our

398
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:33.840
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Join. So we add in here. Yeah, but he definitely helps pay, of course, it's just, I'm the one that usually does it like you know the calling and all that.

399
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, that's great.

400
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:14.790
Okay, I

401
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Would like

402
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.210
Jocelyn Corrales: To go back to to go to church.

403
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.700
Galaxy J3 Orbit: When, when do I wanted to go back to go to church.

404
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Now this actually typing out

405
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.450
Oh,

406
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Because when I'm talking. I could not type

407
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:45.810
Jocelyn Corrales: When I'm trying to explain something so I'm actually doing at the same time when we when you're talking actually also typing in also, you know, adding up some plans.

408
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Morning exercise.

409
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.170
Jocelyn Corrales: For your daily routine or activities of daily living.

410
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.920
Jocelyn Corrales: Winning exercise.

411
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:10.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Or walk. I mean,

412
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.360
Yes.

413
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:24.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe walk about five to 15 minutes and you know you could do your exercise at home and you could also include your daughter, sometimes, you know,

414
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:36.000
Jocelyn Corrales: When my daughters, although my daughter's already old enough really old. She's still around 10 years old. Sometimes when she sees me exercises. She follows

415
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:37.920
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

416
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.590
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My daughter will do something every now and then other words

417
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.570
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Just be playing and then I can do whatever

418
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:43.530
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah.

419
00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:45.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe she's swimming, you went in.

420
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:49.290
Jocelyn Corrales: When she's doing her activities, you could do your exercise at home.

421
00:38:50.160 --> 00:39:04.500
Jocelyn Corrales: You could maybe you could just buy if you have a yoga mat to use yoga mats. If you have a map or any map or a carpet, you could maybe use that. That's fine. You know, just search for some basic poses or stretching exercise that you see.

422
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:19.710
Jocelyn Corrales: And you know what they like about doing that is that, you know, it's actually relaxing afterwards or when you're doing it, he hears off your mind. It's like exercising at the same time meditating.

423
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.460
Jocelyn Corrales: And we'd be good to meals.

424
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:49.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Although you don't eat breakfast, try to eat meals on time and make sure that you are not hungry and try to avoid snacking. So maybe just try to eat light meals in I think you mentioned you're not eating junk food look much or pizza much it and that's okay. It's

425
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Very strict with diet, but you know sometimes we have some cravings.

426
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.140
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah, of course. Of course.

427
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

428
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:20.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

429
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:31.320
Jocelyn Corrales: And do you often know do you watch TV often

430
00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:36.510
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm only like at night on sometimes in the morning like

431
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My daughter watches cartoons in the morning, and I'll watch them with her.

432
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:39.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Or

433
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:47.070
Galaxy J3 Orbit: At night, my boyfriend and I will watch a movie or something after she falls asleep. So it's usually only at night, reading, watching TV.

434
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:53.610
Jocelyn Corrales: What is it on a long duration or just probably Aaron and our or two.

435
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:56.430
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Like an hour to. Yeah.

436
00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.060
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's fine.

437
00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.660
Jocelyn Corrales: It's fine, as long as you're not doing binge watching

438
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.160
Oh, no.

439
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:11.610
Jocelyn Corrales: It's going to, it's actually going to make you lazy. Once you get hooked or addicted to binge watching you know seasons instead of watching it.

440
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:18.150
Jocelyn Corrales: per season. Every day you will be watching the whole season, the whole day. So it's you know it's not really that

441
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:18.420
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Good.

442
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So he knows

443
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.070
Galaxy J3 Orbit: See downs.

444
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.070
Get

445
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.650
Galaxy J3 Orbit: For gene.

446
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.110
Jocelyn Corrales: I think I have no problem with the time you wake up you wake up early.

447
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.100
Jocelyn Corrales: And you sleep at night at around

448
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:50.520
Jocelyn Corrales: 11 like at least you're not sleeping very late. It's okie 11 o'clock is fine.

449
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:56.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe how do we get your daughter to sleep early

450
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.020
Jocelyn Corrales: And

451
00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: One of the things we're working on right now.

452
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:13.290
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Just the things that usually work because sometimes we don't always get to I get out of the house. Like sometimes I get busy and I'm like doing chores. So she's stuck like in the house with me all day while like dad's at work or something but

453
00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.950
Galaxy J3 Orbit: When we take her out like on today probably since it's a weekend.

454
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:26.010
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My boyfriend who's we all Friday. So we're going to probably take her the park. When she like runs around LA and plays hard outside

455
00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:28.290
Galaxy J3 Orbit: You know, we mean or something and then

456
00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.290
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Try not to let her take a nap during the day. Oh.

457
00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:31.620
Jocelyn Corrales: And

458
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.280
Galaxy J3 Orbit: usually pretty good and she'll go to bed early and we're all good.

459
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.170
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Right.

460
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.480
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm going to try to do that more

461
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.470
Galaxy J3 Orbit: As much as I can that really works that actually really, really, really.

462
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:48.780
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually okay to let her take a nap in the afternoon, maybe other own

463
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.250
Not earlier.

464
00:42:51.330 --> 00:43:04.920
Jocelyn Corrales: Early not not either late afternoon but early in the afternoon, probably around one o'clock after lunch time probably one or two o'clock, then you know after once two o'clock. Let her late all around the house until she gets tired.

465
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:11.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe then around maybe seven o'clock or eight o'clock. She gets started, and you'll be able to sleep room.

466
00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:12.120
Yeah.

467
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.090
Galaxy J3 Orbit: We're going to experiment with some different things.

468
00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Here. Yeah.

469
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:17.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Actually

470
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:25.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Not let her sleep at the round, you know, five o'clock or four o'clock because she won't get to sleep really

471
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.640
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh yeah, then she'll be late.

472
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. Yes. So,

473
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:28.680
Jocelyn Corrales: We try to

474
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:36.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to make sure because she does take her afternoon naps to just try to make sure that it takes her nap.

475
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:40.200
Jocelyn Corrales: At around one o'clock so that by two o'clock. She'll be up, you know,

476
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.510
Jocelyn Corrales: She'll be able to sleep early

477
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.520
Jocelyn Corrales: I haven't asked you about friends. Do you have friends.

478
00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:51.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Um, I have some like

479
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.150
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I don't even know if I would call them friends.

480
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:03.720
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, I lost your audio.

481
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:09.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Hello.

482
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay.

483
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:18.870
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you still there.

484
00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:24.780
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I think it can. Yes, I'm so sorry. I guess my sister called and I tried to ignore it. But I accidentally. OK. Yeah.

485
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:32.490
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Exactly, exactly. Um, I don't have really any friends right now. I chose to

486
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:41.820
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Not speak with the people that I was hanging out with before that I didn't think that they were very good friends, and they were a heavy influence on me all the time. So,

487
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:48.510
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I decided not to talk with them anymore. And they were pretty much the last two friends that I really, really had I mean close friends.

488
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:58.440
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I have people that I like this. I have one friend will be she's somebody that I text every now and then that I met last about a year ago at my last

489
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:08.370
Galaxy J3 Orbit: United Healthcare. When I was an insurance producer there, but we don't really like hanging out with each other, anything anymore. We just kind of text. Every now and then about work or

490
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:09.930
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Something

491
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you talking social media.

492
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.520
Galaxy J3 Orbit: No, I don't have any social media.

493
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:28.530
Jocelyn Corrales: At these texts. Yes, that's fine. You know, talking in a phone or maybe texting. That's okay. You don't need you. When you have a friend or you want someone to talk to. You don't really need to, you know, see each other.

494
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Every day in their current situation.

495
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:40.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Texting or calling is actually fine. Did you get to call your family to you mentioned you see you soon have a good relationship with your family.

496
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:50.010
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh, yes. Absolutely I do. I call my mom and I talked to my sisters, all the time, my brothers. We always talk on the phone, whether it's texting. So yeah, I'm very close with my family.

497
00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.560
Jocelyn Corrales: And you get to visit them sometimes

498
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.100
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sometimes, but everyone was kind of far away. For me, my

499
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:03.660
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My mom and my sister.

500
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.220
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Live about three hours away.

501
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:06.300
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My other sister.

502
00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:11.400
Galaxy J3 Orbit: In Arizona, so they live like so. She's my sister and my oldest sister lives like

503
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.490
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I think like eight or nine hours away.

504
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:16.470
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Why even belong to that. I'm not sure.

505
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:21.600
Galaxy J3 Orbit: But my brothers. They live across the whole like they live in Ohio.

506
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.030
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And I'm in New Mexico way.

507
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.680
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Would take me two days to go visit them.

508
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:27.780
Jocelyn Corrales: At least

509
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.730
Jocelyn Corrales: At least communicate with them.

510
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:38.370
Jocelyn Corrales: That's mine. You know, communication, you know, maybe talking or texting you know talking on the phone or face time we got

511
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.110
Jocelyn Corrales: One, because you can do equal

512
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:41.550
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Access all the

513
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.580
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I love this quote to feel to eat.

514
00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.450
Jocelyn Corrales: When if you watching

515
00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.930
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She likes Masha and the bear. It's

516
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.910
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So cute. Cute cartoon.

517
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.360
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I love the cartoon why

518
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.200
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Let me almost done. Okay.

519
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:16.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, we're almost done. No worries. So I'm going to share my screen so that he could see

520
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:24.510
Jocelyn Corrales: For a while I can share the screen so that you'll be able to see it, including the plan.

521
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so I have placed here, the things that works out for you. Your deal with things that you do every day.

522
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:40.260
Jocelyn Corrales: What do you do to regulate your mood and you mentioned that you're on a process of doing it, but it's, it has been better.

523
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.490
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah. Wow. Yes.

524
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.350
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Definitely everything I said

525
00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:06.690
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, sometimes I have to stop because I have to type, you know, important thing so that next time we see each other. I usually review the previous

526
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:16.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Things that we have discussed in. I'm going to follow up on you and check on you. How you doing today, is it better than it was 30 days ago or 45 days ago.

527
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:27.330
Jocelyn Corrales: So, something like that. Maybe I could follow up you because you mentioned you you'd like to be spiritual. And you know, I could also follow up on that, if it's doing better or if you started with already

528
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:36.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. Maybe by then you could probably have transferred or probably could have already have a job.

529
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:42.000
Jocelyn Corrales: I think here, you're not working, will probably not exercising.

530
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.010
Jocelyn Corrales: No.

531
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:45.000
I'm

532
00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:47.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Not really.

533
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:56.280
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm things that are not working well in my life that I would like to change. I definitely would like to say, aside from the exercising.

534
00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:13.170
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I would like to start getting myself ready again because I even though I don't go anywhere. I mean, I don't do my makeup anymore. I don't do my hair, I don't get myself ready at all like I'm mean, I look like Raggedy Ann all day long. Every day, so

535
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:28.800
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I want to change that even though I'm not going anywhere, and a mom like, I don't want to just let myself go, I want to start building my confidence back and trying to get myself ready. Again, that's one thing that's not going well in my life that I want to change and the very, very last

536
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.570
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Thing is basically just my

537
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.160
Galaxy J3 Orbit: My relationship with my boyfriend's mother.

538
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.560
Galaxy J3 Orbit: It's not very well with his mom.

539
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.760
Galaxy J3 Orbit: And I would like to change that.

540
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:48.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, let's best year

541
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:59.550
Jocelyn Corrales: What's a better relationship with your boyfriend's mom.

542
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:01.740
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes.

543
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.880
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I've tried for eight years now.

544
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.180
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, sometimes

545
00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:14.940
Jocelyn Corrales: Especially when they're already evil or sometimes even a little star, don't you know sometimes hard to please

546
00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.580
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh yeah I'm know I'm scared.

547
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:20.190
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I'm so scared for my daughter to grow up in.

548
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:24.600
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Me to be that way. I'm like, Oh man, I'm gonna try as hard as I can to just be nice.

549
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.910
Jocelyn Corrales: To probably her has been in the feature. Yeah.

550
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:35.580
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes, I know. And I'm sure I'm going to find something that I don't like about him or something. And I'm going to have to

551
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:37.890
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Be mom but

552
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:39.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, no. Well,

553
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:46.380
Jocelyn Corrales: someday maybe because they're very protective of their children or add a little me but you know

554
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.030
Jocelyn Corrales: This try to understand her

555
00:50:49.470 --> 00:51:00.540
Jocelyn Corrales: And, you know, try to contribute, what you think you could contribute as much as you can, at home. I think you're doing well because you're doing some chores and you're helping out but she loves her granddaughter right

556
00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.220
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh, of course.

557
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.400
Galaxy J3 Orbit: She loves her so much. She's very, very good. That's good.

558
00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:06.060
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good.

559
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:08.760
Jocelyn Corrales: And you mentioned with

560
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:22.050
Jocelyn Corrales: With your mental health, the things you want change is although you're doing better. So I place here. Sometimes you get angry, but you're in the process of getting better at it.

561
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:23.190
Uh huh.

562
00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:30.780
Jocelyn Corrales: And with regards to spiritual self you would like to get in touch more of your, you know, go to church.

563
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yes.

564
00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:41.910
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I mean, even if it's not going to church every Sunday, I would like to just to go to church, even sometimes

565
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:43.170
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Even just sometimes I

566
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Know, you know,

567
00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.820
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I don't even do that. So I want to go somewhere. I want to start slow

568
00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:57.030
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, let's start with maybe the online. You know, sometimes you don't need to go to the church. You know, sometimes it's if it's especially if it's far away from your area.

569
00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:06.330
Jocelyn Corrales: You could actually attend the online services and once you're ready to go back to church. You could sometimes, you know, once in a while, go to the church itself. And, you know,

570
00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:15.570
Jocelyn Corrales: If you're, you know, if it's hard for you to go to church. This week, probably could just attend the online services today have something like that, right.

571
00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:17.130
Jocelyn Corrales: And

572
00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:23.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Um, you mentioned you won your confidence back. It's like self pampering

573
00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.560
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Yeah. Yes, that's something I

574
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:28.950
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Want to

575
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:29.730
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Do

576
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:31.200
Jocelyn Corrales: And taking care of yourself.

577
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:40.290
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Exactly. Because I used to do it all the time. I, I looked at pictures of myself, the other day and I know everybody gets older, this was like a few years back, like

578
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Three or four

579
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.870
Galaxy J3 Orbit: But I know I'm getting older and things change when you get older and

580
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:53.790
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Things like that, but I still notice things like I used to really care about what my hair look like every day and like even colder.

581
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.340
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I was always like trying to change it make myself.

582
00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.750
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Better or, you know,

583
00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:01.410
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I had my nails done all the time. Like I just really

584
00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:05.970
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Focus hard on my parents and I really noticed that I don't do that like

585
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.510
I don't

586
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:13.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Maybe when you go back to church church. I mean work you'll be more conscious about

587
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:22.080
Jocelyn Corrales: It. So at least hear some plans waking up around or 5AM I have no problems with that. I think you're doing good.

588
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:30.180
Jocelyn Corrales: With regards to meals advice. Eat healthy meals and avoid unhealthy SAS next week. And since you mentioned

589
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:44.880
Jocelyn Corrales: About you know self pampering you would like to take care of yourself. So it actually doesn't need to be physical, you know, it also has to be something to do something, also with the food that it takes so maybe eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.

590
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:45.990
Okay.

591
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.060
Jocelyn Corrales: So you glow. You know, it's, it's what they call the glow foods.

592
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:53.340
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Okay, interesting.

593
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.430
Jocelyn Corrales: And it doesn't make you fat.

594
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:04.440
Jocelyn Corrales: So if a lot of fruits and vegetables and, you know,

595
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:11.310
Jocelyn Corrales: It's not only building yourself physically, but you're trying to build your, you know, your

596
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:12.600
Jocelyn Corrales: mental, physical, so

597
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:21.060
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes and yes I think mentally. That's why you've mentioned about going to church. So you're, you know, preparing yourself spiritually.

598
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:23.940
Jocelyn Corrales: At the same time, you're developing your mental

599
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:35.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Skills in eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. You're also building up yourselves, you know, self with your buddy. You're also nourishing it. And also, you know, do you take a shower every day.

600
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:38.910
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Actually I don't every day.

601
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.400
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Sometimes it's like every other day.

602
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.300
That's fine.

603
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.250
Jocelyn Corrales: But you do your basic hygiene every day.

604
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:59.790
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Oh yes I'm I mean I'm not gonna lie. There's been times where I flew flew out the front door and forgot to brush my teeth. I'm sure we've all done that a couple of times.

605
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:15.720
Galaxy J3 Orbit: But yeah, I'm pretty basically yes the basic hygiene. Yes. I just don't get ready anymore. I don't, I don't do my makeup. I don't do my hair, I don't like get dressed or anything. Sometimes I'm just in my pajamas all day. You know, like it's things like that that I don't

606
00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:18.120
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Know that I want to change.

607
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:24.660
Jocelyn Corrales: So pampering

608
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:52.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so I have please here in the plan so advice to eat healthy meals and avoid and healthy snacks or meals and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables then for activities of daily living. Morning exercise or morning walk around maybe five to 15 minutes in a day.

609
00:55:53.790 --> 00:56:11.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's put your everyday in every, every day and self pampering so self serving includes you know your daily hygiene, you know, something like that. And, you know, the things that you mentioned about taking care of yourself.

623
00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:58.830
Jocelyn Corrales: And I have also place here when you mentioned, I also suggested to you when feeling angry tried to stay away or be quiet for some time to relax.
