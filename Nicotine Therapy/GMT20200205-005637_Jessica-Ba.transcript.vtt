00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.790
Brandon Howard: Like a

37
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.460

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On vulnerability

40
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you said you observe trigger

41
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.260
Brandon Howard: Your not wanting to work, man.

42
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.810
Brandon Howard: Yeah. The the

43
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.660
Brandon Howard: Trigger thoughts was like, okay, for instance.

44
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.800
Brandon Howard: When, when I fail, you know, what was I gonna do to help provide you know since I was going to be out of work.

45
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:07.200
Brandon Howard: Yeah. So mom, which I'm getting paid, but not you know all the overtime and all that.

46
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.730
Brandon Howard: So that they help with

47
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.190
Brandon Howard: With helping with the, you know, like not having to stress over what I was going to do.

48
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What they do that happen again, we said last week, Thursday, right,

49
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.320
Brandon Howard: Yes, ma'am. Okay.

50
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, did you observe any target baths.

51
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:47.130
Brandon Howard: I'm not really because, you know, I figured out that I was still going to get paid. They weren't really nothing to worry about.

52
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the trigger thought was, how will I provide for my family.

53
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.430
Yeah.

54
00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:00.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now when did that come into play. What was your first thought happy.

55
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.850
Brandon Howard: Oh, I mean, my first thought was, holy crap.

56
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

57
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.920
Brandon Howard: Nothing's like My back's broker, you know, anything like that but I'm

58
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:27.180
Brandon Howard: Obviously, that's what my first thought was, and then, you know, I don't know what am I going to do now, since I'm light up and I can't do nothing.

59
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.540
Brandon Howard: So,

60
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:45.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In, in, then you got the information that it was still from be like workman's comp where you'd be paid while you recover. But you were also able to identify. Well, I'm getting paid, but I'm not gonna be able to something that was over.

61
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.610
Brandon Howard: Now,

62
00:07:49.020 --> 00:08:06.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That sounds like a puppy thought but then followed up with another trigger thought, you know, with providing because the underlying theme with that was just providing. And so you have that copy but then it's followed up with or not. I can't get over time.

63
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:08.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

64
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:16.290
Brandon Howard: So I went from like about 1500 dollars a week down to like $500 a week.

65
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.120
Brandon Howard: So,

66
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Doing a lot of overtime.

67
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.150
Brandon Howard: Oh, yeah.

68
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:23.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

69
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:31.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any possibilities that not mean not having to do the overtime because of

70
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, the physical state that you're in. Are there any possible

71
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Benefits of not having to work overtime.

72
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.280
Brandon Howard: Finally,

73
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.280
Brandon Howard: Get my risk that I

74
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.020
Brandon Howard: Really needed

75
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: solace about that balance, you know, in the last group.

76
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We talked about

77
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:21.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fears. What are the worst fears and how does it play a part in your everyday function, your thought process. And so based on what I know about you. I could guess that one fear might be making sure that you can provide for your family.

78
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:33.840
Brandon Howard: Absolutely by I guess one of the fears that I have right now is, is that little check on you know be enough to pay the rent, you know, and make sure we have enough to eat.

79
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now, are you the only one that works in the home.

80
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.990
Brandon Howard: No mom. My wife does, but she don't like merely, you know, what am I

81
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.880
Brandon Howard: She only brings home like maybe 700 every two weeks.

82
00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.250
Brandon Howard: Yeah.

83
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:17.640
Brandon Howard: And like I take care of the ran and you know the food and whatever else that will need through the week and she pays electric water gas know just this everyday necessities.

84
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:28.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What the sessions were had about how the finances are the budget, we need to ship as a result of this temporary situation.

85
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.600
Brandon Howard: Well, I'll just show you

86
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:45.570
Brandon Howard: What am I, calendars and we wrote down everything, you know, we're going to have to pay like like from day to day to day and we just we budget budget did it.

87
00:10:48.570 --> 00:11:00.750
Brandon Howard: And like the step that we didn't absolutely have to have, you know, if we had the money to buy it like Netflix and whatever, then, you know, we would get it but if not you know I want no big deal.

88
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it painful to talk

89
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.390
Brandon Howard: No, I'm in a in a recliner. And it's trying to move on me.

90
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:32.340
Brandon Howard: And the worst part. This morning, for some reason, I don't know if I got a bug or something. But I woke up this morning like badminton can really keep method down today and we're like, when I would go to throw up our tents up. So it's really, really edge tied it. Yeah.

91
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anticipation of the vomiting. So, you know, the physical health.

92
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is now.

93
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Presenting different changes that you need to make throughout your everyday function.

94
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.130
Yeah.

95
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:56.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are some of these changes things that you think even offered this situation changes do you think you wouldn't set back to

96
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:05.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The standard that you were doing before, or do you think, have you identified some of the benefits of some of the different changes you've made as a result of your

97
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:24.360
Brandon Howard: Help like me. I was pushing myself to work every, every hour that I could and I was working 80 plus hours a week, you know, at some point, you gotta have breast and you know do stuff for your sale, you know,

98
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.370
Brandon Howard: So yeah, I'm gonna cut down on that a lot. There's no way

99
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm curious to know where you're well rested before that fall

100
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:42.510
Brandon Howard: I had a I had all weekend off and then I went back Monday.

101
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:49.800
Brandon Howard: And you know, I work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then that's when that happened on Thursday morning.

102
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: HOW MANY HOURS WORKING ON MONDAY, TUESDAY.

103
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.790
Brandon Howard: 12 hours a day.

104
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:11.460
Brandon Howard: But what what actually happened like I was up on the up on the second deck and they was persistent a swinger pop to put it on the on the drill bit to go further on down.

105
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:22.890
Brandon Howard: And when they swung it around a gust of wind caught it, and it pushed over towards me and it was either you know 1000 pound pop hit me or you know I had the job.

106
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.090
Wow.

107
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:28.950
Wow.

108
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.520
Brandon Howard: Yeah, my job. It's, it's very dangerous.

109
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:41.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In a little disheartening for know that you will avoid it back and you get a pay cut and

110
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:52.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There should be more factors, put in place, considering the physical risk that you put on the line to go to your job.

111
00:13:53.130 --> 00:14:06.900
Brandon Howard: Right handball day was one of the workers. He's a, he's my supervisor, you know, he was trying to get me to to get a lawyer and just so them because you know I didn't think it was fair either

112
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:14.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you have a union representative in this line of work. I'm curious to know if you have any union everything

113
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:26.370
Brandon Howard: We do. But like all that stuff right now is under investigation and all that, you know, these are involved, of course, but I don't know what's going to come with that.

114
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:40.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I would definitely follow up with your union rep and get a statement on about exactly what happened so that there can be. You shouldn't have to get the short end of the state because there was a mishap.

115
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:41.940
Brandon Howard: And like you said.

116
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was a voice possible death by being, you know,

117
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Damage with this one, this pole or jump.

118
00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:03.570
Brandon Howard: Yeah, I'd like to hear me. They, they probably won't have been nothing, anybody could do. Because, I mean, it's a bit. Yeah.

119
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:14.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I know that you're on the tail in closing out this chapter of disappointment and then some new chapter but

120
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:29.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Still follow through on what's going on because for a long time, then identifying patterns of unfair treatment for working conditions, then not paying you the rate of what you've been working

121
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.570
Brandon Howard: So,

122
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:43.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I wouldn't, you know, while it's positive, that you're actually going to be transitioning to somewhere else, I would still hold this job accountable for what they're doing. Because it just doesn't seem like a safe environment working on

123
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:58.470
Brandon Howard: That it's not. It's really not you know there there's people out there doing cocaine and drinking beer on the job nicely. Yeah. You don't realize that you're putting others at risk dying.

124
00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.880
Even know

125
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I would, I bet.

126
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:08.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because whoever was on that that job. They could have put you at risk because of their intoxication. If

127
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They need to be mild

128
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:21.540
Brandon Howard: Well that's why the the union rep is involved right now and investigating it to see, you know what, what I'll actually went to to apply there.

129
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:29.040
Brandon Howard: And everybody that was there get drug tested and had to do a alcohol test.

130
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I made sure that that came up throughout the week Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

131
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.500
Brandon Howard: I'm

132
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.680
Brandon Howard: Just pretty, pretty much what I told you I mean that's been a you know about every day.

133
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.860
Brandon Howard: Just the fear of not having enough money to pay the rent, you know,

134
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What coping thoughts.

135
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:12.000
Yeah.

136
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

137
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:23.070
Brandon Howard: Well, one was, you know, at least I'm still getting paid something, you know,

138
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:35.520
Brandon Howard: And I guess where we made these these calendars and might have budget, you know, always had that, you know, have peace of mind. So I guess I guess that would be helpful.

139
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:51.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, knowing that this wasn't the worst case scenario and then also the support of your wife and being able to strategize so that you can plan for this experiment. Now, did you notice at our events throughout this week.

140
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.200
Brandon Howard: Well, I mean, finally getting my mom.

141
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:05.490
Brandon Howard: My identity, you know all that figured out that was a positive outcome.

142
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To work on. I don't know.

143
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you can do some other ones.

144
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:34.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Unless about this one because the physical definitely so. You told me that after the fall, you did take some proactive steps because there's onsite medical care at your job.

145
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:46.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. After that, were there any follow instructions which have to go to another doctor or take, you know, you mentioned the medication. Were there any other recommendations after meeting with that doctor

146
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:58.620
Brandon Howard: I'm just to just to put like a switch it out with he and I asked, and I gotta go back in three weeks just to make sure you know it's still in them. What are

147
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You eating.

148
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:11.910
Brandon Howard: It's, it's been good. Up until the day like like pathology. I'm not feeling so hot. Like, I think it's just like a little virus or something.

149
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:27.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You long we'll do a 30 minute session just considering the state that you're in with the virus and then and see sometimes when you move you take a deep breath. So I just thank you for still showing up, despite everything,

150
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.860
Brandon Howard: You had

151
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:30.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whoa.

152
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And interesting start to January.

153
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.960
Brandon Howard: You ain't kidding.

154
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you been getting enough rest.

155
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:53.310
Brandon Howard: Yeah, I mean actually today what what little time that I've had, you know, had to get up man, throw up. I been asleep, mostly all day.

156
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:12.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you said that your wife. She also has some anxiety, but you share that wanted to find a way to get her some therapeutic intervention as well. So tell me how you got her

157
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Involved with this activity.

158
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:37.920
Brandon Howard: Well, like I said, we, we made those charts and like every morning before she would leave I had him up on the wall and you know before both of us would leave way. We don't like go through each one every day and she I mean she seemed like it helps, but she I think she needs.

159
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.400
Brandon Howard: Some type of medication. I'm not really sure because she's got a lot anxiety.

160
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How does

161
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It impact you.

162
00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:08.070
Brandon Howard: Well, like normally if I if I leave to go to the store and she hear sirens outside or something you know she's color you okay, are you okay there was a year, you know, just like situations like that. It's a

163
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.450
Brandon Howard: Big it's kind of

164
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.540
Brandon Howard: What would you say

165
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:32.820
Brandon Howard: Times. It's kind of annoying when you know like I'm trying to do something extra work like go to the grocery store and shop, but I try to try to understand, but sometimes it's hard to understand.

166
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:47.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Push and pull of wanting to understand, but at the same time, wanting the ability to go about your day without having these concerns and added stress.

167
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now when did you first identify that she would possibly have.

168
00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:03.900
Brandon Howard: Or wow let's say well, like when when we moved from Tennessee down to here in New Mexico, like

169
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:11.670
Brandon Howard: It did when we would get out to go somewhere and I was driving and like they would be a cop.

170
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:26.670
Brandon Howard: Way out of the way. You know that she would say, oh, you better be careful. Be careful don't get pulled over, you know, just things like that. And I just got the notice and more and more and more, you know, if it went from something small to something be

171
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.750
Brandon Howard: Intensified yeah

172
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:45.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To any of her behaviors you find yourself adapting or or displaying some of those same behaviors that she

173
00:22:47.760 --> 00:23:05.520
Brandon Howard: Yeah, like when when Mike say I'm going to the store and like the firing and stance and she's calling just tell her you know just become don't worry I'm over here to store that it wasn't me just, you know, thanks for you were

174
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Saying, yeah.

175
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:07.440
Yeah.

176
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.090
Brandon Howard: Cuz i mean it's it's a daily. It's a daily thing.

177
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:26.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But since that principle paranoia for you. Does that create any invited for you where it was on the other foot. If she were now. Do you have those thoughts. Well,

178
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.380
Brandon Howard: I wanna, I wanna thank so just like I'm

179
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:47.160
Brandon Howard: Like I just don't want to help her so bad. But, you know, it really does no good for me to say anything because regardless it that paranoia and anxiety anxious is always going to be there.

180
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:47.880
Yeah.

181
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:52.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

182
00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:07.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it possible that the best way to help with the anxiety is to speak to her about the need for the help and and how it affects the relationship

183
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.150
Brandon Howard: I have talked her about that. And that's why you know she's wanting to find a counselor.

184
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where she asked me.

185
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:35.760
Brandon Howard: Whoa, she she found a couple, but, uh, they wanted like $200 up Brian and then yeah, like the first visit it was gonna be like the 200 up front and then like another hundred 50 visit

186
00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.260
Brandon Howard: You know, that's crazy with her having health insurance and oh

187
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.190
Yeah.

188
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:51.870
Brandon Howard: So we're still trying to, you know, even if she's got to actually go somewhere, you know, would still be okay.

189
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.490
Brandon Howard: So we're just still, you know, I'm trying to look around and ban something

190
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:03.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what we do know is that your wife's anxiety.

191
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:15.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: affects her in the sense that there's this paranoia that something's going to happen to you. Yeah. Whenever you go out if there's anything that indicates, you could possibly be in danger. She calls you.

192
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:17.850
Brandon Howard: Absolutely.

193
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One of the ways is this her anxiety show itself.

194
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:41.730
Brandon Howard: Um, okay, like when her daughter goes to like whether dad or, you know, terror cousins or whatever. And if you know sarah calls and she don't pick up right away automatically there's she's in some kind of trouble are in danger, you know,

195
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:55.260
Brandon Howard: Whatever could possibly like go wrong. That's why her brain always register stay, you know, even if it happens or not. Yeah. That's every day.

196
00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:01.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is there any moments where times it doesn't present itself.

197
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.380
Brandon Howard: Not really.

198
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:21.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It sounds intense and I agree with that level of intensity, if it is exactly how you typically then she could definitely benefit from ongoing their email address where this rep comes from

199
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:30.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so when you want to be careful, is because she doesn't have any additional support that. Now you're becoming right there.

200
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:44.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so I asked, do you see any of her behaviors on you Leary like are you showing those because then that will be a key indicator that some a person comes in her anxiety is now.

201
00:26:44.790 --> 00:27:00.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Coming out through you, but it seems as though you've been able to do something to separate her inviting from your mental state so that you can support her well not compromising your mental stability and not also becoming

202
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How did you do that.

203
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:21.540
Brandon Howard: I'm like, I'm not really sure, because I'm and I'm like, mentally, I'm pretty I'm pretty strong mentally, but I'm just nine with my problems on. Yes.

204
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:32.970
Brandon Howard: But with somebody else's I'm more than happy, you know, to help and try to figure out a solution, but at the same time I try to do the same for myself.

205
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you see any connection between how some experiences from your childhood.

206
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:50.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Might have created this person today that able to, like you said, Help other people with their situation.

207
00:27:53.640 --> 00:28:08.850
Brandon Howard: I mean, yeah, because I've had a had a horrible childhood, you know, my mom. Mom and Dad. They used to be this and everything else. And like I can remember around when I was five.

208
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:24.780
Brandon Howard: My sister was three years old or may so she was a like if we didn't go out and work in the tobacco fields and stuff. We didn't get to eat that you don't say like we had to. We had to pay for our rise and I guess you could say.

209
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.850
Brandon Howard: So I guess that's what made me, you know, a strong person.

210
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.410
Brandon Howard: And I want to help with other people's issues.

211
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:48.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then also, that work ethic, where it almost seems as though you're accustomed to working hard, because sometimes I'm watching the movie will say that you work 12 hours.

212
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:50.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: House.

213
00:28:52.200 --> 00:29:01.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Every day someone like I mean I go if I were eight eight and a half hours. I'm like, Oh, no, this is too much. You know, in a day.

214
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.410
Brandon Howard: Oh my calm.

215
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.610
Brandon Howard: I've always dealt with with like

216
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:22.320
Brandon Howard: The back I got they said that I had ADHD to like some kind of stand and I just don't ever get tired. I can go to work and you know

217
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:43.410
Brandon Howard: I can come home and work some more. And I just like my body feels tired, but my mind like you gotta keep going, keep going. And I mean it gets it gets really tough. At times, you know, not being able to sleep, and it's just it's locked out to deal with.

218
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:49.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You

219
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.660
Brandon Howard: Know you continue to come to therapy.

220
00:29:51.690 --> 00:30:09.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we we unpack and we find different connections between experiences. You can also then the fellas skills. We can shift things from childhood and its impact and see how we can tailor it to the present day because

221
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.420
Brandon Howard: There's a lot of connections we can identify

222
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:30.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or my childhood experiences. And so it wouldn't make sense that to this day. You work long hours to this thing you think about providing and work almost equates to existence because as a child. If you didn't work. You didn't eat.

223
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:32.790
Brandon Howard: That

224
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:42.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As a child, not know where their meal is going to come from and let alone that they're responsible to make sure they get that meal that's everyday existence.

225
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:51.960
Brandon Howard: Yeah, but you know it's same time being that young, we shouldn't have never had to deal with a thing like that.

226
00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:54.090
Brandon Howard: We should never had to worry about that.

227
00:30:54.510 --> 00:31:10.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not at all, but because that was your experience. Now, to this day, and that would have contributed to your ADHD because I'm a child, you have to keep going. You had to be alert to avoid the next BT

228
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.650
Brandon Howard: Yeah. Well, that's true. Yeah.

229
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:29.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To look and see the difference finds like oh, getting upset. She's been upset, how do I avoid this data being in that state of always going having your amygdala always being exposed to the fight or flight.

230
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, that's how you operate.

231
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:48.540
Brandon Howard: And it's like, you know, then we always had, like, just say was always walking on eggshells afraid, you know, or if we do this is going to trigger that you know like

232
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:57.180
Brandon Howard: I can, I can see where you're coming from, like, the stuff from my childhood. It plays a big part in to where I am today.

233
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And even more so there's probably experiences that you like.

234
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:04.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That definitely

235
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:24.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the same hyper vigilant insane always fright. So when I talked about the middle of night talk about fight, flight, or freeze it almost seems like she always freezing. She's always in shops and going from edge something's going to happen.

236
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:35.610
Brandon Howard: Well, like she didn't have a childhood as bad as mine, but you know she her dad always would beat her and her sister, and then

237
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:58.620
Brandon Howard: You know she she got raped when she was 16 and so she's got the kid now and then she got out of that awful, you know, place and got married to another dirt and in like a red chakra out and Vader and this and I you know I guess that's the reason why she's always in a panic.

238
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:16.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe for you because now she has a dime a dozen of us that loves it when people are conditioned to be in some situations when they finally have a situation is working well, they're in fear of when is it going to be bad.

239
00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:18.330
Brandon Howard: Yeah.

240
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:24.990
Brandon Howard: I can say that. And I mean, that's probably like why she has a lot of anxiety and, you know, anxiety,

241
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:37.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: SHE'S WAITING she's waiting for all those past experiences, she's waiting for the cycle to continue to repeat itself. And so every day. It's almost like she's anticipating that

242
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:50.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, um, we're at the 30 minute mark, you know, let me know if you want to continue, some more, or if this is a good stopping point. I'm sitting. What are you

243
00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.390
Brandon Howard: Right now.

244
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.570
Brandon Howard: Oh, let's let's stop right here okay cuz because I think I'm besides the bathroom.

245
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See your eyes.

246
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.010
Brandon Howard: So,

247
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:09.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reach out to me, hopefully I'll see you on Monday. And we'll, we'll find out where we can meet again for individual to process or

248
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Make some more committee. Okay.

249
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:12.810
Brandon Howard: Absolutely.

250
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:13.680
All right.

251
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:16.320
Brandon Howard: Thank you.
