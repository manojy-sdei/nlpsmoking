00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.700
Angelo: Sick and tired of being sick and tired, you know, I'm just

18
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.550
Angelo: Like

19
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.190
Angelo: I've got to do something different, you know,

20
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:46.020
Angelo: And I don't know, just always feeling so defeated, you know, and just, I don't know, like I feel like I always throw in the towel towel. Even before I arrived. You know, like

21
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.860
Angelo: I've been trying to really like

22
00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:03.420
Angelo: Trying to get it in my head like nothing is going to stop me. You know, like I'm going to find a way around, you know, like, and just use any resource I can you know

23
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:19.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To us, and that black and white thinking visits it you know because you said you kind of like throwing the towel before the fight even begins. And so now happen that resolve that. And we're just going to continue to commit to it.

24
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what what outcomes. Have you noticed as a dip with happiness mindset.

25
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.390
Angelo: Um,

26
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.380
Angelo: I've been. I've been feeling a lot better about myself like

27
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.270
Angelo: I don't know, just feeling productive. You know, like

28
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.960
Angelo: Even though like I haven't like launched my website yet or anything like that or like

29
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:57.840
Angelo: Because I mean there's there's like a lot of like different technical aspects to stuff, you know, like, you can't just go and spam. You know, you get an affiliate link to somebody else's product.

30
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:17.400
Angelo: You know, and they give you like resources and stuff like you know that you can cut and paste and but you have to have your own web page. And then from there you get like a landing page that you can put out to like social media like Facebook and stuff like that, you know, but

31
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.070
Angelo: You have to have that landing page.

32
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.390
Angelo: You know, and

33
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.210
Angelo: You know, just learning all these different types of class, but, you know, like, it seems so

34
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:39.720
Angelo: Overwhelming and like such a like crazy. Like, how do you like where do you even begin to like learn about this kind of stuff. Like, you know, there's really no classes or, you know, where

35
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:49.290
Angelo: But like being able to actually wrap my wrap my mind around like really like it's not that conflict, you know, like

36
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.940
Angelo: This

37
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.130
Angelo: Very scary like demonized it you know like that that was in my head. Like I demonized it and like

38
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:12.420
Angelo: Saw other people enjoying it. And, you know, like you see people on the internet and you know they're they're networking, they're doing, you know, and it's like you look at that and you want to take part in that as well.

39
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.440
Angelo: You know what I mean.

40
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:29.700
Angelo: And it finally feels like that door is is finally opening for, you know, like a whole you know like new world of, you know, the internet, you know and and i mean i know there's a lot of bad dark but you know but like

41
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.680
Angelo: It's not as scary as it once was, you know,

42
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So do you have any resources to connect with someone that already in this field.

43
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To rely on this seems like a very overwhelming and ambitious task to take on so

44
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, be good to have some method supports to help navigate that.

45
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.170
Angelo: That's exactly what I mean like

46
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.200
Angelo: 10 minutes ago, I was just telling my mom. I was like,

47
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:13.080
Angelo: You know, I've learned a lot, you know, on my own, but I need somebody to walk me through this, because there's a few things that are not quite clear. You know, like

48
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.060
Angelo: And I, I've got some

49
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.130
Angelo: Some questions to you know like

50
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.840
Angelo: So I'm actually

51
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.550
Angelo: I'm

52
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:33.990
Angelo: Going to purchase one of the programs I found one for like 10 bucks a month. And so I went out and I bought like a prepaid card because I don't want to tie my account. You know, because trying to cancel stuff and you

53
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.010
Angelo: Know, I mean,

54
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.040
Angelo: Even if it is legit. You know, like, you can still get screwed legitimately, you know,

55
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.250
Angelo: So I put some distance

56
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.970
Angelo: You know by getting a green card, you know,

57
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.260
Angelo: And I'm going to

58
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.540
Angelo: purchase one of the programs with software, you know, they have a lot of stuff built for you.

59
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.520
Angelo: And I'm going to try it out.

60
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.270
Angelo: And, you know,

61
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Through the mentorship and

62
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:08.610
Angelo: Really just trying to take advantage of, you know, put my all you know really focus in on. I mean really trying to get this take, you know, taking it off, you know,

63
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sounds like a good plan. It's always um

64
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:26.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, interesting to learn something new and to see how your mind can attach to the information. So it's empowering when it connects and then

65
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:36.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, it can be disheartening. Sometimes when it doesn't go, you know, give yourself embrace that when it becomes overwhelming. So just, you know,

66
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Take a pause, and then go back

67
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To I think it's very

68
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Important to have some people

69
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Connect with those mentors and that

70
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:57.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That when you have those moments, relax. You know, things are connecting I need some fresh ideas to get to, you know, establish with with your goal.

71
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.430
Angelo: Get out of my own head.

72
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

73
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.490
Angelo: I support system.

74
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.540
Angelo: I mean, initially to help push me through. I mean, like,

75
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.620
Angelo: With anything, you know,

76
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.270
Angelo: Working out or whatever, you know,

77
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like accountability.

78
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.580
Angelo: By and I think it'll really help to

79
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:22.980
Angelo: Have somebody there to to push through because I know there's going to be those times where it's going to seem hopeless and I'm going to want to give up.

80
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.000
You

81
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.910
Angelo: See results and stuff. But I mean, I've got to push through that.

82
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.630
You know,

83
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.320
Angelo: I don't know. I really look forward to

84
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:43.020
Angelo: Just having a topic, you know, a subject to interact with somebody you know just

85
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.010
Angelo: I mean, I don't care what we talked about with the fact that we already

86
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:55.290
Angelo: Have a topic, you know, even before the initial encounter with the person you know there's a topic and some

87
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.060
Angelo: You know something in common and

88
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:15.510
Angelo: You know, it's, it's gonna be nice, you know, because like I'm thirsty for this information and there's a lot of people out there that have the resources toward you know to give this information, you know, like, so it'll be, I don't know. I'm hoping that

89
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:32.550
Angelo: You know, the, the more I've learned you know because I've been trying, you know this by myself for a long time and I've learned a lot of like tricks and, you know, different things, or whatever, you know, but I haven't been able to put them all together to implement them all.

90
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.460
Angelo: You know, you know, working system like

91
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.930
Angelo: I have a lot of like cool parts and pieces, you know,

92
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.030
Angelo: But to put them all together and implement them, you know, it'll be a nice

93
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.890
Angelo: More running machine, you know,

94
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:57.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. Sounds like you know you've already got the foundation and the motivation. So get things going. And you've been a customer for a long time working independently.

95
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:09.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And any goals outcomes that you have experienced as a result of your own hardware which is encouraging and very inspiring to be able to work independently and still make progress.

96
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:21.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But now you know activate other supports and and having that idea that, you know, you don't have to do this alone. I know when I first started with our health and was very overwhelming.

97
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All the different people to learn about, you know, all the different forms to remember. And so I knew that I had to

98
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:38.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Connect with someone else. That was a therapist that was established, because when everything became like okay this is too much and I'm balancing with some balance in that

99
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:47.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I would, you know, check in with that person and they would directly to Zach around, go and it helped it to not be such an interesting transition

100
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:57.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And coming into the program. I think it's something that everyone should explore whenever they're venturing into something new, like you said, have

101
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One that has a common

102
00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.130
Angelo: Interest.

103
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With you, to help keep you encouraged and motivated

104
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.800
Angelo: Right and just critique.

105
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:12.240
Angelo: Your style to, you know, just format. A little different, you know, and perfect, you know,

106
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.360
Angelo: Your performance. I mean, whatever it may be.

107
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

108
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It helps to keep the fire going you know

109
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:31.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You see someone else through things and then to share ideas. It helps you to. It's a measure of how much you have learned and how you've grown and you realize that you're able to also teach it, and her and

110
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Others as well.

111
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:34.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right.

112
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:43.110
Angelo: And that's just like that much more icing on the cake. You know, like, and the money is great, you know, but

113
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.260
Angelo: The relationships and the

114
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:57.450
Angelo: You know, it's just all that much more act you know getting out there and you know I think people are resource you know people are, you know, a wealth of many things.

115
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.970
Angelo: You know, just, I mean,

116
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.710
Angelo: That's

117
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.210
Angelo: I don't know. I

118
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.980
Angelo: I look forward to meeting more people out there.

119
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm very interesting definitely keep you occupied and busy.

120
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.680
Angelo: Yeah yeah

121
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:25.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you have social media outlets, because you know you mentioned that once they connect you have to then kind of have like a social media landing so

122
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I started following no

123
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.650
Angelo: I'm not really

124
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

125
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:44.040
Angelo: I mean I post once a while like on Facebook. Like I struggle for ideas, but like, I'm not like like when I see people posting their food. I'm like,

126
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Who cares, like you

127
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.580
Angelo: Know, like, but I mean, to each their own, you know,

128
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.160
Angelo: But I don't know. I would probably like

129
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.270
Angelo: Personally, I want to distance myself from my personal account.

130
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.500
Angelo: Because like

131
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:06.450
Angelo: There's a lot of like controversial, stuff like that. I post. You know, I see videos of like police beating or something. And I'm like,

132
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.480
Angelo: Oh my god like shocked like

133
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.820
Angelo: Yeah stuff about Trump

134
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.780
Angelo: You know, some

135
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:18.990
Angelo: Nonsense, or whatever. And I mean, people have their own opinion and I don't want to alienate anybody

136
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.490
Angelo: In like

137
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.540
Angelo: From a professional personally out of mine alienating

138
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.110
Yeah.

139
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

140
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:36.330
Angelo: I don't know, like, to me, like my personal opinion is is one thing, but like when I'm in a business sense. I definitely want to have that

141
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.950
Angelo: Separation of the neutral. I mean,

142
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.350
Angelo: Yeah, but I mean, I guess you can always look

143
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.550
Angelo: You know, but

144
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:45.330
Angelo: I don't know.

145
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:53.790
Angelo: I just kind of wanted to. I'm thinking about creating like a different like a business site for

146
00:12:54.990 --> 00:13:00.150
Angelo: You know, the, the affiliate marketing on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, all that

147
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.330
Angelo: But like with this program. I'm not

148
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:19.770
Angelo: Quite clear how like they have like their sites that are, you know, like they integrate automatically you know and like you put up your, your post or whatever your

149
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.830
Angelo: Landing page but

150
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.560
Angelo: The one that goes on the social media sites or whatever.

151
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:45.330
Angelo: The introduction page with your affiliate link and it gets distributed to like a bunch of different social media outlets. You know, so you only have to post it once and then it like webs out into, you know, Instagram and

152
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.010
Angelo: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all that

153
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:53.610
Angelo: It's

154
00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:05.940
Angelo: I'm hoping it's it's all I mean everything always sell it, you know, sounds good when they're trying to sell it to you, but I don't know I'm I'm hopeful that have been resource.

155
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:17.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, it sounds like it's definitely going to be a lot of work but you know the benefits will also be just as a minute so

156
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:19.530
Angelo: Yeah.

157
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.340
Angelo: It's been keeping my mind busy.

158
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:23.970
Like

159
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.560
Angelo: I

160
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.390
Angelo: Don't know. I hadn't been so

161
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.030
Angelo: I don't know, it just

162
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.070
Angelo: In the limbo, like the depressed limbo of not like

163
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:48.060
Angelo: I wake up and I'm, you know, I've got, I've got a project going on. I've got something that's not complete, you know that I still have to work on, you know, and something that that I'm proud of you know that I'm taking

164
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.340
Angelo: Taking me a while.

165
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.700
Angelo: To get it going, you know, scrappy bunch of cages, you know, because I've had to start over.

166
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.690
Angelo: You know,

167
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:09.480
Angelo: And just critiquing, you know, and learning. You know, so definitely still like the sense of accomplishment.

168
00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:18.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And, um, how has how has family dynamics been for you.

169
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:20.520
Angelo: I'm

170
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:41.040
Angelo: Like my mom is actually been surprisingly supportive and like she actually lent me the money, cuz so broke all the time to to go out and get the the $25 card, you know, the prepaid card and stuff.

171
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:53.070
Angelo: She's like, you know, I don't have a lot of money but you know if it's something you believe in, you know, I don't really get it. But you know, I can see that you've been putting a lot of time and effort into

172
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.450
Angelo: Learning about this stuff.

173
00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:02.490
Angelo: Like so, like, she's trying to be supportive, you know, with the little she has, you know,

174
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:05.970
Angelo: Like that means a lot to

175
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:07.950
Like

176
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:29.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Noticing the attempts and appreciating the attempts will continue to strengthen the, you know, communication styles and I know the support has been big for you. And so having mom come alongside you and know as opposed to see your self esteem, the confidence. That's good.

177
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.210
Yeah.

178
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:39.240
Angelo: Me, I noticed, like I have this really bad habit of like meeting for approval like 10

179
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.140
Angelo: Years old and I still look to my mom for

180
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.810
Angelo: For that approval, like, you know,

181
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.980
Angelo: Even when I was doing this.

182
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.850
Angelo: Little you know started off with this affiliate marketing thing. You know, like

183
00:16:52.050 --> 00:17:04.260
Angelo: She was, you know, for a very long time very skeptical and you know like and you know I I kept asking my life because I get really upset when she chewed it down. And I'm like, why is this bothering me so much like

184
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:05.940
Angelo: I can go out and do

185
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.800
Angelo: This on my own, like you

186
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.260
Angelo: Don't have to keep my myself like

187
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.110
Angelo: I can go and do this on my own. Like, you don't need her approval, you know,

188
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:35.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, realizing that that validation and and wanting to prove for mom may translate into other sessions. Right. So when you interact with someone else that that projection of validation from mom might transition and other

189
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:45.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Dynamics, it can transition and works then without even knowing that subconsciously because you've been wanting that validation from mom, you know, your boss.

190
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:59.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: May may appear as though, oh I just want the validation. I want the approval and don't get that on an ongoing you go to that back away making or that catastrophizing where it's like, they must not like me because they didn't say Hi today.

191
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:11.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm for you been, you know, group individual settings, whatever it may be, be mindful that okay, this may be presented itself in other ways. And then having that

192
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:20.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know validating statements and affirmative statement so that you don't go into that spiral of showing insignificant low self esteem.

193
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you noticed that another say

194
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.860
Angelo: Yeah, it's, it's like a circular like

195
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.540
Angelo: It's like a rotating door that keeps going around and around. And like any

196
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.270
Angelo: Each thought like keeps RE. RE validating the next one.

197
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.800
Angelo: You know, like

198
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.590
Angelo: And it's like,

199
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.240
Angelo: I start looking out and observing the wrong things.

200
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.990
Angelo: And those become validation

201
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.830
Angelo: It's kind of like

202
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.780
Angelo: Kind of like a conspiracy theory in my own head. You know, like

203
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.030
Angelo: You start seeing

204
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.910
Angelo: You know, like your mind starts pointing out certain patterns that are like really like

205
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.760
Angelo: It's

206
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:13.800
It's

207
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:37.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, be rational thinking process and because, you know, unfortunately, it's so hard to process that. It all stems to childhood in our upbringing. Right. And it's not pointing fingers at parents, but those relationships play a huge role in how we view and operate in the world. So one

208
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:46.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Validation yeah one in that validation from childhood, it transcends into adulthood and lucky stages this revolving door of want desires.

209
00:19:47.310 --> 00:20:02.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Desires want desires and when you don't meet that need. It just wanting to rejection rejection rejection rejection instead of really identifying what is the ones you know what is the me that I'm actually searching for

210
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.160
Angelo: Yeah, and

211
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:09.900
Angelo: Like it's

212
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:19.740
Angelo: Me and my mom get into it. You know, like she shares her like the way she shows her love is by buying new stuff, financial, you know, like

213
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.510
Angelo: As far as like physical contact or like connecting on an

214
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.910
Angelo: Emotionally or intellectual level is

215
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:34.110
Angelo: Just not there, but like, she'll go to the store and buying this, you know, and be like, you know, see. That's how much I love you like

216
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:43.170
Angelo: You know, I don't feel a connection by in an inanimate object.

217
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.130
You know,

218
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.150
Angelo: But the way she sees my, you know, like

219
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.400
Angelo: And I was taught to love that way to

220
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.240
Angelo: You know, like

221
00:20:51.720 --> 00:21:10.620
Angelo: I feel very awkward, you know, hugging my son or, you know, sitting on the couch, you know, with my arm around them or something, you know, and it's, I don't know, it's, it's, it's the way I was taught to react to, you know, the situations.

222
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Gary Chapman. I don't know if you ever heard of him. He has this book called The Five Love Languages.

223
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:26.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And he picks exactly what you talked about how people give and receive love. And typically people give love the way they want to receive it.

224
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:37.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so it sounds that your mom's love language is gifts. So, you know, when she gives you that gift, she expects that he must know I love him because I'm rocking this

225
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:47.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But if your love language is not gives it doesn't translate to love for you if your love language was say for instance that physical touch or the

226
00:21:48.060 --> 00:22:00.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: words of affirmation that it would be more validate to hear you know statements like you're doing a good job. I see how much progress you made or, you know, you look good today. That would be one for me for you than her purchasing

227
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:21.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So Gary Chapman said there's five different love language is physical touch gifts acts of service words of affirmation and quality time. And so we all have our way and we tend to unintentionally show our love through the way we want to be loved.

228
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:33.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so the education comes in. And when you identify what your love language is, you know, being able to communicate to that person, you know, thank you for this gift.

229
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:49.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then, you know, another timing, you know, just kind of explaining what really brings value to me it really makes me feel love and support it is when you do a b&c because, you know, I noticed that my love language is and

230
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.520
Angelo: For me, I mean,

231
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.070
Angelo: My ideal.

232
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:04.470
Angelo: I think that the best way to to show your love is to spend time with somebody, because that

233
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

234
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:13.590
Angelo: Your time is something that you will never ever obtain more of, and it will always have the same monetary value because it's always limited

235
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:15.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

236
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.830
Angelo: It's something that

237
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.470
Angelo: You cannot replace for get more of

238
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.120
Angelo: You know, so if you're willing

239
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:36.660
Angelo: To spend that time with me like that is definitely a sacrifice in it. Like, I definitely you know like sacrifice and love are very come hand in hand, you know, giving something of yourself, you know, and

240
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.540
Angelo: I find that much more valuable.

241
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.110
Angelo: Than money, you know, and I understand you know money is, you know,

242
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:54.690
Angelo: Monetary to your time, you know, work, you know, but it's not a balance scale, you know,

243
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:55.500
Yeah.

244
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:10.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so do you find because you you your love language is quality time that you try to to show that. And that's how you communicate your mouth towards others.

245
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.510
Angelo: Um,

246
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:25.920
Angelo: I mean, ideally. Yeah, but I mean to be. I mean, if I'm honest. I really don't show a lot of love to anybody. I mean,

247
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.200
Angelo: Like my stuff. Like, I don't

248
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.070
Angelo: I wish I spent more time with but

249
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:53.280
Angelo: I don't know. I'm just for so long and been wrapped up in my own little world and head and like you know in that circle of, you know, I feel guilty because I don't spend time with my son. I don't spend time with my son, because I feel guilty because I don't spend

250
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

251
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.830
Angelo: It's just that constant circle.

252
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.700
Angelo: You know,

253
00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:12.390
Angelo: feeling guilty because I don't spend time with my son and I don't spend time with my son, because I feel guilty about not, you know, spending time with, you know, and it's just

254
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:13.980
I don't know.

255
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.070
Angelo: And it's very

256
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.840
Angelo: Cumbersome it's it's debilitating.

257
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.710
You know,

258
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:31.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You want to show your love for your son. Not sure how

259
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:37.950
Angelo: Yeah, I mean,

260
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:39.870
Angelo: I know that

261
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:46.860
Angelo: I don't know, I just, I don't know if it's like trauma or what but like just that.

262
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:53.610
Angelo: That uncomfortable feeling like of touching and being touched or you

263
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mentioned, you didn't mention having sexual abuse trauma as a child. Correct.

264
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:00.930
Yeah.

265
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.130
Angelo: The family.

266
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.760
graced

267
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:26.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A stranger. This was someone that was loud and trusted within your internal family systems. So it's totally normal that you know your coping mechanism and result of that he shoots was to kind of suppress physical contact and be limited in how you show love

268
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In physical expression.

269
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:41.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You hope you find it in other settings, not just with your son. But when you were in romantic relationships, but it was also difficult physical intimacy.

270
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:50.220
Angelo: Like in the bedroom, not so much. But like in public or or like

271
00:26:51.870 --> 00:27:00.630
Angelo: I don't like it was always awkward. You know, like the first time to like grab some, you know, to hold a girl's hand, you know, or something.

272
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.400
Angelo: Very like nerve wracking, you know, and I mean

273
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:13.890
Angelo: You know, it's always you know like scary to go on a date and like make the first you know and like, but I mean,

274
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:24.330
Angelo: I would have like horrible anxiety like until, like, to this day, like, I haven't. I mean, dated or better like

275
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:31.320
Angelo: Then, with a great you know probably like five years, you know, because I just got so much anxiety about it, you know.

276
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.230
Angelo: And it's just I don't know.

277
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.500
Angelo: Me when I was younger, you know,

278
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.830
Angelo: I messed around quite a bit, you know, but

279
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.510
Angelo: I would never really connect on

280
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.830
Angelo: Like I would never open up, you know,

281
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:59.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That timeline with five years. Can you might connect it with something that happened five years ago.

282
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.690
Angelo: I really can't think of anything.

283
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.470
Angelo: Like

284
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.830
Angelo: Part of it was was my addiction.

285
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:34.290
Angelo: With the opiates, or whatever. I mean, I lost a lot of like that my sex drive or whatever. And I think that like, that's all like a huge motivating factor in a male's life you know you want to get

286
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.530
Angelo: A nice car seat. Press the pretty girl and

287
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.870
Angelo: You know, like that.

288
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:49.410
Angelo: That beautiful girl is becomes like a trophy and, you know, show them a chore to all your friends and you know that's that makes you you know like

289
00:28:50.280 --> 00:29:04.590
Angelo: I don't know, it's, it's a status, you know, and like everything that you know you do is derived around centered around, you know, meeting with that attractive mate, you know,

290
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:20.850
Angelo: And I mean, when I lost that like interest you know i mean i got discouraged. You know, most of my life. I mean, I was, you know, I wasn't all that popular in school. You know, I mean, I didn't lose my virginity till I was like 17, something like that.

291
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:41.700
Angelo: But I was never really all that, you know, and I felt a lot of rejection growing up and stuff like that. And then when my addiction came into play. It was just that much more like reinforce you know that, like, Well, you know, like I lost that much more interest in a subject that I was already

292
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:57.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I mean it's, it sounds almost my performance anxiety, you know, knowing that the expectation is to be intimate and and knowing that you know you're working to get several different obstacles.

293
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:20.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The shame that comes with your addiction history on the childhood lack of validation and so that fear of rejection. It just follows you throughout your course of life. And now this distance it. So all of those are recipes, you know, to kind of create this experience that you talk about.

294
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:26.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I don't know how to show intimacy to others because I don't want to be rejected.

295
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:36.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Last for a lot of vulnerability, but, on the contrary, I see so much vulnerability with you when it comes to the emotional response.

296
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:47.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so, that is, I guess, how you have compensated over time for being unable to maybe express physically um you know your love.

297
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:57.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I do see that emotional vulnerability vulnerability that allows you to connect with other people. I see it resonate in group settings and another group member

298
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:06.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is going through it. You can not only normalize their experience, but also kind of share your own personal challenges to help support them.

299
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.370
Angelo: Well, I mean, I definitely feel the desire.

300
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.050
Angelo: To connect with others.

301
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:16.920
Angelo: You know,

302
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:27.840
Angelo: It's just, it's hard for it to to come about naturally you know i mean

303
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.670
Angelo: And it's

304
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.520
Angelo: I don't know. It's seems

305
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:34.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, um, you

306
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.810
Angelo: Know it just it's it

307
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:54.270
Angelo: Seems like things become more difficult and like more for in the more you desire that you know

308
00:31:54.930 --> 00:32:00.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, because now it's more focus. It's more focused on the outcome, and then

309
00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:09.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Yeah. And then we can't meet, it's like, Okay, another failure because you haven't met that goal outcome.

310
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:30.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. But what if, you know, there wasn't a different outcome, you know, who are you and being able to identify. Well, I have my limitations when it comes to the physical expression of love, but I will commit to, you know, filling in the blank, like how to share your emotional vomit.

311
00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:34.560
Angelo: Um,

312
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.830
Angelo: Well, I mean, I think about it a lot.

313
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

314
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.620
Angelo: But I mean, I still like

315
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.390
Angelo: I don't know. That's

316
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:47.940
Angelo: Like relationship with with somebody else's kind of on the backburner my

317
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.060
Angelo: Right now I need to like get through life.

318
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.700
Angelo: Like my relationship to life and success and the

319
00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.000
Angelo: Like my relationship to the world like

320
00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.700
Angelo: I need to like that needs to be like

321
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.230
Angelo: My first priority.

322
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.890
Angelo: Like, because I want to be a resource to somebody like

323
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:09.360
Angelo: I like

324
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:19.680
Angelo: And I've thought about it to, you know, like, Well, what if you know it would help me to just have somebody like support, you know, like a support system for each other, you know,

325
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.090
Angelo: But like

326
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.860
Angelo: You know,

327
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:35.610
Angelo: I've kicked around different ideas or whatever, you know, but I mean I feel like I want to establish myself and like when I meet it. When I do finally meet a girl like

328
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:47.610
Angelo: She'll be lucky to be with you know and then I don't want to sound. I mean, that sounds really shitty heard it, but like I want to be worth like that. She's like, I'm a resource to her.

329
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.720
Angelo: Like she's happy to be with

330
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:52.770
Angelo: Like I'm not

331
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.200
Angelo: Just a burden to her. I'm not just another

332
00:33:55.770 --> 00:34:04.770
Angelo: guy that comes at you know and lives in her freakin apartment, just you know mooching off and as another just leech on our life.

333
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:15.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, it would be good if a lot of other mentors that perspective to know, you know, to have that that goal. And that attainment is admirable. Not every not every

334
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:29.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Person not even just from a male perspective commits to be in that type of person within a relationship where you can bring something to the table and offer something that is mutually beneficial.

335
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:36.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's what I'm hearing that you want. You just, you know, you want that balance. You know, we all have those desires.

336
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:56.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so what I was when I was talking about in that context was not not compartmentalize to romantic relationships but like you said just social relationships and in recognizing that and giving yourself credit for my ability to connect with others on the emotional level.

337
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:13.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's something to definitely you know, be mindful of because the validation is something that's integrated within you. And so when you start to realize validation. Another standards and measures, then it will continue to build up that self esteem.

338
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you ever take medication for your anxiety.

339
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.350
Angelo: Um,

340
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.500
Angelo: They had me on on

341
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.160
Angelo: Ritalin.

342
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.570
growing up as a kid.

343
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:37.290
Angelo: And I've actually been wanting to get back. I'd like to, to help me to concentrate and focus and stuff.

344
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:54.930
Angelo: But they never had me on on like any and they they've done Ritalin and antidepressants, but I really didn't stick with the IM and presence because they, I don't know that the side effects were just too much for me.

345
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:57.450
Angelo: But I am

346
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:04.260
Angelo: Trying to I've been seeking out somebody who can read diagnosed me and my adulthood.

347
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.520
Angelo: For the ATP so that I could start getting treated for that.

348
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.020
Angelo: Because I think that would really help me, you know,

349
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:22.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To focus more on the Add diagnosis and in regards as opposed to the entire

350
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:24.390
Angelo: Alone.

351
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.900
Angelo: Well, I know that like when I was younger. Like for me, I couldn't

352
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:45.840
Angelo: Like the anxiety would come on when they would sit me down in a desk and open up that book and tell me to sit there and like I was like it was just like a rush of stress and then when they put me on the Gremlin

353
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:54.870
Angelo: It was it became like a fun day. Like I enjoy, you know, sitting there writing, you know, and being creative.

354
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.090
Angelo: Like you got the creative juices flowing

355
00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.940
Angelo: You know, but without those creative

356
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:05.850
Angelo: Like your focus is everywhere else in the room except in that book. It's like

357
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.750
Angelo: Anxiety.

358
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.150
Angelo: You know,

359
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:28.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I'm thinking I'm you know going to your primary care physician. I know they have allowed a lot for primary care physicians to be able to prescribe medication for depression and anxiety symptoms.

360
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:35.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And, you know, the things that you shared with me. I'm worried reflective with the anxiety.

361
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:44.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, because I'm hearing social anxiety symptoms that are presenting itself and how it impacts you know different functions in your life.

362
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:59.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I do see the add as well. I do not minimizing bad but thinking if there's been so much challenges to, you know, maybe to figure out and get that a diagnosis for the anxiety. So you can get some of the support of medication as well.

363
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.710
Angelo: I'm definitely open minded. I mean,

364
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:24.840
Angelo: And I mean, if that stands out to you more, you know, it's, you know, definitely a concern, you know, because I mean I I feel it. A lot of the time, you know, and you know, my mom will point out to me. You know, like I won't even notice. You know, like I'm sitting there watching TV and I'm rocky

365
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.280
Angelo: And like, she'll pointed out to me and I'm like,

366
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.130
Angelo: I didn't realize I was doing that.

367
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:39.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely visible, especially with it being Tele health, like I

368
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:50.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Could see you every movement because then it impacts the video so I do see the add, you know, presenting itself with, you know, constant movement, but I also hear

369
00:38:51.480 --> 00:39:04.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, clear symptoms of anxiety that presented itself, the social anxiety. The rejection, the fear of being in those social settings that impacts the ushers making a mistake.

370
00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those different things.

371
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

372
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:18.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So something to think about, you know, do you have a primary care physician that you're saying

373
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:30.570
Angelo: Oh, um, I haven't seen them in in quite a while. But I went to go check out I made an appointment with psychiatrist.

374
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

375
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.760
Angelo: I don't know, like

376
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.080
Angelo: They make it like eight months out, you know, so I finally got into see

377
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Her

378
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.850
Angelo: She tried me on selects and

379
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.360
Angelo: The Clonidine

380
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

381
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.460
Angelo: You know, I wonder, you know, I take

382
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.510
Angelo: Quantities for support medication you know with with you guys.

383
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

384
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.680
Angelo: Like she started just missed it. And like

385
00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:05.010
Angelo: I asked her about the add. You know, if I could get a diagnose you know. And she was like, well, I don't, I do not prescribe

386
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:10.440
Angelo: Narcotics at all. You know, because of your drug history that

387
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:22.290
Angelo: You know when I said, Okay. Was there anything else you can help me, you know, treat me with, you know, you know, I've got no money, you know, and she's stuck with

388
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

389
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:35.970
Angelo: Because I tried the selection and the quantity for about two months and it didn't work out for me. And when I had the follow up, you know, I asked her, again, you know, this isn't working for me.

390
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.450
Angelo: She was she just basically

391
00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.350
Angelo: Wrote in a report that I was

392
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:46.530
Angelo: seeking behavior or something.

393
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:47.400
Like

394
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.230
Angelo: Yeah.

395
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:57.600
Angelo: So I asked her, you know, if I could switch to a doctor that would prescribe a medication that can help me, you know, because

396
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:03.810
Angelo: It's just so dangerous. Why are they, why did they prescribe it to me as a child.

397
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:04.590
Angelo: You know,

398
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.740
Angelo: Dangerous thing, you know.

399
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:14.790
Angelo: She's like, Well, I'm not getting crushed, you know, and I'm like, Well, you know, my doctor. I'm trying to

400
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:15.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ask you

401
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.500
Angelo: You know, informed, but I'm not trying to be a smart ass.

402
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:22.020
Angelo: And

403
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.210
Angelo: Like, help me I need help.

404
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know,

405
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.070
Angelo: Trying to find another i'd like someone who specifically

406
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:34.500
Angelo: Focuses on

407
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That so far.

408
00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:39.420
Angelo: Um,

409
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:43.020
Angelo: I found a number. I had to call them, but they're

410
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.350
Angelo: Like still closed because the coven thing.

411
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:48.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

412
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:53.430
Angelo: I left a message and I'm supposed to be hearing back from them. I don't know.

413
00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:09.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That she was found was seems like more for what I mentioned the things it because it's you're trying to balance out the serotonin levels. Second, then stabilize some of those inside symptoms that you have

414
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.350
Um,

415
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:12.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But

416
00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:20.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Unfortunate that you had that experience where you're trying to explain what your symptoms are. That's what the psychologists to listen to

417
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:32.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's up in your response to the medication where our symptoms and then help them, then you know calibrate your medication, so that you don't have any negative symptoms of medication.

418
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

419
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:45.360
Angelo: We'll see. She because, like, one of the problems that I was having was I was having to pee like every 10 minutes and like this invitation to Pete like

420
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:46.230
Angelo: Where

421
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:54.060
Angelo: I don't know. It's like a weird feeling in your black like it feels like there's something in there but you get up to go pee and nothing comes, you know,

422
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.150
Angelo: And you have the sensation and I

423
00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:04.560
Angelo: Got that, you know, and she was like, well, that's not listed, you know, Polly your Rhea is not on the symptom, you know,

424
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:07.170
Angelo: Monday. Monday, of course, so that

425
00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:11.460
Angelo: Can't be that you know and like denying that I was experiencing these symptoms.

426
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:12.090
Angelo: You know,

427
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:13.860
Angelo: Well, that doesn't make any sense.

428
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:21.360
Angelo: That's not a, you know, and I'm like this is what I'm experiencing. Like, I'm sorry. It doesn't check your box.

429
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, like

430
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.340
Angelo: I don't know it's it's frustrating.

431
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:31.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah we did the right thing by just trying to find a different provider and

432
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hopefully, when all of this dies down because they are starting to open up again.

433
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:47.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can connect with the provider that will be more into patient here in ensuring that she here. She listens to you know the client.

434
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.470
Angelo: And it really sucks because, I mean,

435
00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:57.420
Angelo: I don't know stereotypes and stuff there. They are based in in

436
00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:59.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some sort of foundation, but

437
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:06.450
Angelo: It, it just destroys so many different industry, you know, of

438
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:07.590
Resources.

439
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.820
Angelo: And it just, it really sucks that

440
00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.540
Angelo: Goes along with you.

441
00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.860
Angelo: Even though you

442
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:17.580
Angelo: Change your

443
00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.340
Angelo: Your, your attempting to change these became

444
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.140
Angelo: society wants to

445
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:22.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Keep you

446
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.700
Angelo: In these roles.

447
00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:40.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So then you know maybe lead with what the end right with the ADD is doing, you know how that has presented and then, you know, finish off with, you know, I am in this program. These are the medications that I'm taking

448
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:49.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because often time in in my treating I hear that patients lead with the addiction. First, the addiction treatment either getting

449
00:44:50.670 --> 00:45:03.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Open up with that. That's our inputs that label, but when you present with these are the symptoms that I want to address right now. And hey, by the way, as well. I you know I am taking this medication.

450
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:08.490
Angelo: Right, you leave it as kind of a background thing, not as the main course.

451
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.170
Angelo: Yeah, like the main issue.

452
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:17.910
Angelo: The main guilt and shame. Yeah, the guilt and the shame of the addiction almost makes it seems like you have to give that disclaimer.

453
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:23.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whenever you're with a medical provider and yes it's important information for them to another medication that you're

454
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:30.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you're presenting issue to them. It's not because you're an avid is because you have ADD and you want treatment for that.

455
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you present with that and all of the symptoms and then then that conversation when the X amount of medication.

456
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:45.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then my feeling. Yeah, this and if they have the gall to ask why you didn't present with that when you say well that's not not presenting issue.

457
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:59.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I had been a treatment for X amount of years. And so this is what my my current stressor. Is this has already been resolved and the medication assisted treatment program then then I have medication. I'm seeing for this.

458
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:00.630
Angelo: Right.

459
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:01.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nice.

460
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:08.640
Angelo: See yeah i think that that will really. I mean, because that first presentation creates the identity.

461
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.420
Angelo: I mean,

462
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:23.040
Angelo: He's the ground works for a lot of the, you know, whether they're going to help you or not, you know, because I I get as as a doctor provide you know like you have to protect yourself from lawsuits from liability.

463
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:24.090
Angelo: You know,

464
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:29.070
Angelo: You know, somebody ended up ended up killing them, you know, and I definitely get that

465
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.510
Angelo: You know, but there's there's a right way like

466
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.940
Angelo: That's being methodical about it, you know, and taking the right approach instead of

467
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.650
Angelo: Entity. That's usually my response, you know,

468
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:46.350
Angelo: What screw it. I just want you know

469
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.480
Angelo: Doing it. Now, before I even get there.

470
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:54.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And fear that's that shame that you have equated with your addiction.

471
00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:04.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That encompasses you so you present with that and some of the symptoms that you show with the movement and stuff. It could match, like, oh, this person is probably high right now.

472
00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:21.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now their scope of you is totally filtered through this person is matic that's why they're moving around. This is why they're talking. This is why, as inspiration speech when it's like, no, really, the symptoms are actually associated with my add and not because I'm high on substance.

473
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:22.860
Yeah.

474
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.070
Angelo: Yeah, and like

475
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.290
Angelo: It comes out more like

476
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.920
Angelo: It like and you look at things through a filter. I mean,

477
00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.590
Angelo: you're observing things. It's kind of like a

478
00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:35.580
Angelo: Checklist you're

479
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.290
Angelo: Checking certain boxes you

480
00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:38.580
Angelo: Know eyes read or

481
00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:42.360
Angelo: Pupil you know like and and it's an evaluation and

482
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:47.520
Angelo: At the top that evaluation if you say drug addict or anxiety.

483
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.320
Angelo: Or whatever, you know,

484
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And yeah.

485
00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:52.020
Angelo: That's kind of how we all evaluate the

486
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:52.410
World.

487
00:47:55.710 --> 00:48:05.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those labels were created to help us to identify how to, you know, coincide with the person that we're speaking to. It helps us to be knowledgeable about

488
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:14.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, how are we going to treat. How are we going to operate and communicate with this individual. You know those labels are putting in place to

489
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:23.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Relate to information and to help with clarity, but it also invite some statements as well. And so we have to find that balance.

490
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:36.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, this information that I have is good because it gives me clarity on how to treat versus now switching it to that filter. Oh, this label. Let me go into my statement, you know, and what I know about it.
