Joel Fike: Oh no, I just got out of shaming.

17
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.330
Joel Fike: And I went to treatment for February. I think the third or the second of this month.

18
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.210
Dr Jameson: Like an inpatient, you mean like a resident place.

19
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.480
Dr Jameson: And so now you're and they did. They have you on Suboxone while you were there.

20
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.770
Joel Fike: No, they didn't. But I relapsed right when I got out.

21
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.210
Joel Fike: And so I got on it.

22
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.790
Joel Fike: As soon as I got through with that little relapse.

23
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.940
Dr Jameson: Where did you from the ER or how did you

24
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.510

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.880
Dr Jameson: Yes, yes. Okay. All right, so

28
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.800
Dr Jameson: Um, when were you there. Like, when did you first start

29
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.940
Joel Fike: When was I there. I was there on. Let's see here.

30
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.360
Joel Fike: It was the third I think

31
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.500
Dr Jameson: OK. And then so they put you on and what the dose that you're taking

32
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.080
Joel Fike: Two films.

33
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.870
Joel Fike: For seven days they gave me

34
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.380
Dr Jameson: Okay, are they, they ate. Sorry. Hold it up.

35
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.240
Dr Jameson: And you're taking them. When do you take it in the day.

36
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.680
Joel Fike: In the morning

37
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.180
Dr Jameson: Can you take them both.

38
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.620
Joel Fike: Well, I usually take one in the morning and then one later on in the afternoon.

39
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.820
Dr Jameson: And how's that been going for you.

40
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.680
Joel Fike: All right, I feel like I kind of need a little bit more but it's it's been going on right

41
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.540
Dr Jameson: And so that I'm not challenging that I'm just telling me what what what is making you feel that way.

42
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.770
Joel Fike: I just get

43
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.010
Joel Fike: A little bit of like sweaty palms and anxieties, a little bit. So I'm not that hungry.

44
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.010
Dr Jameson: Okay, are you nauseous, or just

45
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.010
Joel Fike: Blow up. No, no, no, no. She's just kind of

46
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.680
Joel Fike: Feel a little bit of like withdrawal symptoms, a little

47
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.120
Dr Jameson: And is that coming like continuously or do you have here.

48
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.740
Joel Fike: Like the longest say don't take it so like

49
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.230
Joel Fike: In the evenings.

50
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.970
Joel Fike: So I could if I took it in the morning and then took it again in the afternoon. By the time I go to bed. I kind of figured that feeling a little bit. Okay.

51
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.320
Dr Jameson: And has that been that's been happening ever since you started it.

52
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:58.380
Joel Fike: Well, the first two days really rough I've didn't feel good at all. I was pretty sick. And I just toughed it out and after three days I started feeling a little better.

53
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.020
Dr Jameson: Okay, um,

54
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.670
Dr Jameson: And since then has it continued to gradually get better, or would you

55
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.110
That's good.

56
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.480
Dr Jameson: Okay, so the sweaty palms and low appetite is

57
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.070
Joel Fike: It's still there, but it's gotten better from when I first started

58
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.840
Dr Jameson: Actually getting better. Okay. And he said, it's in the evening. So what do you do when that happens.

59
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.040
Joel Fike: I've just been watching TV to fall asleep.

60
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.960
Dr Jameson: Okay. Just, just trying to ignore it. Okay. Well, that's impressive. Good for you.

61
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.550
Joel Fike: I've done, I've gotten off of this before I was in

62
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.640
Joel Fike: A methadone clinic for three years, actually.

63
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.350
Dr Jameson: Like

64
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.800
Joel Fike: 2014 to 2017

65
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:57.210
Joel Fike: And it was so hard to get off of. And I had to get off of it cold turkey and I was actually in jail and took me like five months to feel normal. So I never want to do that again.

66
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:12.480
Dr Jameson: Oh, well I mean generally we if we make the decision to discontinue at some point it's done gradually and it doesn't mean you don't have some symptoms, but hopefully not to that.

67
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.790
Dr Jameson: Degree.

68
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:27.030
Joel Fike: Yeah, the, the jail that I was in custody. Yeah, they wouldn't treat it even with I tried to get him to call my clinic and everything and they wouldn't give me anything. So I just had to cold turkey.

69
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.990
Joel Fike: Just crazy

70
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:41.400
Dr Jameson: Okay, so let's let me ask a couple other sort of unrelated questions, and then we'll come back to, to the main topic. Are you allergic to any medications.

71
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.780
Joel Fike: No, not that I'm aware of.

72
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.620
Dr Jameson: And do you are you prescribed any other medications.

73
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.310
Dr Jameson: No. Okay, so just the Suboxone for the last week.

74
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.680
Dr Jameson: And that's the first time you've ever

75
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.890
Dr Jameson: Taken you are on methadone before, but you've never been in a car.

76
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.380
Joel Fike: To get on the street a lot

77
00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.070
Okay.

78
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:10.890
Dr Jameson: When you were when you were taking getting yourself what how much like is there a dose that you found that was best for you as far so many in a day.

79
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.310
Joel Fike: Or two and two and a half.

80
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.340
Joel Fike: I was like I was thinking of adding a half that was kind of

81
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.390
Dr Jameson: What I was wondering

82
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:27.870
Dr Jameson: What okay so that's that's kind of been where your, your receptors seem satisfied, I guess, basically. Okay.

83
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:38.670
Dr Jameson: Okay, so then I know we have the opiates to discuss, but any other medical I'm guessing that really since you're not any other medications. Any other medical

84
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.360
Dr Jameson: Diagnosis problem. Those nations operation.

85
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.860
Joel Fike: No mental house or operations or physical problems. No. Okay.

86
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:59.610
Dr Jameson: So you have not. I was just going to ask you if you sell to people don't think of it as a medical condition, but any anxiety or PTSD or depression or any any

87
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.770
Joel Fike: Anxieties, not too bad.

88
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.940
Joel Fike: I've had exactly in the past where I've kind of gotten over it.

89
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:16.470
Joel Fike: Every time I had exact social anxiety for a while, but it was something from some stuff that happened in I kind of grew out of it.

90
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.740
Joel Fike: Was probably like five years ago.

91
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.420
Dr Jameson: Good.

92
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:33.330
Dr Jameson: We have a lot of patients with social anxiety. So maybe you'll be able to offer some wisdom to some of our other folks about how you, how you work through that that's

93
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.620
Dr Jameson: That's

94
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.710
Joel Fike: Mostly just time

95
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.060
Dr Jameson: pushing against it and carrying on.

96
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.650
Dr Jameson: Yeah yeah

97
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.090
Joel Fike: Yeah, some other reasons why I was getting anything

98
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.590
Joel Fike: Relationship issues.

99
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.960
Dr Jameson: Did you go do any. Well, I'm assuming you've done counseling. If you weren't a week in

100
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.230
Joel Fike: Residential I've done a lot. I do a lot of 12 step stuff.

101
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.650
Dr Jameson: Online. Now how's it

102
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.930
Joel Fike: Going meetings on the line and I meet with my sponsor about three times a week.

103
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:17.070
Dr Jameson: That's so great. Good, good, good. Okay. And then, did they have you doing individual work when you were in residential treatment.

104
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.130
Joel Fike: Yeah. Well, there are groups all day, mostly

105
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.620
Joel Fike: Okay, we did a, what's it called CVT cognitive or

106
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.180
Joel Fike: Cognitive Behavior.

107
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.850
Dr Jameson: As a group,

108
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.470
Joel Fike: Oh, yeah.

109
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.570
Dr Jameson: Interesting. Okay, cool.

110
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:41.760
Joel Fike: We got a teacher and they'd come in and do like five classes a day they were their life skills, cognitive, and then

111
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.530
Joel Fike: Stuff Stephen last two because he was through for all for me.

112
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.710
Dr Jameson: Okay. Did you get anything out of any of that. I mean, did it seem helpful.

113
00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:04.050
Joel Fike: Not really for me. I mean, probably, it was good for the first people that have come through there. But for me, the only thing that really keeps me sober is working the 12 steps and was a sponsor.

114
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.300
Joel Fike: That was my

115
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.140
Joel Fike: Choice. I think 30 have I've ever been to.

116
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.630
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you heard this all before

117
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:20.910
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay. Do you feel like at the beginning it was stuff that was helpful. And now you just know it or it's never really been relevant to you.

118
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:32.040
Joel Fike: Um, I kind of pay attention for a while, at the beginning, then I started, I don't know. It all just felt like such common sense to me. I was like, I learned all this when I was in fifth grade, so

119
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.970
Dr Jameson: Unfortunately, not everybody has that that foundation so

120
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:46.110
Dr Jameson: Okay, so then in your fat, so no operations of any kind. Right.

121
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.430
Dr Jameson: And then anybody in your family that has

122
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.470
Dr Jameson: Dealt with or

123
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.880
Dr Jameson: Struggle with addiction or alcoholism. Well, let's so

124
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.530
Joel Fike: Luckily not my immediate family, but you know I have aunts and uncles, but

125
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.310
Joel Fike: My parents, they're not my brother and sister at all.

126
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.090
Dr Jameson: Okay.

127
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.860
Dr Jameson: Everybody's relatively healthy

128
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.800
Joel Fike: Yeah, I'm the one that got hit with addiction.

129
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.760
Okay.

130
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.840
Dr Jameson: So you said you have parents. And did you say two brothers.

131
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.610
Joel Fike: I have a brother and a sister.

132
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.410
Dr Jameson: Okay, and they're all healthy and doing fine.

133
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.550
Joel Fike: You're doing great.

134
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.240
Yeah.

135
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.790
Dr Jameson: Are they supportive

136
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:36.150
Joel Fike: Yes, they are. They're kind of sick of it because I'm the oldest one. They're just like always, like, when are you gonna pull your head out of your ass and

137
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:38.640
Joel Fike: So,

138
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.560
Dr Jameson: To a certain degree, but not

139
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.570
Dr Jameson: I guess aunts and uncles on one side of the family, or both.

140
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.860
Joel Fike: Both sides.

141
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.160
Dr Jameson: And what was it alcohol or opiates, or what

142
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.240
Dr Jameson: Both

143
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.090
Joel Fike: Different drugs and alcohol. Yeah, okay.

144
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.000
Dr Jameson: Are any of them.

145
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.130
Dr Jameson: Are any of them still around, or I mean

146
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.230
Joel Fike: Yeah, they are. They're still in their addiction.

147
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.860
Dr Jameson: Oh, still actively and us. Okay. Yeah.

148
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.550
Dr Jameson: That's a shame. Okay.

149
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.290
Joel Fike: What's bad house.

150
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:23.010
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it doesn't tend to do good things, as I'm sure I don't need to tell you. Yeah, yeah.

151
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.070
Joel Fike: catches up with you. I can hear in your 50s.

152
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.510
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

153
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.220
Dr Jameson: We're EARLIER. EARLIER.

154
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.350
Dr Jameson: Yes, it does. Um, do you smoke cigarettes.

155
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.520
Joel Fike: Yeah, I do.

156
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.270
Dr Jameson: How, what, what, how are you at music, how much

157
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.910
Joel Fike: Right now I'm mostly raping

158
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.890
Joel Fike: So,

159
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.180
Joel Fike: They've been like a tank a day I'd say it was like a

160
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.340
Joel Fike: seven millimeter tank. No, it's just juice.

161
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.820
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm

162
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.500
Dr Jameson: Done can call them little cartridges. You're calling it a tank of tanks to me sounds like a ginormous thing.

163
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.850
Joel Fike: It's like that.

164
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.450
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, so that's quite a bit, then I guess.

165
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:22.890
Joel Fike: I guess through the whole day. It's not as much is a smoke cigarettes, but normally I smoke like a half a pack a day.

166
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:31.740
Dr Jameson: Okay, I always wonder about. I mean I questions about Bates, I think we all do, because we've had they haven't been around.

167
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:44.610
Dr Jameson: enough for us to do all the studies that, see what happens in 20 years after, you know, but so that's a question, but I also see sometimes people because you can kind of fake anywhere now instead of it seems like, I don't know. Sometimes I

168
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.110
Joel Fike: Leave a smell.

169
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:52.080
Dr Jameson: That's true, but sometimes I feel like people end up being more because they can and if you know what I'm saying, like,

170
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:57.450
Joel Fike: I don't know, maybe you can also you can get a higher nicotine content.

171
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.260
Joel Fike: With the veil.

172
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.940
Joel Fike: So you don't need to keep smoking I that's just my personal

173
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.200
Joel Fike: Web so

174
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.400
Dr Jameson: Are you trying to quit or you're just just

175
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:15.030
Joel Fike: I wanted to quit smoking because my vapor. I get my smell and taste back and I don't smoke cigarette smoke.

176
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah yeah

177
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.990
Dr Jameson: Do you think you want to quit the vapor to are you going to stick with say

178
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.100
Dr Jameson: Never. Yeah. Um, how about alcohol for you.

179
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.590

182
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.970
Dr Jameson: How long ago did you get. Did you stop drinking

183
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:47.100
Joel Fike: The last time I drank was when I was the day I went into the hospital that night or the night, the day before I drank a whole bunch of chatter get away from the

184
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:56.160
Joel Fike: Withdrawal symptoms and it just like when I woke up from the alcohol, it just all made it so much worse. And I just was

185
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.110
Joel Fike: Riding around beginning of this

186
00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.760
Joel Fike: Yeah.

187
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.790
Dr Jameson: Okay, before that. How long have you been, I guess.

188
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.600
Joel Fike: You haven't been drinking since I've been down at the rehab. So it was like three months before that.

189
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.250
Dr Jameson: Okay.

190
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.960
Joel Fike: I haven't been

191
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.450
Joel Fike: Drinking for a while now.

192
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:17.040
Dr Jameson: Okay.

193
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.490
Dr Jameson: So you had one one.

194
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.480
Dr Jameson: Is that what you relapse on or you relapse on opiates to

195
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.590
Joel Fike: Kind of Rios relaxing. When I was inside of shame and actually

196
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.520
Joel Fike: Yeah, it was obvious an ACO

197
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.210
Okay.

198
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.810
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, and sorry so they weren't get were they giving you methadone or anything in the residential place.

199
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:40.740
No.

200
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.060
Dr Jameson: So you have withdrawal symptoms, the whole time you were there.

201
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.650
Joel Fike: No, I didn't.

202
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.760
Mean

203
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.990
Joel Fike: This whole crazy thing happened.

204
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.320
Dr Jameson: You just said that you were relaxing. Okay.

205
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:55.890
Joel Fike: Yeah.

206
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.130
Dr Jameson: But hypothetically, you would have like if you hadn't been relaxing.

207
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:00.450
Yeah.

208
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.890
Joel Fike: I wouldn't have wouldn't be what I didn't understand that. So,

209
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.520
Well,

210
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:15.540
Dr Jameson: So normally they do something to help with detox or we you know withdrawal symptoms or something, I guess, not all of them, but

211
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:25.260
Joel Fike: I actually went in there, there, and I didn't tell him because it was a parole thing I didn't tell him that I was like a language strung out when I came in there.

212
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:35.250
Joel Fike: And I got in there and I brought in a bunch of Suboxone tells with me from the street. And then once those kind of ran out. I started you know

213
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:49.620
Joel Fike: Figuring other ways to get heroin there and and a whole big thing happened and I couldn't get it and my heroine got taken and then I went to withdraw was really bad. And it was just ugly mess.

214
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.630
Dr Jameson: Did they kick you out or

215
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:52.890
Joel Fike: Yeah, they did.

216
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:54.900
Dr Jameson: Okay.

217
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.750
Joel Fike: But I almost completely. I was like,

218
00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:58.530
Joel Fike: Two minutes away.

219
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.850
Dr Jameson: Bleeding. So now, what, what, how does that affect your parole.

220
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.340
Joel Fike: Luckily they

221
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.100
Joel Fike: didn't violate me, which I was really surprised because this coven 19 thing and

222
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:18.060
Joel Fike: They wanted me to go to a different treatment program. But as soon as I got out, I, I went to my sponsor and I

223
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:35.970
Joel Fike: started having proof of the 12 step meetings and had my sponsor call them and I just stayed locked in. And I've been reporting to my parole guy every day and doing this re entry packet for him. It's more cognitive behavioral stuff. And so I've just been

224
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:53.010
Joel Fike: Keeping on a short leash with them and making sure that I'm on track and so they know that they said they're probably not gonna have me go to rehab, since it obviously didn't work. The last time when I told him my feelings about how I know how to stay clean and what works for me. So

225
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.760
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

226
00:16:54.510 --> 00:17:01.470
Dr Jameson: Well, and I think if you can be on Suboxone so that withdrawal symptoms aren't an issue that will probably helped a lot. Yeah.

227
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.330
Joel Fike: Yeah, it's a big relief actually

228
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.570
Dr Jameson: Okay. Okay, so

229
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:23.370
Dr Jameson: Your drug of choice has been a combination of opiates and alcohol. Correct.

230
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.920
Joel Fike: Yeah, I guess.

231
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.390
Joel Fike: I probably mostly just opiates. I usually don't even drink hardly when I go

232
00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.040
Dr Jameson: Okay, so. Okay, so to me.

233
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:41.040
Joel Fike: It's like when I was having withdrawals that I was trying to get away from those job symptoms by drinking

234
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.470
Dr Jameson: Great. I hear that hear that quite a bit people

235
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.430
Dr Jameson: Do other things because they don't feel good.

236

Dr Jameson: Why there's so many roofers and people climbing up high, when they, when they. Oh, I hear that all the time. It makes me

244
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.170

Joel Fike: Day I came home from the hospital. I didn't have my script yet. I had to pick it up with the pharmacy so that day I did get a gram. The first day came back and then I picked up my scripts. The next day, and I've been on Suboxone sense

305
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.490
Dr Jameson: And you knew to wait until you felt sick before you started it, I hope.

306
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.540
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Good, okay. I'm okay.

307
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:29.160
Dr Jameson: So, what, what, how can they sent you to the hospital.

308
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:36.870
Joel Fike: Because I was, I woke up like screaming like seizure and kind of from withdraws

309
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.280
Dr Jameson: Okay.

310
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.920
Joel Fike: I guess I was laying there like screaming and riding around in my bed.

311
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.210
Joel Fike: And

312
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:49.140
Joel Fike: I was like screaming I need to go to the hospital. So they call the

313
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:51.570
Joel Fike: Ambulance

314
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.030
Dr Jameson: Do you remember it or you don't even remember.

315
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.270
Dr Jameson: Sounds pretty unpleasant.

316
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:02.940
Joel Fike: It was a nightmare.

317
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:03.720
Okay.

318
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.110
Dr Jameson: Okay, so let me just, I have, we have to run. Everybody through

319
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.720
Dr Jameson: The database that looks at prescriptions that you've filled before so

320
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.390
Dr Jameson: Routine thing.

321
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.250
Dr Jameson: So they explained to you that you need to have bloodwork done

322
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.640
Dr Jameson: Yeah labs, it's blood and urine. But anyway.

323
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:46.170
Dr Jameson: It's sorry 126 87. Is that right,

324
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.280
Joel Fike: Yeah, sure.

325
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.100
Dr Jameson: I flipped out of the screen, I lose when I started

326
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:55.050
Joel Fike: Yeah, they have one of those quest diagnostic places real close to my house and

327
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.460
Dr Jameson: Beautiful, so you'll be able to get

328
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.430
Dr Jameson: There you think

329
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:05.970
Dr Jameson: The next day or so.

330
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.590
Joel Fike: Yeah, sure, sure. Okay.

331
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:16.950
Dr Jameson: I find that if we don't just do it instantly it becomes harder and harder for people to remember to get there. So,

332
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:18.870
Dr Jameson: I just

333
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.830
Dr Jameson: Come to just

334
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:30.870
Dr Jameson: Insist that it happens in the first two, you know, before you get another refill. I'll say, I'll send medicine today. You gotta be out here shortly, but after that.

335
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.030
Dr Jameson: Time if next time we meet it hasn't at least been drawn

336
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.800
Dr Jameson: Then

337
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:38.820
Dr Jameson: We'll have to

338
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.400
Dr Jameson: Make adjustments.

339
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:49.230
Dr Jameson: And the way that we, I should say, you know, the way that we kind of approach this whole process is

340
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:56.160
Dr Jameson: We don't expect. I mean, you'd like to see, you know, complete abstinence from and I mean that is the goal, but

341
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:05.040
Dr Jameson: We also know that there can be you know blips along along that that way. And hopefully the Suboxone will make that minimal but

342
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:19.050
Dr Jameson: In other words, like if you do a drug test and something is in there that isn't supposed to be, or you don't. Well, it's more problematic if you test negative for the Suboxone because then we have to wonder where it's going.

343
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.290
Dr Jameson: But if you're testing positive for things that we're

344
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.760
Dr Jameson: hoping not to see

345
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.510
Dr Jameson: We want to talk to you about it. We want to see, you know,

346
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.470
Joel Fike: Your

347
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:39.240
Dr Jameson: You know, open about it. We want to see that you are working on figuring out what was happening, what was your mindset, what, why, why did what was the trip. You know, like

348
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:49.110
Dr Jameson: Learning from it and trying to use it to move forward. So we're not, we don't kick people out for having a relapse. It's more about we, you know,

349
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.910
Dr Jameson: If there's no sign of any

350
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.670
Dr Jameson: Interest in

351
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.440
Joel Fike: Yeah.

352
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.030
Dr Jameson: Does that make sense.

353
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.900
Joel Fike: Yeah, you're not gonna you're not doing the program, then yeah.

354
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.470
Dr Jameson: Yeah, if you're not here to actually change yourself or try different things and you know be

355
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.210
Joel Fike: Here to take so

356
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.460
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

357
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.710
Dr Jameson: That's kind of where we're where we try to work with.

358
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:33.870
Dr Jameson: People not just kick them out because they had made one one bad choice or bad choices. But anyway, I'm just so you know, because I think sometimes people are avoiding the last because they know what's going to be in there and they're afraid that that's going to have some sort of

359
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:44.220
Dr Jameson: Consequences, so be reassured. I mean, we want to know what's really going on. Otherwise, what is the point. I mean, we're kind of

360
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:45.720
You know,

361
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.310
Dr Jameson: Sort of people right if we're not really

362
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.650
Joel Fike: Dealing with reality. Yeah.

363
00:27:53.640 --> 00:28:02.220
Dr Jameson: So that's kind of how we hit. So anyway, so if there might be something in your urine that it was supposed to be besides Suboxone okay well

364
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:14.100
Dr Jameson: As long as you're open about it, then it's not necessarily a problem at least right if it keeps happening. And there's no sign of any, you know, then that's a problem but

365
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.930
Joel Fike: OK, I'll get right on that. So what, how does it work. Did you

366
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.670
Joel Fike: Do today. I mean, I just go in there and tell them that I needed.

367
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.680
Dr Jameson: Yeah. What I would, what I would suggest

368
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.860
Dr Jameson: What I would suggest you do they have facts in order with your name on it to

369
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.570
Dr Jameson: Question now.

370
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.550
Dr Jameson: Are sent it. I don't know if it's electric electronic email or fax but

371
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:47.520
Dr Jameson: That sometimes things are like don't show up where they're supposed to be. So what I would suggest is you call your local lab.

372
00:28:47.850 --> 00:29:02.070
Dr Jameson: And see if you can confirm that they can find an order under your name in their system just to make sure it's already there. If they can't, then I would call back to the virtual clinic and say the lab doesn't have my order. What should we do

373
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.350
Dr Jameson: And once you're, you know, confirm that they have an order for you so you don't

374
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:16.830
Dr Jameson: Go down there and then get annoyed that they don't that's worse then you can I think they schedule appointments. If you want to on their website, or you can just go and show up and wait but

375
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.140
Dr Jameson: You can talk to them about when the best time for you to come in there would be

376
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:34.170
Dr Jameson: And what we're checking for we do the urine. The drug screen, but we also do some basic blood work which hasn't. You know when you're prescribing a medication you like to confirm a person has relatively normal kidney and liver function and

377
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:35.730
Dr Jameson: Just some basic kind of

378
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:46.680
Dr Jameson: Baseline labs and then we do screen. Everybody, even though it doesn't sound necessarily relevant to you, but we screen for HIV and hepatitis and syphilis, which are things that tend to run in higher

379
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:59.160
Dr Jameson: Frequencies among this patient demographic. So that's considered, sort of, you know, standard of care. So we do test for those things. I'm sure you've been

380
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:13.290
Dr Jameson: Tested before. But anyway, um, and I should say if you've had blood work done in the last three months or something somewhere else. We are happy to, like, just get copies of that you don't necessarily have to go get

381
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.820
Joel Fike: I don't think I have

382
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.680
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right, so

383
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.440
Dr Jameson: Island.

384
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:38.130
Dr Jameson: I apologize. Okay, so that's the first step and then this visit, which we've kind of its there's it sounds. It sounds like you already are pretty familiar with the box on but I do you want to make sure you have the opportunity to ask questions or any any

385
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.510
Dr Jameson: thing you've ever wondered about it, or does it give you any side effects, anything

386
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.270
Joel Fike: No, I don't get any side effects from it.

387
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.820
Joel Fike: In your space new normal.

388
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.110
Dr Jameson: That's the goal.

389
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:56.850
Dr Jameson: Well thing on. Well, I think what will increase your dose just that half strip a day and you're doing films or tablets.

390
00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.110
Joel Fike: Shows. Okay.

391
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.200
Dr Jameson: And that's okay with you that tasted some people don't like

392
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.090
Joel Fike: Yeah, that sounds

393
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:04.740
Joel Fike: Like to tell

394
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.090
Dr Jameson: People have it's different people. I don't care.

395
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.580
Joel Fike: I don't know why the tablet seem like they don't work for me. I don't know. I don't know why, if you

396
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.510
Joel Fike: Do the same thing and I got on a wire strike. I don't

397
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:19.950
Dr Jameson: Yeah, there's

398
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:20.730
Joel Fike: There's almost

399
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:27.270
Dr Jameson: I guess if they're things you've been buying on the street. It's possible. There are some sort of counterfeit going around, but

400
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:34.230
Dr Jameson: Know, different people have a different chemistry. And if you know it's a different product. I mean,

401
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:46.800
Dr Jameson: The drug is the same, but it's packaged it with different you know other ingredients and that can affect how well it is or isn't absorbed for one person differently than another anyway.

402
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.720
Dr Jameson: Fine with me. I think

403
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.070
Dr Jameson: I think medical actually prefers

404
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.250
Dr Jameson: The brand name Suboxone of all things, so

405
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.110
Joel Fike: They do. They

406
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:10.950
Dr Jameson: Yeah, they must have a, I don't know if they've had some maybe the drug maker and they come to some arrangement at the drug my ears, providing it or I have no idea, but yeah.

407
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.820
Joel Fike: I had a problem with that when I went to the Walgreens.

408
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.530
Joel Fike: They only had the

409
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.170
Joel Fike: Doctor readies

410
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.300
Dr Jameson: Brand. Yeah.

411
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.880
Joel Fike: I had to buy a few of them.

412
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:29.430
Dr Jameson: Oh, gosh. Well, they should, you should be able to request a reimbursement once the, once the

413
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.480
Dr Jameson: The real supply is in place.

414
00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.370
Joel Fike: I don't. Do you have any

415
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.220
Joel Fike: I wonder if they're gonna have a real supply

416
00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.610
Dr Jameson: Well, so we can, if

417
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.790
Dr Jameson: We need to try a different pharmacy some sometimes, someone else will have to happen in stock.

418
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:51.720
Dr Jameson: Centers, they have to order it. And now they've ordered it for you. I don't know if

419
00:32:52.500 --> 00:33:02.940
Dr Jameson: That was just for you or if they just happen to be low. The day that you bought there because you're not the only medical patient, they have, I can assure you, you know what I mean. So

420
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.340
Joel Fike: Yeah, especially where I live. It's

421
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.660
Joel Fike: Ramping out here that

422
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:15.420
Dr Jameson: May have been a fluky thing, so we'll see. But if if they aren't able to fill it with the brand name, we can always try sending it to a different pharmacy.

423
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.800
Joel Fike: Or

424
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.100
Dr Jameson: Sometimes ask you to help like call around and see who has it.

425
00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:28.860
Dr Jameson: talk today, and then let us know. But anyway, well, we'll cross that bridge. The other thing is that sometimes, and they may have already done it for you a prior off.

426
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:35.700
Dr Jameson: Needs to be filled out sometimes for the insurance different insurances are different. I can't remember whether medical does or doesn't, but

427
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:41.820
Dr Jameson: So anyway, there's sometimes some hoops. We have to jump through to get, get it going.

428
00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:45.330
Joel Fike: But once we get it. They just ran my social security and got it.

429
00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:45.870
Okay.

430
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:55.290
Dr Jameson: So like I said, like some state. I work you know I asked you if you were in Ohio. I see patients in Ohio and in Ohio. It's like you have to mother. May I, and it's a big

431
00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:00.240
Dr Jameson: They're there and they have a very different approach. It's interesting. Different states have different

432
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.360
Joel Fike: What is their approaches a lot more control.

433
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:10.590
Dr Jameson: Yeah, there were much more limited they limit the total number of doses, a particular pharmacy can have in a month.

434
00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:16.590
Dr Jameson: So they they just can't take any more patients because they don't, they won't be able to get any better for them. You know what I mean.

435
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:31.350
Dr Jameson: And then they're much more suspicious in general of. I just don't think that the education. I don't know. There may be the state laws are more restrictive or something. So it makes the pharmacist more nervous.

436
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.460
Dr Jameson: They're, they're very reluctant sometimes to

437
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:40.920
Joel Fike: Go here is considered a godsend everyone's like, oh yeah, you're on Suboxone yeah

438
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.820
Dr Jameson: Well, it is a gods, and I think it's kind of a miracle drug

439
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.460
Dr Jameson: To make you feel normal.

440
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:58.200
Dr Jameson: I think, yeah, anyway. So yeah, we're lucky for you, you're in California, so that that usually makes it less of a problem. You don't need as much issue. So do you

441
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.040
Dr Jameson: I don't want to go through things you already know, but

442
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:08.370
Dr Jameson: Tell me what you already understand about about how Suboxone works. It's not a path I

443
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.560
Joel Fike: Understand. So what about the

444
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:19.920
Joel Fike: Suboxone now axon, the naloxone is like a something so you can't use heroin answer box and at the same time, right.

445
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.310
Dr Jameson: You understand that more than a lot of people so so naloxone is not can

446
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:37.560
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Um, but it's not absorbed through the the mucosal lining, which is the way that you know the transmute Kozel absorption is the why you have to melt it in your mouth.

447
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.000
Dr Jameson: Not sound doesn't

448
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:49.140
Dr Jameson: Really get absorbed very well. That way, maybe a trace amount, but almost none, it's there for. If you tried. Somebody tried to melt it, and, or, you know, if it's a credit

449
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.880
Dr Jameson: You know, smoke it or do something

450
00:35:51.330 --> 00:36:08.520
Dr Jameson: They're not supposed to be doing within the first place and then you're injecting yourself or inhaling, nor can we have fun with that. So that's what that's for the buprenorphine itself is a, it's a partial the terms, the medical terms or scientific terms are like antagonist.

451
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:09.780
Dr Jameson: Goodness.

452
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:14.100
Dr Jameson: So agonist is the opposite of antagonist. I think we know that word from

453
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.180
Dr Jameson: Our language.

454
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:21.270
Dr Jameson: You would say blocker for antagonist right and then agonist is sort of

455
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:32.010
Dr Jameson: It's a activator, basically what it does is it, it's been kind of it was manufactured and it's like a, it's a, what do you call it a

456
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:47.430
Dr Jameson: designer drug, I guess in a sense, but they they purposely to be able to block the receptors that cause you know like people don't get so tired and shot breathing and overdose and it blocks the

457
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:59.160
Dr Jameson: euphoria sort of receptors, but then it activates the physical receptors that have to do with these physical symptoms that people get

458
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.030
Joel Fike: Okay.

459
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.850
Dr Jameson: So that's so it's it's it's activating the ones that are missing.

460
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:16.740
Dr Jameson: The drug and causing that basically you know it's the opposite of all the all the effects of opiates opiates usually make people sleeping when you suddenly take them away.

461
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:27.270
Dr Jameson: Now you can't sleep usually makes people constipated. So then what do you suddenly take it away. Oh, now we have diarrhea. Because what your body has been doing is to like

462
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:41.910
Dr Jameson: gonna break. So it's pushing harder on the gas to try to overcome the break when you suddenly take the breakaway you're still pushing on the gas and everything goes haywire and it takes a while for things to kind of on

463
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.330
Dr Jameson: On set at that that new

464
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.940
Dr Jameson: Thermostat or whatever.

465
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:53.190
Dr Jameson: There are ways that it happens. But it's slow. So in the meantime you feel

466
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.000
Dr Jameson: horrendous. So that's kind of how people the dependence.

467
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.580
Dr Jameson: Is happening and what the, what the

468
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.220
Dr Jameson: Suboxone does is go back in there and kind of put a break on at least the physical

469
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.590
Dr Jameson: sweats and some of those other kinds of effects.

470
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.520
Dr Jameson: But it allows you to still think clearly and

471
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:23.340
Dr Jameson: You know, it doesn't make you holy. Most people do not feel any sort of euphoria, unless you're taking really high doses are doing it.

472
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.400
Dr Jameson: In ways. Yeah, as opposed to in the first place.

473
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:27.510
Um,

474
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:36.840
Dr Jameson: Any questions, and then it blocks those other ones, but it not only blocks it like pushes other drugs out other opiates.

475
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:44.790
Joel Fike: Yeah, like the way I've been how's it describes music like action or tighter than the actual hairline come back.

476
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.430
Dr Jameson: Right. So then if you

477
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.520
Joel Fike: Can't really use her porch.

478
00:38:51.120 --> 00:39:02.880
Dr Jameson: Or a dentist gives you Viking because they pull your teeth, then doesn't understand how this stuff works. You know any other opiate that is introduced in the Suboxone is in place just has nowhere to go.

479
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.930
Joel Fike: So good.

480
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.190
Dr Jameson: You don't get much from it. And that goes for pain relief to, I think,

481
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:19.560
Dr Jameson: So that's kind of how it, it helps protect people from overdose and then also just cravings and things, hopefully, or art.

482
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:27.720
Dr Jameson: Minimize or absent, because the receptors are activated, you know, by the Suboxone instead of a different opiate

483
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:34.920
Joel Fike: I noticed. Yeah, it makes me not even saved a drink either when I'm on Suboxone like totally eliminates you

484
00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:46.410
Dr Jameson: Yeah, some people say that I've had some people say it helps them not want to use math to but it's not necessarily like designed for that. But if if your brain receptors that have kind of made you

485
00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:52.890
Dr Jameson: Crave alcohol overlap with with some of these other

486
00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:57.420
Dr Jameson: Substances then yeah, it's just, it's just as

487
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:02.190
Dr Jameson: Just as well. There's a drug called now track stone.

488
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:03.960
Dr Jameson: Which is

489
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:06.900
Dr Jameson: Used for opiate

490
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:17.820
Dr Jameson: Dependence but also for alcohol and it's very closely related to the no locks own and now you know they're very similar Naltrexone in a lockdown. So anyway, it's

491
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.870
It's certainly

492
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.650
Dr Jameson: I mean, I'm glad to hear that that's that's a twofer.

493
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.210
Dr Jameson: Yeah, um,

494
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:37.350
Dr Jameson: Okay, so it sounds like you have a pretty and you understand that if you were to take it like before you got to the place where you felt sick. He could actually put you into that place.

495
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.960
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. Okay, I know you're

496
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:41.970
Joel Fike: Never had to do that though.

497
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.470
Dr Jameson: You're, you're very lucky.

498
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:53.220
Dr Jameson: That's no fun. It's a base. It's we call it precipitated withdrawal, but I'm told that instead of, you know, I know it.

499
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:55.470
Dr Jameson: Happens somewhat gradually

500
00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:15.510
Dr Jameson: Before it gets to its most hot worst point right over a couple days or something when you when you when you take Suboxone too soon, kind of like taking our can because it like throws everything out, it pushes everything out and then

501
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:22.380
Dr Jameson: Anyway, people say it's it's like on steroids. All of a sudden terrible withdrawal so

502
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:30.030
Dr Jameson: I think it's important that you understand that even though I'm prescribing it to you and you're already taking it and I am not.

503
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:42.060
Dr Jameson: giving you any permission to give your pills to somebody else. But I want you to know how that works. If you ever have a friend who's going into treatment or take it. You know, I just, I think it's important that you understand

504
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:42.960
And understand

505
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:52.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you have to be feeling sick before your first dose. Once you're on it, then that's, that's it. But it is a funny little

506
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.950
Dr Jameson: funky thing about

507
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.570
Dr Jameson: About the medication.

508
00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:03.750
Dr Jameson: Do you, I guess you don't really have pain. You don't have any prior injuries or anything.

509
00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.230
Joel Fike: I've got a lot of injuries, but they're not really in pain.

510
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.360
Joel Fike: I just learned to deal with them.

511
00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.190
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm broken bones and that's our suffer.

512
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:20.250
Joel Fike: Yeah, it's broken race and I have a separated shoulder, nothing really serious just

513
00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:20.940
Okay.

514
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:33.750
Dr Jameson: I don't know if you've a lot of people come to opiates, as I, I know you know from prescription pain, pain pills, because they had pain. So we see a lot of patients who have

515
00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.510
Dr Jameson: Become physically dependent and or addicted.

516
00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:38.040
Dr Jameson: But also still have pain.

517
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.690
Dr Jameson: So,

518
00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.130
Dr Jameson: One other

519
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:45.030
Dr Jameson: fortunate thing is the Suboxone does actually also

520
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:50.100
Dr Jameson: Get the receptors that deal with what we call analgesia or pain relief.

521
00:42:52.470 --> 00:43:00.900
Dr Jameson: There are different ways you can take it like splitting it into smaller more frequent doses. Anyway, so if you're ever in a position where you say you need to go to the dentist or have

522
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:12.210
Dr Jameson: Teeth cold or you hurt yourself or something's going on. Reach out because we sometimes can just adjust the way that you take your Suboxone throughout the day and get better pain relief.

523
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:19.350
Dr Jameson: Increases the dose, a little bit too, but sometimes we don't actually, it's really interesting. So just

524
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.960
Dr Jameson: Be aware to be in touch. If you, if anything is upcoming so we can

525
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.890
Dr Jameson: We can or soon as something if you get hurt or something. So we can

526
00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:34.710
Dr Jameson: Better utilize this medication for you to the best, you know, maximize its benefit.

527
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.810
Dr Jameson: Um, okay. So then

528
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.380
Dr Jameson: random questions, but how tall are you,

529
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.820
Joel Fike: I'm 68 so

530
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.520
Dr Jameson: And about how much do you weigh thank

531
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.380
Joel Fike: Right right 210 pounds.

532
00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:57.090
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then the structure of our of our program, did anybody go over that much.

533
00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:03.240
Joel Fike: I'm not really just, you guys have meetings and

534
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:05.640
Joel Fike: Not really, actually.

535
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:06.630
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

536
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.910
Dr Jameson: That's usually the way it is. So it's I

537
00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:15.630
Dr Jameson: figured maybe 15 something. Okay. Um, so yeah, so we have this initial meeting.

538
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.120
Dr Jameson: That you also

539
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.850
Dr Jameson: At some point, hopefully in the next couple weeks we'll have an initial evaluation with a counselor in one on one.

540
00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:33.210
Dr Jameson: And then right away. We'll, we'll get you started in in the weekly group. So yes, we have weekly groups, which is similar, I think, to a lot of programs.

541
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:48.300
Dr Jameson: Combination. So I'm at the group. And there's a facilitator, who's usually drug and alcohol counselor and it's usually eight to 10 sometimes more sometimes less patience clients I guess selflessly

542
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:59.910
Dr Jameson: And we, you know, I check in with everyone who needs refills any issues in your case, if we adjust your dose, a little houses that better are you good, you know, and then

543
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:04.050
Dr Jameson: I listen in. But, I'm, you know, sending refills and checking whom

544
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:12.570
Dr Jameson: Do you and you know, that kind of stuff sort of simultaneously and we start out with pretty short.

545
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:21.960
Dr Jameson: Short prescription to sort of make sure that we keep you kind of want to, I don't know if my mother would say a short leash for a little while.

546
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:32.340
Dr Jameson: Just to reinforce, you know, coming to group every week meeting with the counselor, getting the drugs. I mean, the labs done, sort of, you know, making sure all the pieces are

547
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:41.940
Dr Jameson: falling into place. And as time goes on and things are sort of stabilizing and status quo for a while, then we will will

548
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:58.560
Dr Jameson: extend the duration of the prescription to say two weeks at a time and then eventually, eventually, after four or five months, something like that. People will earn the monthly support monthly prescription. Just like if you had a blood pressure medicine or something.

549
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.590
Joel Fike: That's just, that's it. Was it the other clinic going

550
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:02.400
Dr Jameson: Yeah yeah

551
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.540
Dr Jameson: I mean, it's pretty standard.

552
00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:08.340
Dr Jameson: So we, we start with weekly group visits.

553
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:12.300
Dr Jameson: For some people, we just

554
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:30.480
Dr Jameson: Keep them forever because they need them or they find them really helpful or they provide you know as time goes on, you move from listening more to sort of talking or as as the sort of elder experienced role model for other people. So some people just continue to come every week because

555
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.520
Dr Jameson: They find that best for them.

556
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:39.900
Dr Jameson: We do allow eventually again like after months and months people to move to every other week on the on the

557
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:47.040
Dr Jameson: If, if it's necessary. Some people have worked, you know, complex and it gets tricky, but

558
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.760
Dr Jameson: That's the bare minimum is to two groups, a month.

559
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:59.760
Dr Jameson: We also require any Elise that initial counseling one on one in that evaluation, they typically

560
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.900
Dr Jameson: What's the word recommend. It's not hard word

561
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:15.900
Dr Jameson: Up here, kind of a course of one, one on one counseling for it and that depends. That's very variable. Some people have a lot of stuff. They need to deal with other people.

562
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.490
Dr Jameson: Not too much stuff so

563
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.040
Dr Jameson: It's maybe a series of a couple, you know,

564
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.080
Dr Jameson: once every two weeks visits for

565
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:26.100
Dr Jameson: Two months or something, just to kind of make sure we don't have any other

566
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.840
Dr Jameson: Things we want to try to help

567
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:36.780
Dr Jameson: Work through and the point of that is to try to minimize, you know, maximize your success basically like if there are outstanding.

568
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.840
Dr Jameson: This you know discord or

569
00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:50.100
Dr Jameson: You've done the CVT yourself already, but for something that a lot of people haven't or they have sort of but haven't really gotten to the crux of certain issues.

570
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.130
Dr Jameson: That's an opportunity to kind of help.

571
00:47:53.700 --> 00:48:01.740
Dr Jameson: Deal or lying issues that probably led to this in the first place because we want to we want to not just Band Aid it with Suboxone we want to help.

572
00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.020
Dr Jameson: Really get, get it.

573
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.200
Dr Jameson: Through and through, if that makes sense.

574
00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.270
Joel Fike: Yeah. Makes sense.

575
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.470
Dr Jameson: And then

576
00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:25.800
Dr Jameson: You do the initial labs and then after I'm trying to think, what are the other. What are the other components we do a monthly drug screen and once the initial when you go to the lab, but after that most of our patients we we mail a

577
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:27.570
Dr Jameson: Little cup that has the

578
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.580
Dr Jameson: Built in, you probably don't have

579
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:32.550
Dr Jameson: seen those before we mail it to you directly

580
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:38.700
Dr Jameson: And then you sign into the virtual clinic with your unopened package and and open it and

581
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.210
Dr Jameson: The point of that is so make sure nobody's tampered with it and then

582
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:50.550
Dr Jameson: Every so often they stick a saliva test in there which are much more expensive. So we don't do those routinely but you just never know what's going to be in the box.

583
00:48:52.200 --> 00:49:01.230
Dr Jameson: And then I don't think they make you like be on camera to put the urine in the cup, but they're there, you know, can hear you. In in the room and

584
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:03.270
Dr Jameson: And then

585
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:04.410
Dr Jameson: You know, they read it right off the

586
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:05.310
Joel Fike: Screen so you

587
00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.360
Dr Jameson: Can do that at home.

588
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:08.160
Dr Jameson: Okay, Andy.

589
00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:11.940
Dr Jameson: There are some survey, they're really into

590
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:19.110
Dr Jameson: Artificial Intelligence and tracking data and learning about factors that are, you know, encourage you know

591
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:24.810
Dr Jameson: Associated with good outcomes and factors associated with not so good out of them. So they ask

592
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:41.580
Dr Jameson: Patients to fill out a variety of surveys. I think every week. I know you did a bunch of them already for the initial but it's not as many is that every week. But there are a series of questions they asked you, I think it's like 15 minutes or something. A week that you fill out.

593
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:44.430
Dr Jameson: Just so we can be tracking various

594
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.380
Dr Jameson: Factors.

595
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.550
Dr Jameson: I think that's about it. I mean I it's

596
00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:54.570
Dr Jameson: Also an hour a week for the

597
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:55.920
Dr Jameson: Groups and then

598
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.120
Dr Jameson: The counseling is

599
00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.560
Dr Jameson: In addition to that,

600
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.230
Dr Jameson: At least at the beginning.

601
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.640
Dr Jameson: Last time we really just asked. Like, it's okay.

602
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.880
Dr Jameson: Just you and I. But if we were in group, I would have asked you to turn that

603
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:10.350
Dr Jameson: Background noise on

604
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:13.950
Dr Jameson: It gets to be distracting. Somebody else trying to talk

605
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.740
Dr Jameson: So we just ask people to be in a quiet.

606
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:23.850
Dr Jameson: private place we we do require earbuds or headphones for reasons, just so you can make sure you have those

607
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.180
Dr Jameson: When it comes to the group and we ask people not to smoke rebate because some people are trying to quit that

608
00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:33.510
Dr Jameson: Just to not not to aggravate people

609
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.220
Dr Jameson: As far as your scheduled goes

610
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.940
Dr Jameson: You're not working at all at the moment.

611
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:43.110
Joel Fike: Right now. Okay.

612
00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:48.600
Dr Jameson: So my my California groups are on Wednesday.

613
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:52.590
Dr Jameson: And your time options are.

614
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.190
Dr Jameson: 10:30am

615
00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:06.390
Dr Jameson: Or three no noon. Sorry, I'm on the East Coast. So I said one time every time so 1030 or noon.

616
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:08.400
I think that

617
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.720
Dr Jameson: Just. Do you have a preference.

618
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.750
Joel Fike: I know right now the mornings probably better

619
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.630
Joel Fike: The 1030 yeah okay

620
00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:29.580
Perfect.

621
00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:37.110
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I'll pencil you in. So that means that your first group will be the day after tomorrow.

622
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:43.020
Dr Jameson: Right now, especially because we've had a lot of growth and they've hired a bunch of new people. So it's a little

623
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:55.650
Dr Jameson: I don't know, it can be a little slow in the virtual clinic. When people that everyone's checking in for a certain group. So we asked people to start checking in at least a half an hour. Prior to group.

624
00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:07.410
Dr Jameson: You could if you got up in the morning. You want to just get it out of the way you could, you know, do that at 8am and then once you're done. They'll email you or text you or something. The code the meeting ID for the group that day.

625
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:13.710
Dr Jameson: You can, you know, do whatever you're doing. And then when it's 1030 sign into the to the meeting. So, can be done earlier but

626
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.720
Dr Jameson: You're not like, oh, I have group in five minutes. Let me go check in.

627
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.380
Dr Jameson: Because they can you know if you have to fill out a survey or

628
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:28.650
Dr Jameson: They have to, you know, schedule you for the counselor or something, then you end up late to group so

629
00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:34.350
Dr Jameson: So I want. So think of it as 10am I guess at

630
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.390
Dr Jameson: That way you can

631
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:40.980
Dr Jameson: Right, so you got your 10

632
00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:49.680
Dr Jameson: Six. Okay, so we're good. Alright, so I'm going to send the Suboxone AIDS, but I'm going to put two and a half a day.

633
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:51.780
Dr Jameson: And

634
00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.720
Dr Jameson: 2.5 strips.

635
00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:08.670
Dr Jameson: How you want to break those up is kind of up to you. It sounds like maybe you want to do what you're doing now and then just take an extra half in the in the evening.

636
00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.200
Joel Fike: Yeah, that's what my plan was

637
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:21.840
Dr Jameson: Yeah, but, you know, the, the truth is that this medicine is a 24 hour very long acting medication and the fact you know you're saying at the beginning, it wasn't it

638
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:25.110
Dr Jameson: Sounds level long Catholic. Yeah.

639
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:32.790
Dr Jameson: So really you should be a radically should be able to take two and a half of them once a day and they should carry you right through. So

640
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:40.620
Dr Jameson: I think that there. It doesn't matter it's perfectly fine to do do it splitting it up like we talked about but

641
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:47.340
Dr Jameson: Be aware, there is a psychological component on some level to

642
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:53.070
Dr Jameson: Draw and I know that because I had a patient, tell me, well, I knew that. Anyway, but she was saying that she lost she

643
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:53.940
misplaced.

644
00:53:54.990 --> 00:54:01.770
Dr Jameson: A few of her doses because she'd gone somewhere and she puts them in a wallet or something and then she forgot that she

645
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:11.880
Dr Jameson: Had them there. She just took she came home early from a trip. And anyway, forgot all about them. So for like 20 minutes she couldn't find any her medication and she me, she's like, I immediately.

646
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:22.800
Dr Jameson: You know, withdraw and then she finally found them and then she felt better right away and nothing had changed, like she had not missed it. Oh, she had. It was just the idea

647
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:23.910
Joel Fike: Yes, you.

648
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:32.670
Dr Jameson: might miss it. Oh. So there certainly is some psychological component. And that's fine. I mean, this whole a lot of this is a psychological issue so

649
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:41.130
Dr Jameson: The physical stuff is not being made up. You don't get me wrong, but a lot of it is so you can play with it. You could just take

650
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:55.260
Dr Jameson: It would be a probably more of a pain to cut one and a quarter and take that twice a day. So it's probably not worth it. But you could just take one in the morning and one and a half and the app, you know you can. You don't have to, like, make it even I guess is what I'm trying to say.

651
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.000
Dr Jameson: Fine, if you want to

652
00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:01.740
Dr Jameson: But you don't have to. Okay, so I'm going to send this one.

653
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:18.660
Dr Jameson: For three days, just to get you through it will be a little bit us, you'll have more than enough to get to group and then at group will do the next chunk him. So we're lining it up with when you're coming to group.

654
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:20.100
Dr Jameson: OK. OK.

655
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:26.310
Dr Jameson: So actually, I'll do four days because otherwise it's an uneven number of strips.

656
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.010
Dr Jameson: 10

657
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:32.760
Dr Jameson: And it's a Walgreens on Sutton way. Yeah.

658
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:34.020
Yeah.

659
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:41.190
Joel Fike: I also found there's a pharmacy really close to me, but I'm not sure if they have them or not.

660
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:41.940
Okay.

661
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:56.280
Dr Jameson: Well, we can start with this and I'm going to say no substitution, because they don't want you to have generic and then if we need to resend it or you know after this one you want to go to the place that's closer, you can confirm that

662
00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:01.380
Dr Jameson: They have it. And, you know, between now and group. You can let us know when you

663
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.650
Joel Fike: Call them after this, and see if they have them.

664
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.980
Joel Fike: Okay, and what if they don't have them.

665
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:14.190
Dr Jameson: So then I would. Well, you could ask them, How long until you'll be able to fill it.

666
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:24.720
Dr Jameson: Or and and maybe call a couple other pharmacies and see if anybody has it today and your own. You only need 10 so

667
00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:36.360
Dr Jameson: For now, and if there's somewhere else that does have a we can you call virtual clinic login there and let them know we need to switch the pharmacy because they don't have it in stock and

668
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.520
Joel Fike: Good. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

669
00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.030
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

670
00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:50.430
Dr Jameson: That will just send this is my work.

671
00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.790
Dr Jameson: Do you have any other questions or

672
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.740
Joel Fike: No, I don't.

673
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:06.660
Dr Jameson: I didn't ask you, have you had any overdoses.

674
00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.220
Joel Fike: No.

675
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:09.540
Dr Jameson: That's less common within

676
00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:15.900
Joel Fike: With this. Well, I mean, I have a few years ago, I think I overdosed on fentanyl patches. That's, that's a

677
00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:17.490
Joel Fike: Long time ago.

678
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.280
Dr Jameson: That they have to give you an arcane or

679
00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:22.080
Joel Fike: Yeah, okay.

680
00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:24.690
Dr Jameson: Was it in the ER or it was

681
00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.910
Joel Fike: Just woke up.

682
00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:31.440
Joel Fike: Actually happened in the car and my girlfriend drove me to the ER.

683
00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:36.360
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm okay with that was the only just that one.

684
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.350
Joel Fike: Yeah, okay.

685
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:47.670
Dr Jameson: Um, I usually offer as a routine thing to send a prescription for an hour can for for our patients if that would

686
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:51.000
Dr Jameson: Be of interest. I will happily do that.

687
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.930
Later.

688
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.710
Dr Jameson: I don't know if you have. I'm assuming you have friends.

689
00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.350
Joel Fike: Yeah, unfortunately, yeah.

690
00:57:58.530 --> 00:57:59.910
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so sometimes

691
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.160
Joel Fike: They sometimes they're worried about you.

692
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:11.100
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so sometimes it's good to have well always it's good to have that available even if not for use on yourself. But just to have it.

693
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.120
Yeah.

694
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.180
Joel Fike: You could save someone's life.

695
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:24.120
Dr Jameson: That's right. And then you that sometimes a teachable moment, as they say, you know, you know, there's the Suboxone stuff. I really works great for me.

696
00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:25.170
Yeah.

697
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:29.460
Joel Fike: It was just talking to my friend about that yesterday.

698
00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:30.930
Dr Jameson: Oh, yeah.

699
00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.460
Joel Fike: So yeah, he's a guy wish I was good on that. I'm so sick of this

700
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:36.510
Yeah.

701
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:52.500
Dr Jameson: And then also just for our because I know you don't have too many right now. But when you have withdrawal. What are your. I mean, it's usually some variation on the similar thing. But what do you do you start actually vomiting. Eventually, or

702
00:58:53.490 --> 00:59:09.240
Joel Fike: Most of the time I started getting really like restlessness and that's like the first start and then I'll start sweating a lot. And then from there, then I'll start feeling sick like nausea nausea and about bowel movement.

703
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.670
Joel Fike: Diarrhea yeah

704
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:17.190
Dr Jameson: And then I'm in trouble sleeping.

705
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:19.860
Joel Fike: And I will shake to

706
00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:24.000
Dr Jameson: Do you get runny nose.

707
00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:31.500
Joel Fike: Runny nose runny eyes. That's when I first can tell it starting is the first sentence for me is the runny eyes and yawning.

708
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.810
Dr Jameson: Uh huh. So weird.

709
00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:36.870
Dr Jameson: And

710
00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:39.540
Dr Jameson: Paid you get paid.

711
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.190
Joel Fike: No, not really.

712
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.750
Dr Jameson: Okay.

713
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:45.840
Joel Fike: Sometimes I guess I feel like I'm achy

714
00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:47.940
Joel Fike: But that's about it.

715
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:51.540
Joel Fike: Yeah, we get restless leg really bad.

716
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.490
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

717
00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:58.440
Dr Jameson: OK. And then, so you've been in

718
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:03.840
Dr Jameson: Different or three different residential treatments.

719
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:05.850
Joel Fike: That was the third time and balance that

720
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:12.540
Dr Jameson: Their time. Okay. And do you usually relapse pretty much as soon as you get out every time, or have you

721
01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.070
Joel Fike: So far,

722
01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:16.680
Joel Fike: Really

723
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:31.860
Joel Fike: Not a big like for me. I don't think they're waste of time, but I think they're good to go for one time to get your eyes open to see like what addiction is. But once you know what's going on, it's up to you to change it out. Yeah.

724
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.300
Joel Fike: I mean I it's good to have for people if they wanted to detox just have some

725
01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:39.960
Joel Fike: Options and some time to get sober.

726
01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:43.200
Dr Jameson: Now, well, sometimes people are in an environment that really doesn't

727
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.750
Dr Jameson: Allow

728
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.760
Dr Jameson: You know sobriety. If you're like, surrounded by people that

729
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:54.330
Dr Jameson: Are actively using, for example.

730
01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:08.700
Dr Jameson: So i mean it's it's it's a and, you know, because you've done your 12 steps for a while about the people, places, things and you know kind of boundary setting up those boundaries so

731
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.460
Dr Jameson: We talk about that stuff in our

732
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:19.830
Dr Jameson: I shouldn't. I don't, I don't, when I roll my I have this habit of doing that. And it does not mean, I think it's stupid. It's just a habit that I have. Sorry.

733
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.750
Dr Jameson: Okay, cut, stop it, we do talk about

734
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:30.240
Dr Jameson: Lots of different things. But it's, it's, you know, kind of like the general subject is relapse prevention.

735
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:47.550
Dr Jameson: Recovery skills is kind of the way that we we frame it and we talked about different things, different week. Sometimes we just talked about everybody's you know misery with this quarantine stuff. I mean, that's been a common conversation for the last few weeks, but

736
01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:49.260
Joel Fike: common theme nationwide.

737
01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:49.950
Yeah.

738
01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:59.460
Dr Jameson: Yeah, for sure, but sometimes you know there'll be a certain quote or will review the difference like

739
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:10.230
Dr Jameson: I don't know, different, different things, different weeks john is our is the counselor for this particular group. Yo, you'll be in he's super easy when I

740
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:21.720
Dr Jameson: And we will invite you to participate, but especially in the first few weeks it's okay if you really rather just lifting on you can say

741
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:29.790
Dr Jameson: Come back to me next week or you know whatever that's totally fine. We do end each group with a gratitude.

742
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:34.710
Dr Jameson: Everybody goes around something they're grateful for. So I think for that we probably asked you to

743
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:38.610
Joel Fike: Answer the question or I'm used to. I'm used to. Yeah.

744
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:39.690
Dr Jameson: So, till you probably

745
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:44.700
Dr Jameson: A lot less uncomfortable, then some people are not so sure has burst so

746
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.070
Dr Jameson: Okay.

747
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:51.720
Dr Jameson: So that's kind of how that will work.

748
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.550
Dr Jameson: God I felt like there was something else. I was gonna say, and then

749
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:06.540
Dr Jameson: I sent an arcane I sent the four days worth of Suboxone for you. Make sure you've got your labs at least

750
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:15.180
Dr Jameson: Taking samples provided before ideally for for group. I think would be great. And then just going to know

751
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:29.460
Dr Jameson: whether they'll schedule your initial counseling counselor evaluation right away or maybe maybe on Wednesday when you check in for group, they call it a bio cycle social maybe you've heard this term before. Okay.

752
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:41.580
Dr Jameson: And we just say, I don't know. Seems seems interesting. Anyway, so that's what they refer to for that in case. So they'll schedule something hopefully in the next

753
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:49.380
Dr Jameson: I don't know how when the next available appointment is but hopefully they'll give you the time on the next couple this week sometime

754
01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.550
Dr Jameson: And yeah, I think we're just about working with people to

755
01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:14.070
Dr Jameson: See where the hang ups are what, what are the triggers. Why do you know what are you trying to escape. What are we, you know what, what's happening and see if we can help find other ways for for for us to cope with our with our discomfort. So which whichever type they happen to be

756
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:18.780
Dr Jameson: So that's kind of where we're where we try to focus. I think mainly

757
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:30.630
Dr Jameson: Okay so headphones on Wednesday and check in around, at least at 10am or sooner.

758
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:45.960
Dr Jameson: So you're ready to go. They send you an email. I don't think maybe not this week because you've already done so many surveys, but next week you'll probably see an email. I don't think you need to save that, because I don't know that they keep sending it every week.

759
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:52.590
Dr Jameson: You need to remember to try to fill your surveys out before before you're signing into group cuz I don't

760
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.720
Dr Jameson: Blame things. Yeah, okay.

761
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:58.170
Dr Jameson: Okay, um,

762
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.200
Dr Jameson: Any last questions before we go.

763
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:07.050
Joel Fike: No, I think I got it. Okay, we got Wednesday at 10 1010 O'clock 1030

764
01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.690
Joel Fike: Yes, and go to my screen.

765
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:14.160
Dr Jameson: Yes, your labs it and the group last an hour, I guess.

766
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.120
Joel Fike: Say that

767
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:20.280
Joel Fike: I did have one question I was just thinking if I do go back to work, or their evening groups at all.

768
01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:29.430
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I have on Tuesday evening. I have a couple. I try to reserve them for people that really have to use them because

769
01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:30.780
Joel Fike: You're saying when I

770
01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:31.800
Joel Fike: When I have to go back to

771
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:37.140
Dr Jameson: Yeah, for sure. And then, you know, sometimes Tuesday night doesn't work for some reason.

772
01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:42.330
Dr Jameson: I don't have groups other nights. But there are other doctors who do so we can always transfer

773
01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.470
Joel Fike: Do I do work.

774
01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.100
Normally

775
01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I will probably work during daylight hours so

776
01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:50.910
Joel Fike: Like 530

777
01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.310
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. So I have a

778
01:05:54.570 --> 01:06:03.360
Dr Jameson: It's really an 8pm group for me and a lot of Ohio, folks. But then I have a your time group which is more California folks.

779
01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:19.260
Dr Jameson: It still kind of puts a close. I know, but since I'm on the East Coast, I can only I can only go so so late, but that's, I was saying there are other doctors like who live in California who are in the same time zone as you are, who have evening groups and other nights a week, so we can

780
01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:22.950
Dr Jameson: If we have to transfer you, that's fine. I'm

781
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:32.250
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we'll see you on Wednesday. And you'll be touched sooner if you have any issues today. If you have any issues with the pharmacy or prescription

782
01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:34.770
Joel Fike: Issues. Okay, now let you do

783
01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.660
Dr Jameson: All right, good.

784
01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:37.950
Dr Jameson: Night.

785
01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:39.840
Joel Fike: You're welcome, and look

786
01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.330
Dr Jameson: Forward to to working with you and

787
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:44.790
Dr Jameson: I'm normal. That's good.

788
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.110
Joel Fike: Yeah, sure.

789
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:47.670
Dr Jameson: Happy to be normal, right.

790
01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.760
Joel Fike: Yeah, it's nice and it's the stressor leave

791
01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:56.310
Dr Jameson: Yeah I that's what people say it's just so old to be constantly on this like

792
01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.330
Dr Jameson: Search and counting hours and

793
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.770
Joel Fike: Go sucks.

794
01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.700
Dr Jameson: You can just like have other things to you know

795
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:08.220
Dr Jameson: Worry about other more

796
01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:08.850
Joel Fike: Just the

797
01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.970
Dr Jameson: Stars and not stress.

798
01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:18.360
Dr Jameson: Yeah and if your friend is like, you know what, I hope you did share and I maybe you want to see how it went for you before you

799
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:27.210
Dr Jameson: Recommend it but i mean you know we're we're definitely, I know there's a lot of well right now, especially a lot of programs have shot because of

800
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:38.820
Dr Jameson: Kobe. And they weren't necessarily set up for telemedicine and there's just so much probably more demand than then availability locally, sometimes in general. Anyway, so

801
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:50.550
Joel Fike: Well, this the way that you guys do it actually is going to be a lot more people seem like they're, they would rather do it like through the phone like this and having to have the stigma of going to the

802
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:52.050
Joel Fike: Office molester.

803
01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:57.630
Dr Jameson: Well, anyway, yeah. I mean, I wish it weren't a stigma. But let's I know it is what it is. So,

804
01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:01.620
Dr Jameson: Especially if you live in kind of a small town like who you're going to see there and

805
01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:10.710
Dr Jameson: Then if you are trying to hold down a job getting out every week or sometimes the programs want people, they're like three days a week. Some of them are very

806
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:24.450
Dr Jameson: Involved and you can't really do that. And the whole point of Suboxone as opposed to be that it's a regular prescription that you get from your regular primary care. It's just that most people's primary cares don't happen to have gone through the training. So then

807
01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:32.580
Dr Jameson: Anyway, the whole point is to be able to do this without having to say go to a methadone clinic every morning and

808
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:45.480
Dr Jameson: You know, be a little bit more conducive to just regular, normal life and you're not congregating with people's have one person is, you know, not in the right mindset. They can that can be contagious. Right.

809
01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:51.240
Dr Jameson: Yeah, this way, you're kind of, you know, in your own space there, you're less risk for any

810
01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:53.880
Dr Jameson: Parking lot funny business right

811
01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.110
Yeah.

812
01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:09.600
Dr Jameson: So, and then some people like I was saying, you know, we have a lot of patients with social anxiety. So there are people who like really wouldn't go and sit in a room with a bunch of people. They didn't know so i think it's it's it fits a lot of

813
01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:14.100
Dr Jameson: It takes a lot of boxes in that sense, I think. Yeah.

814
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:17.730
Joel Fike: Yeah, people get really far out there, some terms.

815
01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:22.650
Dr Jameson: Yes, for sure. All right.

816
01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:30.750
Dr Jameson: Well, I guess I was nice to meet you. And I look forward to lots of success going forward. Okay.

817
01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:31.800
Joel Fike: Not to have a good day.

818
01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:33.000
Dr Jameson: You too. All

819
01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:34.080
Joel Fike: Right.

820
01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.550
Dr Jameson: You gotta get out just kind of

821
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:36.900
Joel Fike: Touch your screen, it's

822
01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:40.200
Dr Jameson: Time to leave you got it sometimes by

823
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:50.760
Dr Jameson: Okay, this is john Fike here for his initial history, physical, I think we sort of covered most of the bases.

824
01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.380
Dr Jameson: We can incorporate his initial

825
01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:02.490
Dr Jameson: Expert

826
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:26.850
Dr Jameson: survey questions. And here he is unable to stop using when he wants to feels bad or guilty as spouse or parents complaining reject has neglected family because of drug use and experiences withdrawal symptoms. He's

827
01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:34.110
Dr Jameson: Answering no to the other questions, although he ended up in jail. So I guess.

828
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.200
Dr Jameson: He's not linking that as being a causal factor. I wonder

829
01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.690
Dr Jameson: And

830
01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:52.050
Dr Jameson: So that will help an API. And then he's been in three different residential treatment and the one overdose.

831
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:58.620
Dr Jameson: And

832
01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:05.250
Dr Jameson: I filled in medical history, his mental status and physical or normal. Oh, Ed severe

833
01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:17.370
Dr Jameson: I ran a curious report reviewed the structure of our program review the mechanism of action of Suboxone he has been using it without side effects previously.

834
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.680
Dr Jameson: does seem that his dose, maybe slightly sub

835
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:43.560
Dr Jameson: Optimal so I'm going to increase to two and a half films per day. I sent a four day supply number 10 refills we've chosen the 10:30am Wednesday group, and he will begin that in two days. We've rude. The

836
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.310
Dr Jameson: Need for headphones and

837
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:51.300
Dr Jameson: No smoking during group request.

838
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.360
Dr Jameson: And

839
01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.150
Dr Jameson: That is, and for him.

840
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:10.110
Dr Jameson: Hello.

841
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.130

844
01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:24.780

Modoc County: Like one for one day every day.

850
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.380
Dr Jameson: Do you take it all at once, or do you split it.

851
01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.690
Modoc County: Oh, I started that

852
01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:00.840

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:12.780
Okay.

858
01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.120
Modoc County: So,

859
01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:22.260
Dr Jameson: You know that's not surprising because you were you you know you don't have a long history of lots of tolerance to opiates for

860
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.590
Modoc County: The first time.

861
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.900

Modoc County: For

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:45.690
Modoc County: Four times

865
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:49.620
Dr Jameson: So you take a quarter four times a day.

866
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:51.120
Modoc County: Yeah, right.

867
01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:55.140
Dr Jameson: Okay. And if you take the whole half then you feel. Yeah.

868
01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:55.830
Dr Jameson: On well

869
01:13:55.950 --> 01:14:00.540
Dr Jameson: Okay, it doesn't come any smaller. I wish we could give you a smaller one, but

870
01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:03.150
Modoc County: I mean it works that way.

871
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:11.700
Dr Jameson: Okay. And then, um, have you so it has caused some side effects in the najah did you actually vomit.

872
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.100
Modoc County: No, I didn't.

873
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:16.140
Dr Jameson: But you felt nauseous and then

874
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:21.570
Dr Jameson: Some, some sedation and or, I guess, euphoria.

875
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:26.550
Modoc County: My new the new ones yet because we have a hell of a

876
01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:31.620
Modoc County: Deal. I'm working to get her daughter back so I

877
01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:36.000
Modoc County: Started the new just I got my neck.

878
01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:39.900
Modoc County: But I have the extra Sony Angeles anyway.

879
01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.000
Dr Jameson: Oh, so you still have medicine.

880
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:43.410
Modoc County: Yeah, so

881
01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:44.280
Okay.

882
01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:47.790
Dr Jameson: You're taking last and okay

883
01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:54.450
Dr Jameson: What are you so what do you think you you don't want to have it in your system if they're doing dress testing. Is that what it is.

884
01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:58.620
Modoc County: No, I, I will see here

885
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:02.790
Modoc County: Everything is last week Monday.

886
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:07.800
Dr Jameson: Why is that, sorry. I'm just curious, it's not. You're not. It's okay.

887
01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:10.410
Modoc County: Just because I

888
01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.980
Modoc County: I got scared. I don't like

889
01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:16.320
Modoc County: I don't like

890
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:21.990
Modoc County: Okay, I don't, I don't like the high i don't i don't like that feeling.

891
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:28.980
Dr Jameson: Know, sure. So even when you were taking the quarter. What day was it making you feel high

892
01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:31.140
Modoc County: Yeah, and I don't like it.

893
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.140
Modoc County: Made me go sleep all day long.

894
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no, I don't.

895
01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.040
Modoc County: Like the feeling

896
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:49.620
Dr Jameson: Okay, so. Okay. So, I mean, there's two options. One is to drop it. Well, how have you been feeling in the last so you stop taking it a week ago.

897
01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.320
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and how

898
01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:56.160
Dr Jameson: Have you been obviously I assume all those symptoms have gone away.

899
01:15:56.850 --> 01:16:03.840
Modoc County: Yeah, I got, I started taking like you prescribed and I just couldn't do it.

900
01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.290
Dr Jameson: I know and I'm glad you shouldn't. You did the right thing.

901
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:12.810
Modoc County: I tried just one, four times a day.

902
01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.810
Modoc County: I just don't like that feeling.

903
01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:23.010
Modoc County: I tried it for three or four days.

904
01:16:24.090 --> 01:16:24.330
Modoc County: Okay.

905
01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.040
Dr Jameson: There's a couple options.

906
01:16:29.190 --> 01:16:42.750
Dr Jameson: So we could drop it even more like just taking a quarter once a day or twice a day, or we could stop Suboxone all together and try. There's a I think I meant that I mentioned last time, the Murtaza pain.

907
01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:43.980
Dr Jameson: As other

908
01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:57.030
Dr Jameson: Yeah, there's other options. I mean, we, it doesn't have to be this one if and that's not even a controlled substance. So if you're at this. Is there any concerns with the custody of testing you know testing for

909
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.010
Modoc County: Something. Oh, it's just

910
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.150
Modoc County: Like that feeling.

911
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:09.180
Dr Jameson: Uh huh. Good. And I don't want to be giving you something that's making you feel I either honestly

912
01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:11.250
Dr Jameson: I'm so

913
01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:13.620
Modoc County: Zombie down

914
01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.870
Modoc County: Yeah, it was crazy.

915
01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:21.210
Dr Jameson: Did you try taking just a quarter once or twice a day, or you didn't get that low

916
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:26.100
Modoc County: Yeah, no, I just stopped taking it. Okay.

917
01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:27.690
Modoc County: I just

918
01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:33.810
Dr Jameson: So I think I'm hearing that you would rather not take it at all. Is that, is that what you're saying.

919
01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.350
Dr Jameson: Yeah, let's try that.

920
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:45.780
Dr Jameson: Different stuff, I have to tell you, I'll be honest, I've used this medication for completely unrelated purposes it's it's helps people fall asleep at night.

921
01:17:46.530 --> 01:17:55.560
Dr Jameson: And it's actually technically an antidepressant like the class of medication, but somehow in some study was observed that it seems to decrease

922
01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:02.070
Dr Jameson: quite substantially. The amount of methamphetamine positive tests that they found in this group of people

923
01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:17.280
Dr Jameson: So, how it works, or why it works. I don't think I certainly don't understand. I don't know if anybody else has kind of figured that out yet either. It's kind of like when we used Wellbutrin which is a an antidepressant and notice that people were cutting back or quitting smoking.

924
01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:29.460
Dr Jameson: Interesting. So it's kind of was just this observed thing. I have not used it for this reason before so you will be my first test.

925
01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.780
Dr Jameson: But the study was quite quite encouraging.

926
01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:42.060
Dr Jameson: Potentially. Yeah, that's a different subject which I'd be happy to talk to you about, but

927
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:50.370
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I would love for that. So unfortunately Wellbutrin is not the same as this. This is a different medication, but

928
01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:52.320
Dr Jameson: I was using that as kind of a

929
01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.020
Example, yeah.

930
01:18:56.430 --> 01:19:02.610
Dr Jameson: So this is a medication that does make people sleepy. So we give it to you, we tell you to take it at bedtime.

931
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:09.720
Dr Jameson: So if you have trouble sleeping, it's an extra bonus that it helps you sleep, but it's not a

932
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:13.950
Dr Jameson: It's not a sedative, it's not a

933
01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:21.300
Dr Jameson: It's not a controlled substance. It's not a benzo it's not habit forming. It's not. It's so it's it's

934
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:34.770
Dr Jameson: You know, otherwise it's it's pretty safe. It's like I said, it's not a controlled substance, it wouldn't test on any art shouldn't unless it has a cross reaction, but it's it's not a controlled substance so kind of the way that

935
01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:46.800
Dr Jameson: Anti histamines like Benadryl make you sleepy. It's the same kind of thing. It's sort of a side effect that it makes you sleepy. That's not the reason we're giving it to you, but it will make you sleepy. So

936
01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:54.570
Dr Jameson: Not to the point that someone couldn't wake you up, but you'll want to take it when you're pretty much ready for bed anyway.

937
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:56.340
Dr Jameson: I'm

938
01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:01.620
Modoc County: Sorry.

939
01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.660
Modoc County: I couldn't function enough

940
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:06.360
Dr Jameson: No, no, it will make you sleepy.

941
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:17.250
Dr Jameson: All the next day. It's more like, like I said, we use it as a sleeping medicine for people and it makes you sleepy for a few hours and then by the morning, you should be

942
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:19.050
Dr Jameson: Hopefully,

943
01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:26.580
Dr Jameson: And and we sometimes have to adjust the medication or the time you're taking it if you still feel like you're groggy in the morning, then we will we will need to

944
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:42.900
Dr Jameson: Adjust it sometimes over time the sudden, you know, it may not be as the dating app. If you take it for months and months, but your body, you may get a little tolerance to that. So we'll have to see, but it will be interesting to see if it, if it seems to help you feel less

945
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:52.590
Dr Jameson: Drawn to to think about using math. So with that, that's the idea is, it seems to decrease that desire. Okay.

946
01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:01.500
Dr Jameson: And I'll have to look it up. We can talk about adding Wellbutrin at some point to add. So to make sure there isn't an interaction. I have to check that I haven't

947
01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.050
Modoc County: I've tried everything. I mean,

948
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:14.430
Modoc County: Yeah, like I've gone to jail for a month, two months at a time and

949
01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.290
Modoc County: And that's

950
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:20.040
Modoc County: A nice looking for two months.

951
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:22.890
Dr Jameson: Okay.

952
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.500
Modoc County: Workstation and a half probably

953
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.280
Hmm.

954
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.580
Dr Jameson: So the name of this medication is

955
01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:32.940
Dr Jameson: Or REM Iran is the brand name.

956
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:50.640
Dr Jameson: Just FYI. So I'm going to have you start the dose. I have to, I have to remind myself what the dose in this in this trial was. But either way, I want you to start at a lower dose to start because I want to make sure there aren't any.

957
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:56.460
Dr Jameson: You know, it's not too sedating for you or that you know that there aren't any other

958
01:21:57.810 --> 01:21:58.680
Dr Jameson: Issues.

959
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:11.790
Dr Jameson: As far as side effects to watch for. Obviously, I already told you is going to make you sleepy, and that's a side effect, but we can't do anything about that. So you just take it at that time and then

960
01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:15.180
Dr Jameson: It has been

961
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:27.150
Dr Jameson: It can cause increased appetite. I think we also use it for that purpose and like old people who won't eat so you're going to have to watch for that.

962
01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:31.380
Dr Jameson: And then, constipation, dry mouth.

963
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.560
Dr Jameson: We are dreams.

964
01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.050
Dr Jameson: Any

965
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:54.330
Dr Jameson: Usually, the thing is, any medication can cause any number of things. Most of them are very rare, but those are the kind of more common ones. So you can monitor for that if there's anything that's bothering you. That seems new since you've started it, then let me know we'll, we'll have to

966
01:22:55.590 --> 01:23:00.810
Dr Jameson: You know, talk about it and see what I'm going to do is have you start on the 50 milligram, which is

967
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:08.910
Dr Jameson: A lower dose anyway. And then for the first few days anyway. Break them in half, even

968
01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:16.350
Dr Jameson: So that you can have a chance to see if it's something bothering you, at least it's pretty mild because it's a low dose. Okay.

969
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:18.390
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

970
01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:21.360
Modoc County: Hi. Hello. So

971
01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:24.720
Modoc County: With this program and stuff.

972
01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:34.890
Modoc County: That we are only like doing like the Suboxone and stuff is we have like our doctors here in this small county to do like the other medications.

973
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:35.670
Dr Jameson: Oh, okay.

974
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:49.080
Modoc County: Because this this building is like mental health. So we already told my doctor who does like mccaskey or welding training, things like that to me better managed to do them.

975
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.760
Modoc County: Okay, right.

976
01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:56.670
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm okay, that's fine. So, um, then

977
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.500
Dr Jameson: You guys do groups and all that stuff to

978
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:09.270
Modoc County: Get well we do therapy here not Rousseff is we're just barely started groups now because of the coven it

979
01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:12.390
Dr Jameson: Right, okay so

980
01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:17.880
Dr Jameson: Okay, that's fine. Um, so then we maybe can

981
01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:23.940
Dr Jameson: Pass you back to the local ducks there. If the Suboxone hasn't been

982
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:27.030
Dr Jameson: A great fit for you.

983
01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:33.990
Dr Jameson: Okay. I mean, sometimes we have people and I don't know because this is, I know this was kind of the first

984
01:24:37.650 --> 01:24:40.920
Dr Jameson: What's the word, I don't know, try this kinda

985
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.970
Modoc County: Yeah.

986
01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:42.900
This kind of

987
01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:46.650
Dr Jameson: setup with the local group.

988
01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:52.080
Dr Jameson: Of folks, then I'll tell them medicine from the same room but um

989
01:24:52.980 --> 01:25:06.780
Dr Jameson: I mean, sometimes we have patients who get their medications somewhere else and then still come to us for groups and individual counseling. I guess it doesn't sound even in this unique situation that that may even be necessary. So we should probably talk to the

990
01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:14.940
Dr Jameson: I don't know if you're working with Elena or ed or who you've been working with about setting this all up in the first place.

991
01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.880
Dr Jameson: But I can let them.

992
01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:20.010
Dr Jameson: I have

993
01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.900
Modoc County: Mr john champion.

994
01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:32.670
Dr Jameson: Oh, that's the CEO. Okay, we can, I guess, depending on whether you guys are going to get groups going there. And I guess that's your intention eventually anyway.

995
01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:35.580
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. So then

996
01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:47.370
Dr Jameson: I don't, I guess we it's he has individual counseling there so we don't need to do that. So really it's a question of whether or not, then there is a need for the group.

997
01:25:49.050 --> 01:25:56.970
Dr Jameson: Counseling like recovery skills relapse prevention type stuff. And I know you have a couple other patients, although I haven't seen them.

998
01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:00.120
Modoc County: No doctor goes out and does

999
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.690
Dr Jameson: Okay, so then in May, I guess if if that's a sheet right

1000
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:08.550
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Yes. I haven't met

1001
01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:10.920
Dr Jameson: Okay. I think so. But I can

1002
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:19.830
Dr Jameson: Maybe she is running if she has kind of them. I know it's so small number, but the majority of the patients. Maybe she can run the group because I know I didn't have

1003
01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:39.270
Dr Jameson: Availability on the day that you were needing it anyway. So I'll, I'll kind of send an email back to to john that for you. Anyway, we were going to probably pass on the medication piece and then still to be returned to be determined if we're going to continue with a group for you guys.

1004
01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:40.590
Dr Jameson: Okay, that's

1005
01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:47.850
Modoc County: That's good. I'm just, I'm just doing what they're telling you to do because we're only supposed to be regarding those spots on the

1006
01:26:49.590 --> 01:27:00.360
Dr Jameson: Other it's a it's a special. It's a special license that you have to have to prescribe it and you know otherwise. But you're right. I wasn't really thinking about

1007
01:27:02.370 --> 01:27:06.510
Dr Jameson: Okay. So that would be my recommendation. I don't know if they

1008
01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:11.370
Modoc County: Are they like it, they will put it like in your notes if that is your recommendation.

1009
01:27:11.370 --> 01:27:14.070
Dr Jameson: Yeah, for sure. And then

1010
01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:21.330
Dr Jameson: I'll look up the dose that was used in that trial to so that we, we get

1011
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.060
Dr Jameson: In there once I find it.

1012
01:27:25.530 --> 01:27:31.560
Dr Jameson: I think it was 30 but I have to triple check on that. So, but either way I

1013
01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:42.600
Dr Jameson: I'm sure your doctors are perfectly capable. I'm sure they do the same thing where you start kind of low and then move it up to the to the goal, assuming things are going fine so

1014
01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:50.010
Dr Jameson: Okay. And then, yeah, I mean the only other which i don't i. It sounds like that would be

1015
01:27:51.090 --> 01:28:08.520
Dr Jameson: Choice number to Plan B would be to go back to the box on but just do the quarters like once a day or twice a day or something only enough to below that feeling high sort of threshold. If we can get you that low but you know if it's that difficult to tolerate even this

1016
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:19.380
Dr Jameson: Is a low, actually, then I think because then you'll end up having to wean off that which will be very difficult at such a low dose to start with. So it may be, it's best just to try the other other brewers

1017
01:28:20.130 --> 01:28:21.750
Modoc County: Yeah. Well, yeah.

1018
01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:23.550

1019
01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:24.900
Dr Jameson: Oh, you're welcome.

1021
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:28.800
Modoc County: I don't do

1022
01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:33.180
Modoc County: I don't do locally. I guess myself because I'm like

1023
01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:36.540
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you're the receptor mix that that

1024
01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:39.030
Modoc County: My, my mind is my brain doesn't like that.

1025
01:28:39.090 --> 01:28:40.140
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so

1026
01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.070

1027
01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:42.960
Modoc County: It is so

1028
01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.000
Modoc County: Nice that

1029
01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.460
Modoc County: Being in a wheelchair for six months and I'm walking

1030
01:28:47.730 --> 01:28:51.060

1031
01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:51.870
Well,

1032
01:28:53.190 --> 01:28:57.480
Modoc County: My, my mind is not want to lay down, it makes

1033
01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.730
Modoc County: It makes you feel really

1034
01:28:59.970 --> 01:29:01.200
Dr Jameson: Anxious. Probably, yeah.

1035
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:02.910
Modoc County: Just well

1036
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.240

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.770

01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:14.100
Dr Jameson: I don't love the idea of

1040
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:23.100
Dr Jameson: Yeah I don't love the idea of adding something that makes you feel really so that's just as well. Yeah. Okay. Well, I hope everything works out with your

1078
01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:40.050
Adam Krug: And I neglected my my bag and

1079
01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.380
Adam Krug: Then I also got

1080
01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:48.540

01:32:55.710 --> 01:32:56.610
Adam Krug: Take care of my bag.

1084
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:59.520
Dr Jameson: So kind of a combination of things.

1085
01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.750
Dr Jameson: Okay. So how long has that been an issue.

1086
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.120
Adam Krug: Oh,

1087
01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:09.570
Adam Krug: Good question. I think it

1088
01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:13.200
Adam Krug: I mean, like, weeks, months, years, it's very bad specific

1089
01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:17.220
Adam Krug: Oh, so like one to two months ago.

1090
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.700
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1091
01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:19.110
Dr Jameson: That was okay.

1092
01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.920
Dr Jameson: So you're seeing a local

1093
01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:32.730
Dr Jameson: Doctor clinician of some sort, and they were suggesting that you use the buprenorphine to help with pain. Is that what you were saying I

1094
01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:37.980
Adam Krug: In pain management or also a co op

1095
01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:40.260
Adam Krug: Yes, it

1096
01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.320
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's Luck It's fortunate that it can help with both because it. Obviously, it helps with opioid that's it helps with

1097
01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:53.160
Dr Jameson: physical dependence and all that, but it also does have some pain. Pain relief. Now it sounds like your

1098
01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:06.300
Dr Jameson: Issue is something that will heal it. I mean, eventually it's going to get better anyway. Fortunately, because it doesn't sound like it was some kind of, you know, operation with plates and all this stuff that can kind of bother people forever so

1099
01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:16.560
Dr Jameson: Sounds like stretching and care being careful with keeping your computer apply. So you're not hunched over, it's very common. It's a very common problem.

1100
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:27.660
Dr Jameson: For unfortunately this teenage I have. I have. You can't see, but I have my computer up on a stand so that I'm looking up instead of and I have my keep my

1101
01:34:28.410 --> 01:34:41.730
Dr Jameson: Keyboard like in my lap. So I can not have my arms. You know, you can you can definitely put yourself into contortions very easily on a computer all day. I guess I been there. Okay, so

1102
01:34:44.190 --> 01:34:53.220
Dr Jameson: Then let's kind of back up for a few seconds. Let me ask you some kind of basic things like are you allergic to any medication.

1103
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.410
Dr Jameson: No. Okay. And are you prescribed anything

1104
01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:01.560
Adam Krug: Yes.

1105
01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:04.380
Adam Krug: But I've been

1106
01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:10.110
Adam Krug: Mostly taking the forget lattice prescribing these

1107
01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:15.450
Adam Krug: To help ease or alleviate symptoms of

1108
01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:17.790
Adam Krug: opioid withdrawal.

1109
01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:29.670
Dr Jameson: Okay, I think I might not. Can you say that again. Are you saying you're using the medicine more for not for pain anymore for for physical withdrawal that what you mean.

1110
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:31.380
Adam Krug: Well, it's both.

1111
01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.760
Adam Krug: I though one point was

1112
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:46.140
Adam Krug: Using the opioid am analog, Sir. Sir, gather just for pain, but then when I would stop using

1113
01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.710
Adam Krug: An analog of Tramadol and and i will obviously experience withdrawal and then

1114
01:35:52.710 --> 01:35:53.010
Yeah.

1115
01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:59.700
Adam Krug: The, the preamble, in order to alleviate the symptoms of of pain and withdrawal.

1116
01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.460
Dr Jameson: Are you taking that now the Lyrica

1117
01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:10.650
Adam Krug: I haven't taken it today because I found it. Like it doesn't

1118
01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:22.500
Adam Krug: It was like not being very helpful and actually causing constipation, because I was also taking non steroidal anti inflammatories, so I stopped taking the gamble.

1119
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:29.220
Dr Jameson: Okay. Just today, like do you feel like you're not going to take it at all anymore or that's just a today. You're not taking it.

1120
01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:35.220
Adam Krug: So far just today. I'm taking but I'm I like to not taking any more, but I

1121
01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:41.850
Dr Jameson: Okay, but you had been so I'm just trying to update your chart with like what your medications are so I think

1122
01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:55.560
Dr Jameson: I'm gonna, I think I'll put it in there. And then if we end up, you don't end up going if you stay off of it. We can always just okay can discontinue But theoretically, that was what, one of the things your doctor had wanted you to take right

1123
01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:59.430
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Okay. Is it. Do you know the dose.

1124
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.450
Adam Krug: Yes, hundred milligrams three times day. Okay.

1125
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:09.780
Dr Jameson: So I'll just put it in here. And then if you don't take it, then you can take it up. Okay.

1126
01:37:10.890 --> 01:37:15.240

01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:31.590
Adam Krug: Similar yeah

1132
01:37:33.690 --> 01:37:36.300
Dr Jameson: Okay. Say it. One was the first word he said

1133
01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.000
Adam Krug: Since and said he is a brand name have

1134
01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.750
Dr Jameson: Never heard of that one is that start with the

1135
01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.950
Adam Krug: Yeah, z and see the eye.

01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:14.400
Adam Krug: 20 milligrams twice a day and then designs it less time citizens that is does just actually 15 milligrams three times a day. If I pick up that brand name.

1140
01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:21.960
Dr Jameson: So what determines whether you get what determines whether you get the brand name or the generic

1141
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:31.230
Adam Krug: If I am living in an area that the pharmacy says we are all out of the brand name.

1142
01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:33.240

01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:42.270
Adam Krug: And yeah 30 days flyer, a while ago of interchange

1159
01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.410
Adam Krug: Both of those. I haven't used the late

1160
01:39:48.450 --> 01:39:50.430
Adam Krug: I've just mostly been using

1161
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.620
Adam Krug: A non steroidal anti inflammatory naproxen hand.

1162
01:39:58.050 --> 01:40:06.120
Adam Krug: I ceased usage. Lastly, a recent Neil uptight closed for that job because he was causing dermatitis mildly.

1163
01:40:06.450 --> 01:40:10.410
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you have approximately 500 words.

1164
01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:12.330
Adam Krug: Yes. Okay.

1165
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.220
Dr Jameson: You take that every 12 hours.

1166
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:16.950
Adam Krug: Oh, yes. Okay.

1167
01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:24.540
Dr Jameson: So you're not going to do the Voltaire and gel anymore because that makes you have a rash and then the light is a lot of cane patch hobbling

1168
01:40:26.730 --> 01:40:27.840
Adam Krug: very mildly.

1169
01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:29.460
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1170
01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:31.230
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1171
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:34.560
Adam Krug: It's not really too noticeable, if that makes sense.

1172
01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:37.500
Dr Jameson: Uh huh. I need to take it off after 12 hours right

1173
01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:39.390
Adam Krug: Yeah, okay.

1174
01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:42.540
Dr Jameson: All right, and that's where you're putting that somewhere up on here.

1175
01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:50.520
Adam Krug: Yeah, like right here or or here say maybe I'm like

1176
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.870
Adam Krug: Yeah, we're running

1177
01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:57.300
Dr Jameson: And then have you done like massage or stretching or physical therapy or any of that stuff.

1178
01:40:58.590 --> 01:41:04.770
Adam Krug: I haven't done physical therapy because the coronavirus made that a little tricky, but stretching

1179
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:11.730
Adam Krug: And stretching and like why lying on my back with my feet up on

1180
01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:13.590
Adam Krug: A chair.

1181
01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:18.600
Dr Jameson: Does your low back, Father, you are. It's mostly in the upper back.

1182
01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.380
Adam Krug: You ever been asleep. It's not really my lower back.

1183
01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:31.710
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I wonder if getting like a foam roller or like a tennis ball and kind of laying on that to kind of press on the knots. I'm sure there are not

1184
01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.110
Dr Jameson: Might be

1185
01:41:35.010 --> 01:41:36.870
Adam Krug: What's a foam roller certain

1186
01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:38.070
Dr Jameson: Know it's a fine.

1187
01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:55.530
Dr Jameson: Well they sell them on Amazon. I think if you just typed in foam roller, but it's basically a cylinder and they have different like squishy. Mrs. And then they have them that have these little like knobs sticking out like there and increasingly torturous

1188
01:41:56.730 --> 01:42:08.970
Dr Jameson: But basically you use it to kind of roll you can roll anybody part like if your hamstrings are tight or your quads are time and you have to get on the floor and kind of like move yourself around, but you can use it, it's

1189
01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:21.720
Dr Jameson: Good for like the the low back in the upper back, but at a certain point up in the neck there, you know, you kind of need to be like rolling this way and you can't really use that thing to roll yourself over it, but

1190
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:34.170
Dr Jameson: It still might be good to use for your upper back, and especially if you kind of hug yourself so your arm like those muscles that are right along the inside of your shoulder blades that are, I'm guessing part of the problem.

1191
01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:45.540
Dr Jameson: You know, you can kind of really or you can lean up against the door like the corner of a door jamb and just kind of get the edge there to dig into things that are sore, kind of like giving yourself a massage

1192
01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:49.950
Adam Krug: If you can find us at CVS say

1193
01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.620
Dr Jameson: You'll find at CVS Walmart might have it.

1194
01:42:59.310 --> 01:43:08.820
Dr Jameson: There shouldn't be very expensive. I mean, it should be inexpensive, they shouldn't be charging you too much. And some of them literally are made out of foam. Some of them are more like

1195
01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.600
Dr Jameson: You know what I have, let me go get one.

1196
01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:15.540
Dr Jameson: Second,

1197
01:43:39.930 --> 01:43:40.320
Dr Jameson: Myself.

1198
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:45.090
Adam Krug: I see there's a bit of a variety

1199
01:43:45.330 --> 01:43:46.620
Dr Jameson: Oh yeah, well, my husband has

1200
01:43:47.670 --> 01:43:58.890
Dr Jameson: Little things bothering him and he's a he's a gadget guy, so he has purchased all sorts of this is one, it's kind of, if you can see that very well. It's kind of

1201
01:43:59.850 --> 01:44:11.580
Dr Jameson: You know, it's mostly smooth and it's just it's hollow and you can roll over whatever by part you want this one is me and I won't use it because it hurts me but this one has like knobs sticking

1202
01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:16.080
Dr Jameson: But you can see how that would push into a muscle, not

1203
01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:25.470
Dr Jameson: You can really get in there and kind of dig at it. And a lot of times if you keep keep doing that for a while, they, they kind of let themselves they release.

1204
01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:29.010
Dr Jameson: So anyway, and then

1205
01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.920
Dr Jameson: This is just one example. He's got all these different sizes and shapes but there's different balls that people

1206
01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:47.220
Dr Jameson: You know you like put it under word hurts and like either under chair on the floor, you kind of like, you know, roll around in there and try to sort of, wait, like I said, it's kind of a way of giving yourself a massage

1207
01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.360
Adam Krug: It's a foam roller different the tennis ball in terms of play.

1208
01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:57.300
Dr Jameson: Yeah, cuz the tennis ball is going to be very localized to that one.

1209
01:44:59.550 --> 01:45:09.840
Dr Jameson: One. Not like sometimes people's backs. Get out of alignment. So when you roll that like up and down your spine. Sometimes you'll feel things like cracking a little bit like as you kind of

1210
01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.920
Dr Jameson: Push things back into place. But if you could start with a tennis ball, you probably have one already. That's probably easier.

1211
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:18.870
Adam Krug: Somewhere. Yeah, yeah.

1212
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:30.960
Dr Jameson: So I would, I would definitely because this sounds like to me more what we call a soft tissue, meaning it's not a bone. It's the muscles and tendons and those kinds of things should be

1213
01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:42.240
Dr Jameson: fixable or managed anyway with some of these kinds of techniques and you know I know it's a shame. It's hard to get anything right now with coronavirus but

1214
01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:48.330
Dr Jameson: Yeah, massage or or therapy that kind of stuff should help that along

1215
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:52.080
Adam Krug: Thank you so

1216
01:45:52.950 --> 01:46:00.120
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so that would be, I would definitely recommend trying that kind of stuff. And if you sit and watch TV. Anyway, or something, you know, you could just

1217
01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:16.470
Dr Jameson: Get in the habit of laying on the floor, but one of these things under you and kind of rolling around and sitting, usually if you just find the spot and then like just leave it, let it push for a few minutes. A lot. Usually, kind of, like, kind of, let's go after year.

1218
01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:18.990
Dr Jameson: Like lean on it for a minute.

1219
01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:22.020
Dr Jameson: Anyway,

1220
01:46:22.590 --> 01:46:24.960
Adam Krug: That makes. Oh, sorry. Oh.

1221
01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:25.740
Dr Jameson: No. No, go ahead.

1222
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:29.550
Adam Krug: I was gonna say that. That makes sense. And I

1223
01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:30.870
Adam Krug: Do believe it is like

1224
01:46:32.010 --> 01:46:42.990
Adam Krug: At least maybe muscle related I heard first from an urgent care in a bit ago that like it might be Unitas or something.

1225
01:46:43.320 --> 01:47:02.370
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean tendinitis is generally like a more in a joint that's like mobile where you have a repeated movement of muscles which are connected to attendance rubbing inside their little compartment and they get inflamed. That's usually an overused. I mean,

1226
01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.950
Dr Jameson: This to me sounds like it doesn't matter. I mean, we do the same sorts of things. Anyways,

1227
01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:16.500
Dr Jameson: But, but, this sounds more like muscle knots and and like the the gristle of your tissues may be getting kind of

1228
01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:32.070
Dr Jameson: Rough and bunched up a little bit in there from being kind of pulled on and strain for a long time. And that's where the massage and rolling and stretching and all that stuff can kind of help. We set where things were supposed to be.

1229
01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:42.450
Dr Jameson: So anyway, so that I would recommend anyway. But as far as we were prescribed opiates or

1230
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:49.800
Adam Krug: I'm not not currently or recently a while. Quite a while ago.

1231
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:51.150

01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:18.780
Dr Jameson: They give cards in in California. I don't know how they do it there.

1304
01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:28.080
Adam Krug: Well, I think you can get like a card or something, but I got a letter of recommendation for your

1305
01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:28.740
Okay.

1306
01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:33.810
Dr Jameson: And you do that regularly or just here and there.

1307
01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:36.900
Adam Krug: Just you're in there.

1308
01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:38.310
Dr Jameson: Like

1309
01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.320
Dr Jameson: Three days a week.

1310
01:53:41.550 --> 01:53:42.840
Dr Jameson: At bedtime, every day.

1311
01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:47.280
Adam Krug: For three

1312
01:53:48.810 --> 01:53:49.140
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1313
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:54.270
Dr Jameson: So up to three times per week and it's just a one one.

1314
01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:01.530
Dr Jameson: Dose. I don't know how you when you use it or do you when you use it in a day do you do it all day long, or how does that look

1315
01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:03.420
Adam Krug: At so maybe like

1316
01:54:04.590 --> 01:54:07.410
Adam Krug: Once again dose wise for us to our three

1317
01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:10.140
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1318
01:54:11.730 --> 01:54:15.420
Dr Jameson: All right. And that's, again, treating anxiety or pain or what

1319
01:54:17.070 --> 01:54:18.180
Adam Krug: More so the pain.

1320
01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:28.980
Adam Krug: Inside anxiety, the THC seems to tend to sometimes elevate the the CBD can be sometimes nice but

1321
01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:32.160
Adam Krug: It also helps the pain.

1322
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:39.030
Adam Krug: A little bit. It's like a very sick. Once again, similar to the patches then tiny well

1323
01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:40.410
Adam Krug: Okay, got it.

1324
01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.270
Dr Jameson: And how about alcohol.

1325
01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.250
Adam Krug: No.

1326
01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:47.400
Dr Jameson: Was it a problem are you just not you

1327
01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:52.890
Adam Krug: Know it's not my not my thing. I don't have the desire to okay

1328
01:54:54.660 --> 01:55:02.970
Dr Jameson: And any other drug use mentioned cannabis, which is still from time to time. Anything else that you use.

1329
01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:05.010
Dr Jameson: illicitly

1330
01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:07.020
Adam Krug: Know,

1331
01:55:09.810 --> 01:55:16.290
Adam Krug: And like the most recent thing is for the things as prescribed to discuss

1332
01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:23.130
Dr Jameson: So have you ever used math for benzo cocaine.

1333
01:55:24.090 --> 01:55:27.960
Adam Krug: Well, I was prescribed benzodiazepines for an

1334
01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:34.590
Adam Krug: Infrequent in like emergency a did I have never used

1335
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:40.020
Dr Jameson: Okay, but you don't have the benzo now or you still do.

1336
01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:42.870
Adam Krug: Do not have that right now. Okay.

1337
01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:46.200
Dr Jameson: So it's a prescription like for a panic attack or not.

1338
01:55:46.230 --> 01:55:47.130
Adam Krug: Yeah, and I think that

1339
01:55:47.370 --> 01:55:48.540
Adam Krug: Both of those

1340
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.600
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1341
01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:53.490
Dr Jameson: Um,

1342
01:55:56.790 --> 01:56:03.840
Dr Jameson: Alright, so when you were taking you said you use it was always orally. You never inhaled anything or injected anything right.

1343
01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:06.420
Adam Krug: Yeah. Never those two

1344
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:07.140
Okay.

1345
01:56:09.630 --> 01:56:11.340
Dr Jameson: Typically sublingual

1346
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:15.060
Dr Jameson: Is fentanyl. This was

1347
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:18.060
Dr Jameson: Not for the past month. He said,

1348
01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:21.360
Adam Krug: Well,

1349
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:27.750
Adam Krug: Actually yes but it was like I was trying to

1350
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:34.620
Adam Krug: Cross Tabor with like other things, if that makes sense.

1351
01:56:35.190 --> 01:56:36.930
Adam Krug: That's why as yeah he's

1352
01:56:38.370 --> 01:56:38.790
Adam Krug: Other

1353
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.960
Your

1354
01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:44.520
Dr Jameson: Scientific about it. I think making like chairs and

1355
01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:53.340
Adam Krug: I'm just glad that I'm not dead, because that's why I was like, I don't. I was trying to be very cautious for a reason is

1356
01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:55.980
Dr Jameson: Right well right rightfully so.

1357
01:56:57.450 --> 01:57:00.030
Dr Jameson: It's always you sometimes he's Tramadol to you said, Yeah.

1358
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:09.390
Adam Krug: Well I, I used an analogue that was like easily we easily, easily accessible mine called oh dismantle travel

1359
01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:11.850
Dr Jameson: Okay. Is it like from China or something.

1360
01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:16.200
Adam Krug: I don't, I was actually domestic

1361
01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:18.630
Adam Krug: Because I didn't want to

1362
01:57:20.010 --> 01:57:22.290
Adam Krug: Purchase international from there. Right. Yeah.

1363
01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:27.420
Dr Jameson: Yeah, got it. Okay, so, um,

1364
01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:45.480
Dr Jameson: Us. I mean, I guess I'm surprised to hear you say. And it's not uncommon. So I, it doesn't, it's not a problem. I just you. I was surprised to hear you say you haven't used recently because to me, you kind of seem groggy, a little bit.

1365
01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:50.190
Dr Jameson: Which is not like I said, I'm kind of used to that in this in this job so

1366
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:54.090
Dr Jameson: But is there anything else you've taken that could make you

1367
01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:55.800
Dr Jameson: Sleepy.

1368
01:57:56.250 --> 01:58:02.340
Adam Krug: Well, I did just a badly. Unfortunately, wake up like 1005

1369
01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.860
Adam Krug: However, the only thing that can make me sleepy was

1370
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:10.260
Adam Krug: Let's say

1371
01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:19.350
Adam Krug: And yesterday I did take a javelin, which has a lasting effect.

1372
01:58:19.770 --> 01:58:21.180
Adam Krug: Yeah. Apart from that,

1373
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.930
Okay.

1374
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:31.050
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no, cuz you almost have, like, you know what I'm talking about the nodding or like I would, they're kinda

1375
01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:42.720
Adam Krug: I don't, you know, I do know you're talking about and I I also get that a bit from gambling, if that makes sense.

1376
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:43.770
Adam Krug: But I also

1377
01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:49.410
Adam Krug: I also did

1378
01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:52.950
Adam Krug: Wake up recently.

1379
01:58:53.970 --> 01:58:54.780
Adam Krug: So I feel like

1380
01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:57.900
Adam Krug: shakily cold, if that makes sense. Sitting on

1381
01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:04.080
Dr Jameson: Did you ask any cannabis. Right. Yeah.

1382
01:59:04.350 --> 01:59:07.140
Adam Krug: I did well yeah I did a bit

1383
01:59:07.530 --> 01:59:08.940
Dr Jameson: Okay, well maybe that's what it is.

1384
01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:12.750
Dr Jameson: Um, I don't know. I mean, like,

1385
01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:24.210
Dr Jameson: I i don't know i don't turn to say like, sometimes you can't see it in yourself, but other people like Kenny, are you can see yourself in the in the video. Right. Do you see what I mean.

1386
01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:26.520
Adam Krug: Yeah.

1387
01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:28.890
Adam Krug: Compared to you. Yes, especially

1388
01:59:29.370 --> 01:59:31.620
Adam Krug: I guess I'm not trying to make. I'm not trying to

1389
01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:39.930
Dr Jameson: Make you self conscious. I just, I'm like, hi. What I would have, I would have thought you were going to tell me you use fentanyl like three hours ago or something so

1390
01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:42.870
Adam Krug: Thank you for pointing you know

1391
01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.010
Dr Jameson: No, no, I don't.

1392
01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:48.600
Dr Jameson: I just what I it's important that we

1393
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:57.360
Dr Jameson: Let you know it. I just, we need to have a, you know, whatever it is, it is. And, but it's important that I have the full picture because

1394
01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:10.350
Dr Jameson: buprenorphine. If you take it before you're really in withdrawal, which in we judged by how long it's been since you've taken an opiate it can create a terrible sudden withdrawal so

1395
02:00:11.010 --> 02:00:18.420
Dr Jameson: I asked these questions because I want to make sure we don't have you take it at the wrong time. This is so I'm not trying to

1396
02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:32.790
Dr Jameson: Like I said, I'm not trying to put you on the swatter but I just want to make sure you you I'm trying to reassure you, I'm not upset. I don't. It doesn't. I don't judge or anything. I just need to know because otherwise we could have a bad

1397
02:00:33.810 --> 02:00:37.500
Dr Jameson: A bad reaction in the first dose, which we don't want to do

1398
02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.620
Adam Krug: Yeah, and

1399
02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:54.840
Adam Krug: I appreciate. Thank you for pointing it out. Well, like I don't know if this would be, it's probably something to consider. Actually, but I took the 300 milligrams

1400
02:00:56.190 --> 02:00:57.840
Adam Krug: gabble and at night.

1401
02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:02.280
Adam Krug: And typically, that makes me

1402
02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:07.140
Adam Krug: A little dizzy student so

1403
02:01:07.230 --> 02:01:10.920
Adam Krug: Okay, Association of that it does cause symptoms withdrawals.

1404
02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:24.720
Dr Jameson: Yeah. What is, you know, the pre gambling and gabapentin Neurontin for some, not everybody that takes it. But for some people it's sort of cross reacts with some of these same receptors so

1405
02:01:27.810 --> 02:01:34.110
Dr Jameson: Anyway, our end up end up for some people they end up being used kind of for other

1406
02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:39.510
Dr Jameson: Reasons and you know the original intent with their prescription so

1407
02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:42.660
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

1408
02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:45.390
Dr Jameson: I just want to make sure I'm

1409
02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:53.520
Dr Jameson: Getting everything correct. So you had been prescribed some sort of prescription opiates.

1410
02:01:55.860 --> 02:02:00.030
Dr Jameson: At some time ago for this shoulder and everything was I right.

1411
02:02:00.810 --> 02:02:03.960
Adam Krug: Um, it wasn't for the shoulder, and it was

1412
02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:06.600
Adam Krug: Some time ago. Yes.

1413
02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:09.090
Adam Krug: But

1414
02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:12.300
Adam Krug: It was for

1415
02:02:13.650 --> 02:02:15.000
Adam Krug: Wisdom to through

1416
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:18.510
Dr Jameson: Okay. And that was how old are you when that happens.

1417
02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:24.780
Adam Krug: 1615 actually

1418
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.710
Adam Krug: Okay.

1419
02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:29.250
Dr Jameson: So you got a prescription for like biking in or Percocet, or something.

1420
02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:33.090
Adam Krug: Yes, actually, I believe it was nice.

1421
02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:35.460
Adam Krug: Purposes, it gives the

1422
02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:36.810
Dr Jameson: X equal access to the

1423
02:02:36.810 --> 02:02:37.770
Dr Jameson: Medicine. Yeah.

1424
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:44.280
Dr Jameson: Okay. So you took that and then I mean, did they give you a whole bunch of it or how long do you take that for

1425
02:02:45.330 --> 02:02:51.060
Adam Krug: They gave me a limited split, which I did not take for very long, but I had procured

1426
02:02:52.110 --> 02:02:53.610
Adam Krug: oxycodone prior

1427
02:02:55.590 --> 02:02:56.220
Dr Jameson: Can that

1428
02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:01.200
Dr Jameson: As just like partying with friends are

1429
02:03:02.370 --> 02:03:02.520
Adam Krug: As

1430
02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:08.820
Adam Krug: Well, it wasn't as prescription. It wasn't really partying his friends either say it was worse or just like a

1431
02:03:13.230 --> 02:03:13.500
Adam Krug: Like

1432
02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:16.230
Adam Krug: Sort of

1433
02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.630
Adam Krug: Going about my day. And that was about it.

1434
02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:39.030
Dr Jameson: Okay. What was, what was the just, just for our ton of notes. So we know where we can try to help as much we can. Where was we self medicating something or did it just give you a high or what was, what were you, I think.

1435
02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:43.560
Adam Krug: At the time it was used for both

1436
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:50.880
Adam Krug: An ability to sleep and in physically

1437
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:58.890
Adam Krug: I think it the inability to sleep it being physically might be related

1438
02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:05.160
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. Well, when you have pain and hurt me, for sure. What, what sort of pain, ones that

1439
02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:08.250
Adam Krug: I'm like I avoid

1440
02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:11.010
Adam Krug: Didn't like

1441
02:04:13.380 --> 02:04:13.620
Adam Krug: It.

1442
02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:16.800
Adam Krug: So that was

1443
02:04:18.270 --> 02:04:21.690
Dr Jameson: Okay. And that was when you are, how

1444
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.990
Adam Krug: Well,

1445
02:04:26.610 --> 02:04:29.730
Adam Krug: That was also around 15 but

1446
02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:32.460
Adam Krug: Think

1447
02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:34.380
Adam Krug: Are you

1448
02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:38.550
Adam Krug: Started

1449
02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:46.230
Dr Jameson: Okay. So you started using that on your own to help you sleep and for various aches and pains of sorts.

1450
02:04:46.890 --> 02:04:47.160
Yeah.

1451
02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:53.580
Adam Krug: Sorry, I was gonna say. So it's a good an infrequent off and on.

1452
02:04:54.090 --> 02:04:55.590
Dr Jameson: Okay so wasn't like a

1453
02:04:56.010 --> 02:05:00.930
Dr Jameson: Routine or anything. And then you got the prescription when you were 16

1454
02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:03.840
Dr Jameson: And then what happened.

1455
02:05:06.690 --> 02:05:08.640
Adam Krug: Then things

1456
02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:16.260
Adam Krug: Escalated lately, where it's been quite a while since I've

1457
02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:20.460
Adam Krug: Used

1458
02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:22.920
Adam Krug: Opioids but

1459
02:05:24.570 --> 02:05:31.500
Adam Krug: More recently the offense, you know, as a result of this again just

1460
02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:38.010
Adam Krug: Not addressing the pain properly.

1461
02:05:39.690 --> 02:05:41.490
Dr Jameson: So you started using fentanyl

1462
02:05:42.810 --> 02:05:44.940
Dr Jameson: In the last few months, you say, or before that.

1463
02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.370
Adam Krug: Yes, last few months.

1464
02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:49.410
Dr Jameson: Okay, and how much you every day.

1465
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:51.690
Adam Krug: Not every day.

1466
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.740
Okay.

1467
02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:56.970
Dr Jameson: So you alternating with the Tramadol. I'm just going to call it Tramadol but

1468
02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:04.980
Dr Jameson: Sometimes we've kind of mixing and matching the two or did you just wish to Tramadol after you were trying to stop the phenom

1469
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:15.750
Adam Krug: Uh, well, the, the, the, the terminal analog was, yeah. After the defense and offense. So was

1470
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:22.410
Adam Krug: It wasn't like a an everyday thing, but I also wasn't alternating

1471
02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:25.890
Adam Krug: Necessarily because I wouldn't use it for

1472
02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:29.100
Adam Krug: Too long of extended periods of time.

1473
02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:30.810
Adam Krug: Like okay,

1474
02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:35.400
Dr Jameson: Well, what point did you realize you had with you felt sick if you didn't have something

1475
02:06:36.150 --> 02:06:36.720
Oh,

1476
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:48.810
Adam Krug: Let's see, that might be about a month and a half to two months now, two months ago, I'd say.

1477
02:06:51.180 --> 02:07:02.460
Dr Jameson: Can you describe a little bit just, I mean, most, most the time, it's a fairly consistent description, but what's the. How do you feel like what kind of symptoms do you get when when you start

1478
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:09.150
Adam Krug: Like tension vomiting aches, nausea,

1479
02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:12.120
Adam Krug: I

1480
02:07:13.470 --> 02:07:16.710
Adam Krug: You know, a society irrational irrational anxiety.

1481
02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:19.380
Adam Krug: Insomnia.

1482
02:07:21.090 --> 02:07:21.960
Adam Krug: Pain.

02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:29.910
Dr Jameson: Some people get like runny nose and yawning and

1484
02:07:30.570 --> 02:07:32.370
Dr Jameson: Runny eyes that happen to you.

1485
02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:38.760
Adam Krug: I'm just at the same time, I feel like I just feel like sickness and

1486
02:07:40.530 --> 02:07:42.720
Adam Krug: There are not even it's a hot and cold.

1487
02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:46.410
Dr Jameson: Hmm, that's people describe that a lot. And some people say restless legs.

1488
02:07:47.010 --> 02:07:48.510
Dr Jameson: Jenna. Yes. Okay.

1489
02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:57.540
Dr Jameson: So not only do you actually help the whole whole body restlessness and sorry you said you vomit, or do you just get nauseous. I

02:07:57.810 --> 02:07:59.340
Adam Krug: I have vomited in the back.

1491
02:07:59.340 --> 02:07:59.520
Dr Jameson: End

1492
02:07:59.790 --> 02:08:03.000
Dr Jameson: If it gets gets long enough. Okay, diarrhea, to

1493
02:08:03.810 --> 02:08:07.560
Adam Krug: Some times more than others. It depends on how bad it is.

1494
02:08:08.850 --> 02:08:09.150
Okay.

1495
02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:15.480
Dr Jameson: So currently, are you having any of those symptoms.

1496
02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:18.030
Adam Krug: Currently,

1497
02:08:19.890 --> 02:08:24.690
Adam Krug: I am but to a lesser extent, partially due to

1498
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:28.020
Adam Krug: The things such as

1499
02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:29.910
Adam Krug: Gamble and but also

1500
02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:33.750
Adam Krug: Due to the fact that I have not

1501
02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:36.420
Adam Krug: I have not taken

1502
02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:39.240
Adam Krug: In the past,

1503
02:08:42.450 --> 02:08:44.190
Adam Krug: Like about a month. Okay.

1504
02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:49.800
Dr Jameson: But you also get some symptoms when you don't take the preamble and right. Is that what you said.

1505
02:08:50.250 --> 02:08:53.610
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay. And are they similar or is that different

1506
02:08:54.090 --> 02:08:55.200
Dr Jameson: highly similar

1507
02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:56.610
Adam Krug: But slightly different

1508
02:08:57.810 --> 02:08:59.310
Dr Jameson: In how is it slightly different

1509
02:09:00.930 --> 02:09:04.740
Adam Krug: Oh, okay. So like the Kaplan

1510
02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:09.120
Adam Krug: I don't feel like I'm as

1511
02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:12.990
Adam Krug: Hot in cold but I

1512
02:09:14.130 --> 02:09:21.660
Adam Krug: That I don't feel like I'm like super sweaty, but I feel more in pain with people to muscular Lee.

1513
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:24.300
Adam Krug: More sensitive and week

1514
02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:37.050
Adam Krug: I also have don't really get like diarrhea, because I feel one constipated. Surprisingly, if it's

1515
02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:40.170
Dr Jameson: A restless restlessness and insomnia and that kind of stuff.

1516
02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:45.390
Dr Jameson: Yes, yes. Okay. So that's the same. It's just the stomach is not quite as intense

1517
02:09:45.930 --> 02:09:47.370
Adam Krug: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

1518
02:09:48.150 --> 02:09:49.140
Dr Jameson: All right. Um,

1519
02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:55.890
Dr Jameson: Okay. And then, have you ever been hospitalized of this

1520
02:09:57.330 --> 02:09:58.530
Dr Jameson: Okay, and

1521
02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:03.510
Dr Jameson: Have you had any overdoses that I asked you that you have not right.

1522
02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:06.930
Adam Krug: I have not. You did not ask. Thank you.

1523
02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:08.070
Dr Jameson: That was the last page.

1524
02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:10.560
Adam Krug: To worry no

1525
02:10:10.890 --> 02:10:15.390
Dr Jameson: I did. I couldn't see. Okay, so no overdoses. Fortunately,

1526
02:10:17.010 --> 02:10:18.930
Dr Jameson: Luckily, because fentanyl, as you know, is

1527
02:10:20.670 --> 02:10:21.450
Dr Jameson: Very dangerous.

1528
02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:24.120
Dr Jameson: And

1529
02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:35.100
Dr Jameson: Okay, so what, and I'm just, again, so we can know where you're at, where you're at in this whole thing, what brought you to decide to try

1530
02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:42.450
Dr Jameson: I guess somebody recommended that buprenorphine is to replace a lot of these other things. Was that the goal.

1531
02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:44.160
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay.

1532
02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:51.810
Dr Jameson: And then would you say that you have an addiction problem or what

1533
02:10:52.290 --> 02:10:52.740
Adam Krug: You think

1534
02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:59.280
Adam Krug: Well, I do think that I have a large problem, but it also feels like

1535
02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:05.580
Adam Krug: Or more like a dependence sometimes because I don't feel

1536
02:11:07.170 --> 02:11:16.710
Adam Krug: To that extreme. But I do. Yeah. Feeling like do something about it, you know, or, oh, I cannot function without the blank and I don't want, I don't like that.

1537
02:11:17.130 --> 02:11:17.550
Uh huh.

1538
02:11:19.290 --> 02:11:20.880
Dr Jameson: So, um,

1539
02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:31.470
Dr Jameson: Okay, so it helps you sleep and helps with pain. What don't you like about using what you're like where you're at right now with how you're

1540
02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:33.510
Adam Krug: Like other

1541
02:11:34.590 --> 02:11:35.100
Adam Krug: The

1542
02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:40.680
Adam Krug: The cons are with pros because I'm not

1543
02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:43.650
Adam Krug: Well,

1544
02:11:46.590 --> 02:11:50.640
Adam Krug: I'd say like it's I think it's best to live. Ideally, I'd like to live.

1545
02:11:51.810 --> 02:11:53.370
Adam Krug: Without having to take anything

1546
02:11:54.450 --> 02:11:55.020
Adam Krug: And

1547
02:11:56.610 --> 02:12:04.410
Adam Krug: Like even if it might help with pain or sleeping. I think it also obviously like in the long term can

1548
02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:14.550
Adam Krug: Be worse for both those are excited. And so, yeah, choosing it to taper off. It's just a byproduct of

1549
02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.890
Adam Krug: Greater issue. Okay.

1550
02:12:17.550 --> 02:12:18.030
Um,

1551
02:12:19.230 --> 02:12:30.060
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, yeah. I mean, I just everybody has their own reasons I just like to hear what what what each person is kind of thinking about, um, okay. So have you been doing okay in school.

1552
02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:41.550
Adam Krug: Lately, uh, not as like I've been doing. Okay, as well as I would like. Not as well as I usually do. It's about a low point.

1553
02:12:43.710 --> 02:12:45.990
Dr Jameson: You feel that's because of the medications.

1554
02:12:47.070 --> 02:12:56.670
Adam Krug: And also I think it's part two to circumstantial reasons and withdrawal or non medicated substances. Yeah.

1555
02:12:57.030 --> 02:13:06.360
Dr Jameson: Okay, so yes okay either taking them are not taking them. And by that, that it has. It's related okay you have you had any legal issues.

1556
02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.350
Adam Krug: With no no

1557
02:13:10.410 --> 02:13:13.710
Dr Jameson: Okay. A lot of people have we had do you Iser gotten

1558
02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:24.600
Dr Jameson: Oh, stealing or something. Okay. Um, okay. And then is there anyone in your family that has addiction or dependency type problems.

1559
02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:28.650
Adam Krug: Oh yes and

1560
02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:30.480
Adam Krug: Like

1561
02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:43.290
Adam Krug: To alcohol.

1562
02:13:44.670 --> 02:13:46.530
Dr Jameson: Unable to really speak really right now.

1563
02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:55.290
Dr Jameson: Is it is it your dad.

1564
02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:03.270
Dr Jameson: I can't see you. Sorry.

1565
02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.290
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay. And he, I hear, I think I heard and whistling a minute ago.

1566
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.630
Dr Jameson: If you there.

1567
02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:15.600
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Okay, got it. Okay, so he currently still using

1568
02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:20.520
Dr Jameson: No. Okay. But so he's in he's sober now.

1569
02:14:21.330 --> 02:14:22.020
Yes.

1570
02:14:25.410 --> 02:14:31.140
Adam Krug: I, too, would like to try to look into counseling 12 step programs.

1571
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:37.410
Adam Krug: That's I think beneficially that has helped

1572
02:14:37.590 --> 02:14:39.870
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you mean for alcohol or just for this.

1573
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.740
Adam Krug: For for for alcohol with

1574
02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:44.550
Adam Krug: The family.

1575
02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:45.720
Dr Jameson: Kind of thing.

1576
02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:50.730
Adam Krug: And so also within my situation. I think it could it could apply

1577
02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:52.200
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

1578
02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:55.650
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, but your dad is in in recovery.

1579
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:57.720
Dr Jameson: And you

1580
02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:00.930
Dr Jameson: Haven't been drinking in the past or no.

1581
02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.630
Adam Krug: No like

1582
02:15:04.890 --> 02:15:06.360
Adam Krug: I've had drinks.

1583
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:14.490
Dr Jameson: But it's hasn't been a problem that I asked you and that's what you'd said before, so I just want to double check. I didn't have something and anybody else in the family.

1584
02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:18.720
Adam Krug: Oh, not that I can think of.

1585
02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:28.320
Dr Jameson: Okay. Yeah. Okay, the mom's been fine. And how about like uncles or grandparents on anybody else in your dad's family that's

1586
02:15:32.730 --> 02:15:33.960
Adam Krug: All I guess, actually.

1587
02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.440
Adam Krug: Maybe late

1588
02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:41.190
Adam Krug: Great.

1589
02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:45.600
Adam Krug: To see grandparents.

1590
02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:48.900
Adam Krug: Drink a lot. Yeah.

1591
02:15:51.330 --> 02:15:52.170
Dr Jameson: It's not unusual.

1592
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:59.910
Dr Jameson: Ok so so paternal grandparents. Was it just okay well anyway.

1593
02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:01.170
Adam Krug: Full sides.

1594
02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:03.540
Dr Jameson: Oh, both sides. Okay.

1595
02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:06.300
Adam Krug: Yeah, I just retired and think

1596
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:10.860
Dr Jameson: I forgot. Okay. Both sides with alcohol.

1597
02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:14.310
Adam Krug: Both yeah both grandparents.

1598
02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:21.960
Dr Jameson: With up all problem. Okay. All right. And you know, I mean, sometimes there is genetic.

1599
02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:25.230
Dr Jameson: It's not always genetic, but it can

1600
02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:27.600
Adam Krug: I think it. Yeah, it's probably a

1601
02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:33.930
Dr Jameson: Plays a piece anyway. Yeah, I think some of us have more receptors that are easier to

1602
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:39.720
Dr Jameson: Change their set points than others. Some people, you know, are much more sort of

1603
02:16:41.130 --> 02:16:46.260
Dr Jameson: Stable or whatever. I don't know if that's not the right word, but the receptors. I'm talking about night the person

1604
02:16:47.010 --> 02:16:59.130
Dr Jameson: That you know we're more, some of us are more susceptible than others. Just because of our chemistry and how we're how we're built obviously environmental things also play a role. Not all one or the other, but okay so

1605
02:17:00.690 --> 02:17:08.670
Dr Jameson: I was going to ask you some questions about you've mentioned being struck more than one time. Is it, are you able to answer questions like that right now.

1606
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:16.170
Adam Krug: Um, no, but I think I could talk more. Over. Over. Sure.

1607
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:31.530
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Okay, so we'll leave that where it is for now but I definitely, I want to make sure you're safe now. First of all, and second of all, I mean, that sounds like it might be playing a role in in in this whole entire sort of, you know,

1608
02:17:31.950 --> 02:17:34.080
Dr Jameson: Packages as far as where we've gone

1609
02:17:34.650 --> 02:17:38.310
Adam Krug: It will, it was, it was a past X struck me

1610
02:17:39.390 --> 02:17:41.460
Adam Krug: But in that, in that instance

1611
02:17:43.650 --> 02:17:44.010
Adam Krug: Yeah.

1612
02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:50.190
Dr Jameson: Um, okay. So, but that's not somebody that you have any contact with now.

1613
02:17:50.490 --> 02:17:51.510
Adam Krug: Yes. Okay.

1614
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:52.890
Dr Jameson: Was there any was it

1615
02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:55.290
Dr Jameson: I mean, I just told her I wouldn't ask

1616
02:17:56.820 --> 02:18:02.730
Dr Jameson: So, are there more than one partner that was abusive, in your experience, or just that one.

1617
02:18:05.670 --> 02:18:09.990
Adam Krug: I'm really just that, that one especially physically. Yes.

1618
02:18:11.550 --> 02:18:13.950
Dr Jameson: And how it's been how long since you have been

1619
02:18:15.090 --> 02:18:15.570
Dr Jameson: X.

1620
02:18:16.530 --> 02:18:18.960
Adam Krug: Oh, like two months.

1621
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:20.100
Dr Jameson: So pretty recent.

1622
02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:21.270
Adam Krug: Yeah, okay.

1623
02:18:21.630 --> 02:18:23.550
Dr Jameson: And that wasn't How long was that relationship.

1624
02:18:26.310 --> 02:18:28.080
Adam Krug: By year. OK.

1625
02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:30.000
OK.

1626
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:38.340
Dr Jameson: OK. So previously, and any other trying to ask yes or no questions. Any other

1627
02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:46.470
Dr Jameson: Like where you any other physical abuse in your life by any like

1628
02:18:48.510 --> 02:18:49.470
Dr Jameson: Just this partner.

1629
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:52.470
Adam Krug: Others.

1630
02:18:52.530 --> 02:18:53.520
Adam Krug: Others. Okay.

1631
02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:54.090
Okay.

1632
02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.030
Dr Jameson: I like I said, We'll wait till you're in a

1633
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:58.800
Adam Krug: private place to

1634
02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:02.580
Dr Jameson: Get into details. Okay, but you're feeling you feel safe currently

1635
02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:03.720
Yes.

1636
02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:05.970
Dr Jameson: I'm glad to hear that.

1637
02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:12.690
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um,

1638
02:19:14.910 --> 02:19:24.870
Dr Jameson: I have to say I'm not entirely. I've never transition someone specifically from pregabalin to Suboxone. So this is a little bit of a new new one for me.

1639
02:19:25.530 --> 02:19:32.700
Dr Jameson: It sounds similar and I have done like you know somebody was using them. And anyway, so it's okay. I'm just being

1640
02:19:33.390 --> 02:19:43.050
Dr Jameson: fully honest with you, I'm usually we want people to wait a certain amount of time after they use whatever the substance is and I'm not sure what to tell you on the Lyrica because

1641
02:19:43.530 --> 02:19:55.800
Dr Jameson: I haven't come across this the general rule of thumb is that you need to. Unfortunately we do have the one drawback of Suboxone is or buprenorphine is that you need to enter into withdrawal and be feeling

1642
02:19:57.270 --> 02:20:03.330
Dr Jameson: Significantly uncomfortable. Before we introduce the buprenorphine for the first initial dose.

1643
02:20:04.650 --> 02:20:17.460
Dr Jameson: And I, you seem like you're someone that has, you know, done a lot of research. So what before I launch into a whole lecture about stuff you already know. Tell me, give me a just an idea of what you already know about the buprenorphine.

1644
02:20:18.570 --> 02:20:22.470
Adam Krug: Um, I am just too familiar with it is

1645
02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:24.660
Adam Krug: A

1646
02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:32.790
Adam Krug: And globally. That really is pain and can also be used to

1647
02:20:34.170 --> 02:20:39.720
Adam Krug: Help people taper off of addictions or dependencies. At the same time, with

1648
02:20:40.770 --> 02:20:42.330
Adam Krug: In terms of the buprenorphine.

1649
02:20:43.530 --> 02:20:45.450
Adam Krug: Be printing print nor she yes

1650
02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:53.580
Adam Krug: Yeah, but I'm also. Lastly, I guess. But in terms of the

1651
02:20:54.720 --> 02:21:00.810
Adam Krug: PR gambling. That seems to take about like a

1652
02:21:01.890 --> 02:21:11.790
Adam Krug: Lot when by late later says seem to start to feel it, then it seems like a day and a half his rule of thumb for minutes out of your system, but um

1653
02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:26.250
Dr Jameson: But yeah, I was gonna ask you to help me, help me with that because, yeah. Um, okay. So as far as how the buprenorphine works are you, I want to make sure you understand it. But if you already do then.

1654
02:21:26.910 --> 02:21:27.390
Oh,

1655
02:21:29.430 --> 02:21:31.710
Adam Krug: Thank you for asking, and

1656
02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:37.890
Adam Krug: As far as I know, it can come in different forms like

1657
02:21:39.570 --> 02:21:40.440
Adam Krug: A

1658
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:42.750
Dr Jameson: Tablet. There's a film. Yeah.

1659
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:52.080
Dr Jameson: So the way that it works. You were right. So, and it has to be absorbed. It's a kind of a unique medication, it's absorbed through your

1660
02:21:52.500 --> 02:22:02.850
Dr Jameson: mucosal membrane. So that's why they have these things that you have to dissolve in your mouth and try not to actually swallow the medicine let sit there and be absorbed through the, through the

1661
02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:09.780
Dr Jameson: Usually the bottom of your, your mouth is keep some is a roof but but the base of church underneath, you're done.

1662
02:22:11.250 --> 02:22:22.410
Dr Jameson: If it gets swallowed into your stomach. It does not get absorbed nearly as well. So that's it's kind of like I said it's a little bit unique, but the way that it works in your brain.

1663
02:22:23.250 --> 02:22:36.390
Dr Jameson: You know, we have different receptors and there's different opioid even receptors. Some subtypes. Some of those receptors are the ones that cause euphoria some make you sleepy. And if you really activate those that receptor.

1664
02:22:36.690 --> 02:22:48.300
Dr Jameson: To pass out. And then eventually stopped breathing. If it's really, really turned on. There are other receptors that deal with pain. And then there's receptors that deal with some of these other physical constipation and

1665
02:22:51.210 --> 02:23:01.260
Dr Jameson: Nausea, Vomiting appetite. The hot but apparently it affects your temperature regulation, right, because people always feel weird when they take take away the opioids, but the hot and the cold.

1666
02:23:01.770 --> 02:23:07.260
Dr Jameson: And the restlessness and those sorts of things. So the way that the buprenorphine works is it's sort of

1667
02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:21.840
Dr Jameson: It turns on some of those receptors and it blocks or turns off some of the, some of them so they designed it specifically so that it turns off the receptors that can make you overdose. So it's relatively safe that it doesn't really

1668
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:27.930
Dr Jameson: It goes in that receptor, but then it kind of blocks things from from being in there and turns it off.

1669
02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:38.730
Dr Jameson: Then it goes into the receptors that do the physical things and turns those on so that you feel it makes your physical withdrawal symptoms.

1670
02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:40.770
Dr Jameson: Go away.

1671
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:42.330
Dr Jameson: So,

1672
02:23:44.490 --> 02:23:56.490
Dr Jameson: It blocks, also in the sense. So on a different level. It also blocks. Because once it's in the receptor. It sticks in there. We call it has a very strong affinity

1673
02:23:56.940 --> 02:24:05.550
Dr Jameson: So it's like binds very tightly to these receptors and it's almost impossible to get it out until it wears off on its own in its own time.

1674
02:24:07.170 --> 02:24:16.290
Dr Jameson: So that means that if somebody is also prescribed by getting by their dentist or decides to go take a hit of whatever

1675
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:34.590
Dr Jameson: They can you can put another opiate in your system, but the receptors are all filled up and you know other opiate just kind of has nowhere to go and filters out and that it doesn't do anything. So, it blocks in that sense.

1676
02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:36.210
Dr Jameson: As well.

1677
02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:50.010
Dr Jameson: It pushes other opiates out as well. So that's the reason why it's important we wait until you're already in withdrawal, because if we introduce the Suboxone buprenorphine.

1678
02:24:50.610 --> 02:25:07.740
Dr Jameson: Bile you have other opiates in your system in your in the receptors. The buprenorphine will come in and push them out and then stick. So now you suddenly go into this terrible withdrawal and there's nothing we can do until

1679
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:26.910
Dr Jameson: Time wears off in the end the it creates it's just very, very uncomfortable for people. So we want to make sure that you're we want to kind of come in when the, when the receptors are reasonably empty and fill them up instead of knocking something else out. Does that make sense.

1680
02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:33.810
Adam Krug: Yeah, and thank you, I appreciate the new info. Luckily,

1681
02:25:36.270 --> 02:25:44.370
Adam Krug: Consider per Gamblin to be your average IQ and there are no, no, it's okay, it's my system.

1682
02:25:46.590 --> 02:25:46.860
Adam Krug: Just

1683
02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:50.280
Dr Jameson: I think just to be on the safe side because even though it's

1684
02:25:50.430 --> 02:25:55.530
Dr Jameson: If you're right, it's a Gabba it mostly hits the GABA receptor.

1685
02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:05.820
Dr Jameson: I would just because the symptoms you experience are so similar to an opioid withdrawal. I'm concerned that it might also be in your case.

1686
02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:13.710
Dr Jameson: Somehow partially activating some of those opioid receptors, also in some way. There's sometimes it's like a cross reactivity and I

1687
02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:20.400
Dr Jameson: I just don't want to find out the hard way. But, oh, I guess it did have some hope you know I'm saying, like, you don't want you to be

1688
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:36.000
Dr Jameson: puking your guts out for the next 12 hours or something. So I would I would I would strongly encourage and I'm happy to send like some other you know anti his there's some other minor medications we can try to use in the meantime to kind of

1689
02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:40.020
Dr Jameson: Address uncomfortable symptoms.

1690
02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:54.960
Dr Jameson: Until sounds like maybe tomorrow afternoon or night would probably be if you don't take any more pregabalin would probably be the safest time to actually take your first dose of the buprenorphine.

1691
02:26:57.330 --> 02:26:57.840
Dr Jameson: So,

1692
02:26:59.790 --> 02:27:10.830
Dr Jameson: It sounds like sleep might be an issue and anxiety in general would be the target. The target symptoms. Okay, so we'll come back to that. So, um,

1693
02:27:11.490 --> 02:27:25.650
Dr Jameson: I just want to the other subject. Is this the structure of our program in general they. I don't think they generally explain too much about that. Two guys so I tend to go through that as well.

1694
02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:41.880
Dr Jameson: Which is that we have weekly groups where is which is where the prescriptions are generally I mean today my prescription, but then going forward you you'd have a visit with me in concert with a group

1695
02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:51.810
Dr Jameson: Counselor, and I mean the interaction with me is like you need a refill is your bills. Okay. You know, it's not a in depth like

1696
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:56.910
Dr Jameson: Medical discussion because there are other people sitting there, so

1697
02:27:58.170 --> 02:28:09.330
Dr Jameson: But that's how that's how we structure it so we start out with very short prescriptions like days worth of medication. And then as you attend groups and then

1698
02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:18.030
Dr Jameson: There's other other pieces. But we start to extend the prescription duration to a whole week. And then after a few months.

1699
02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:30.030
Dr Jameson: All things working as as according to plan, two weeks at a time prescriptions and eventually like six months and usually something like that when things are getting really stable and

1700
02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:34.110
Dr Jameson: You know, we're making progress as far as some of

1701
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:45.630
Dr Jameson: The counseling and some of that kind of stuff, then we can potentially be prescribing it a month at a time, just like you would with any other medication usually

1702
02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:55.020
Dr Jameson: The groups meet weekly even if you're getting a prescription for more or less time than that. But you still come to group every week.

1703
02:28:55.590 --> 02:29:06.510
Dr Jameson: Sometimes eventually again oh well into the future, we we graduate people to come into group every other week, but that takes you know that's after a good while.

1704
02:29:07.050 --> 02:29:19.080
Dr Jameson: What we do at the group's besides me ready for people is talk about like recovery skills relapse prevention. It's not like per se. A 12 STEP program.

1705
02:29:20.130 --> 02:29:27.720
Dr Jameson: We do usually recommend people also do 12 step programs, but we're we kind of work on a little bit of a

1706
02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:36.960
Dr Jameson: We talk more about stress management and coping skills and those kinds of subjects.

1707
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:52.320
Dr Jameson: These days, there are actually a ton of them. I mean, there were before, but now there's even more online 12 step meeting program type things because of the covert so we can give you some references or resources for that.

1708
02:29:53.820 --> 02:30:00.360
Dr Jameson: And we do usually recommend people are having at least two or three other meetings a week in between the weekly groups with us.

1709
02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:04.380
Adam Krug: Great, if you could send data sources.

1710
02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:07.860
Dr Jameson: Sore um, do you have a pen. I can give you some right the second

1711
02:30:08.580 --> 02:30:10.140
Adam Krug: I actually do. Yeah, thanks.

1712
02:30:11.430 --> 02:30:11.850
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1713
02:30:14.160 --> 02:30:15.780
Adam Krug: Thank you. Whenever you're ready.

1714
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:21.180
Dr Jameson: Okay, so there's a website called in the rooms, all one word.

1715
02:30:22.590 --> 02:30:28.830
Dr Jameson: You just Google that. And you can enter you can create an account and it asks you, your local area at one point.

1716
02:30:29.250 --> 02:30:39.720
Dr Jameson: Back in the old days, and people had actual local live meetings, it will it will list like these are the meetings in your area and then they have subtypes like

1717
02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:50.730
Dr Jameson: I checked it out where I live in Florida, but I put in my my zip code and what came up for me was like, first there was, and they I'm sure they self. They gave themselves these names, but it was something like silver

1718
02:30:51.480 --> 02:31:00.330
Dr Jameson: Something like obviously was more older folks right and then there was an LGBT group. And there's a all women group. And then there's the

1719
02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:06.630
Dr Jameson: Yeah, anyway, they have separate like kind of sub groups to to help you kind of find your peeps, a little easier.

1720
02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:16.950
Dr Jameson: And then, and you sometimes have to go to a number of them until you kind of find the group that seems like it fits best with your sort of life experience and approach and stuff like that.

1721
02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:27.030
Dr Jameson: Now they're doing them on. They do have online groups. They always have some so they also have them ongoing I think all the time. And so you can just kind of

1722
02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:31.710
Dr Jameson: Go down the hallway and find the room that looks like.

1723
02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:43.050
Dr Jameson: A good fit. And you can just sit and listen. They have somewhere. It's like all chat based and then they have some that are video live like this is so there's a variety of different kind of options there.

1724
02:31:43.980 --> 02:31:52.170
Dr Jameson: Now if you go. The other thing to write down as a 24 seven. I think they call it, but I think if you just go to the A site.

1725
02:31:53.490 --> 02:32:02.490
Dr Jameson: They'll probably see something about the online groups now they've kind of had to make a lot of their groups online and obviously na

1726
02:32:03.810 --> 02:32:18.090
Dr Jameson: The in the rooms will have both an A and na in there. And in case you wonder, there's a very big overlap in the 12 steps are kind of the 12 steps. It doesn't really matter what the drug of choice was it's mostly

1727
02:32:18.810 --> 02:32:33.870
Dr Jameson: The steps are still the steps. So sometimes people who are really opiate addicts end up in a meeting, assuming the people in the meeting. Don't judge them because sometimes what happens. Oh, well, we were just alcoholics. We weren't heroin addicts or whatever, you know, sometimes you get

1728
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:35.070
Dr Jameson: Though so

1729
02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:48.570
Dr Jameson: Sometimes you have to like I said you have to kind of move around, but either one is applicable, even if you're not an alcoholic technically alcohol wasn't your drug of choice. The A meetings are probably, you know, still very relevant.

1730
02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:51.870
Dr Jameson: So those are two online.

1731
02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:58.050
Dr Jameson: Meeting types of things. Are you religious is religion, a

1732
02:32:59.550 --> 02:33:00.600
Part of so

1733
02:33:03.210 --> 02:33:03.810
Adam Krug: Let's say I'm really

1734
02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:05.670
Adam Krug: Not really.

1735
02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:06.180
Adam Krug: Okay.

1736
02:33:06.450 --> 02:33:13.800
Dr Jameson: I'm only because there are some that are more faith based so if if that's not. I mean, they all talk about a higher power, but it's really more

1737
02:33:14.370 --> 02:33:23.460
Dr Jameson: Of a spiritual thing than a, you know, super duper strong religious Tom. But there's something called Celebrate Recovery, which I believe is more faith based naming. It's like

1738
02:33:24.930 --> 02:33:35.460
Dr Jameson: And then the another app that I would like you to download before your first group is called insight I N si GH t

1739
02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:38.580
Dr Jameson: Second name is

1740
02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:46.950
Dr Jameson: The second word is timer. I don't know why they named it that, but that's the name that is free and it's full of

1741
02:33:48.000 --> 02:34:02.460
Dr Jameson: They have an upgraded version that has even more stuff like courses and stuff. So you might find you wanted to purchase it, but the plane when that's not paid for has, like, I don't know how many 10s of thousands of different meditations and

1742
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:13.740
Dr Jameson: Relaxing music and little talks about different sub like Buddhist ideas. Anyway, just a ton of stuff all about different mental health.

1743
02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:24.600
Dr Jameson: Coping with loss grief anger self esteem eating problem. I mean, everything you can search in there and come up with more things. And you can even begin to get to

1744
02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:32.940
Dr Jameson: So I think that's a we recommend that a lot for people who, if you're in the moment of feeling like a panic attack or can't sleep or

1745
02:34:33.210 --> 02:34:43.830
Dr Jameson: Something comes up and is bothering you. This is a good resource to go sit in a quiet place for 10 minutes and play your play your meditation and do your breathing and kind of help calm yourself down.

1746
02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:52.890
Dr Jameson: So that's also, I think, a very rich resource. And I don't know why it's even free because it's so it's really good. So

1747
02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:57.030
Dr Jameson: So those are a couple of different resources.

1748
02:34:58.470 --> 02:35:07.080
Dr Jameson: In addition to the weekly group, you'll have an initial set of bloodwork that they get you sort of a plan on how that's gonna happen.

1749
02:35:09.330 --> 02:35:17.850
Adam Krug: Not to my knowledge. I, I did hear about diagnostics Quest Diagnostics within 1.2 miles. But yes, yes.

1750
02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:26.160
Dr Jameson: So that's where they want you to go then. Because that's often we usually use quest. Usually what that they typically they send

1751
02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:31.260
Dr Jameson: Orders electronically, I guess, to the to the lab.

1752
02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:34.170
Dr Jameson: And they are in here, sent

1753
02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:36.510
Dr Jameson: On 510

1754
02:35:37.530 --> 02:35:51.900
Dr Jameson: So what I would suggest if there's any way you could actually just get those done and out of the way, between now and your first group that would really be my preference, because I find this if it doesn't happen in the first week or two.

1755
02:35:52.890 --> 02:36:00.420
Dr Jameson: It's like people just don't do it at all. And we really, we do want to have a baseline. What we're, what we're checking is sort of baseline.

1756
02:36:00.810 --> 02:36:10.110
Dr Jameson: kidney and liver functions. Make sure everything in your body is working right before we're giving you too much medicine that you might not metabolize right or something and then we screen.

1757
02:36:10.830 --> 02:36:21.330
Dr Jameson: Which probably isn't really relevant for you that much but never, never bad to get screened for hepatitis and HIV and stuff like stuff that you could potentially somebody who was injecting especially

1758
02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:31.890
Dr Jameson: Along the way, could have picked up so we screen for those two and then you do a urine, which shows, whatever. It shows it's not expected to be, you know,

1759
02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:47.040
Dr Jameson: A plus or whatever. It's just the kind of, you know, see where we're starting from. Basically, so there's no reason to fear if there might be something coming up in your urine, we're not, we don't. In general, even

1760
02:36:48.330 --> 02:36:57.780
Dr Jameson: At any point, we're not really a punitive kind of program, we're really focusing what we call harm reduction. So we're just doing whatever you know

1761
02:36:58.830 --> 02:37:10.500
Dr Jameson: Trying to help make the likelihood of relapse as low as possible and improve the chances for long term successful recovery. So sobriety.

1762
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:31.050
Dr Jameson: So we understand, not that I don't want to say, Oh, don't worry, it's no big deal. Like I we we hope for, you know, appropriate, as I say, appropriate or expected urine drug results. But if something shows up that we were hoping not to see. We don't kick people out or

1763
02:37:32.490 --> 02:37:41.670
Dr Jameson: You know, I'm probably going to ask to meet with you individually. Let's talk about it. I'd like to know what was going on. What happened, what's what's what's going on. Are you okay

1764
02:37:42.090 --> 02:37:52.530
Dr Jameson: And then what have you figured like what did you learn about, you know, this process, what did you learn from that experience, you know, what can we work on to change for the next time you're feeling

1765
02:37:53.040 --> 02:38:04.680
Dr Jameson: Those ideas. Ideas are entering your, your head, that kind of thing. So there's no reason to delay the medic the labs, because you don't want us to see something it doesn't

1766
02:38:05.430 --> 02:38:14.640
Dr Jameson: It's fine, doesn't matter. It's actually rather know whatever else is whatever is in there will kind of like know about it, obviously will expect to see

1767
02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:16.470
Dr Jameson: THC.

1768
02:38:17.970 --> 02:38:39.840
Dr Jameson: And we don't people ask me that question to we, you know, it's very in a perfect world, I'd love people to all sort of live in a fully present on that, you know, altered state, but it's legal in some states now so I mean we can't, we can't. We don't. Anyway, I guess we could, but we don't

1769
02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:45.060
Dr Jameson: Absolutely forbid or ban it or I mean

1770
02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:52.260
Dr Jameson: So that will, you know, I have patients that test positive for THC every month, along with their buprenorphine.

1771
02:38:53.730 --> 02:38:54.240
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1772
02:38:55.530 --> 02:39:06.060
Dr Jameson: Well, you know, we can we can work with it. It's again, ideally, if we can get this feeling better and and anxieties, sort of, well controlled and

1773
02:39:06.930 --> 02:39:18.540
Dr Jameson: coping skills in, you know, kind of bolstered maybe don't feel the need at some point to use that, which would be great. So that's kind of where we how we approach that in case you were wondering.

1774
02:39:19.290 --> 02:39:20.010
Adam Krug: Thank you.

1775
02:39:22.050 --> 02:39:32.820
Dr Jameson: So, initial labs. So what I would suggest, if you want to write it on your on your paper there is to find that quest on your Google or whatever, call them.

1776
02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:45.510
Dr Jameson: Ask them, did they said they sent an order for me is it in your system and make sure that it is before you schlep down there and make an appointment and then go and sit there and wait and then they tell you we don't have any order for you.

1777
02:39:46.770 --> 02:40:00.240
Dr Jameson: It should be there. But sometimes things don't go as expected. So if they don't see an order for you then go back to virtual clinic and explain. Okay. Well, the lab didn't get my order. What should we do

1778
02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:07.050
Dr Jameson: And whether they can email it to you and you can carry it to them or they can send it again and confirm by phone that they receive it.

1779
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:13.350
Dr Jameson: But I would do that. I would do that before you go down there just to save yourself frustration.

1780
02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:21.690
Dr Jameson: And then at that point if they have it. You can either schedule an appointment or any way you can figure out when the best time to go to the lab is

1781
02:40:23.370 --> 02:40:41.940
Dr Jameson: I need to look you up. I forgot to look you up in the there's a database that all pharmacies have to report anytime they feel any kind of controlled substance for any patients they they put it in here and we are mandated to be checking, Matt.

1782
02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:45.690
Dr Jameson: All right, are you, is it June 29 99

1783
02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:47.250
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay.

1784
02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:50.220
Dr Jameson: Okay, making me feel old.

1785
02:40:53.730 --> 02:40:55.920
Adam Krug: Very young, young ish

1786
02:40:57.090 --> 02:40:58.170
Adam Krug: Quarter life.

1787
02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:08.100
Dr Jameson: Alright, so it does not Joel shy but I'm here because I don't know. I put I put Jill instead of bad. Okay, try again. That's why nothing came up

1788
02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:10.920
Dr Jameson: I think that was my last patients first

1789
02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:14.100
Dr Jameson: Okay, there you are.

1790
02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:19.650
Dr Jameson: Oh, and they can they can tell me about Arizona to. Interesting. OK.

1791
02:41:20.730 --> 02:41:32.760
Dr Jameson: OK, so I'm unless includes you're saying you know it does include the javelin, and the decks drolma amphetamines, there will consider control. So they show up in here too. Okay.

1792
02:41:34.650 --> 02:41:40.560
Dr Jameson: Everything as as expected. I think no surprises there. So, but I have to check that before I send the fish. Okay.

1793
02:41:41.070 --> 02:41:42.300
Dr Jameson: Good. Um,

1794
02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:43.320
So,

1795
02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:52.680
Dr Jameson: I'm jumping all around. Sorry. The other piece, besides the labs and the weekly group, we need to pick a group for you.

1796
02:41:55.860 --> 02:41:59.040
Dr Jameson: What's your day like on Wednesdays generally

1797
02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:09.840
Adam Krug: Well as of right now, it should be free by our schedule is flexible as class just kind of finished.

1798
02:42:10.830 --> 02:42:12.120
Dr Jameson: Okay, is

1799
02:42:13.950 --> 02:42:16.140
Dr Jameson: noon on Wednesday doable.

1800
02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:23.040
Adam Krug: It's doable. Uh, maybe like two days later might be nice.

1801
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:27.000
Dr Jameson: Otherwise, it's okay. Yeah, I have a 10:30am and noon.

1802
02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:29.520
Dr Jameson: Noon.

1803
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.900
Dr Jameson: OK.

1804
02:42:32.190 --> 02:42:45.810
Dr Jameson: OK, so that will be Wednesday and if you have a calendar and your phone, I would very strongly encourage you to put it in there and set alarms for like an hour ahead or something so that you're awake and

1805
02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:53.010
Dr Jameson: We, we need people checking in, usually because there can be everybody checking in at once that can get backed up.

1806
02:42:53.940 --> 02:43:07.950
Dr Jameson: So we typically typically ask people to start checking in about half an hour before it actually starts to make sure you're all everything's if you have to wait and then they have to go through stuff that you're actually ready at the time group starts

1807
02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:17.070
Dr Jameson: So that would mean if you put it in for your phone for 1130 then you're safe you know I'm saying

1808
02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:18.120
Yeah.

1809
02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:21.630
Dr Jameson: What time do you usually wake up.

1810
02:43:22.470 --> 02:43:27.450
Adam Krug: Um, it depends on my schedule. But as of right now.

1811
02:43:29.130 --> 02:43:30.810
Adam Krug: Around 10am

1812
02:43:31.050 --> 02:43:35.070
Dr Jameson: Okay, so at least you're not at risk of sleeping way through it.

1813
02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:37.500
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

1814
02:43:40.350 --> 02:43:46.800
Dr Jameson: If it turns out that it's really not working as a time like you really need something later. I don't have anything later.

1815
02:43:47.610 --> 02:43:56.670
Dr Jameson: And I, I just have my groups on Wednesdays. But there are other than a bunch of other doctors and all different times. So we can always transfer you to some different time that works better for you.

1816
02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:00.030
Adam Krug: Thank you. Chicken short

1817
02:44:02.370 --> 02:44:06.540
Dr Jameson: They will also the, oh, the other section or pop

1818
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:24.450
Dr Jameson: Piece of our program is individual counseling. So we do the groups to talk about general general things like how to calm yourself down. And what what are the stages of relapse and how can you identify what when you're at risk for relaxing and making plans for what you're going to do.

1819
02:44:26.460 --> 02:44:34.560
Dr Jameson: We also ask people to meet with counselors individually to go through some of their other maybe more personal.

1820
02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:40.890
Dr Jameson: You know, things that that you probably don't need to talk about or want to talk about in a group.

1821
02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:51.900
Dr Jameson: That are probably playing roles in some of how we've gotten where we're at. And that's usually the anxieties and maybe PTSD. If it, if it's, if applicable, and

1822
02:44:52.410 --> 02:45:04.080
Dr Jameson: You know, dealing with difficult relationships or whatever, like stuff that's happened to you in the past that, that hasn't really been fully like processed and healed from that kind of stuff.

1823
02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:15.780
Dr Jameson: So we do an initial assessment which they refer to as a bio psychosocial. It's a very long mouthful but you meet with a counselor, they ask you a bunch of questions.

1824
02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:24.180
Dr Jameson: And then based on that they come up with a recommendation for okay you need to meet with a counselor every day. No, just kidding.

1825
02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:34.980
Dr Jameson: Twice a week, once a week, every other week, whatever they you know what what depending on how many different things. They, they kind of identify that they probably need to help work with you on

1826
02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:46.170
Dr Jameson: And then that will be happening kind of in parallel to the group visits. You'll also be meeting periodically with the individual counselor to do some some more kind of

1827
02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:49.260
Dr Jameson: You know, in depth kind of stuff.

1828
02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:51.390
Dr Jameson: Um,

1829
02:45:52.830 --> 02:45:53.640
Dr Jameson: Any questions for that.

1830
02:45:57.210 --> 02:45:59.580
Adam Krug: Don't think so but I appreciate a meaningful.

1831
02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:01.620
Dr Jameson: You're very polite.

1832
02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:08.760
Dr Jameson: And then you have your headphones on. So it shouldn't be an issue. But we do require headphones for group for

1833
02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:20.220
Dr Jameson: privacy reasons, like for example your dad's on the back. I can't see you, but maybe somebody your friend somebody sitting in the room, how we can't tell that people are sharing personal information.

1834
02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:33.690
Dr Jameson: In this case, it's just me and you. So I don't, I wouldn't have cared anyway but but now, other people are sharing their personal stuff we need it to be confidential so I'm glad you have headphones. Make sure you have them when you come to group.

1835
02:46:35.070 --> 02:46:46.020
Dr Jameson: You don't while you babe, I guess we ask people not to be inhaling anything during group, either because that's distracting and triggers for people that are trying to quit.

1836
02:46:46.830 --> 02:47:01.950
Dr Jameson: We asked people to be sober when they come to not to come to group under the influence. And ideally, is the perfect like in a quiet place where there aren't a lot of distractions, so that there's a lot of background noise and that kind of stuff.

1837
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:12.480
Dr Jameson: We will be gentle with you when you first start attending groups, we don't we don't put people on the spot.

1838
02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:18.660
Dr Jameson: We may invite you, if you want to participate, but you're not going to be forced to

1839
02:47:20.490 --> 02:47:35.250
Dr Jameson: You know, do too much talking in the first few weeks, we get it. Like you might just want to listen along for a while you're welcome to participate more actively at first. If you are comfortable, but, you know, we may john is the counts or he may ask if you want to

1840
02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:48.990
Dr Jameson: If you have anything to add, but you can 100% say no, not really. Not sure. Next week I'll maybe, you know, I don't know. Come back to me. You know, you can totally defer. That's fine.

1841
02:47:50.100 --> 02:47:55.440
Dr Jameson: We do finish every week. It's always the same. We go around and everybody says something they're grateful for.

1842
02:47:56.430 --> 02:48:07.560
Dr Jameson: So I think we probably would ask you to answer that question. But other than that, I always let people know ahead of time so you can be prepared. You're not caught off guard. So you can

1843
02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:09.540
Dr Jameson: You can

1844
02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:13.320
Dr Jameson: Decide what you want to say beforehand if you want to

1845
02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:18.300
Dr Jameson: That's kind of the way that group works.

1846
02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:29.100
Dr Jameson: You started the virtual clinic to check in and then they'll make sure everything's all squared, whatever they need to make sure it's all set and then

1847
02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:41.910
Dr Jameson: They give you this email or text you I guess the meeting ID code which changes every week. So you really do have to go through the virtual clinic. You can't just try to put in the last week's ID number because it won't work.

1848
02:48:43.140 --> 02:48:43.740
Dr Jameson: Just so you know.

1849
02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:47.130
Dr Jameson: Thank you. Um, and then

1850
02:48:49.410 --> 02:48:56.610
Dr Jameson: I think, you know, as far as dosing goes you know there's sort of, I think we probably should.

1851
02:48:57.900 --> 02:49:03.810
Dr Jameson: First of all, I think you should really try to wait as long as you can until you're really feeling

1852
02:49:04.830 --> 02:49:10.710
Dr Jameson: as uncomfortable as you can stand to feel before you take the first dose. As we explained

1853
02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:20.070
Dr Jameson: But as far as dosing goes and you've never tried it. I know a lot of times people have purchased it themselves from

1854
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:21.780
Adam Krug: I've never tried to

1855
02:49:23.130 --> 02:49:23.340
Adam Krug: Okay.

1856
02:49:24.180 --> 02:49:28.470
Dr Jameson: I'm just checking. So way for me to cheat on the dose.

1857
02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:34.020
Dr Jameson: People sometimes have already tried it. Um, do you have insurance.

1858
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:35.250
Adam Krug: If you

1859
02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:36.990
Dr Jameson: Is it

1860
02:49:38.310 --> 02:49:39.930
Dr Jameson: Private insurance or medical or

1861
02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:45.660
Adam Krug: I'm done with a PPO you shield. Yeah.

1862
02:49:45.690 --> 02:49:46.500
Dr Jameson: Okay, I just

1863
02:49:46.770 --> 02:49:48.060
Dr Jameson: Want so

1864
02:49:49.290 --> 02:50:01.800
Dr Jameson: Most insurances want the generic almost always but medical it has, they must have signed, they must have some deal with the company that makes brand name Suboxone they require the brand name only prescription. That's the only reason I'm asking

1865
02:50:03.810 --> 02:50:06.390
Dr Jameson: It comes in tablets and films.

1866
02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:19.890
Dr Jameson: The tablets are more inexpensive. So often the insurance companies prefer that one. There's not a difference as far as what's the ingredients of the medication, but obviously tablets are thicker.

1867
02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:30.480
Dr Jameson: chalky things and slip, you know, films or films. So some people don't like the taste of one compared to the other. Sometimes we try one and then try the other one. And see, but

1868
02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:31.950
Dr Jameson: I would

1869
02:50:33.180 --> 02:50:41.250
Dr Jameson: Be inclined to write for the tablet at first because a lot of times insurance will say no, you have to do the tablets, because it's cheaper.

1870
02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:49.620
Dr Jameson: But I don't really. I don't care. Whichever one which one you so do you, do you have a sense of which one you would prefer

1871
02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:54.180
Adam Krug: Um, so this is speaking about the buprenorphine.

1872
02:50:55.800 --> 02:51:03.570
Adam Krug: Is there a difference in how the medication is being gives or like a duration was

1873
02:51:03.930 --> 02:51:04.440
Um,

1874
02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:14.700
Dr Jameson: There is not supposed to be. I just had a guy tell me my last call that he found the tablets didn't work as well for him. It seemed compared to the strips.

1875
02:51:15.270 --> 02:51:22.110
Dr Jameson: He was also buying them off the streets. So whether they were really Suboxone. I don't know if that's really what they were, you know, I don't know.

1876
02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:37.020
Dr Jameson: I have some people don't like the taste of the films they find them really gross. And then other people prefer the films and don't like the taste of the tablet. So I think it's it's really an individual thing but know that it's not supposed to be any different.

1877
02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:43.620
Adam Krug: Um I to well i i'm not even thinking about it. As you can see, but I

1878
02:51:44.670 --> 02:51:50.700
Adam Krug: Like more inclined to prefer the films, but is the film going to be like 40 bucks kind of our covered or

1879
02:51:50.730 --> 02:51:59.670
Dr Jameson: Um, well, what I would say is if they say they won't pay for it will will substitute it with with with the tablet.

1880
02:52:00.690 --> 02:52:05.700
Dr Jameson: You know, I'll put okay to substitute. So if that's if that's their if that's their

1881
02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:18.690
Dr Jameson: You know requirement or that's what they want, then we'll, we'll try it anyway. And then if it bothers you, at least we have a reason why we want to ask them to pay for the thing that they said they didn't want to pay for

1882
02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:30.810
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we'll start with the film. And what I would like you to do because because this isn't transferring from say fentanyl to buprenorphine.

1883
02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:44.670
Dr Jameson: I want to start on the lower side dose wise and then we can always add more if we need it but you know it's a it's a guess, to some degree of how much of this stuff you'll need.

1884
02:52:45.750 --> 02:52:48.450
Dr Jameson: But I'm going to ask you to take

1885
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:55.740
Dr Jameson: Half of the film, and you can just snippet with literally snip it with scissors.

1886
02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:07.380
Dr Jameson: And then we actually have an induction protocol, which I don't know if you how much you've looked around, if you've seen that anywhere. I'll have I can have Jamie

1887
02:53:07.920 --> 02:53:17.340
Dr Jameson: Or one of the one of the staff members email it to you. But what we usually do is have you take the four milligram dose and then wait an hour.

1888
02:53:17.730 --> 02:53:29.430
Dr Jameson: And if you're feeling great then that's it. Don't just maybe take it again 12 hours later, you do it twice a day if you really don't feel any different at all. You take the other half.

1889
02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:36.270
Dr Jameson: And sort of we kind of like stepwise increase it as needed.

1890
02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:38.940
Dr Jameson: So,

1891
02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:44.850
Dr Jameson: Have you seen it. The, the induction procedure and all

1892
02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:47.880
Adam Krug: I do not know.

1893
02:53:48.510 --> 02:53:50.880
Adam Krug: Sounds like you haven't. I don't think so.

1894
02:53:50.940 --> 02:53:52.980
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's fine. I'm

1895
02:53:54.960 --> 02:54:05.850
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that's fine. I will have them email it to you because you don't, you're not even going to take it to. And this is actually kind of good because there may be a prior off, it has to be filled out and so

1896
02:54:07.050 --> 02:54:14.100
Dr Jameson: Where we can get all that done while we're while you're still going through the weight the waiting period anyway.

1897
02:54:18.090 --> 02:54:31.110
Dr Jameson: So I'm going to send. Just a couple because you're going to come to group on Wednesday, you will have taken maybe two to three doses by then to maybe on a Monday morning.

1898
02:54:32.190 --> 02:54:34.050
Dr Jameson: So I'll just say two days.

1899
02:54:37.980 --> 02:54:50.250
Dr Jameson: So usually I usually try to line it up so that you're going to get your refills around the time you're coming to group every week. So, so I just want to give you a little bit to get to group and then once we have a better idea of what your doses and give you a week supply at that point.

1900
02:54:53.790 --> 02:54:54.870
Adam Krug: Okay, okay.

1901
02:54:55.710 --> 02:55:00.330
Dr Jameson: So they they can the the film's can get a little bit

1902
02:55:01.650 --> 02:55:08.520
Dr Jameson: Mushy sticky fine. So I would you know the other half, I would put in like a zip lock or something. Try to keep it.

1903
02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:12.810
Dr Jameson: Sometimes they kind of if it's human they can kind of like

1904
02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:24.480
Dr Jameson: Melt in their little in their little and I would try to keep it in. It's the foil route like open the full wrap snippet, and half but save the for, like, put it back in and try to kind of

1905
02:55:26.340 --> 02:55:31.590
Dr Jameson: Contain it again until you're going to use the other half. That makes sense.

1906
02:55:32.010 --> 02:55:37.590
Adam Krug: Yeah, makes a lot of sense because boy came patches to kind of something similar.

1907
02:55:37.860 --> 02:55:44.070
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Okay. And then I have a CVS pharmacy and 41st street in here. Is that the right one.

1908
02:55:44.910 --> 02:55:47.070
Adam Krug: Yeah. Let me double check really quick, though.

1909
02:55:47.130 --> 02:55:48.060
Adam Krug: Just to be sure

1910
02:55:51.330 --> 02:56:03.900
Dr Jameson: Going to send a note to I have. We call them care man care navigators and my care navigators Jamie, so I'm going to ask her to email you this induction protocol.

1911
02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:17.370
Dr Jameson: Sometimes, a lot of times patients are using heroin, you know, gram a day or something. We don't we just start them at the full dose, because we know they're going to need it. So I don't always do it by the stepwise way.

1912
02:56:21.780 --> 02:56:28.080
Dr Jameson: Okay, please email me induction. I should have it on my computer. So I can send it, but I don't know the induction.

1913
02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:38.580
Dr Jameson: And have we tested to make sure they have the correct email for you.

1914
02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:42.270
Adam Krug: I believe so. Because I've been receiving emails.

1915
02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:42.570
Okay.

1916
02:56:44.490 --> 02:56:46.020
Dr Jameson: Because they also send you

1917
02:56:47.640 --> 02:56:52.560
Dr Jameson: The last pieces is the surveys that they have our patients fill out every week.

1918
02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:59.460
Dr Jameson: So they send you an email with the surveys in it too.

1919
02:57:03.630 --> 02:57:05.370
Dr Jameson: Is that, did you find the pharmacy.

1920
02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:09.180
Adam Krug: Oh, I did. As a matter of fact, and it is the correct one. Okay, thank you.

1921
02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:10.710
Dr Jameson: So,

1922
02:57:10.830 --> 02:57:11.790
We'll send

1923
02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:22.440
Dr Jameson: I'm just going to send for a little phones and you're taking a half at a time. So I think you'll have plenty to get you through Wednesday anyway.

1924
02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:23.730
Adam Krug: Thank you.

1925
02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:27.120
Dr Jameson: And then as far as other symptoms.

1926
02:57:27.180 --> 02:57:27.990
Go.

1927
02:57:30.780 --> 02:57:38.400
Dr Jameson: Sorry, let me get this done. So I can, I have to enter double codes that expires and five seconds so

1928
02:57:39.450 --> 02:57:54.510
Dr Jameson: As far as other medications, go for anxiety and all that stuff. So currently, you're not taking the Lyrica because that's kind of the whole point of this, you have this anxiety, the lighter Durham and then approx in and that's it right

1929
02:57:55.110 --> 02:57:56.130
Adam Krug: Yes. Okay.

1930
02:57:56.610 --> 02:58:00.480
Dr Jameson: And so I'll make sure there aren't any interactions with whatever I prescribe okay so

1931
02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:04.320
Dr Jameson: Have you ever taken.

1932
02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:14.970
Dr Jameson: Either Clonidine not Klonopin Clonidine or visceral or Hydrazine is another name for it.

1933
02:58:15.570 --> 02:58:27.690
Adam Krug: As a matter of fact both. And yeah, I've also taken marked as a PM, which I still have for as you put that on my interest on but which both of those maybe really grow.

1934
02:58:28.470 --> 02:58:35.520
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well, my. The reason I would be prescribing something would be if you're feeling really anxious and restless and you can't sleep.

1935
02:58:35.850 --> 02:58:43.650
Dr Jameson: Oh, so we're looking for something that would make you a little cranky. Actually, do you have doesn't Murtaza P make you sleepy.

1936
02:58:45.330 --> 02:58:57.030
Adam Krug: Yes, too sleepy. So in case I have sleep issues, I might I could try. Perhaps the transit on unless you have a better suggestion, because I

1937
02:58:57.030 --> 02:59:00.060
Adam Krug: Also feel restless these well

1938
02:59:00.330 --> 02:59:01.950
Dr Jameson: You've taken Clonidine

1939
02:59:02.730 --> 02:59:07.440
Adam Krug: That's actually very helpful. I don't know. Have them, but I have in the past.

1940
02:59:07.860 --> 02:59:10.200
Dr Jameson: And that's you use that for what symptom.

1941
02:59:10.770 --> 02:59:15.540
Adam Krug: I'm like sleep and anxiety rich

1942
02:59:15.810 --> 02:59:20.730
Dr Jameson: Does it help because some people find it helps with the hot, cold feeling and the restlessness.

1943
02:59:21.630 --> 02:59:22.260
Dr Jameson: Oh,

1944
02:59:22.800 --> 02:59:24.390
Adam Krug: The restlessness, as well as

1945
02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:27.120
Dr Jameson: It does. It has helped that before for you.

1946
02:59:27.660 --> 02:59:32.640
Adam Krug: Yeah, and I haven't tried it for the opiate withdrawal symptoms.

1947
02:59:32.700 --> 02:59:38.190
Dr Jameson: Okay, so maybe that's what we'll do. Because you've had it before you know it doesn't bother. It doesn't cause a problem.

1948
02:59:40.170 --> 02:59:45.660
Dr Jameson: Stick with stuff we know okay so you currently also have a supply of travel down and Murtaza team.

1949
02:59:46.140 --> 02:59:49.830
Dr Jameson: Yes, I just, okay, but you don't take them every day.

1950
02:59:50.490 --> 03:00:02.190
Adam Krug: No, no. There I guess they actually feel what kind of restless so weird combo. It's not a, like a long term grade thing either sales feel impair the next day it Clemente

1951
03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:06.870
Adam Krug: I used to cook on or something applauded. Yeah.

1952
03:00:06.900 --> 03:00:10.200
Adam Krug: Canada, whatever it is. That's right. Yeah, that's better.

1953
03:00:10.500 --> 03:00:16.410
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, um, but you have something you can take tonight. If you can't fall asleep.

1954
03:00:18.300 --> 03:00:19.320
Adam Krug: Yes.

1955
03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:20.370
Dr Jameson: Okay. And, you know,

1956
03:00:20.430 --> 03:00:33.720
Dr Jameson: I don't know if you probably are smart enough to have already tried this, but sometimes taking a half of whatever it is you have if it gives you too much of a hangover the next day, sometimes taking a lower dose health looks better.

1957
03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:39.300
Adam Krug: Yeah, I agree with both of them. It's weird because even a half

1958
03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:42.840
Adam Krug: Day kind of caused similar symptoms.

1959
03:00:43.020 --> 03:00:47.940
Dr Jameson: What um DOS right do you have the mortality.

1960
03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:52.800
Adam Krug: I believe it's 15 milligrams actually know that

1961
03:00:53.070 --> 03:00:54.210
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

1962
03:00:54.390 --> 03:00:57.300
Dr Jameson: And do you know your dose on trouser no

1963
03:00:58.230 --> 03:01:01.380
Adam Krug: I think it's 50 but I split it always

1964
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:05.490
Dr Jameson: Do split them are tapping into

1965
03:01:05.910 --> 03:01:12.810
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Okay, so you're already doing that and it makes you kind of agitated. Is that what you were saying or jittery

1966
03:01:13.170 --> 03:01:21.300
Adam Krug: It's not agitated. It's just like restless, rather than jittery, it's like I I'm sleepy but I'm restless at the same time.

1967
03:01:23.100 --> 03:01:23.430
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1968
03:01:24.630 --> 03:01:25.920
Dr Jameson: That doesn't sound very comfortable.

1969
03:01:27.450 --> 03:01:31.230
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, so you've never tried hydroxyl seen

1970
03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:32.850
They have

1971
03:01:35.100 --> 03:01:36.330
Adam Krug: Started. What's the next one.

1972
03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:41.220
Dr Jameson: Well, that's the same thing. They're just two different names for the same one sister. Oh, it's the brand name.

1973
03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:47.400
Dr Jameson: So you've tried the hydroxyl seen before.

1974
03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:49.800
Adam Krug: Yes.

1975
03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:52.530
Adam Krug: Compared to the

1976
03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:56.280
Adam Krug: Current in class.

1977
03:01:56.940 --> 03:01:57.300
Dr Jameson: Today,

1978
03:01:57.570 --> 03:01:59.310
Adam Krug: Yeah. Thank you. On a dean.

1979
03:01:59.670 --> 03:02:01.620
Adam Krug: Has a long, a while ago.

1980
03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:10.470
Adam Krug: But I find that more effective for what I definitely star. I remember when I was like 14

1981
03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:13.320
Dr Jameson: The Hi Dr. Dean was more effective or the quantity

1982
03:02:13.770 --> 03:02:15.150
Dr Jameson: Clonidine, okay.

1983
03:02:16.290 --> 03:02:17.640
Dr Jameson: Does it make you sleepy.

1984
03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:19.920
Adam Krug: Yeah, that's what I remembered

1985
03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:24.300
Dr Jameson: Okay, okay. Alright, so let's just leave it um

1986
03:02:25.410 --> 03:02:40.260
Dr Jameson: Let's see what I send some quantity. So you can use that. Well, you can use that after you start the buprenorphine to because they work in different ways, but you can certainly use that today tonight, tomorrow, while you're sort of trying to wait wait it out as best you can.

1987
03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:49.740
Dr Jameson: So I would say if you say it's a day and a half to when you usually start not feeling good at all. I would say we want a minimum

1988
03:02:50.310 --> 03:03:00.270
Dr Jameson: To be at the day and a half, we usually try to ask people to get not just to their. OK, now I can tell something is starting with withdrawal. We asked them to get down to like

1989
03:03:02.070 --> 03:03:11.700
Dr Jameson: Get into, like, Okay, I don't know how much more of this. I can take level, just to make sure that we don't put you into with even more intense withdrawal.

1990
03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:17.400
Dr Jameson: So if you have a quantity to use would najah medicine be helpful to

1991
03:03:23.370 --> 03:03:26.400
Adam Krug: That actually probably would have never tried that.

1992
03:03:27.030 --> 03:03:31.350
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you never had. You've never had it even when you are sick with a stomach bug or anything.

1993
03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:35.610
Adam Krug: Not to my knowledge. Yeah.

1994
03:03:35.970 --> 03:03:44.580
Dr Jameson: The one we usually use is called So Fran on dance. The Tron is the brand is the generic name. It's a little tablet also melts under your tongue.

1995
03:03:46.650 --> 03:03:52.470
Dr Jameson: That's done that way because if you're actively vomiting. We can still get it into without having to go to your stomach so

1996
03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:57.540
Dr Jameson: It's a, it's a different reason why it's happens to be a melt in your mouth.

1997
03:03:58.560 --> 03:03:59.040
Dr Jameson: But anyway.

1998
03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:01.260
Adam Krug: Really, really quick question.

1999
03:04:01.770 --> 03:04:08.070
Adam Krug: If they're both sublingual or rather than caustic because like curious impact.

2000
03:04:08.940 --> 03:04:11.550
Dr Jameson: And nobody's ever asked me that.

2001
03:04:12.810 --> 03:04:13.170
I

2002
03:04:14.610 --> 03:04:21.930
Dr Jameson: Nobody has ever mentioned the the box on like burning or singing or anything when they complain. It's usually

2003
03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:25.050
Dr Jameson: They don't like the taste.

2004
03:04:26.130 --> 03:04:26.580
Dr Jameson: Frankly,

2005
03:04:28.050 --> 03:04:38.430
Dr Jameson: But some people, like I said, some people prefer the film. So I think that's obviously a personal, personal preference kind of thing. I've never heard of anybody saying I think about it being caustic

2006
03:04:40.230 --> 03:04:48.420
Dr Jameson: Usually the XO friend the nausea medicine is like a few doses and then you know you're not feeling sick anymore. You don't keep taking it so

2007
03:04:49.080 --> 03:04:57.570
Dr Jameson: It wouldn't be a long term thing anyway. But I've, I don't know. I've given it to people in an urgent care like while I'm standing there, nobody's ever went

2008
03:04:58.260 --> 03:05:06.750
Dr Jameson: You know, the taste. I've actually taken, taken one verte. I mean, it was one manufacturer, but it was kind of tasted like great remind me of kids Tylenol.

2009
03:05:08.250 --> 03:05:09.090
Adam Krug: Let's good

2010
03:05:09.120 --> 03:05:10.590
Adam Krug: Yes, goes over things

2011
03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:10.950
Yeah.

2012
03:05:12.300 --> 03:05:17.340
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so, and I don't know if they're all that flavor. Maybe, maybe not. But that's the one I had

2013
03:05:20.430 --> 03:05:21.870
Dr Jameson: And it just melts, you can

2014
03:05:22.890 --> 03:05:29.790
Dr Jameson: You actually don't have to put it under your tongue. It just has to melt it just dissolves in your mouth. Doesn't matter where

2015
03:05:30.510 --> 03:05:30.690
Oh,

2016
03:05:31.950 --> 03:05:36.780
Dr Jameson: And the, the Suboxone buprenorphine will come with instructions and they probably they haven't

2017
03:05:38.340 --> 03:05:52.650
Dr Jameson: Jamie said she just emailed you the induction plan. There may be some instructions on that too, but you basically they want you to, like I said, we want you to not eat or drink anything for about 10 minutes before or 10 minutes after

2018
03:05:54.090 --> 03:06:03.060
Dr Jameson: You just set it in there and let it melt until it's completely dissolved and then start your 10 minute clock for not eating or drinking anything and do your best not to swallow.

2019
03:06:03.720 --> 03:06:13.560
Dr Jameson: You know i i don't know how that works sometimes because I I know I make a lot of saliva, but you try to let it sit there, as opposed to swallowing swallowing it as its melting

2020
03:06:15.750 --> 03:06:19.830
Adam Krug: Sounds good. How long does it take to melt soon.

2021
03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:24.960
Dr Jameson: I don't think the strip takes too long, maybe five minutes, something like that.

2022
03:06:25.710 --> 03:06:26.370
Adam Krug: Oh this stuff.

2023
03:06:27.300 --> 03:06:30.750
Dr Jameson: The tablets can take longer because they're kind of thicker and clunkier that's

2024
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:33.030
Dr Jameson: Part of what sometimes people don't like about them.

2025
03:06:35.310 --> 03:06:50.910
Dr Jameson: You can always like snippet, even into two. I know you're already cutting in half. But you can take that half snip that into if it's taking a long time to melt for you. You can snip that into two pieces and like put one under each side or on your cheek or something just to have

2026
03:06:52.530 --> 03:06:55.020
Dr Jameson: I don't know, maybe that would make it go a little bit faster.

2027
03:06:56.100 --> 03:07:01.950
Adam Krug: Thank you, but like I wouldn't want to do them to the buprenorphine ray and just keep it one place

2028
03:07:02.940 --> 03:07:09.000
Dr Jameson: That's what I was talking about, if it's if it's like some people put it up like in their cheek and other people had it under their tongue.

2029
03:07:11.850 --> 03:07:23.700
Dr Jameson: So you could you could put like half of each half of the piece on each side if you if you just start with the half and see how it goes. But if it's if there's like an issue, and you'd like to try, you can try cutting into two pieces.

2030
03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:27.720
Adam Krug: And the tablet be signed, though.

2031
03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:30.330
Dr Jameson: For the naga medicine. You mean

2032
03:07:30.360 --> 03:07:32.880
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. That doesn't take long.

2033
03:07:34.350 --> 03:07:34.560
Adam Krug: And

2034
03:07:34.590 --> 03:07:34.980
Dr Jameson: I mean,

2035
03:07:36.450 --> 03:07:43.080
Dr Jameson: It also comes in and non dissolving tab. Like you could just do it as well. But if it's taking too long.

2036
03:07:44.250 --> 03:07:48.810
Dr Jameson: That's that one's okay to swallow. It's the people, the strip is the one that we don't want you swallowing.

2037
03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:50.910
Adam Krug: Thank you.

2038
03:07:53.040 --> 03:08:01.890
Dr Jameson: Well, the buprenorphine even whether it's a tablet or a strip that one needs to be absorbed in absorbed through the lining of your mouth, but no Anja medicine.

2039
03:08:02.490 --> 03:08:13.380
Dr Jameson: Is made to dissolve because people may be actually vomiting while they're trying to convince them that they can, like, hold it under their tongue, and yet it in. But it's okay to swallow it, it still works that way.

2040
03:08:14.550 --> 03:08:15.030
That makes

2041
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:22.500
Dr Jameson: Other questions. I know that a lot of different

2042
03:08:26.220 --> 03:08:28.020
Adam Krug: Not at the moment. Thank you.

2043
03:08:28.410 --> 03:08:42.480
Dr Jameson: You're welcome. Um, okay. So you have some resources there you've got that app to download you wrote down 1134 group on Wednesday to get checked in, no later than

2044
03:08:42.570 --> 03:08:45.120
Adam Krug: The way to I wrote, I wrote noon on Wednesday.

2045
03:08:45.150 --> 03:08:50.190
Dr Jameson: Well, the, the group starts at noon, but we'd like you to check in half an hour before that so

2046
03:08:52.920 --> 03:08:56.040
Dr Jameson: Might want to just write down 1130 just to be on the safe side.

2047
03:08:57.120 --> 03:08:59.190
Adam Krug: Thank you. I had already done.

2048
03:09:00.540 --> 03:09:01.050
Adam Krug: This now.

2049
03:09:01.500 --> 03:09:03.540
Dr Jameson: Okay, okay, um,

2050
03:09:04.410 --> 03:09:13.410
Dr Jameson: And then I thought, I didn't talk to the left about. So as far as our sort of just general policies go as a practice, um,

2051
03:09:14.430 --> 03:09:20.160
Dr Jameson: I think it goes without saying, but you're responsible for the, you know, keeping your medication.

2052
03:09:21.270 --> 03:09:24.870
Dr Jameson: Secure. So if, for some, you know, people

2053
03:09:26.100 --> 03:09:31.350
Dr Jameson: call us and say their medications and stolen or whatever you need a police report before will replace it.

2054
03:09:34.260 --> 03:09:37.020
Dr Jameson: I'm assuming this will not be an issue. But just just, you know,

2055
03:09:38.190 --> 03:09:39.570
Dr Jameson: Attendance is not

2056
03:09:41.250 --> 03:09:44.820
Dr Jameson: Optional like you need to go to group. If you want to get a prescription

2057
03:09:46.530 --> 03:09:59.040
Dr Jameson: So that that doesn't work, all if you don't come in and say you need medicine. That's why you're supposed to come through. If something comes up and you can't make group you're sick or you have a doctor's appointment or

2058
03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:02.760
Dr Jameson: I don't know. Power's out or whatever.

2059
03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:13.230
Dr Jameson: You can still call ideally the main number for bright heart, let us know. Ideally, before the actual appointment time

2060
03:10:13.770 --> 03:10:27.300
Dr Jameson: That there's going to be a problem. And I can be able to attend. And then, you know, we're not unreasonable if something is going on in life that prevents you from getting to group this week okay as long as you're calling and communicating and we hear from you.

2061
03:10:29.430 --> 03:10:37.590
Dr Jameson: My least favorite message is Friday at six o'clock, oh, this person is completely out of medication. Now it's a crisis.

2062
03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:42.180
Dr Jameson: But they didn't call for three days after they miss their group and

2063
03:10:43.410 --> 03:10:48.660
Dr Jameson: Okay, like you can understand that's not that's not encouraged. That's kind of frowned upon.

2064
03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:55.410
Dr Jameson: They're actually getting really strict because we've had a problem, especially with the counseling appointments people blow them off.

2065
03:10:56.040 --> 03:11:03.600
Dr Jameson: Because they're their medicine isn't tied to that. I don't know. They don't want to do counseling. I'm not sure, but there's like a ton of no show. So they've actually like

2066
03:11:04.560 --> 03:11:16.290
Dr Jameson: Put their foot down and now if people miss an appointment without calling and notifying us you get your prescriptions cut to 40 supplies for the next month until you have a month with no no shows

2067
03:11:17.460 --> 03:11:18.000
Dr Jameson: So,

2068
03:11:19.350 --> 03:11:25.470
Dr Jameson: I would avoid a no show at all costs for your for yourself. And it's, you know, if you need to reschedule.

2069
03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:37.260
Dr Jameson: That's okay. But we just want to, we want to know, we can put somebody else in that slot and not have a medical professional sitting at a empty computer screen, but then with announcing patients so

2070
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:55.350
Dr Jameson: I kind of went over the group stuff. So that's the biggest thing is just being proactive and respectful and responsible about keeping appointments or canceling if you're not going to be able to meet rescheduling if you need to.

2071
03:11:56.520 --> 03:11:58.890
Dr Jameson: I think it should be common sense, but we have a lot of

2072
03:12:00.630 --> 03:12:04.290
Dr Jameson: missing. Missing patients sometimes um

2073
03:12:06.630 --> 03:12:08.310
Dr Jameson: Any questions about any of that.

2074
03:12:09.870 --> 03:12:12.090
Adam Krug: No thank you once again.

2075
03:12:13.170 --> 03:12:17.760
Dr Jameson: Alright, so I'm gonna we'll leave it that you're gonna you'll get that induction, you can review it.

2076
03:12:18.420 --> 03:12:26.940
Dr Jameson: But like I said, you kind of start with a half of a film or tablet, whichever one they give you. And then if an hour later, if you take it you don't feel better.

2077
03:12:27.930 --> 03:12:34.950
Dr Jameson: You can take the other half, and then the next time. It's whatever your effective dose was the first

2078
03:12:35.610 --> 03:12:46.110
Dr Jameson: Dose you're going to start with that. The next time. So if you needed to take the second half to get yourself feeling better than the next day, just take the whole one. You don't have to go back to the half again.

2079
03:12:47.970 --> 03:12:48.480
Adam Krug: Yeah.

2080
03:12:49.410 --> 03:12:58.110
Dr Jameson: And most people take it twice a day. So the way I wrote the prescription was one half film twice a day per induction protocol.

2081
03:12:59.250 --> 03:13:05.640
Dr Jameson: So you start, you're going to start by half. But you may well end up at a whole, I don't know. We just have to kind of see

2082
03:13:06.750 --> 03:13:09.630
Dr Jameson: How it goes for you personally

2083
03:13:10.770 --> 03:13:13.290
Dr Jameson: But plan on whatever the dose is taking it.

2084
03:13:14.340 --> 03:13:21.510
Dr Jameson: Again, like about twice a day 12 hours apart so it doesn't have to be exactly 12 hours, but most people take it morning and night.

2085
03:13:23.610 --> 03:13:42.090
Dr Jameson: And if you feel like, whoa, with the even the half of a strip. If it makes you feel bad in some way. I just had a patient that it's a long story, but he was, he has made him feel high, but he was transitioning from something non opiate related. So we were trying to use it for something else.

2086
03:13:44.070 --> 03:13:55.230
Dr Jameson: So he we had a drop the doctor says you have to drop the dose lower you can cut it into smaller pieces. There's nothing to say. You don't. You can you can do even less but

2087
03:13:56.160 --> 03:14:09.210
Dr Jameson: This is kind of a, an average starting dose for these induction. So it's reasonable to start that. And if you feel good and you still feel good or you're not sure, you need a second dose in the day. It is actually a 24 hour

2088
03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:21.600
Dr Jameson: Medication, even though everybody wants to take it twice a day. So you could just take a half and then leave it at that for a full 24 hours to its. It was actually designed to be taken once a day.

2089
03:14:22.740 --> 03:14:24.630
Dr Jameson: We have a lot of I think there's a lot of

2090
03:14:25.740 --> 03:14:35.160
Dr Jameson: Being used to using something multiple times throughout the day and it's, it seems like way too long to go between doses for a lot of people to go, just go all the way to once a day.

2091
03:14:36.570 --> 03:14:36.960
Dr Jameson: So,

2092
03:14:39.240 --> 03:14:49.620
Dr Jameson: And if you have any questions you can always sign into virtual clinic to if you're kind of not sure what to do after your first dose. If you don't, you're not sure, you certainly can call in and ask

2093
03:14:50.670 --> 03:14:59.490
Dr Jameson: You'll be having group like the next day, so it won't be very long before you have an opportunity to touch base anyway with me and see. See how it's going

2094
03:15:01.140 --> 03:15:01.680
Adam Krug: Thank you.

2095
03:15:01.830 --> 03:15:02.280
Okay.

2096
03:15:03.990 --> 03:15:09.180
Dr Jameson: Okay, well that's a lot of talking, do you, do you have any last questions before we go.

2097
03:15:11.250 --> 03:15:22.680
Adam Krug: I guess a last question would be, so uh is or is the CVS receiving like prescriptions today or tomorrow.

2098
03:15:22.860 --> 03:15:32.790
Dr Jameson: Yes, I sent I've sent them all within the last whatever 15 minutes or so. So after we hang up. If you want to maybe give it a few more minutes. But you can call them.

2099
03:15:33.390 --> 03:15:42.810
Dr Jameson: Pretty soon and confirm that they've received them and then the next question, which is, I'm glad you asked this question because I, I should have told you to do this anyway.

2100
03:15:43.710 --> 03:15:53.730
Dr Jameson: Any idea when they'll be ready. So I'm sure though Fran, and the quantity will be fine. There may well be a prior off for the people in our field so

2101
03:15:54.510 --> 03:16:11.640
Dr Jameson: That's where you'll kind of get, oh, well, there's a insurance and we need to pay. We need a prior off done or what what prescription. We didn't get that. Or we don't have this in stock or, you know, anyway, if you get the sense of there's any issues from from the pharmacy side of of the thing.

2102
03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:18.840
Dr Jameson: Also called virtual clinic and just let them know they said, I need a prior if they send it automatically. We have a

2103
03:16:20.100 --> 03:16:29.580
Dr Jameson: Wonderful staff member named Danielle who fills. Who does all those and they usually go through just fine. But just so they know to have the heads up that they should have received a prior offer you.

2104
03:16:30.750 --> 03:16:38.940
Dr Jameson: Thank you, usually. It's usually well in California. They're usually pretty quick turnaround. Some of the other states, not so much but

2105
03:16:40.530 --> 03:16:47.190
Dr Jameson: It should be, it should be certainly process by tomorrow and you don't need it before then. Anyway, so

2106
03:16:48.780 --> 03:16:59.970
Dr Jameson: But yeah, I would just touch base with them and make sure, sometimes they don't have it in stock rarely where they need to order it or something so that can delay things to sometimes

2107
03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:10.470
Adam Krug: And I think that was my only question for now. But anything else. I'm happy to

2108
03:17:10.560 --> 03:17:13.740
Dr Jameson: Yeah, call virtual clinic. Again, I'm

2109
03:17:14.970 --> 03:17:22.080
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm good. So it was nice to meet you. I will will definitely

2110
03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:26.670
Dr Jameson: Adjust medication dose, if we need to. So

2111
03:17:28.020 --> 03:17:34.230
Dr Jameson: Don't we can go either up or down, and then we'll see you on Wednesday, the day after tomorrow.

2112
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:38.790
Dr Jameson: At noon 1130 checking in.

2113
03:17:40.080 --> 03:17:40.590
Adam Krug: Yes.

2114
03:17:40.920 --> 03:17:41.820
Adam Krug: Oh, thank you.

2115
03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:45.330
Adam Krug: Very much and I missed me and have a good day.

2116
03:17:45.390 --> 03:17:51.810
Dr Jameson: Thank you. Thank you. Do you do see how to get out. You have to sometimes you have to touch the screen to get the leave meeting to come up

2117
03:17:52.410 --> 03:17:54.750
Adam Krug: Yeah. Thank you. All right.

2118
03:17:55.170 --> 03:17:58.950
Adam Krug: I'm about to leave. So, have a good one, you too. Bye.

2119
03:18:02.910 --> 03:18:12.000
Dr Jameson: Okay, I think I had finished with my first guy. Then I had Edward the last go

2120
03:18:13.680 --> 03:18:16.080
Dr Jameson: Who reports that he started

2121
03:18:17.970 --> 03:18:19.230
Dr Jameson: The Suboxone

2122
03:18:20.490 --> 03:18:32.130
Dr Jameson: As prescribed, but found it to be extremely sedating and actually made him feel high so he actually hasn't taken it in a week now.

2123
03:18:37.110 --> 03:18:42.780
Dr Jameson: And for reasons having to do with his custody.

2124
03:18:44.430 --> 03:18:55.770
Dr Jameson: Battle or case, I should say. He doesn't want to take it again because it makes him so sedated. We talked about the option of Murtaza pain.

2125
03:18:57.810 --> 03:19:14.130
Dr Jameson: Which I would recommend. Instead, the nurse who accompanies him at the community health center where they're calling from indicates that they have clinicians available there that can prescribe that so at this point.

2126
03:19:15.450 --> 03:19:19.320

Dr Jameson: This would be

2130
03:19:46.650 --> 03:19:55.200
Dr Jameson: Based on a study done that showed a 30% drop in methamphetamine positive drugs greens in a group of

03:19:58.140 --> 03:20:00.540
Dr Jameson: Patients period.

2132

Dr Jameson: Constipation dry mouth, etc.

2134
03:20:23.550 --> 03:20:47.610
Dr Jameson: As far as individual counseling and group meetings I would need to follow up with our leadership about whether, in this particular case, we will continue. Well, proceed with the plan to provide group relapse prevention sessions for this individual, and the handful of others. His

2179
03:25:13.110 --> 03:25:16.230
Dr Jameson: A patient does seem to have a history of

2180
03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:25.620
Dr Jameson: Prolonged opiate and opioid use with physical withdrawal symptoms now occurring even

2181
03:25:27.810 --> 03:25:31.560

2183
03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:47.400
Dr Jameson: And also has chronic pain period, excuse me, I think buprenorphine is a reasonable

2184
03:25:49.590 --> 03:25:50.490
Dr Jameson: Option to

2185
03:25:52.080 --> 03:25:54.630
Dr Jameson: Deal with both these

2186
03:25:57.480 --> 03:26:02.160
Dr Jameson: Problems period dosing is a little bit uncertain.

2187
03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:09.360
Dr Jameson: At this time, so we will follow the typical induction protocol period.

2188
03:26:10.980 --> 03:26:21.840
Dr Jameson: I sent a prescription for a number of people in our field eight slash two films. Number four, period, we discussed the potential side effects, the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

2189
03:26:24.180 --> 03:26:42.750
Dr Jameson: Period, given his reports of symptoms developing between one and a half and two days after last use I strongly encouraged him to delay his initial dose of Suboxone until at least 36 hours if not 48 hours from his last Lyrica dose.

2190
03:26:46.320 --> 03:26:50.100
Dr Jameson: We discussed the program structure, the

2191
03:26:51.570 --> 03:26:53.460
Dr Jameson: policies for no shows

2192
03:26:56.490 --> 03:27:00.060
Dr Jameson: The importance of individual counseling and addition to the group's

2193
03:27:01.350 --> 03:27:05.220
Dr Jameson: He's gonna have his initial labs done in the next few days.

2194
03:27:07.980 --> 03:27:25.290
Dr Jameson: I did send some Clonidine point one milligram tablets and zero Fran four milligram sublingual tablets to use if he has najah or restlessness insomnia. But between now and when he begins his induction.

2195
03:27:31.980 --> 03:27:38.700
Dr Jameson: It's evident that he has a history of domestic abuse.

2196
03:27:40.620 --> 03:27:41.370
Dr Jameson: Which he's not

2197
03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:47.310
Dr Jameson: Freely able to discuss at the time of this particular visit

2198
03:27:51.150 --> 03:28:02.340
Dr Jameson: So this will need to be addressed and at a future time he does date on several questioning several times that he is in a safe. Safe situation currently

2199
03:28:09.150 --> 03:28:12.450
Dr Jameson: Anxiety may also need to be addressed in more

2200
03:28:16.980 --> 03:28:22.050
Dr Jameson: Detail, I will have a low threshold for a psychiatric consultation for this patient.

2201
03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:30.030
Dr Jameson: But would like to evaluate once he has transitioned on to buprenorphine a lock zone.

2202
03:28:36.990 --> 03:28:38.370
Dr Jameson: I did want to Karen's report.

2203
03:28:40.380 --> 03:28:49.920
Dr Jameson: Which was which showed expect was revealed that was consistent with the patient's verbal reports.

2204
03:28:54.810 --> 03:28:55.890
Dr Jameson: I think that is the

2205
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.850
All right.
