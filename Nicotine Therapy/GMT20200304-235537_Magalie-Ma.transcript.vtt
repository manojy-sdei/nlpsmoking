Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

35
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:32.220
Martin’s iPhone: So, I mean, I'm still experiencing the same amount, but I've only been on that for about a week and a half, two weeks. So hopefully something will change. If it doesn't, you're just gonna keep trying.

36
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.430

Martin’s iPhone: President

45
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:27.450
Martin’s iPhone: You know it's helping me get to sleep. I noticed that I do get the sweet sleep quicker but the intensity of the nightmares is same, if not worse. I'm just, I go to a sleep study tomorrow night. I started at eight o'clock so

46
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:37.110
Martin’s iPhone: I would post already have done it. But my insurance in kicking it by the tournament had the appointments so they had to reschedule me and it took them almost a month and put me

47
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.120
Martin’s iPhone: On tomorrow.

48
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.190
Magalie Marcellus: So I did some nice, that is, it's the nighttime is less

49
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.460
Magalie Marcellus: Either intense or

50
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:51.510
Martin’s iPhone: Is it the

51
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.410
Magalie Marcellus: Same every night.

52
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.650
Martin’s iPhone: Um, no, it's not the same every night, but the feeling I get this feeling, while I'm in it.

53
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.040
Martin’s iPhone: It's just a very, very, very sad.

54
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.740
Martin’s iPhone: Feeling the feeling is always there. It's always some something of fear.

55
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.200
Martin’s iPhone: Insecurity

56
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:29.520
Martin’s iPhone: Where I have to build my courage, up to stop something or to fight something and it could be anything from a bear to, uh, to another person to dragons to just being in a situation where I'm drowning or jumping off the cliffs.

57
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.100
Martin’s iPhone: Trying to stop a car.

58
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:39.180
Martin’s iPhone: From rolling off a hill or hurting somebody just stopping fights and

59
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.020
Martin’s iPhone: A lot of them have happened since the fire.

60
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.640
Martin’s iPhone: And

61
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:45.930
Uh huh.

62
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:59.100
Martin’s iPhone: I've had a few of them not, you know, and I've been trying to block, trying to remember them. The last few days, just because I don't want to like reaction reaction.

63
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:10.560
Magalie Marcellus: So we leave them. Yeah, I'm not. Do you notice any different in terms of what might be going in during a day that may

64
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.470
Magalie Marcellus: Bring them on more or

65
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.280
Martin’s iPhone: I think because I'm sober. Now I have spent the last

66
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.310
Martin’s iPhone: Almost 30 years 25 years high

67
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:36.810
Martin’s iPhone: And now that I'm you know facing everything. There's just a lot of pressure on me to try to everything was ketchup. Ketchup ketchup, you know, from my bills to my relationships to my

68
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:47.310
Martin’s iPhone: Getting a job to paying child support everything was just all, I think that might have something to do with it, know that I'm just all my

69
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:54.600
Martin’s iPhone: synapses are firing or something, I don't know, nothing's being blocked anymore. I know like cake Suboxone but

70
00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:04.950
Martin’s iPhone: I'll tell you, I am so grateful that I got that, you know, they don't have to take any opioids or anything. Now there is a moccasin is similar to that, but it's

71
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:18.990
Martin’s iPhone: It's definitely there's something else to it because I don't crave getting high anymore. And a lot of that to go to the fire and you know everything there, you know, not being aware of my surroundings and letting my garden.

72
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.310
Magalie Marcellus: Being around so did so doing the

73
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.380
Magalie Marcellus: Way you

74
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.000
Magalie Marcellus: Were you using at that time or

75
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.290
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah yeah

76
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.640
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

77
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:36.870
Magalie Marcellus: Yes.

78
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:45.090
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, I had a relapse. Old Spice, and I was smoking. I had been smoking weed up until almost five months ago, four months ago.

79
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.910
Martin’s iPhone: A little over four months now, because

80
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.980
Martin’s iPhone: I thought it was helping

81
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:57.180
Martin’s iPhone: And in a lot of ways, it did help. But in a lot of ways, it just created more people around me that were negative,

82
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:11.430
Martin’s iPhone: Another thing to get high on, you know, I didn't really get hide, though, I just, you know, the first one, one or two times I did. And then after that it was almost like back to the old you know just smoking, just to smoke.

83
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:21.540
Martin’s iPhone: Uh huh. Sometimes I go high, and sometimes I just, I didn't smoke near as much as I used to have a couple of hits off joint here and there and

84
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.190
Martin’s iPhone: Uh huh. But it just end up being another crutch, you know,

85
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.170
Magalie Marcellus: Smoking

86
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:33.720
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah.

87
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:36.990
Magalie Marcellus: And I'm

88
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:47.370
Magalie Marcellus: Just trying to you know if there's a pattern in terms of Windows happened goes up kind of the night terrors, um, you know what, maybe

89
00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.010
Magalie Marcellus: Some other underlying causes five

90
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:55.200
Martin’s iPhone: I will say that when I was getting high all the time. I don't remember how many of my dreams.

91
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:57.300
You know,

92
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.600
Magalie Marcellus: Because you have a clear mind that

93
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.540
Magalie Marcellus: Now you tense. We call this

94
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.080
Yeah.

95
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.880
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah I did have a few nightmares here and there.

96
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.700
Martin’s iPhone: But nothing like this.

97
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.290
Martin’s iPhone: Nothing like this at all.

98
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:23.610
Martin’s iPhone: And I've had them all throughout my life but seems like when I quit. You know, I'm sober that it just comes on.

99
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.860
Martin’s iPhone: So, I mean, maybe there was a benefit to smoking weed, but

100
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.200
Magalie Marcellus: I just don't want, but then say other consequences.

101
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:35.190
Martin’s iPhone: So, yeah.

102
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:36.840
Martin’s iPhone: Maybe I should try as

103
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.980
Martin’s iPhone: Well, yeah.

104
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.160
Magalie Marcellus: Maybe you should try to want

105
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.180
Martin’s iPhone: To take CBD oil and everybody's talking about that.

106
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:57.780
Magalie Marcellus: That will be something a conversation to have with medical staff and see what it's something that can really be effective as with the treatment actually

107
00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.670
Magalie Marcellus: I'm getting

108
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:09.630
Magalie Marcellus: So it's now during those windows terrorists occurred. So when you wake up. How do you wake up is Danny. Do you feel like

Magalie Marcellus: And then you will have fully or do you go back to sleep right away.

115
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.180
Martin’s iPhone: Sometimes I do, I'm just getting so used to knowing that they are nightmarish now.

116
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.200
Martin’s iPhone: The last real bad were no i had i was

117
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:52.680
Martin’s iPhone: I was choking. Some guy some guy was trying to hurt me. And so I got on top of them. And I was behind him and I was trying to break his neck or

118
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.460
Something

119
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.840
Martin’s iPhone: And in my dream. I woke up.

Martin’s iPhone: I was choking Michelle.

122
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:19.980
Martin’s iPhone: So then I woke up, I woke up for real. And I just started crying and I didn't get the response from her that I thought that she was going to be like, you know, it's okay, she was mad. She's like, Don't you ever do that. I'm like,

123
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.870
I would never do.

124
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.080
Magalie Marcellus: This you realize us. Um, yeah.

125
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.850
Magalie Marcellus: We've been out of time. Yeah.

126
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.810
Martin’s iPhone: But it really upset her because she thinks

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:34.500
Martin’s iPhone: Know that

128
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.300

Magalie Marcellus: Again, yeah.

130
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:49.470
Magalie Marcellus: Which, you know, could be understandable because she's not show windows would have occurred, and it can be, they can potentially be valid and

131
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.420
Magalie Marcellus: As well so

132
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.290

Magalie Marcellus: And you've been dealing with Apple how long ago.

136
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.770
Martin’s iPhone: Since I was 11 or 12

137
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:22.260
Martin’s iPhone: And maybe a little earlier. And although I've slept walked

138
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.480
Martin’s iPhone: It's been a long time since I remember doing that, but I used to sleep walk when I was a kid to

144
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.990
Martin’s iPhone: And I just kept crying and I went upstairs and fell back asleep, you know,

546
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:50.880

Martin’s iPhone: And and they don't even fix what's wrong with it so

550
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.130

551
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:12.510

554
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:29.820
Magalie Marcellus: Just to watch at the door because it hasn't transportation. But in the meantime, I'll

555
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.810
Magalie Marcellus: Run back with the

556
00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:31.890
Weapon.

557
00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:39.150
Magalie Marcellus: I know people, a lot of people feel safer when they have this. Should we visit any type of

558
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:49.500
Magalie Marcellus: Concerns in a neighborhood where people can try to get into your home. So my hope is that you won't have to be in a situation where

559
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.320
Magalie Marcellus: Anybody have to use a weapon.

560
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.970
Magalie Marcellus: But

561
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:59.490
Martin’s iPhone: I hope that, too. But the day that somebody comes to my door trying to hurt me. I want to be ready.

562
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:05.220
Magalie Marcellus: And how does the government feels about it because I know sometimes couples and

563
00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:14.490
Martin’s iPhone: I will. She's a little bit hesitant on it, but she wants to go out and use the guns retired practice you like shooting guns.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:49.560
Martin’s iPhone: There's if there's somebody trying to bring up the house I want him so you'll be okay with him. Shouldn't someone

588
01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:51.780
Magalie Marcellus: And somebody will come to your house.

589
01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:53.580
Martin’s iPhone: What if they're going to kill him.

590
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:58.950
Magalie Marcellus: I hear what you're saying, but I'm me so

591
01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:00.600
Magalie Marcellus: I sound like

592
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.010
Magalie Marcellus: A child.

593
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:03.630
Magalie Marcellus: Right.

594
01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:06.990
Martin’s iPhone: Well, I don't want, I hope that never happens.

595
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:12.930
Martin’s iPhone: But I don't want to walk into my house and have my son dead because I didn't show more the gun was

596
01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:32.970
Martin’s iPhone: You know, it's a tough one. I know. I mean, there's parts of me that don't want look I kept it locked and loaded for a couple days and then thought was that if I'm not here, and somebody tries to break into this house and he does not know how to defend him so

597
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:37.500
Martin’s iPhone: That they're gonna try to kill them to get away with whatever they're doing

598
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:39.450
A nice

599
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.180
Magalie Marcellus: And in the

600
01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:53.130
Magalie Marcellus: In the, the other way I would think, Okay, if this special concerns that maybe they mean you know somebody make book breaking through the house.

601
01:01:53.580 --> 01:02:09.570
Magalie Marcellus: My other thought we say because he's still a minor cuz that's a lot to have on a minor. Yes, he knows it's there, you know, that's but if there's a way that somebody may come in the house. I wouldn't want him to be there without another adult there. That's the other thinking to

602
01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.700
Magalie Marcellus: Do a

603
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:13.860
Magalie Marcellus: Safe

604
01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.010
Martin’s iPhone: home invasions.

605
01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.650
Martin’s iPhone: Once a week at least.

606
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:35.070
Magalie Marcellus: So that's a lot that's I'm saying, so I have you see there is a concern. So then if there's a possibility or I know everybody's busy his mom had things going, not to leave. And then, then you would be by himself. If something were to happen well

607
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:35.430
Magalie Marcellus: I know

608
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:40.890
Martin’s iPhone: right about that. You're right about that. We don't hardly ever leave here so

609
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:44.700
Martin’s iPhone: Mm hmm. But if he ever has to be here by himself.

610
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.770
Martin’s iPhone: Um, there's a baseball bat. There's a machete and there's a gun.

611
01:02:50.970 --> 01:03:02.670
Martin’s iPhone: And if somebody is trying to come in here and do harm to them and I come home and he was not able to defend himself because I decided that he couldn't have access to the gun.

612
01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:16.410
Martin’s iPhone: I it's on. It's on my conscience, you know, he would never pick up the gun and randomly try to shoot anything he's not the type of kid and I know a lot of people say that this one.

613
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:22.560
Martin’s iPhone: He has access to guns and his dad's house at his Grandpa's house and

614
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:36.660
Martin’s iPhone: He doesn't touch them unless unless he has permission if somebody comes blasting through the store, and it has the intent to rob us, they might kill them to get away with them.

615
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.220
Martin’s iPhone: And

616
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:41.550
Martin’s iPhone: Give them this the means to protect them. So

617
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.550
Martin’s iPhone: Then I feel like it would be on me.

618
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.640
Martin’s iPhone: Is a hard one. I mean,

619
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.170
Martin’s iPhone: You can go with it.

620
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:51.810
Martin’s iPhone: It will do in the face.

621
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.340
Magalie Marcellus: Why, why

622
01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:07.590
Magalie Marcellus: Right. And this is and I hear, I hear you know use get any with what you sayin you have every right to be scared, but it's just I don't like said it's hard to just have

623
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:17.610
Magalie Marcellus: To me. What am I supposed to have a minor to ever have that thought that. Okay, I may have to defend myself because things are going up.

624
01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:20.430
Martin’s iPhone: The only thing that we told him.

625
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:28.230
Martin’s iPhone: Was I said brace the shotgun is over by my bed. There's nothing in the chamber and the safety zone.

626
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:46.800
Martin’s iPhone: If you ever have any problems. I just want to let you know that it's there. And that's the only any said, Okay, I said, Have you shot a 20 gauge before he says yes so shocked playing games. He went through the list of guns at him and his dad, go to the firing range and all this other stuff.

627
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:56.730
Martin’s iPhone: He's been doing it for years. He, he would know how to no matter what if I kept it unlocked and no boats do

628
01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:57.120
Magalie Marcellus: Not have

629
01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:01.380
Magalie Marcellus: Access to it and his mom is okay with that as well. Yeah.

630
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.810
Martin’s iPhone: But we don't ever want him to have to do that.

631
01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.390
Martin’s iPhone: We have, we are going to all go to the firing range together.

632
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:13.950
Martin’s iPhone: I want to make sure that I see what he knows how to do and what he claims, you know, so do

633
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:19.680
Magalie Marcellus: You have any other security measures measures in place and

634
01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.150

635
01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:30.030
Martin’s iPhone: We have a deer cam that sends a signal to my phone, but we hooked up because

Martin’s iPhone: No problem is that

645
01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:04.020
Martin’s iPhone: There's just so many bad people in this area right now. As soon as Bryce graduates. He's going into the Navy.

646
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:05.340
He's very tall.

647
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:13.440
Martin’s iPhone: He's really settled. So he's called naked recruiter, and they're going to go ahead and set up for tomorrow.

651
01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.680
Magalie Marcellus: Amen. All right.

652
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.700
Martin’s iPhone: I know they're

653
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:32.100
Martin’s iPhone: Bad people everywhere, but

654
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:33.660
Martin’s iPhone: To find an area that

655
01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:34.920
Magalie Marcellus: I agree.

656
01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.980
Magalie Marcellus: Why, then, right, that that's where you'll be let

657
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:39.630
Magalie Marcellus: less concerned about

658
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:41.610
Martin’s iPhone: Yeah, and less people know about

659
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:43.980
Magalie Marcellus: Safety and things right and started

660
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.810
Martin’s iPhone: As a real bad.

661
01:06:48.150 --> 01:07:09.660
Martin’s iPhone: I knew a lot of people and mess with a lot of bad people throughout the years and they know that I'm a really nice guy. And they know that I'm easygoing, they would, they wouldn't expect me to be protecting my my house and already happened once. So now I have to put my garden.

662
01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:19.770
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, again, hopefully, you know, that doesn't come to a point where you do have to use those kind of measures, sorry.

663
01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.900
Martin’s iPhone: I don't even want to catch the gun.

664
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:22.710
Martin’s iPhone: I mean, you

665
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.530
Martin’s iPhone: Never use it for is to go hunting really

666
01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:33.150
Martin’s iPhone: Michelle was good target practice and everything. And I believe that's a good idea. So we all get familiar with it and

667
01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:38.010
Martin’s iPhone: Uh huh. I, that way I know nobody's going to shoot their, their foot off or something.

668
01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:47.580
Martin’s iPhone: Mm hmm. So that's our next step is to go to the firing range and to get some pointers from professionals and things like that.

669
01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:55.020
Martin’s iPhone: But as far as it's just got to this point where I have to defend myself.

670
01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.680
Martin’s iPhone: You know, with a physical weapon.

671
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.260
Magalie Marcellus: Yes, yes, you know,

672
01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.340
Martin’s iPhone: Yes, I got shot and then me when I was 16

673
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.560
Martin’s iPhone: Because me and my buddy.

674
01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:20.850
Martin’s iPhone: We went into an abandoned cabin, and there was a rifle there and my buddy went to pull it up from underneath to see the truck that we read, and it went off and shot me in the knee.

675
01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:26.070
Magalie Marcellus: So I mentioned. So that's the other thing way. You know, sometimes

676
01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:30.690
Magalie Marcellus: It's not malicious. But I think accident happens we

677
01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.230
Magalie Marcellus: Do all that. So yeah, so

678
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:39.270
Martin’s iPhone: Any, any time we handle the gun all all safety measures are going to be taken.

679
01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:40.740
Martin’s iPhone: Every single

680
01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:49.590
Martin’s iPhone: Measure right now though if I don't have it loaded in beside my bed I if somebody was to break in. I wouldn't have time to do anything.

681
01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:53.430
Martin’s iPhone: And that scares me more than just saying

682
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:59.070
Martin’s iPhone: let God handle it because would be dead or injured really bad.

683
01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:00.480
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

684
01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:08.250
Martin’s iPhone: I don't want to let my guard down again least not right. No, no, we're done in this area, the drugs are horrible run here.

685
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:09.480
Martin’s iPhone: I mean,

686
01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:13.470
Martin’s iPhone: Horrible. There are people getting murdered just for the drugs and for the money.

687
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.290
