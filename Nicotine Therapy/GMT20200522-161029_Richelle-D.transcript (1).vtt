00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.410
Jessica A: My brother. She, she said rapists, so

70
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:09.870
Jessica A: My sister's wondering if maybe because he would when he was in the picture, he would have the like you take them to go do stuff with them.

71
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.070
Jessica A: So we're my sister's kind of wondering if maybe my brother did you something to her.

72
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.970
Jessica A: Because why else would she called rate this sheet know nothing about what he had done to be

73
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.340
Richelle Direny: Oh, and you said you said you feel like it's your fault.

74
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.430
Jessica A: Right, because, like I do, that are the days where she tried

75
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.000
Jessica A: hurting yourself.

76
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.310
Jessica A: And if we rather did you stop the tour. Like I feel like

77
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.730
Jessica A: I could have stopped it because

78
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:03.480
Jessica A: You. But then again, nobody really wrote me, me and my sister. It is not that good of a relationship, though.

79
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:11.610
Jessica A: Nobody believed it to up a toy about passed away in a moment. Heard the conversation between me and my brother.

80
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.550
Richelle Direny: I'm so I'm

81
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:26.520
Richelle Direny: So you're blaming yourself because you think that if you had said something about your brother than it wouldn't happen. What

82
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.380
Richelle Direny: But then you said that you told them, but just no one was really believing you

83
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.900
Jessica A: Will basis, though.

84
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.010
Jessica A: Because my parents would like

85
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:52.080
Jessica A: Say stuff to keep me just our part of what we told her, and I lived like

86
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.300
Jessica A: It was her sister good bottler

87
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:08.760
Jessica A: So we really didn't have that struggle relationship. Anyways, because we both got buried our parents just told both of us. So

88
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.480
Jessica A: We kind of lost contact with each other.

89
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.750
Jessica A: We didn't start having contact with each other up until like

90
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.030
Jessica A: Four years ago,

91
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.020
Jessica A: Yeah.

92
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.190
Richelle Direny: So, um,

Richelle Direny: So, this happened on Monday, and she went and saw hospital.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.400
Jessica A: My sister got notified on Sunday.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:09.090
Jessica A: And when they she, you know, raise these said, oh, I didn't try doing anything.

101
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.320
Jessica A: When she says, Dr. Monday, they tried take in her vitals and they see the marks on herbs.

102
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.990
Jessica A: In the hospital that she's at it's just like totally

103
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.390
Jessica A: I took my sister to Columbus on Tuesday.

104
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:40.170
Jessica A: Because she had to be there within 24 hours to sign paperwork. Well, first, I told her that my sister that she get to see her daughter.

105
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.120
Jessica A: And

106
00:09:46.080 --> 00:10:00.060
Jessica A: They like you tell her. What's Gregory they ma these has likes her is both of my niece's have coping mechanisms to help them cope with because they work with counselors is often

107
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.670
Jessica A: Like maybe that the words of the hospital. She has nightmares real bad. So she has a coping mechanism. She hasn't bear

108
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:23.190
Jessica A: Yes, she sleeps with the house with the night terrors and stuff. And the woman looked at my sister said to all the only parents that bring bears that are there was a don't care about their kids just leave the doc come back for them.

109
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.060
Jessica A: It's just, you know, like

110
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.250
Jessica A: They were fashion a league or when she would it

111
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.560
Jessica A: And make fun of the way that she cut her so that she didn't do it right.

112
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.680
Jessica A: The next time she's in the cut straight

113
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.800
Richelle Direny: So she hit her wrist and so the cat in the other kids know that this is what she did.

114
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.310
Jessica A: You know the tour nurses that says this stuff to her.

115
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.280
Richelle Direny: Oh, that it was they told her that the next time.

116
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.650
Jessica A: Yeah, that's the next time that she tries to kill herself. She's cut straight across the up and down.

117
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.820
Richelle Direny: Nursing nurse and a half. Oh, sorry.

118
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:21.630
Jessica A: Yeah, like this place is just like they they told my sister that the only parents that bring barisan are the ones that leave their kids are and don't come back for them, but don't care about that.

119
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.100
Jessica A: It's just

120
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.340
Jessica A: Been like every time I these calls like

121
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:39.120
Jessica A: She's like doing any better. And she's just, I don't know, like at this point, like

122
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:55.350
Jessica A: I feel like me and my sister both feel like she should be, you know, put somewhere else somewhere that's going to help for the we like, look, this place up online is nothing but bad reviews and negative connotation. So

123
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:05.940
Jessica A: Maybe they were supposed to set something up on zoom. So by these could visit us, is they will letter.

124
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.790
Richelle Direny: That's that's interesting that

125
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.780
Richelle Direny: That the nurses will say that

126
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:30.600
Jessica A: And then my sister asked my sister was on the phone with my niece and she says, Well, let me talk to one of your nurses nurses, like what does she want like we heard her say that

127
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.020
Jessica A: And I'm just like, wow, you know,

128
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:43.170
Jessica A: But I kind of like it's my fault that she's there because like i guess i expect more out of her because

129
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:57.600
Jessica A: My other niece is autistic and have a towel. The other three or four year old so i i feel like i expect more out of the hospital because

130
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.860
Jessica A: You know she's she more mature.

131
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:09.270
Jessica A: And I just, I feel like it's my fault because I yelled at her that they were trying to do it.

132
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.290
Richelle Direny: And what were you, what did you yell at her for

133
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.520
Jessica A: Well, cuz she has her sister, boo. But

134
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:29.250
Jessica A: She like I said to her, she would like look directly at me.

135
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.130
Jessica A: So I do you like something had gone wrong it

136
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:42.390
Jessica A: Was this other girls around. She's just hard to talk to. She's hard to

137
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:44.790
Jessica A: You know,

138
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.000
Jessica A: Do anything with it.

139
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:54.090
Jessica A: I yelled at her and she takes I don't love her, but I do

140
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.650
Richelle Direny: I mean, the thing is,

141
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.630
Richelle Direny: To say that it's you know you know so much

142
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:22.260
Richelle Direny: emotion or feeling to say to think that, you know, or two, one to blame yourself.

143
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:28.710
Richelle Direny: That it just goes to, there's just some she's been struggling with a lot and maybe haven't really spoken.

144
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:46.020
Richelle Direny: Um, so you know it's it's no one's there's no blame here because it's just one of those things where it's a lot. The headline going on with her that she hadn't express and the fact that she was being bullied.

145
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:58.980
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, the question is, how much did anyone know what was going on with her in terms of the bullying. That was just an outward expression of what she was feeling

146
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:15.600
Richelle Direny: Or what was going on in her mind. So it's just one of those situation where it's just more being there for her being more supportive and understanding as to the pain that she was feeling especially knowing of the past.

147
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:18.720
Richelle Direny: Abuse

148
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.600
Richelle Direny: Just being there for her, you know, I'm sure, just like how you feel.

149
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.620
Richelle Direny: You're, you're someone kind of

150
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.980
Richelle Direny: blaming yourself. I'm sure your sister as her mother is feeling the same way.

151
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.060
Richelle Direny: And having to know that this is where her daughter is

152
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.480
Richelle Direny: And there's not a whole lot that she can do

153

Richelle Direny: You know, I'm sure she feels super enraged

159
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.470
Jessica A: Yeah, it would be when she called my brother and rapists.

160
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.830
Jessica A: She just was kind of like it shot because

161
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:22.830

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:41.460
Jessica A: That would be very appropriate for me to do it very you know that like me to do. So it's like, you know, where did she get that

164
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.240
Richelle Direny: She has older sibling.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.420
Yeah.

168
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.620

169
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:12.690
Jessica A: Like the other day that he found out he started like pudgy stop it.

170
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.270
You know,

171
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.530
Jessica A: My son, her, her cousin.

172
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.740
Jessica A: Maybe her older sister thinks that it's it's

173
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.640
Jessica A: Like we're all busy.

174
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.080
Richelle Direny: It's her fault.

175
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:43.950
Jessica A: Like she she say that like everybody's like very much labor there. So play with scissors. You think of that it's her fault. I think it's my law.

176
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.520
Jessica A: her older sister thinks that it's all

177
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:54.720
Jessica A: In my son says he would have been there for more than maybe he could have texted her

178
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:03.420
Jessica A: Like it's just everybody's you know saying, well, you know, if I wanted this you know maybe shorter than that.

179
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.780
Jessica A: It's like the What If game like

180
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.860
Richelle Direny: I hear you. I can't hear you.

181
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.310
Jessica A: Sorry, somebody was trying to call it.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:25.950
Jessica A: Do you hear me.

183
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.250
Jessica A: Okay, yes, somebody was trying to call it.

184
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.060
Jessica A: But everybody like playing the What If game. Like if I would have this. What if I could have that

185
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.180
Jessica A: And

186
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:44.250
Jessica A: I guess the thing is, is the question that's in my know

187
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.170
Jessica A: Is if my brother didn't do anything to her.

188
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.070
Jessica A: You know,

189
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:58.950
Jessica A: I don't know.

190
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.590
Jessica A: Why we rather

191
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.850
Jessica A: Go after her.

192
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:19.200
Richelle Direny: But but ok so for a moment, this is speculation, because you don't you don't know. She does. She ate your brother her Uncle Tom abused her in that way.

193
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:27.750

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:50.100
Richelle Direny: Investigation. Now when did it come out. Did it just come out after the attempted suicide that she on that that so your sister prior to this wasn't aware of the sexual abuse.

219
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.850

Jessica A: Sometimes

224
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.330
Jessica A: You know, there would be

225
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.430
Jessica A: Just like what my brother took my side of the truck with

226
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.940
Jessica A: I wasn't aware of it by sound come back like he was like

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:34.290
Richelle Direny: But it did. Now is your sister pressing charges are they going to know investigated.

233
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:48.390

234
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.440
Richelle Direny: Were their charges pressed against her father.

235
00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.220
Jessica A: Though they

238
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:20.940

239
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.420

242
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.120
Richelle Direny: From the Father, and the Father. Yeah.

243
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:43.770
Richelle Direny: Okay.

244
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.450
Richelle Direny: Um,

245
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.740
Richelle Direny: You know, as I said, a lot of it is

246
00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:53.190

247
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:59.820

250
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:32.850

251
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:37.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Yeah, but then still dealing with your own

252
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:49.950
Richelle Direny: emotional and mental trauma from what occurred with you, especially, it hits closer to home because your brother's name is being called in and off.

253
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:51.660
Jessica A: Right.

254
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.550

Richelle Direny: Yo,

257
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:07.860
Richelle Direny: Yo, let's just bringing in such a rush of emotions and

261
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:27.480
Richelle Direny: feeling helpless that there's nothing you could have done to stop it, because here it is that he did it to you. And now he had the opportunity to

262
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:34.830
Richelle Direny: Someone else closer to you. And who's to say, whoever else it's been done to

263
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.610

Jessica A: Movies movie out of this area, period.

309
00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:47.820
Jessica A: Like moving an hour, even an hour away. You know, like towards the Columbus area.

310
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.570
Jessica A: Just to get away from

311
00:29:52.680 --> 00:30:04.050
Jessica A: The people in our past. And I mean you can't run from it but just just the new cage, a change for all of us, you know,

312
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:17.730
Richelle Direny: It's a change. I think it's just really, it seems like within the family. There's just so much that's going on.

313
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:32.190
Richelle Direny: There's so much that needs to be addressed. There's so much that needs to be talks about, um, the dynamic between each family member of yours so much like what's your dad's on limits and involvement and kind of his viewpoint, with everything with you, mourning the loss of your mom still

314
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:38.190
Richelle Direny: And I know you said that it's coming up for the memorial on to spread her ashes is coming up soon.

315
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:47.190
Richelle Direny: And now this with your adult your nice attempted suicide because of you know her bullying her being bullied and just the past

316
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:54.870
Richelle Direny: Trauma that she's experiencing now you're, you're, you're so it's a lot. It is a lot that's going on in the family.

317
00:30:55.230 --> 00:31:02.040
Richelle Direny: Farm with your own medical issues that you're going through and just so much uncertainties and soul so much unanswered questions.

318
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:10.770
Richelle Direny: Um, you know, there it is. It's a lot. Jessica, that you're trying to process. And so while you're trying to work on.

319
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:23.280
Richelle Direny: Getting them better hold on your medical things that's going on you're dealing with a brother who was abusive. In the past, in and out your life you you're dealing with an unsupportive father, he kind of runs in when he wants to and runs out.

320
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:36.090
Richelle Direny: You're still dealing with, you know, processing the loss of your mom and here is this new thing coming down. So it's like, it's very hard for you to really truly process. Anything I know in the past that you had ended up in the domestic violence.

321
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:43.920
Richelle Direny: Shelter, for whatever reason, that was surrounding whatever the story is that was surrounding back so

322
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:45.870
Richelle Direny: It's a lack

323
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.710
Richelle Direny: There came a little somewhat of a

324
00:31:51.360 --> 00:32:02.370
Richelle Direny: Some, some positive things that came out of it with your son, you're working on the relationship and, you know, improving the relationship with your son, which was very important and meaningful to you.

325
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:16.230
Richelle Direny: And so we talked about Jessica in the past that having family around you is was a very important, but there's there's so much going on within this family context that's to some degree that's somewhat. Yeah, it has some

326
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:26.010
Richelle Direny: There's some toxic ness in it. Not to say that they're being toxic to you, but it's going to be very hard for you.

327
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:33.000
Richelle Direny: To for you, your personal self to feel for you to work through and get through what it is that you're going through

328
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:40.680
Richelle Direny: With so many different things that's going on with each individual family member that you want to be so close to and be a part of and

329
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:53.280
Richelle Direny: You know, just the accepted within there's just so much that's going on that. Now you're going to get to that place where you're going to start blaming yourself for everything that happens to everybody else.

330
00:32:54.660 --> 00:33:08.070
Richelle Direny: And you're going to feel like there is some part of you is going to feel like I'm whether you contributed or there was no contribution. But just having that sense of responsibility for everything that's going on with everybody else and that

331
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:15.600
Richelle Direny: Is going to be very hard for you to accept that you hold no responsibility to it. There are things that happened.

332
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:21.720
Richelle Direny: There's things that's happening to people to access to people within your family and

333
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:34.050
Richelle Direny: It has nothing to do with you. It doesn't mean that you don't care. It just means that they're just bad things that's happening to people and those people just happened to be your family.

334
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.490
Right.

335
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.760
Richelle Direny: So,

336
00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:46.140
Richelle Direny: You know, you want to be there for you. You're nice as much as possible. You know firsthand what that looks like.

337
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:58.560
Richelle Direny: For everything that's going on because of what happened to you that sense of feeling abandoned that sense of beat because like, here it is. Her father violated her there's that sense of also abandonment, because now he's not around.

338
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:10.260
Richelle Direny: There is, you know, Mom. Attention is is a lot, probably on this, you know, autistic child that she has. And so a lot of our time and attention goes into that.

339
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:16.260
Richelle Direny: So here it is that now your sister could be blaming herself in that aspect. Because here it is these bad things are happening.

340
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:33.480
Richelle Direny: And you know she has so much that she's dealing with and having to take care of. And the question is, how is she coping with it. And the same goes for you with you, trying to work on the relationship with your son, you know, everyone is everyone is somewhat surviving

341
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:46.170
Richelle Direny: Right. Everybody is in survival mode, everybody within your families on survival mode. How are you guys surviving is the ultimate question, how are you coping. What are you using Nicole what outlet. Are you using Nicole.

342
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.600
Richelle Direny: You go to group you're you're part of a program, you have a counselor. Is everybody has the same thing.

343
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:59.280
Richelle Direny: And so you just have to work on building yourself up emotionally and mentally so that you can be there for everybody else.

344
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:08.430
Richelle Direny: And in this place. Honestly, I have to say that you trying to be there for everybody else is just not a good situation. So it's a recipe for your own disaster and destruction.

345
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:16.020
Richelle Direny: And that's the quality and sounds bad, but it's the reality of what is for you. You're so vulnerable, you're still

346
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:28.020
Richelle Direny: You're still where you are because you have so much on your plate that you're dealing with. One more thing attitude to it just weaken your defenses to some regard

347
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:30.720
Jessica A: Right.

348
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:44.070
Richelle Direny: Well, yes. Do you want to be there for your nice as much as you can. And that's really it is as much as you can. Are you going to abandon her no are you going to abandon your sister. No.

349
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:53.880
Richelle Direny: But what you are, what you can say is, I'll be there for you as much as I can because we're all individually hurting people trying to figure out how to get through all of this.

350
00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.300
Richelle Direny: You're every single last one of your individually hurting from different things.

351
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.410
Jessica A: Right.

352
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:12.750
Richelle Direny: But you may be more because of the loss of your mother. You're still going through that her your sister may be more because of that start with having this this child has autism.

353
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:21.930
Richelle Direny: A husband dad was an abusive abandoned who has that abandonment relationship abandonment down with the children the violation of the children.

354
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.300
Richelle Direny: I mean, your sister has her own thing. Your dad with the loss of his wife and everything else that's going on with him.

355
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:35.010
Richelle Direny: Your brother everything that's going on with him, even though he violated you and everybody else. Well, where were all of that came from his issues that he's are

356
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:51.060
Richelle Direny: Your son. So every single person that's within your family bubble. They're all hurting in their very individual ways. When you're ready, is that you guys are trying to come together for each other. You're trying your best to do that.

357
00:36:52.590 --> 00:37:00.810
Richelle Direny: You're really truly trying your best to do that. And so what each of you are hurting. Here's something that just happened. Something just got inducted into that bubble

358
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:10.350
Richelle Direny: And now, each of you are personalizing it and conceptualizing it in very different ways. And now that's just adding more to the hurt and the pain that each person is dealing with

359
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.180
Richelle Direny: And so how do you, how do you guys get through it.

360
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:34.170
Richelle Direny: Be there for each other as much as you are able to, but first and foremost is that you have to work on yourself individually and everything that is coming along with it because your past is still there. And every day something new is being added to it.

361
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:35.760
Jessica A: Yeah.

362
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:47.250
Richelle Direny: But you know what the skills that you're learning and how you're processing it. And as it's related to your past, it's going to help with everything else that comes along, because nothing happened. Nothing is new under the sun, which means that

363
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:55.110
Richelle Direny: No matter what the situation is no matter what it is somebody else has gone through it and even though it's for first time for you hurt is hurt.

364
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.370
Jessica A: Right.

365
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:08.820
Richelle Direny: Hurt is hurt. It's not like a, I'm a different way to hurt. It's not a different hurt is her there is not there there. One may say there love different levels of hurt. Hurt he's hurt.

366
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.460
Richelle Direny: Broken is broken.

367
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.800
Jessica A: You understand, yeah.

368
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.840
Richelle Direny: I'm Pain is pain.

369
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:26.340
Richelle Direny: They're not different. The Pain is pain. Maybe our threshold for each thing that we're seeing is a little bit different. Our tolerance is different.

370
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:42.930
Richelle Direny: For each thing that you experienced an encounter hurt pain devastation disappointment. They're all the same in the sense that it's coming at me. How do I do with it and how to I want

371
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:45.420
Richelle Direny: Cope with it.

372
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:59.490
Richelle Direny: How do I get through it not get over it not get under it. How do I get through it morning comes. But I got to get tonight, I can't jump over it.

373
00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:05.640
Richelle Direny: I got to go through it. I gotta what how do I walk through it without falling apart.

374
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.260
Jessica A: Right.

375
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.220
Richelle Direny: How do I go through it without dying in the process.

376
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.570
And

377
00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.200
Richelle Direny: Easy way out of it. How do I go through it.

378
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:27.030
Richelle Direny: That's the conversation. And that's what we have to work with. How do I go through with each hurt devastation both past and present.

379
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.670
Richelle Direny: I first have to work on me.

380
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:36.810
Richelle Direny: And I have to first be willing to get rid of one thing at a time, not everything.

381
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:44.610
Richelle Direny: Rice chicken salad. This that is all on the plate you can consume it all. You can only do it one at a time.

382
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.440
Jessica A: Right.

383
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:54.180
Richelle Direny: You could probably mix a little thing up and eat it, which can't consume it all, one at a time.

384
00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:55.710
Jessica A: Right.

385
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:12.540
Richelle Direny: And for you. It is working through what is for you. Your primary. What is the primary thing that stands out for you daily that you're faced with daily that you're trying to get through the day, what is the one thing for you.

386
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.970
Jessica A: One thing daily learn, try to get through.

387
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:34.260
Jessica A: Would be that I'm, I'm, I mean my past my past there. I mean, I can't forgive my brother.

388
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:41.460
Jessica A: I mean I guess I I'll never forget about it but

389
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:49.110
Richelle Direny: I forgive you can forgive. It's hard. You can forgive

390
00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:57.270
Richelle Direny: What's not gonna, you're not going to forget you can't forget it, because it's happened. It's something that happened, you won't forget it.

391
00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:12.720
Richelle Direny: You will forgive and you're forgiving and you'll be able to forgive him. It's not telling him that it was okay, what he did, it's never that you're forgiving, so you can release the hurt you can release the pain that you walk around with every day.

392
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.660
Jessica A: Right. Yes. Yes.

393
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:19.650
Jessica A: That's what they let I am trying to

394
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.130
Jessica A: To go to get through.

395
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:38.220
Jessica A: In the relationship with my son. I mean, my son has you will be that mom I Boys, boys, going to be here for you. My, my son's will be that he forgives me

396
00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:45.780
Jessica A: For everything that you know that I have put him through and

397
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.000
Richelle Direny: Thank you for gives you for everything that you've put him through

398
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:58.860
Jessica A: Like exposing him to the negativity of

399
00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.640
Jessica A: Like my husband like

400
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:15.060
Jessica A: In the abuse it, you know, I never used drugs around him, that that's one thing that I never really did. I never ever ever use drugs around him. Like I made sure that he was in a safe place.

401
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:33.600
Jessica A: I made sure that he was only always taken care of and he'll tell anyone that the part that he forgives me for is is like a BNA leaving him with, you know, people and not being a mom to him when I should. He's told me that he forgives me for that.

402
00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:45.960
Jessica A: For that he understands that I did it for a reason to make sure that he was okay. And he told me that he he's never stop loving me. He's always going to love me, and he only wants what's best for

403
00:42:47.430 --> 00:43:01.560
Jessica A: You know, in I guess, knowing that my son is okay if you know that he forgives me has released. So a lot of like, you know, guilt in my head of

404
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:13.710
Jessica A: Me blaming myself because, you know, but he's a he's a great kid he's he's got a job full time job. He's a manager at a restaurant know he's still in school.

405
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:15.480
Jessica A: You know,

406
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:31.470
Richelle Direny: Just said listen to what I want you to hold it for a second. I want you to listen when you set him saying to you, Mom, I forgive you for everything that happened or whatever he forgave me for for you what it did for you, it released the guilt because

407
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.080
Richelle Direny: A lot of times

408
00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:40.650
Richelle Direny: As parents as individuals. First, who has a pass.

409
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.770
Richelle Direny: Unresolved pass

410
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.070
Richelle Direny: And however it's it

411
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:51.300
Richelle Direny: Is whatever that path consists of we have a pass.

412
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.320
Richelle Direny: Now we bring forth a child in this

413
00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.680
Richelle Direny: Through the hurt and through sometimes

414
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:11.190
Richelle Direny: The decisions we've made because of our paths and the journeys. We've gone on because of our past a child came forth and in our best in our infinite wisdom.

415
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:26.100
Richelle Direny: Our own infinite wisdom of what we think is best. We're doing things that we think is best for our child in the end, it ends up hurting them. And so here it is. Now they have a story to tell.

416
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:43.290
Richelle Direny: You understand, based on what I thought was best in the end I recognize that whole crap, all I was doing because I still had the baggage from my past. Somehow I allow that baggage to come on my child until now, my child.

417
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.000
Richelle Direny: has issues with me.

418
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:57.630
Richelle Direny: While I still have issues with my past. And so, your son is saying, Okay, I'm going to stop here and Mom, I'm going to say I forgive you I forgive you, because I know you tried your best

419
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:08.520
Richelle Direny: And even though you thought it was good for you. You didn't know that all it was doing was hurting me you maybe you didn't recognize it was hurting me because of your own path of what you went through.

420
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:20.040
Richelle Direny: And you were trying your best to do otherwise but ended up that this happened. So I forgive you for that. So that him doing it was for me to help him.

421
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:34.200
Richelle Direny: Even though it helps you to release that guilt of everything that was going on and what you carried with you because of what happened with your son. Ultimately, it helps him to you understand what forgiveness does

422
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.520
Jessica A: Yeah.

423
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:41.070
Richelle Direny: Forgiveness is not for the person necessarily that you're forgiving. It's for you.

424
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:42.450
Jessica A: Real yeah

425
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.920
Richelle Direny: It's really for you.

426
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:55.440
Richelle Direny: I'm not telling you that, Jessica, I am in full acceptance and I agree with what you did. That's what our mind tells us we're doing it. That's why we hold on to this forgiveness and that's why it's We're drowning.

427
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.900
Richelle Direny: In this hurt and pain because if I tell you I forgive you. It means no, it doesn't.

428
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:02.160
Jessica A: Right.

429
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:12.000
Richelle Direny: And I remember what you did. Yes, it does. But I'm forgiving you because I'm suffocating I'm dying on the inside. And because I'm holding on to this.

430
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:20.400
Richelle Direny: I am making a lot of decisions and the things that I'm doing simply because of me holding on to their life for it and I need to release it.

431
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:31.920
Richelle Direny: I need to release you, I need to let you go and go throughout yourself. But what I'm going to do, I'm going to work on me. So I can now start sinking and learn how to breathe.

432
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.350
Richelle Direny: And work through. So now,

433
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:45.480
Richelle Direny: Morning started I'm slowly getting tonight I'm getting through the day to get tonight, and that's what we're doing. That's what forgiveness. Does it helps me to get through with ease.

434
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.190
Richelle Direny: Because there's other that's going to come. So that's what forgiveness does

435
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.950
Richelle Direny: You will, you will you will remember it.

436
00:46:53.970 --> 00:47:04.260
Richelle Direny: I remember things that people have done to me, but I don't allow it to eat what I do right now and how I operate. I don't allow

437
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:19.560
Richelle Direny: To ruin my whole day because I'm so focused on it. I'm so I'm holding on to it. It's like, I, I feel like if I forgive. I'm going to let go of them. No, you ain't gonna let go. Mmm, are gonna be there. You always memory.

438
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:23.370
Jessica A: Right.

439
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:39.720
Richelle Direny: So I think with for you. And also, just because he's your brother. I mean you didn't choose him as your brother. He didn't choose you as a sister again. He has a story, and I'm not justifying his actions. But he also has a story.

440
00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:45.510
Richelle Direny: Maybe something happened to him. I don't know. But this is what I can say

441
00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:55.260
Richelle Direny: I don't have to be around you. You're my brother. Yes, we have the same DNA. Yes. But guess what, I'll have to be around you. I don't have to see you.

442
00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.490
Right.

443
00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:02.340
Jessica A: Now, I haven't heard from him ever since I stopped up for myself so

444
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.480
Richelle Direny: So I don't have to be around you. I don't have to see you.

445
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:15.150
Richelle Direny: Especially now that you're hearing that he continues to do what he does. Hey, I feel sorry for him that he's not getting the help that he needs.

446
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.350
Jessica A: Right.

447
00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:20.550
Richelle Direny: Here for him. But, you know, for me, being around that is not good for me.

448
00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:27.570
Jessica A: You know, and I'm wondering if him being a truck driver is him running away from everything that he's done.

449
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:29.340
Richelle Direny: It could be

450
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:37.530
Jessica A: Did he ever have to be around because I have to to watch all of us suffer why he sat back and destroyed all of our lives.

451
00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.970
Richelle Direny: It could be that, but it could also be him running away from dealing with his own issues.

452
00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:54.000
Richelle Direny: Again, I'm not saying that, you know, I'm not validating anything but looking at it from a different perspective.

453
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:55.770
Jessica A: Right.

454
00:48:56.910 --> 00:49:10.230
Richelle Direny: Something happened to him at some point in life. Remember, we're not all born to be child molesters or murderers or liars or thieves or this or that you were not something happened along the way.

455
00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:12.240
Jessica A: Right.

456
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:13.650
Richelle Direny: We become

457
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.080
Richelle Direny: Is it right

458
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:22.230
Richelle Direny: Who we become if it's bad. No, it's not. Right. But we have a story.

459
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:26.580
Richelle Direny: You have an addiction. Right.

460
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:38.970
Richelle Direny: Into our shun you because of your history of addiction or to say, Jessica has a story she self medicated with those drugs. I wonder why.

461
00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:44.040
Richelle Direny: Then I gave you the opportunity to sit and listen to your story.

462
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:58.470
Richelle Direny: Then I'm like, whoa. So all this time you were bullying me all the time you look down to me all this time you treated me the way you're treating. And that was because you were operating out of your own hurt from your past.

463
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:04.770
Richelle Direny: It doesn't mean just because I forgave you. It doesn't mean I don't forget what you did.

464
00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.960
Jessica A: Right.

465
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:12.300
Richelle Direny: I don't didn't forget what you did. Maybe I have some sense of understanding

466
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:19.530
Richelle Direny: I'll still choose not to be around and to be close to you, but I have some sense of understanding

467
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:21.960
Jessica A: Right.

468
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:35.370
Richelle Direny: People are giving that opportunity. Some people aren't forgiving is Forgiving. Forgiving means that whether I know your store. I don't know your story. I'm still choosing the road for forgiveness because I needed.

469
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:35.790
Change.

470
00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:37.710
Jessica A: Right.

471
00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.960
Richelle Direny: If you benefit from it. Okay, well you did, but I still needed for me.

472
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:47.220
Jessica A: Right.

473
00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.100
Jessica A: Oh,

474
00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:58.680
Jessica A: Yes, it's been a really emotional weight.

475
00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:02.940
Jessica A: And I started writing in a journal more like

476
00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:08.400
Jessica A: Of like

477
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:15.360
Jessica A: Things that come to my memory that like might have happened in my childhood.

478
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:24.030
Jessica A: Like if I have a nightmare. Like I'll wake up and in. Alright, you know, down what I remember.

479
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:36.660
Jessica A: You know, it's just, it's just little things that come to my mind that I remember from my childhood that might have affected you know

480
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:45.060
Jessica A: Me as a human being, you know, as an adult, today, you know,

481
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:53.400
Jessica A: Why I don't want to feel affection from from other people. Why I don't want to

482
00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.080
Jessica A: Like the relationship that I have with my fiance like

483
00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:08.970
Jessica A: Why do I do the things that I do to him. I take all my anger out on him. I click on my question, I shut down on him. I

484
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:10.080
You

485
00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:15.240
Jessica A: Know I my, my, you know, my, my boy.

486
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:24.090
Jessica A: You know i i take all my anger, frustration and everything out on him because

487
00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:33.030
Jessica A: In, in, you know, I didn't tell him. Sorry. Every day you know like snapping at him.

488
00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:42.360
Jessica A: And it's not his fault. It's really not you know he doesn't do anything. He tries to help me. If anything,

489
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:46.050
Jessica A: You know, and I just

490
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:51.720
Jessica A: Treat him like he doesn't exist. And I shouldn't treat him like that.

491
00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:58.440
Richelle Direny: Mm hmm. Because all of the anger and frustration and everything.

492
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.280
Richelle Direny: Do you understand what the word displaced me

493
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:06.300
Jessica A: Not really.

494
00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:15.450
Richelle Direny: Placed means that all of the anger and frustration and everything that you feel for, let's say your brother.

495
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:20.880
Richelle Direny: Or your dad you take it and you put it on someone else.

496
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:23.220
Jessica A: Right.

497
00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:30.360
Richelle Direny: So it's just released feelings displaced emotions you took everything all of the rat.

498
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:32.190
Richelle Direny: Pack that you're unleashing on him.

499
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:45.870
Richelle Direny: Excuse me. He ultimately is the punching bag really and truly all of that really belongs to your brother, your dad. Your, your everyone in your life was hurt you. That's who it really belongs to

500
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:54.270
Richelle Direny: But you take it all and because of this person is not going to respond to you how those people will

501
00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.510
Richelle Direny: Use really release it all because there are somewhat of a safe haven and understanding that

502
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:12.990
Richelle Direny: They will take it and they're not going to treat me how other people will they're still going to love me. So it's almost like your comfort. So you displace everything on this individual.

503
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:22.770
Richelle Direny: And sometimes here in that that like, Listen, I'm like, you're, you're taking out a whole lot of unnecessary frustration, like all I said was high, we're lacking from

504
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:39.870
Richelle Direny: Because you have so much overwhelming emotion that maybe he walked into a path where he said something that wasn't legitimately upsetting. But now, guess what, because you will already bubbling over now you just vomited everything on him.

505
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:48.990
Richelle Direny: Where that didn't belong to him. It belongs to the people who are really belong to, but they're not here for you to let them have it.

506
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:59.700
Richelle Direny: Because you feel the way you feel about your dad and you kind of want that relationship. So, you know what, in your mind, even though you're upset. You're not going to give it to him, simply because if I do tell him exactly how I feel.

507
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:10.920
Richelle Direny: You will walk away from me for life. If I tell my brother exactly how I feel. This is how he's probably going to respond to me so I couldn't. So you see how that how our minds work.

508
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:20.670
Richelle Direny: I run it to them. But somehow, your mind tells you not to. Because if you just so you've already rationalized it so your mind says, hey, just give it to him.

509
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:28.290
Richelle Direny: He ain't gonna do. He's not gonna respond to them. Hell, maybe your mind is like you know what the if he walks away, man. Maybe if I vomited to him.

510
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:36.000
Richelle Direny: Maybe he'll walk away for real. And I don't have to deal with him. Or maybe he's not going to respond and he's still going to love me anyway. Your mind has already rationalize

511
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:47.100
Richelle Direny: How things the outcome of your emotions. So now you display it or you displace it to somebody else and that's what displacement is

512
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:58.230
Richelle Direny: You took all of that anger and frustration, you put it on something else. But it was really meant for the next person. And that's how we all function without realizing it. That's how we all function.

513
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:14.370
Richelle Direny: My managers pissing me off right now. Jessica, you came on this computer screen and you sent the wrong word to me. Now I flip on you, and you're like, hold up. Well, what does all that for because I was already upset with my manager and now you are just receiving my wrath.

514
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:22.470
Richelle Direny: My anger has nothing to do with you but hey you walked in my past. So then therefore guess one on that you have

515
00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:34.050
Richelle Direny: Because there are repercussions to my wrath with you, but if I did it to the other person. There's going to be repercussions. So my mind has already figured that out.

516
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:37.140
Jessica A: Right.

517
00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:43.530
Richelle Direny: So in this case I'm going back to I know one of our goals was for you to join a little bit, little bit more

518
00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:53.190
Richelle Direny: And so with everything that went on. I would love you to journal, especially like with your nice what's going on with your nice and everything that's surrounding that.

519
00:56:53.490 --> 00:57:04.050
Richelle Direny: And what does that like the emotions that you're feeling as it's related to your nice and you having that like self blame. I want you to put it in a just kind of journal it

520
00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:14.820
Richelle Direny: And bring it to you, like, what does that feel for how does that feel for you. What is it doing for you right now, and maybe the next time that we meet you can read it and we can process it.

521
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:22.980
Jessica A: Okay.

522
00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:27.060
Richelle Direny: Let me look what what what are you going to do for the next our next session.

523
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:36.690
Jessica A: Jerome, a feeling bad about a nice and lively may so is over it next time that we meet

524
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:37.650
Mm hmm.

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:39.690

Richelle Direny: So that's what you're used to throw it on for your reminders.

539
00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:27.420
Jessica A: Yeah, yeah. I'll show you. Let me show you this. It's kind of neat, but you can write

540
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:29.520
Jessica A: See this

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:53.490
Richelle Direny: That's pretty neat. That's pretty neat. I mean, and then you have it on your phone because you could also use your phone send you alerts to

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:55.320
Jessica A: Right, well I

545
00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.670
Jessica A: Remember what happened with that it was like sending me duplicate alerts.

546
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:12.510
Jessica A: So I just figured like this, I could just look at in the planner that I had in my

547
01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.620
Jessica A: I keep switching back and forth the planar that I had in my my

548
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:28.800
Jessica A: Purse. I don't know. I lost it, I guess.

549
01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.460
Jessica A: I like to switch purses too much so.

550
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.720
Richelle Direny: I know that's the, that's the purse. The woman thing in the purse.

551
01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.220
Richelle Direny: Yeah, kinda. I'm kind of given up on person because I'm tired of switching them over.

552
01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:57.390
Jessica A: Yeah, like I've got like for Christmas. I got two guests versus like course first and then even though I got those for Christmas, like me and my sister went to the

553
01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:12.870
Jessica A: thrift store yesterday, and we both ran into each other and we have like 10 purses in our cart. We were like, at the same time I eat your help, you know, it was just, you know, something to kind of like

554
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:15.540
Jessica A: You know, fun to do, and

555
01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:17.430
Jessica A: So,

556
01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:25.530
Jessica A: Plus I'm gaining weight. So all my clothes are getting too tight on me. So I got a couple pairs of pants that actually fit.

557
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:28.860
Jessica A: My

558
01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:39.930
