Natalie Austin: Yeah, we're here to help you and guide you. So if we just give you a month and we don't see for Monday, and I don't know how you're doing so.

476
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:29.640
Chassidy Saunders: Well, yeah.

477
00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.010
Natalie Austin: It's all basically

478
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.650
Chassidy Saunders: I enjoy group session.

479
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.780
Chassidy Saunders: Do you good

480
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.750
Natalie Austin: Did you do that at the last place that you were at

481
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.280
Chassidy Saunders: X. He said, Did I go to group meetings in the last place.

482
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:53.670
Chassidy Saunders: Yeah. Um, well, we are actually we didn't have groups like was a big group of people, we

483
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:55.590
Chassidy Saunders: Won't

484
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.270
Chassidy Saunders: I think about we do it.

485
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.240
Chassidy Saunders: Is called intensive outpatient

486
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:19.050
Chassidy Saunders: We will do a group goes twice a week and then like after you graduated from that. It's like once a week. I did do that. And I did one on one therapy and I definitely I enjoyed it. I'm not gonna lie.

487
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.390
Natalie Austin: I didn't know

488
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.410
Natalie Austin: That. Do you ever recovered ask you. Were you ever in inpatient rehab.

489
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.870
Chassidy Saunders: Oh, I have never been and rehab.

490
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:35.790
Natalie Austin: Okay, so what was the inpatient group that you're talking about up through

491
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:41.100
Chassidy Saunders: From it was intact. Yeah, I was out, it was actually an outpatient

492
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.450
intensive outpatient

493
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.740
Chassidy Saunders: ERC it's actually a part of drug court.

494
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:48.840
Natalie Austin: Okay, tired.

495
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:58.200
Chassidy Saunders: Like the first. I don't know, like they don't go based on like paperwork assignments that you get done. It's basically if they see that you're getting better.

496
00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.490
Chassidy Saunders: On the first half of it. You go through time. Why

497
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:18.750
Chassidy Saunders: Don't you go two or three times a week for like literally three or four hours and then you move up to just like once or twice a week to like an hour, two hours. And I mean, I was in it, for I have a binder full of papers.

498
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.440
Natalie Austin: Oh, how long is that does that go on for a couple months.

499
00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.690
Chassidy Saunders: Um, I was in an RC for about

500
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.110
Chassidy Saunders: Well drug courts, a year.

501
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.360
Chassidy Saunders: I was in it for at least a year.

502
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:38.820
Natalie Austin: Oh, I didn't realize it was that long does it that you do that time.

503
00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:41.820
Chassidy Saunders: Yeah, it's based on how well you're doing too.

504
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.110
Oh, OK.

505
00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.540
Natalie Austin: Now you do that instead of jail. Is that correct, is that kind of like a probation.

506
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.110
Natalie Austin: Look, you're cutting out

507
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.070
Chassidy Saunders: I said, what did you say I'm

508
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.130
Chassidy Saunders: Cut out right as you start saying, oh,

509
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.110
Natalie Austin: Is that like probation.

510
00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:12.150
Natalie Austin: Like being on

511
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.050
Chassidy Saunders: I think

512
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.510
Chassidy Saunders: I'm not. I don't know if I heard you correctly or not.

513
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:30.030
Natalie Austin: This is drug court going to drug court. Is that like being on probation. Is that what you're avoiding jail. Is that what that is.

514
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.530
Chassidy Saunders: No, I'm, I'm actually

515
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.300
Chassidy Saunders: I'm

516
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:42.000
Chassidy Saunders: I got off of misdemeanor probation and

517
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.850
Natalie Austin: That's one of the stipulations for it.

518
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.730
Chassidy Saunders: Yeah I graduated

519
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.270
Chassidy Saunders: Everything and then it was

520
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:56.460
Chassidy Saunders: Good.

521
00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:02.610
Chassidy Saunders: I find like

522
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:05.970
Chassidy Saunders: Nothing like that.

523
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:09.390
Natalie Austin: You graduated

524
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:10.980
Chassidy Saunders: Oh, thank you.

525
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:11.790
Yeah.

526
00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.550
Chassidy Saunders: Um, I just

527
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.310
Chassidy Saunders: I knew I mean everybody knows as just taste you

528
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:38.190
Natalie Austin: Okay.

529
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.870
Natalie Austin: I'm gonna send you an email to get a drug screen.

530
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:50.580
Natalie Austin: And monthly or just one time labs, you're going to need to do read that email yet. Did you get that

531
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.830
Chassidy Saunders: And I will see right now.

532
00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:02.160
Natalie Austin: It would have been in the same email that you got to talk to me. I should have been

533
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:11.880
Chassidy Saunders: Typed in all that information.

534
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.770
Chassidy Saunders: So I'm looking right now.

535
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:17.700
Okay.

536
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.750
Chassidy Saunders: 65 that it got sent to you.

537
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.330
Chassidy Saunders: Yeah, I believe. Yep.

538
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:36.870
Chassidy Saunders: But it can, because I'm also on the phone as well.

539
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.330
Natalie Austin: Yes. True. Yeah. Okay. One of the ways is um they usually check

540
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.890
Natalie Austin: Where the nearest lab is to where you are.

541
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:57.480
Chassidy Saunders: Okay. Um, I believe it. I don't, I don't remember the name of the lab, I was asked about, but I know we have a comp unit right. Enjoy.

542
00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.640
That counter

543
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.350
Natalie Austin: On the will do you usually use quest, but I don't know.

544
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:07.830
Natalie Austin: Okay.

545
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.090
Chassidy Saunders: Never we was on the phone yesterday actually discovered that there is one

546
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.350
Okay.

547
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:15.930
Natalie Austin: So they'll probably send it to their

548
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.120
Chassidy Saunders: Own

549
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:23.760
Natalie Austin: And and then I'll do we do monthly urine drug screens, which you probably had that done already at the other place.

550
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.010
Natalie Austin: They do that they're

551
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:28.170
Chassidy Saunders: Um,

552
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.920
Chassidy Saunders: They don't go monthly. It was like I

553
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:39.000
Chassidy Saunders: Was called color code I caught an everyday like it was basically, you don't know you're gonna eat up the screen.

554
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:40.020
Okay.

555
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.670
Chassidy Saunders: So,

556
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.310
Chassidy Saunders: drug screens are definitely okay

557
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:49.500
Natalie Austin: So we

558
00:46:52.500 --> 00:47:05.520
Natalie Austin: Don't probably send them to to do at home. I got to the first one. The first one you just have to go to a an outline lab like question the other ones. I think that you can do at home that we don't go anywhere, which is nice.

559
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.680
Chassidy Saunders: Yeah, that would be awesome.

560
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.810
Natalie Austin: And then only we still have one

561
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.590
Natalie Austin: You don't have a car.

562
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.270
Chassidy Saunders: I do have it on day one, we are sharing one minute.

563
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.100
Chassidy Saunders: I know I can definitely get it done. If that's your problem.

564
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:38.970
Natalie Austin: We'll just

565
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.360
Natalie Austin: Do this. The first time you have to go, you can just go

566
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:43.500
Natalie Austin: You know,

567
00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:44.730
Chassidy Saunders: Yeah, that's fine.

568
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.890
Natalie Austin: And then after that.

569
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:54.000
Natalie Austin: They do the drug screens you can do at your house, you just have to videotape it or something they do it on a video though.

570
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.130
Chassidy Saunders: Oh, okay.

571
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:07.650
Natalie Austin: I'm not quite sure how they do that, but it's it's all legitimate. You don't have to show anything that are you any genitalia or anything, it's just

572
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.320
Natalie Austin: Not quite sure how they do it.

573
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:12.630
Natalie Austin: It's pretty cool.

574
00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.020
Chassidy Saunders: Well, yeah. Because, I mean, I think.

575
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.160
Chassidy Saunders: If I will ping on camera.

576
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.340
Natalie Austin: I think you just put a camera and they want you to really go into the bathroom when you come

577
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.980
Natalie Austin: Out of the bathroom or something. I'm not sure, but

578
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.100
Natalie Austin: It just makes it easier for you guys.

579
00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:36.510
Um,

580
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:48.480
Natalie Austin: Okay, and then the light of the lives rolling at one time we just checked your liver, kidney and your heart. So that's just a one time lab. It's an overall health assessment.

581
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.280
Chassidy Saunders: Okay.

582
00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.170
Chassidy Saunders: I don't know if you can see and

583
00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:13.980
Chassidy Saunders: I want to love. But you know, I just got this in my up. I think it was is there would have been January 20 20. No, no, no. I graduated December 2019

584
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:23.520
Chassidy Saunders: MC RT and all that good stuff. So you know I had them say moms and I you guys need them again. Right.

585
00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.530
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

586
00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:29.190
Chassidy Saunders: Okay, that's fine.

587
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:38.310
Natalie Austin: And then if you if you guys need papers to for drug court, just let us know and they can get them over to you.

588
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.800
Chassidy Saunders: And now we actually both have graduated so

589
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:45.690
Natalie Austin: Oh, so you don't need to try anything else in

590
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:49.050
Natalie Austin: Good. Okay.

591
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:50.610
Natalie Austin: Awesome. Okay.

592
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.220
Natalie Austin: That's even better for you.

593
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.890
Natalie Austin: I think that's it. Do you have any other questions for me.

594
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.330
Chassidy Saunders: The moment.

595
00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:36.180
Natalie Austin: You're trying to get that spring or your internet. You say you're getting internet that's coming to your house. Is that correct,

596
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.450
Chassidy Saunders: I, I will, we will either both be like getting like the

597
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:54.750
Chassidy Saunders: Other

598
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.610
Natalie Austin: Do it on your, like you said, you have a computer, it might work better on there, even

599
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:15.990
Chassidy Saunders: Yeah, I thought about that, too. I usually use my hotspot for my thumb and then I do everything on the laptop and it seems so much faster. And I don't understand that.

600
00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.450
Natalie Austin: See

601
00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.180
Natalie Austin: Do you have any other questions for me.

602
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:33.300
Chassidy Saunders: Um, no. I think I asked, though.

603
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.630
Natalie Austin: They were all good questions though.

604
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:38.670

Chassidy Saunders: I'm the, the oldest and then the two year old all three of them have different dads, but I met Joey when my two year old was only a month old, so she is basically known him and only him.

628
