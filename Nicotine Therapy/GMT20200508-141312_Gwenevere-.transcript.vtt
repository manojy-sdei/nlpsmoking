00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my goodness bustled

2
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.160
Magan: Yeah, I'm sorry.

3
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just

4
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.060
Magan: apologize for the delay.

5
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, just settle in find somewhere to sit you know the deal.

6
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll just, I'll just review notes so we don't have to add pressure to yourself just

7
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Different environment.

8
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that t shirt.

9
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.490
Magan: And a mask is stuck in my hair.

10
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're here and you're coming straight from work.

11
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there anything kind of currently going on even right now.

12
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.190
Magan: Yes, going to move into the kids room because the dog is crouching at the door and it's driving me nuts already

13
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.030
Magan: Yeah, there's a lot going on right now.

14
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.960
Magan: I had a really bad night at work, it was

15
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.810
Magan: Not good. And then yesterday it was really bad just coming in.

16
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.180
Magan: And

17
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.060
Magan: I don't even know how to where to start.

18
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.910
Magan: So I had worked all night. I thought it was a great night.

19
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:29.130
Magan: And you know that girl that I was talking to you about that. So she came into work. I grabbed my strengths to go put them in the shred bin and she always switches her chairs in the morning. Apparently there's no throne mighty enough for her. So she

20
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:37.140
Magan: Grabs goes to grab a different chair so she's pushing the chair that was at her desk to a different desktop grab another one.

21
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.820
Magan: To switch them out.

22
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.130
Magan: And I'm at the shredder. I was their first I didn't see her even coming

23
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:57.300
Magan: She came up behind me and then to my side. And she pushes the chairman, to me, she doesn't say, Excuse me, she doesn't say move or anything. She just pushes the chairman to me.

24
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.690
Magan: And so I turned to her and I said, Do you not see me I'm standing right here.

25
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:12.780
Magan: And I said, I'm utilizing the shredder and she starts yelling. She's like what I said I'm utilizing the shredder. You can wait till I'm done.

26
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.400
Magan: And

27
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:31.110
Magan: Then she I turned to walk away and I'm like this is just ridiculous. And she screams What and there's two supervisors in the room on a trainee in the room and two other employees. Nobody said a word.

28
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:32.850
Magan: And

29
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:50.700
Magan: So I turn around at this point because she yelled what and I said, are we really going to do this right now. Stephanie, are we going to do this right now. And she said, do what Megan, what are we going to do, what are we going to do, and she's yelling at the top of her lungs.

30
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:59.190
Magan: And it took every fiber of my fucking being not to pop her in her face with my fist.

31
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

32
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.560
And instead

33
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.830
Magan: I turned around and I walked away.

34
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, nice.

35
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:16.620
Magan: But I physically wanted to violate like every code in the conduct book and just

36
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.380
Magan: Let her know

37
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.170
Magan: How

38
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:32.100
Magan: And how how entitled she is, she is so entitled, and she has no respect at all.

39
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.590
Magan: And so

40
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.910
Magan: I wrote an email to my boss and I let him know what happened.

41
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:56.130
Magan: My other supervisor my direct supervisors had to pull up the footage from the cameras. There's no audio, but there is footage and he says, from my perspective on the camera. It looks like she was the aggressor. She was the one that was following you with the chair and coming up for you.

42
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:06.720
Magan: But nobody even looked up or said anything until she was yelling at me. That was when everybody stopped and started paying attention.

43
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.380
Magan: I didn't raise my voice. I didn't yell at her.

44
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.890
But

45
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.590
Magan: I

46
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.440
Magan: I'm not okay with this.

47
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Wish

48
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:28.140
Magan: I go into work last night because you know I didn't sleep well because I had a lot of adrenaline pumping through my body.

49
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:38.010
Magan: And I was awake and I didn't sleep well. And I, I had some nightmares. Some pretty intense ones actually and

50
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:48.420
Magan: I couldn't go back to sleep. Each time I woke up from them and I had more than one. I woke up more than once from nightmares and

51
00:10:50.700 --> 00:11:01.500
Magan: Then I went to work and last night was just really stressful. Again, there's a bunch of policies and procedures that they are being played out and nobody's on the same page and

52
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:08.880
Magan: I'm in the middle person that has to enforce it with my officers and it's something that I strongly, strongly disagree with.

53
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:28.050
Magan: And it's very difficult for me to enforce something that I don't believe in any way, shape, or form and that I feel like somebody's going to end up killed or dead and i'm i'm very uncomfortable with it, but I have to do it because I'm the dispatcher, and I have to tell them no.

54
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:29.940
Magan: And it's hard.

55
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.760
Magan: Because it doesn't feel like I have my officers back. It feels like I'm letting them down.

56
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:45.930
Magan: And I'm not only letting them down, but I'm placing them in an unsafe situation, but I have to because

57
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:57.150
Magan: Different departments are bickering and can't get on the same page. So instead of trying to solve the problem. They just cut. Cut the whole thing off. And that's dangerous in my opinion.

58
00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.860
Magan: So all of that is happening, then I get a 43 call

59
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:18.540
Magan: And the trainee answers it. And it wasn't even an emergency call it was a 39 call it was a disturbance passenger was denied getting on the plane because they had Cofield symptoms they lost their shit.

60
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.250
Magan: And

61
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.800
Magan: So the train. He didn't get any of the information right my supervisor had just stepped out of the room.

62
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:36.510
Magan: She answered the phone. She didn't keep the person on the line. I didn't get any for information. So I dispatched my officer. It was just a fucking mess. The whole thing was a fucking us

63
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:46.470
Magan: And by the end of it. I could not wait to get out of there and Stephanie walks into the room and she has this shit eating grin on her face.

64
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.770
Magan: And I'm just like, I really would just like her to hit me, just so I can like do this and go

65
00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:58.980
Magan: You know, like

66
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:00.990
Magan: But

67
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.420
Magan: I took everything in me not to get physical with her when

68
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.080
Magan: Like it was my first response was just to lay her face into the chalkboard.

69
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:22.440
Magan: But because that's all I know. That's all I know. I was raised up, you fucking somebody folks with you.

70
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.750
Magan: You fight.

71
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.180
Magan: For you. Anybody else there was only one person that I did not fight.

72
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.860
Magan: But I'll be damned as anybody else tried right

73
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This entitlement.

74
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: coming in contact with entitlement.

75
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is familiar

76
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you have any consciousness. At the time, like this rage that I have right now for Stephanie.

77
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:07.860
Magan: I tried so hard to put on the start crying. I tried so hard to put myself in check and take a deep breath.

78
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:19.140
Magan: But I was literally fucking shaking. I was so angry. I had so much adrenaline like literally just my whole body went into fucking fight mode.

79
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:33.060
Magan: And I was shaking. She made fucking physical contact with me and I couldn't do anything about it because I have mouths to feed because I'm worried about making sure that my kids have a roof over their head.

80
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me interject right there. Okay, let's have something a little different. Take a deep breath. We're going to interview right there.

81
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Read together. That's part that's part of the truth and I don't deny that I get. I get that. You want this job and and and and need it. I get that. But we're going to interview right on that one. Just breathe with me.

82
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's free.

83
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact, let's do a new technique which is just look straight ahead to an object, it could be my face. It could be some little tiny

84
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. Some pen. Some paperclip and just look at it and I want you to look at it for a moment. But then I want you to describe without looking to the right, should we keep your eye straightforward and I want you to describe without looking

85
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: To the right, I want you to describe the shapes and shadows and maybe the object to your right. Don't look at it, though. I want you to describe it from your peripheral vision. What do you notice

86
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.080
Magan: Oh, I see what you mean. Okay.

87
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.870
Magan: I noticed this a stuffed animal

88
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.190
Magan: I know that it's a horse because it's her favorite

89
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're not shades of color and

90
00:15:47.460 --> 00:16:01.380
Magan: It's black and white and the hooves are turquoise and it has shapes on it that sparkle. But I can't tell what shapes, they are without looking at it directly.

91
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about really big light changes like one dark colored one light color, top, bottom, what do you notice the

92
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:15.270
Magan: Top half is black and the underbelly of the horses white. It looks really soft to touch.

93
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.410
Okay.

94
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And anything else you notice over to the right mean big light lighting changes.

95
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:27.420
Magan: There's a bright light that's back behind the horse.

96
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.920
Magan: Which is towards the door of the bedroom that shining on to the whoops.

97
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.180
Magan: Let the hubs are the brightest part of the stuff down

98
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:48.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok and now keep your eye on that object. So it's really tempting to want to look to the, to the left. But now let's get a sense of what's to the left without looking at it.

99
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And then know for me, what I do is I move my hand like okay, I'm going to point as if if my hand. I'm like, Okay, right here.

100
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Blue, green file white paper some sort of blue something I'm assuming it's handwriting and a shadow and now I see my shadow of my finger moving up and down because my down. Okay, so now

101
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.290
Magan: What do you notice I look to the left, like I did the right

102
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So just just

103
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.590
Magan: Looking at the fourth thing.

104
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.460
Yeah.

105
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:27.090
Magan: I see a very large takes up a lot of space yellow duck. Okay.

106
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.720
Magan: It's very, it's been sticking up

107
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:38.610
Magan: And I can't see its head or any other part of its body just it's but and it's back foot.

108
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.590
Magan: behind its back foot is a piece of paper that McKenna drew on

109
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And you see your own hand because it's still your left, isn't it.

110
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.080
Magan: I do see my own hand.

111
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.920
Magan: I see.

112
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.840
Magan: I see some of the lines at my hand.

113
00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool.

114
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Check in with your body right now. How's it doing

115
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.700
Magan: My heart rate went down.

116
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: In that knee.

117
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.990
Magan: Yes, that was actually really good.

118
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.480
Magan: Ever tried that before I had, I have had this for about six months and

119
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yesterday and group. It's one of those ones. One of those intense ones where Dr. Alberto was going through a thing. You've, you've seen those right

120
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:26.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It got

121
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I did it was psychotherapy in a group setting. And I remembered this and we all did it together.

122
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is when we're in in the fight, flight we we get tunnel vision.

123
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's we do it instinctively right because we're going to have to our danger pieces right here in front of us and it's it's instinctual. We go here. So when we do this.

124
00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That means there must not be right, a threat, a danger in front of us if we're going to afford to budget or attention peripherally, why then we must not be in danger.

125
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.990
Magan: How can I do that in the moment.

126
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So we can play with that but

127
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You could also try to picture so

128
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Simple so rich because she bumped. You remember I said let's intervene. First we're intervening in the moment, but let's like we can play it out. So let's say she bumps into me.

129
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.950
Magan: I'm moving into living room. Again, I want to speak.

130
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.130
Magan: To

131
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Me in the chair. I already know.

132
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to start interpreting this thread.

133
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

134
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna look at the shredder.

135
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Peripheral I see her moving over here. She's over here. She's not bumping

136
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Shredder. Okay. So over here, his desk and

137
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.360
Magan: What, what would you do

138
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: About

139
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.820
Magan: Okay, that's what I'm wondering.

140
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What the energy in that, but we're trying to see if that particular technique would work. I don't know if it would. But, um, because my guess is

141
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your ears were throbbing your heart was racing and everything was ready to punch. So

142
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: When you noticing that right, your body is going to wreck acknowledge it first.

143
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to somehow. Remember that technique the shredder was there, she's off to one of these sides, you can probably see the. You can see the chair because he's here. Now I see her kind of moving

144
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now off to the right is such and such door and light and blah, blah, blah.

145
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say that was the intervention. Let's say you actually remember that that would be amazing if you could do that. But those are hard to do.

146
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say you do by some miracle if you're able to do that, remember one of those techniques, the grounding techniques anything to get you out of perceived threat anything will work.

147
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You just need to get out of perceived threat. Now if you take away all of it.

148
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: How many times has your kid accidentally stepped on one of your toes. I mean, come on.

149
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.200
Magan: Oh yeah, definitely, many, many times.

150
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you have that same perceived threat as you did with Stephanie.

151
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:53.700
Magan: I don't think I've ever my mind when they were smaller they felt right. Hit me and

152
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.670
Magan: In frustration and I don't think I ever responded

153
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:06.960
Magan: Like that I was hurt more than anything, like how could you do that to me.

154
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I feel that something other than threat at least

155
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:18.120
Magan: But yeah, but that would probably be the only feeling that I felt, other than, Oh well.

156
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

157
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.280
Magan: Now, I mean,

158
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Kids make mistakes, they, they, their

159
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: nerve endings are not mile unaided so even when they were babies, they would try and reach for something and they would actually couldn't even reach it. And then you start to see

160
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That the babies could reach for an object if they set their little eyes to it, then they can actually grab the mobile and they could get ahold of something, but before

161
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: They'd be reaching for it like this. When the things over here and now, even when they go and they want to go cut something or draw something. It's not this straight line. And that's because we don't have this myelination is the fatty around us are synaptic whatever dendrites.

162
00:22:55.050 --> 00:23:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So nurse, so we get better and better word. We're ours are all ready to go. Okay. So mistakes happen.

163
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:04.680
Magan: There wasn't a mistake.

164
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but for this intervention, you're going to have to suspend disbelief for just a second.

165
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.700
Magan: So hard when you do this.

166
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I know but push play it out. See what see what sanity offers that threat response just doesn't offer

167
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.510
Okay.

168
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.040
Magan: Okay.

169
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.380
Magan: Maybe

170
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She bumped into go back to your kid has accidentally thrown it accidentally fell on you. She accident kids have accidentally run little fake mowers little carts they accidentally hit you right

171
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:50.460
Magan: The first thing that comes to my brain upon imagining that is their little faces like oh shit.

172
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I know right.

173
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.120
Magan: Like, oh shit it's about to get real.

174
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.430
Magan: Like, oh my god.

175
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.460
Magan: How will she respond. Okay.

176
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So it actually you get you can get angry with your kids to when they make mistakes like that they hurt you.

177
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:16.050
Magan: Know like because okay so last week McKenna through a burrito at me. You're playing for throw burrito game.

178
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:25.620
Magan: And I dodged it and I went to go step on the cat. Oh, I wouldn't step away. But I stepped on the cat and I felt for on. I mean I I bounced back up and I

179
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:36.660
Magan: I fell on the floor, really hard. I bruise my leg McKenna started screaming and crying and panicking and she ran away because she thought she screwed up.

180
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:53.340
Magan: Oh yeah, and I didn't I, when I finally was able to get up off the floor and handle the pain because it hurt my legs all purple from it. Um, I told her it wasn't her fault. So maybe if I apply it like that.

181
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well I don't know yet. I don't know that I have quite the right imagery. Can you picture you

182
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing that your child accidentally bumped into you with something

183
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. And are you enraged and threatened, as if they're entitled, and these little and I'm gonna I'm gonna smack them in the face.

184
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:20.790
Okay, no.

185
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: One, we want. I know that's what I'm trying to get. I know.

186
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not quite there. So all I did was bumped into you. They didn't being too. They there was an accident that happened.

187
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:41.400
Magan: That when it there when you were like you're mad and angry and you're going to turn to them and yell or smack

188
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.680
Magan: It puts it in my head. I know what you mean. Now,

189
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Your response as a parent is probably. Oh, that's her

190
00:25:53.250 --> 00:26:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you would do. Ouch that hurt if you kind of saw a pattern with the child and they were really sort of sort of respecting mommy's body and you might do like real on purpose. Ouch. That hurts when you cut. When you hurt me. You do that when you hit like that hurts me

191
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't hurt each other that way. So you might do it as a parenting thing, but you might say, Ouch.

192
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

193
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:21.990
Mm hmm.

194
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.750
Magan: Yeah, I can totally see that.

195
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And the first one also was out there was some other out scenarios. So now we're going to go back to

196
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're going back to I know you did the interpretation of Stephanie's behavior and I don't disagree with you, but they doesn't serve you. That's all I'm saying. I agree with you. And it does not serve you.

197
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.950
Magan: How, how do you mean

198
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you couldn't use your whole brain.

199
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.410
Magan: Okay, so it doesn't serve me that I

200
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: perceived threat.

201
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.100
Magan: perceived threat. Okay.

202
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just played out. Remember, all of these things. All we're doing is just slowing it down.

203
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing if we can intervene somewhere so that you have access to all of your brain. It's not just the reptilian part. Okay, that's the one that went like this.

204
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: She's trying to take a resource that I need.

205
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's my job and I want to punch her, or so it she. Right. So there's the perceived threat.

206
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's, I know it's more complicated, but let's not get into it. There's all these complicated pieces of her entitlements, she's been doing this awhile, blah blah blah, all of that. But I'm talking about that moment that moment, let's say, magically, you can remember one of the

207
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there's blue there's chair. There's white there's off white. There's a little bit of gold over there. There's almonds. There's file. There's white their shadow

208
00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm perceiving threat.

209
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

210
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it real. Is she going to cause bodily injury or take my life she going to do that.

211
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.790
Magan: She's not going to take my life but

212
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.890
Magan: She's

213
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.720
Magan: She's trying to get a reaction. She's trying to get a rise out of me.

214
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.680
Magan: She got it.

215
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.750
Magan: She got what she wanted.

216
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so notice that we're, we haven't even gotten to that part yet I'm staying right here with

217
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.210
Magan: She did bumped me. She did try to

218
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:46.020
Magan: Make physical contact with me on like she pushed the chair into my leg. So I watched her do it.

219
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.110
Magan: So, but

220
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.860
Magan: My life was not in danger. She may not going to kill me.

221
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop right there and you do whatever brief peripheral centering

222
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And you say to her.

223
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you mean to hit me with a chair.

224
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. Just hold on to it. Hold on.

225
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't matter what she says.

226
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This

227
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that I can say, Did you me but listen to my voice just went up right

228
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What Hi. Did you mean with that chair.

229
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

230
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you already know her answer, but that doesn't matter.

231
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, did you mean to hit me with a chair.

232
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. Now what what she's going to say next. But let's say she says nothing. I might

233
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Get up and walk to my supervisors office.

234
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.790
Magan: Okay.

235
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what Josh. This could be nothing but given the context of kind of what feels like a hostile workplace with Stephanie.

236
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I watched her take the chair and she had a choice to send it this way or send it that way. And she ran into me.

237
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You know whether you know go look at the video if you want to. I'm just getting kind of ahead of it right here. I felt threatened, as if she kind of wants to instigate

238
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Some kind of argument with me. I'm just giving you a heads up, if it turns into nothing. God bless. All right, just giving you a heads up, I'll keep you posted. If anything else turns into

239
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Thanks for listening to me, Josh.

240
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.660
Magan: sounds much better.

241
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:54.420
Magan: So I wish that you could like he in my head all the time.

242
00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.400
Magan: Like so you could say stop making

243
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.640
Magan: Is this a threat.

244
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:12.930
Magan: Because after that happened, I immediately thought of our sessions immediately. And that's not typical for me.

245
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're getting there. Look how much closer. It's getting it's getting closer and closer to the moment don't minimize how hard this working I'm

246
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to respond the same way you are. I'm no better than you. I make it look like some kind of Oz thing because nobody's giving me shit right now.

247
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:32.910
Magan: Mm hmm.

248
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what I'm talking about. Because I've lived this

249
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And I teach it all day long. And I'm good at it because I'm literally doing this with people all day long.

250
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So don't think that you're missing any piece of what you need to get this done. It just takes practice. And in fact, I want to bring something up.

251
00:31:53.940 --> 00:32:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That Dr. Rob real mentioned yesterday and I was in a really playful mood at all if it's appropriate to tell the joke but but basically what she said is, well, did you know that

252
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're learning something new. There's certain chemicals that are released that we're very interested in in this novel idea, and we are very tuned into it and we want to problem solve, about, but she says there's a missing chemical

253
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: That happens

254
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And that was the joke because I was like, what's the chemical. Can I buy it at Whole Foods.

255
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like waiting like oh Oh good. Oh, good. Now I'll have a better memory. So anyway, so she's like yeah this is missing, chemical and so we don't remember. And she was cracking on herself. She's like, I open a book and I look and I'll see

256
00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That I underlined something. And she says, I don't reread the book and then I'll highlight that same sentence and then I'll look at that book. And I'll put a little asterisk next to the side.

257
00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't remember it, and I'm like, What's the chemical that needs to be present, so that I can store this in my hippocampus. Please would you market that to me, I will be the spokesperson for free.

258
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's my point. Don't give yourself a hard time for forgetting, especially since when we're in distress, right, all that cortisol is Russian over on that that hippocampus and we can't pull the memory we need. It's just messing with everything. First thing we have to do is down regulate

259
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Peripheral right peripheral what's out here and I'm breathing to hack. Okay, I can see this and this and this. You just learned this new one, just now right looking outside looking at the shutter what's over here, what's over here.

260
00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, I must be okay because I'm noticing my peripheral vision.

261
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: That didn't feel great. Did you mean to hit me with that chair.

262
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, now I played out the other scenario. Now we're all indulge in your hypothetical, which is what does she say when I say that. What do you think she's gonna say

263
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.050
Magan: I didn't eat you with the chair.

264
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.130
Magan: Okay, that's what I think she would say,

265
00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now do the peripheral vision right now.

266
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't get you with the chair.

267
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:30.810
Magan: Oh, I just got it just went adrenaline. I felt it automatically

268
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.310
Magan: Boom, right there.

269
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And go out, go use the technique, pull out look at an object measurements, the shredder pull out awareness just starting

270
00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:41.970
Magan: Out that

271
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Well, I'm a great

272
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.660
Magan: Basically felt that it just went

273
00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:53.190
Magan: My, my adrenaline just went, I don't know where to my brain to my organs, I don't know, I just felt it went

274
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

275
00:34:59.370 --> 00:34:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

276
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:04.260
Magan: So honor it is a a breath.

277
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:06.570
Magan: It's purple and black.

278
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.780
Magan: It's bristle brush.

279
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:16.050
Magan: The handle looks rubber, but I know it's rubber because I touch it every day.

280
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.770
Magan: But I know it's rubber and I can see the

281
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.680
Magan: The wedges on the handle.

282
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:28.770
Magan: Michael glasses are sitting next to the brush and

283
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:38.730
Magan: My phone, he is sitting next to my glasses and the sunlight from outside is shining in on the tip of my phone a spot.

284
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.090
Magan: To my left.

285
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:51.960
Magan: Is a is a washcloth and my mask that I wore to work today.

286
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I can wait can you can't even tell the distinction or is it just sort of gray.

287
00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:02.610
Magan: It's black and white polka dots on the straps and the front of the mask is a map of England.

288
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But can you really see that, though.

289
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.440
Magan: Not without look all because I know it's there.

290
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of gray know when it's out of your peripheral isn't it.

291
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.640
Magan: It is. It's like a brownish gray color.

292
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go. So what is not what you remember what is it's important that you described.

293
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.350
Is

294
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.600
Magan: So,

295
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.810
Magan: I am so mad.

296
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.790
Magan: I just, I'm so mad.

297
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.340
Magan: Because

298
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:49.110
Magan: The first thing that I want to do is say, what is wrong with me.

299
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.800
Magan: Why is she doing this to me what it what is wrong with me.

300
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:03.000
Magan: That is the first thing that I want to do. And I know at this point.

301
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.250
Magan: That

302
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.810
Magan: I

303
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.520
Magan: Do not deserve to be treated like that.

304
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.010
Magan: And I

305
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:17.280
Magan: Good Person.

306
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're more than that you intimidate her and threaten her and she is jealous of you and you could look at it like that. It is the burden of the leader.

307
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Of Israel threat and a bit

308
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.740
Magan: What Josh said

309
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:42.000
Magan: He said, It's the burden of the leader and said, Well, what do you mean he goes, You just got

310
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:58.680
Magan: A kudos a big kudos for the active shooter training you will he put me as head dispatcher on it and I handled the whole thing because he trusted that I would. And I did.

311
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:09.840
Magan: And the director of aviation sent a kudos to the team. But she said I would especially like to thank Megan She was awesome.

312
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.390
Magan: And everybody saw

313
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you don't default to

314
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Playing small

315
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It means you don't get to do that one anymore that's gotten us some things in your life.

316
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.200
Magan: Like, like, What do you mean, could you explain what you mean.

317
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm hurt. Don't hurt me. Look what you're doing. You're hurting me. Don't hurt me. What color you're hurting, cry, cry.

318
00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, thank you. Is it no

319
00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.210
Magan: It's not and that's why I'm trying so hard.

320
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:50.670
Magan: To see that I'm doing that to that I'm trying that my

321
00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:59.820
Magan: Myself my usual self my behavioral pattern is trying to revert back to

322
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:11.580
Magan: That little girl of you're hurting me. Stop. Yeah, I don't like it. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can do about this and I hate it.

323
00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:26.220
Magan: And it's my fault. I shouldn't have put myself in that situation, whatever. But I see those behaviors wanting to go there. But then I see new behaviors of even realizing that it's happening.

324
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's redo this one. While with with the time we have. Let's redo this scenario, a couple of so

325
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.050
Magan: Sorry, I was late. I'm so sorry.

326
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You lose out.

327
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:44.340
Magan: I know I didn't mean to. Is there any way I could schedule another one for before Friday, and I still come on Friday to

328
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what we can do. I'm pretty booked next week. But let's make use of this moment. Okay. Okay, so

329
00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to remember to it could be useful, just for today to grab paper and pen just to have a couple notes in front of you might be

330
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What you do

331
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your, is your bodies on

332
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:19.920
The first

333
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.590
Magan: Okay, I got it.

334
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to just slam you into some intense feeling you're going to feel the bodies, write it down body.

335
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's do you want to do will do peripheral peripheral as our go to technique for today. Okay, we're going to do that one.

336
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:45.720
Magan: Okay.

337
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Free

338
00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and then there's lots of things to do lots of different things to do. And I've got a couple of different variations of what we can do. I did one of them already.

339
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: One of them was

340
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we did this. What if it, if we did

341
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to create safety. I thought we did that VR thought create safety three

342
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Eight see okay now. Now let's make it more personal for you because that was one of your statement. Why don't we do what is actually what do you do all the time.

343
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.630
Magan: I create safety.

344
00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.310
Magan: Absolutely. Do I perceived threat.

345
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:42.690
Okay.

346
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:44.820
Magan: You

347
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Bought your body already took care of that. You already did that. But no one behaves

348
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

349
00:41:54.660 --> 00:42:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Under that kind of pressure and that you know you have that you have that ability. You've done it at work. Active Shooter kind of thing you can do it. This is one of those moments, you've got to be able to use your whole brain.

350
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got body's response. We've got I'm going to regulate if you remember to the peripheral Coco cool going to free is I'm going to create safety.

351
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: For all

352
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.360
For all

353
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: For all which means

354
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.180
Magan: And I don't do that.

355
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely dodo bird as well. That includes her. She is not safe around you, you threaten her period. It's a fact. So

356
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't have the evolution of the evolved mind to be able to do it in any kind of productive way like I need to learn new skills, get more training so that I can compete with Megan instead. She's going to

357
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: just piss you off, and she's going to do what you're doing, which is

358
00:42:52.650 --> 00:43:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope she punches me, she's doing the exact same thing you want her to do. You guys are doing it together, both of you want to be the first one to blow the first blow y'all recognize each other and each other, whatever. Let's give all that. But let's go to create safety for all

359
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: She's scared.

360
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: She's scared of me.

361
00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Net. Yeah. So now I can. So if we have this sort of mantra create safety for all i can smile. I can turn my posture towards her. And I can say

362
00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you mean to bump into me.

363
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I can check out my initial assumption. So you might write that down. Check out assumption asked question.

364
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I know you already know.

365
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.180
Magan: Took out my assumption.

366
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Your assumption.

367
00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But basically, what it means is you're going to ask a question.

368
00:43:50.010 --> 00:44:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you could do my tried and true choose curiosity over being right. It's one of the best goes by many different names doesn't if it's the same darn thing. Here we go.

369
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Body peripheral breathing create safety and guess what she's curiosity. Now I can turn towards this thing I'm crazy. I can turn towards it. I can investigate

370
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I can ask a question. Do not give yourself a hard time because we're going to do this again.

371
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If you get one piece of this done. That's okay.

372
00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. All right, we're gonna do it again.

373
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:24.990
Okay.

374
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.000
Magan: That was hard.

375
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So you overdid the squeak a little much.

376
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.370
Magan: Right, yeah. I wanted to threaten her

377
00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Like she did it but you remembered it. Now, how did you create safety for all. So I noticed you didn't look at me. Notice you had to relax far away. So we're going to do it again.

378
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: He created safety created safety for all

379
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, speak until you are safe and that you can give safety to another.

380
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Do not make your sweet ass time. Okay.

381
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:22.770
Okay.

382
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.360
Magan: Did you mean to me with that chair.

383
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't bump you

384
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.250
Magan: Didn't practice this part.

385
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So how did you create safety for yourself and you were able to turn to her. How did you pull that off. What did you do to make that

386
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:20.370
Magan: I thought, well first sight took it. The first thing that came to these breathing, because that is the most thing. I work on with everything that we do is applying the breathing. So I took a deep breath. I made sure my belly popped out

387
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.630
Who

388
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:30.210
Magan: I briefly focused in on your forehead and looked at the floating bottle.

389
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.030
Magan: I tried to let my shoulders drop a little bit

390
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.950
Magan: Because my jaws clenched, and I'm wearing it.

391
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.760
Magan: Because I'm literally Imagining her with fucking chair when you went bump so

392
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:50.550
Magan: And then

393
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:57.930
Magan: I imagined myself, even though I didn't stepping back

394
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

395
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice creating safety that distance

396
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.880
Magan: So I put myself away from the perceived threat.

397
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.040
Magan: And then I turned to her.

398
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:18.060
Magan: And said, Did you mean to bump me with that chair and then you said I didn't bump you with the chair.

399
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:24.030
Magan: And I want to say something else. But I'm not going to

400
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was a good test of more like what would really happen you defaulted to to anger response right to perceive threat.

401
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:44.430
Magan: Yeah. As soon as you said, I didn't bumpy with the chair. I immediately wanted to say you're sucking can and just bless it. So like like

402
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:47.640
Magan: But I didn't

403
00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Radical acceptance peace. I am

404
00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to change. I'm entitled insecure vindictive and I'm coming after you.

405
00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:06.480
Magan: That was a really good group, I have to say that, by the way, that was really

406
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:09.810
Magan: Tough. But it was a good group.

407
00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:17.490
Magan: Of radical acceptance. She's not going to change.

408
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So now.

409
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to do them again and again and again and again and you just do the same exact ritual again. Okay, here we go. Yeah.

410
00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.880
Magan: Did you mean to buy me with that chair.

411
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't bump your

412
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Problem.

413
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.960
Magan: I'm gonna walk away.

414
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.670
Magan: Yeah, yeah. Walk away at that point.

415
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:25.860
Magan: I'm not even gonna

416
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.230
Magan: I'm not gonna do this.

417
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Engage.

418
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Engage engage

419
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.420
Magan: I'm just not gonna do it. Yeah.

420
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:37.560
The bait.

421
00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the bait and if you're not desperate to make your point finally to wind you right

422
00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you don't engage. You're not desperate.

423
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We just

424
00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Fucking idiot

425
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:06.450
Magan: Said that, too. I walked back to my desk and mouse like fucking ridiculous bullshit. I logged off and I walked out

426
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But now, get all the way to there. Let's do it again and see if you like this engaging accountability.

427
00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Part that part about Josh, see what comes up around that just play it out and but you know you're the one that knows what to do. I'm just throwing it out there. But I want to see what happens with that becoming an option where you're not

428
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not taking on the role of a supervisor, which they should notice is going on. That is the truth. It's my opinion. Let's play it out one more time. See what happens. You ready, I might throw in a curveball. So just keep doing the exact same thing that works.

429
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my god. You're so weird.

430
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your problem.

431
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:14.760
Magan: Did you mean to bump me with that chair.

432
00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:15.990
I didn't

433
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.310
Magan: Josh. Could I please speak with you.

434
00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:39.990
Magan: I just wanted to bring

435
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:45.030
Magan: Possible situation to your attention. I could be

436
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.310
Magan: misinformed.

437
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not misinformed do it over.

438
00:51:53.400 --> 00:52:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Facts. What you saw with your friggin eyes what you felt on your leg just the facts. Here we go. I'm Josh

439
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:01.860
Magan: Okay.

440
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What's up, Megan.

441
00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.350
Magan: I would like to bring this situation to your attention.

442
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:17.940
Magan: And Stephanie pushed her tear into my leg as I was trying to put my papers in the shredder.

443
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sure it was just an accident.

444
00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:22.950
Magan: I'm sure it wasn't

445
00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do it again.

446
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It what I heard you say was, she went from her desk.

447
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And while she I think she was trying to switch out to share. She prefers a particular chair. She kind of went out of her way to go towards the shredder and kind of bumped me and kind of see you're coming. She could clearly see me.

448
00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if it you know if this is a thing. If this is part of an ongoing pattern, but it does sort of match this hostile workplace that we've been talking about over the last few weeks, giving you a heads up that that happened.

449
00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I really am uncomfortable without behavior. I don't feel safe around her. Okay, we're gonna redo you ready

450
00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:15.540
Magan: I just wanted to bring a situation to your attention.

451
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:29.520
Magan: Okay, as I was placing my treads in the trippin Stephanie was switching out her chair for the day and she proceeded to bump her chair into my legs.

452
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.290
Magan: I did feel that it was intentional. I

453
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:48.570
Magan: Know that we have been dealing with some hostility between her and I at different times in the past few weeks, and I did feel that this

454
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:55.050
Magan: Match some of those behaviors and felt provoking.

455
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Did she apologized. She just leave the chair right there.

456
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:04.140
Magan: She proceeded to keep coming at me.

457
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:16.200
Magan: So I as I turned to walk away and I said, this is just ridiculous. She started yelling what and was walking towards me and I turned around.

458
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this.

459
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:24.420
Magan: No, she left the chair where she was. Where was will and came towards me and was like,

460
00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:40.740
Magan: I only turned around. The only reason why I know she was still coming at me was because her voice was getting louder. And that's why I turned because I'm not about to be my back exposed. So I turned and she was coming towards me still. And she said,

461
00:54:43.170 --> 00:55:00.240
Magan: I said, This is ridiculous. As I was turning away, she said. What this is what I said, are we going to do this. Are we really going to do this right now. Stephanie and she then got louder and closer and said do what, what are we doing, what are we doing Megan.

462
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:04.620
Magan: And I turned and walked away and walk back to my station.

463
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Was her hitting you with the chair, an accident.

464
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.790
Magan: No.

465
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you perceive that that was hostile behavior.

466
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. And was it followed up by an aggressive a conversation

467
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: No aggressive way of speaking to you.

468
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.800
Magan: Oh, was it like towards from her.

469
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Did she come at you with aggressive

470
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.120
Magan: Propagation absolutely

471
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's and that's all you say you just just those pieces just THIS HAPPENED. THIS IS HOW WAS PERCEIVED and under the context of my already expressed concerns around a hostile workplace.

472
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I continue to be concerned and I'm bringing this to your attention. So we're gonna do it again.

473
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, it's I perceive this as a provocation. She physically is that's kind of new hadn't had that one yet.

474
00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know it's, it doesn't seem to be getting any better. It seems to be progressing. She followed up with with this verbal provocation. Welcome to look at the video if you want to I can send you to feel threatened by her and just keeping you posted. Okay, so we're doing to get ready.

475
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's up. Megan.

476
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.840
Magan: And I would like to bring a situation to your attention.

477
00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.050
Magan: And

478
00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.150
Magan: Referring to the yelling that happened this morning.

479
00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:43.710
Magan: I was going to put paper in the strip in and Stephanie was getting her chair for the day and she pushed her chair into my legs.

480
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:59.790
Magan: I felt that it was a direct provocation of me, and she's continuing to act hostile towards me in the work environment and I'm uncomfortable.

481
00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:07.890
Magan: I don't want this to escalate any further. However, I don't find this behavior acceptable.

482
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's pretty good. How did that feel to to do that.

483
00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:15.570
Magan: That's all pretty good actually because somebody's listening to me.

484
00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:18.960
Magan: Like someone's listening.

485
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're, you're not. It's not the same like helplessness and then of course rage and all of that. It's

486
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You brought it to the attention where it belongs.

487
00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: These key pieces.

488
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Of addressing the perceived threat.

489
00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're, you're going to need some some visual reminders of it at work, things that can really tether you back to some of these these steps.

490
00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: somebody's hand someone little finger on your wrist something to sort of be like

491
00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Little thing in your pocket.

492
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.410
Magan: I think I'm going to try the wrist bracelet thing to snap.

493
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

494
00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.480
Magan: A lot of people recommend that, and I am a visitor.

495
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:20.790
Magan: But

496
00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:30.480
Magan: I could maybe snap it to breathe because I I am trying so hard. The breathing exercises I really am.

497
00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:46.530
Magan: It's um but I literally just saw like white in that moment, and I felt so much adrenaline rushing to me. I was legitimately concerned that I was going to fuck everything else up for myself and my family.

498
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.410
Magan: I am I know I have an anger problem, but

499
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.050
Magan: I don't know how to respond.

500
00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.620
Magan: In a healthy way.

501
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:05.160
Magan: In those moments and I want to so badly.

502
00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And knowing how you just learned a how isn't it. I don't remember.

503
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.230
Magan: How to Apply

504
00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't remember. Wait, I don't remember the how that I learned

505
00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes number and how that I learned

506
00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:28.860
Magan: I don't remember the how that I learned in those moments and I still

507
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.870
Magan: I literally only feel rage pure

508
00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Rage at my desk. I would know that about myself and I would have reminders and I don't really want everyone else knowing what my little reminders are. And I'm not sure I want you doing this so that people can give you a shit about it.

509
00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I want something right here. Every time I move if I get up. I'm going to look at that sticky.

510
00:59:55.350 --> 01:00:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's going to be a list of things to do, they'll be something that will say no. Maybe there's symbols a body is a little stick figure

511
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Peripheral little eyes off to the side. There's a little apparel lungs right there. Create safety don't know, put a little heart. I don't know. Smile or something and then ask a question.

512
01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then maybe it's speak my truth and speak the truth can be tell a supervisor. I don't know what it is but you have a thing and you don't move.

513
01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you go out into the world for you out of the world is picking up a phone standing up and moving to a shredder move from this station you run the risk

514
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Of having interpersonal interaction like that. So why not memorize review what's already. Okay, what's my thing.

515
01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I already have it fresh in my head.

516
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.850
Magan: Oh, that's a good, that's a really good idea. I see what you mean.

517
01:00:50.970 --> 01:01:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's already here already know it's out its out there. There's going to be people that are you know so workplace. I've got to keep my skills. These are not automatic.

518
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And hard to remember because they're new so I'm going to get. Okay, I got it just, you know, my mind's on that and minds on that. Now I remember why I'm getting up ok ok shredding shirts I go to shred

519
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And then just imagine you had that already on your mind, maybe like it might have even like had a smile. Like, how am I can't believe it's happening. There it is. As predicted

520
01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:33.930
Magan: That's a really good idea. I think I'm going to do some symbols. So that way, nobody can decipher them.

521
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. Yeah, I don't, you know, we don't need more

522
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:38.880
You don't need to look bullshit.

523
01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Explain yourself to anyone.

524
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, when you think

525
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: My jobs on the line. It's not as intense and it's just did you mean about me.

526
01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. OK. OK. And now if I go

527
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Josh have a minute.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: This is part of my KEEPING YOU INFORMED not

529
01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I'm just feeling as a hostile workplace has continued to happen. It looks like she intentionally bumped into me if she didn't apologize stared me down and track follow the afternoon. What, what, what

530
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Just let me know if you want to review the video I continue to feel threatened, she's trying to provoke a physical fight keeping me in the loop.

531
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, thanks for listening.

532
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And Josh, could you make note of it. I don't know if you're keeping track of these things, or would you rather just send it in a quick email to you.

533
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.430
Magan: Hmm.

534
01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And there you go. I'll write it down. Okay. I think I'll follow it up with an email to just so I can keep track of them myself. Great. Sounds good. Thanks. Megan. Thanks for bringing to my attention.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

536
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:10.800
Magan: I think it's great. I think, I think I'm going to give it a try. I'm gonna try the symbols.

537
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:29.100
Magan: I wonder, though I know it's kind of weird, but I wonder if you're standing at the shredder how you would really respond in that moment, like I do, always wonder how would grant, when really respond like

538
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm

539
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to think if there's actually been

540
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: See that there just has

541
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's real, it's it really has happened.

542
01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:51.480
Magan: I believe it. I absolutely I know I'm not the only person in the world that deals with girl bullshit. No.

543
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.200
Magan: We're not even girl bullshit any bullshit.

544
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You just call bullshit.

545
01:03:57.690 --> 01:03:57.930
Magan: It's

546
01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: A problem with

547
01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Being a leader, it's just, it's just real, they're going to find you a threat, and they're not going to be your friend. And it is, you know,

548
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm very blessed to have a sense of humor that I have access to, because I use it so prolifically I can use it. Whoops.

549
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoops.

01:04:51.630 --> 01:05:12.000
Magan: I don't adult and there's and there's where I want to be. I want to be able. Right there is where you are pinpointed on. I don't want to harp on it. I don't want to focus on it. I don't want to let it engulf me wanna be free of it. I want to seal the ceiling and move past the ceiling.

557
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You forgot the skill of pity the fool.

558
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Remember that when you like to you like that one.

559
01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:21.810
Magan: I pity you.

560
01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.040
Yeah.

561
01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.620
Or anything

562
01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:30.900
Magan: Small

563
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: But don't miss dangerous. So it's, it is a dangerous thing to have that. So what do we do you know you you you do advocacy and you tell me, Josh is and you, you put it in an email.

564
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You put it, you track it you timestamp and off you go.

565
01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:17.400
Magan: I did, I did send an email right away. Josh told me to. He said, I would like for you to please send me an 80% Christian email and CC me because you know AUTOMATICALLY, BECAUSE SHE WORKS day she's going to be in his office physically implementing her perspective.

566
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

567
01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:38.430
Magan: So he said, at least get your voice out there because we were asleep all day and nobody sees us because we're night shift workers. So try to get your piece out there as soon as possible so that at least your pieces out there to here in comparison to hers.

568
01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and then let it go. Let it go. It's already done. You already took action.

569
01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Sleeve it

570
01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:50.070
Magan: I do want to be a leader.

571
01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:52.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You already are.

572
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: If you're born, these kind of people, it just er.

573
01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:01.680
Magan: Mm hmm. And I just, I don't want

574
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:03.990
Magan: A don't

575
01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.660
Magan: Speaking of the pity.

576
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:19.740
Magan: I genuinely if I were to set back because I've done this with you right now, if I were to feel anything. I would want to say to her, Stephanie.

577
01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:28.290
Magan: Can we just move past this and have a healthy working environment. I'm totally on board with it.

578
01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no, you're in the land.

579
01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

580
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

581
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.210
Magan: But that's truly how I feel.

582
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that she her

583
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Hair is going to continue to find you a threat. So notice I said create safety.

584
01:07:48.600 --> 01:08:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So next time. Right. You just did all this work, we can't get everything done in one session. The next time is something like, you know, I've been meaning to tell you, Stephanie that I really, I really appreciate that you did. Did you

585
01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:05.310
Know,

586
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: She feels complimented she feels proud, she feels acknowledged she feels important

587
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That is

588
01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Up here, but you can do that.

589
01:08:21.570 --> 01:08:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You could do it if you want it to imagine the woman, they can do that. That's it. I it's like, oh,

590
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's me. Right. I do. Oops, I say, oh,

591
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a chair, she means to do that.

592
01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: No, okay, coco, coco

593
01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Not the hair flipping but obviously have an air conditioned

594
01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.890
Magan: I imagine what you'd be like, from

595
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, your, your story.

596
01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Mine was right. I was an actual leader. Right. I'm an actual in a command stuff.

597
01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. I can't even get to the complexity of 14 years of dysfunction, but

598
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, just mental illness also point. Yeah.

599
01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And they only same some there were some same people that would see what was going on. And they're like, Yeah, I saw she just did that. And, but there are two

600
01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:33.570
Gwenevere Abriel: They've drank the Kool Aid. They've been be a soda and there's no, there's nothing. There's, there's no you can't get them.

601
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.160
Magan: To take action.

602
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The light they

603
01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Making too much money just it's too. They can't come over here. So there's no rescue me. I'm all alone. And I know that and

604
01:09:46.110 --> 01:10:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have to go to a boss who is literally after me and he's my Josh. So I have nowhere to go. So, and I try all of the many departments and all of them are corrupt and so I keep doing it.

605
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.790
Magan: Right, exactly what it feels like.

606
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: They're all

607
01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.130
Magan: Like that.

608
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And it turns out I'm I couldn't stay i mean i i certainly tried to stay for as many years as I could, thinking, right, that it was me that surely they'll see the light, they'll see that my goodness that I mean well for everyone that I'm literally, literally.

609
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: preventing people from getting in trouble or

610
01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Be sued like it's part of my strength is that I see detail, I see these are the rules and like, Hey, let's follow them, so we don't lose our license.

611
01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:39.180
And

612
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's basically the entire job description is of command is to say, you know, let's all follow the rules. Here they are. You didn't follow them pull in mind, let's go. And it's not welcome. Nobody wants to be told it in some wrong.

613
01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, there was. Yeah, so it. I know I don't know exactly what that chair is in my world. It's a chart. Just think throne, or it's, it's, it's, it's, I know what you're talking about.

614
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:11.280
Magan: How did you respond

615
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean i i got to have that chart. I'm actually not ready to give you that chart doc yet. I haven't reviewed it.

616
01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.390
Magan: Yet, wow, that's really good.

617
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I understand you want that chart. And I know you want to make some edits to it. But first, I need to review it.

618
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't done the audit, yet we brought it in here yesterday. I haven't gotten to it yet. And I know you want to address those things that you heard verbally, but I need to do a thorough audit and and you do I need to do the audit first

619
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But I

620
01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: was sick.

621
01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:49.050
Magan: Oh, yeah.

622
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Distress right minds right here.

623
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:52.830
Magan: Here's isn't the job to

624
01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, yeah, it is. But mostly I get little pin. Pin for x in my whatever these little

625
01:11:58.650 --> 01:11:59.790
Magan: Minds right here.

626
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but the. My point is to say we're still going to feel fear.

627
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Men to, it doesn't matter that there are these folks will miss behave because there she's in perceived threat. Now, I knew it. Because what I was about to write about was a missing release of information. She wants to protect her job.

628
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: She's like, I need that chart up right and I'm like, it isn't how it works. I'm going to audit it and I'm going to document.

629
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of the things that you're

630
01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.350
Magan: Trying to cover her ass.

631
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Every harass

632
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:39.390
Magan: For to forgot to put something in it, but it was already done.

633
01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's more than I forgot. It's a big deal. But guess what agency and so they don't do anything about it because she was actually positioned. You're not going to believe this. She's. Do you want to consider paranoia don't know if it's a paranoid, but I'm pretty sure this is accurate.

634
01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Position is certain composition of people that weren't specifically assigned to me.

635
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's exactly what her personality is is to she's going to start

636
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Making complaints and filing reports and

637
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's going to put me in about light.

638
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And

639
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I saw. I'm like, So you gave me this person, this, this is my team, this, this, this and this. Got it. I see what's up. I mean, I know y'all think I'm an air an idiot. But I know what's up.

640
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And

641
01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I think I did pretty well for as long as I could but I mean there's real mental illness. I mean, a lot of people that go into the field.

642
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Of addiction. Right. They're like, oh, I want to be a mental health counselor to um

643
01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And they're doing it because they maybe had a good one. When they were having there. So since us treated. I felt so good. I want to give back. I want to be that too.

644
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of people in the substance use field that have pretty toxic family histories and they haven't done that really important healing work.

645
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:09.540
Magan: Was in itself.

646
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's still so they create that same toxic system in the workplace and this particular department was wildly dysfunctional and I'm, I'm, I'm, like, I have I have like

647
01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:35.460
Magan: I forgot to tell you I have a I remember how I told you I applied for Burnley oh County Sheriff's Office.

648
01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

649
01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:38.400
Magan: I got an email back

650
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:41.280
Magan: And I'm going in for testing on June 1

651
01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:46.470
Magan: Yeah, so maybe I'll get that and just be like,

652
01:14:49.680 --> 01:15:02.850
Magan: Because it's exactly what you just described bosses sleeping with bosses and and people having irresponsible relationships and all you didn't say that. But people

653
01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:21.360
Magan: Covering for each other in the, in the most corrupt way and the people who are trying to do what's right are squished and pushed into a corner and made the shut up and it's it's it's sickening and really it's just a bunch of mental illness.

654
01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And

655
01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you know it's interesting because you want to, you want to go to the very place that I just described as the sheriff's office right

656
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:36.630
Magan: Oh, no.

657
01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You know cuz power, power can corrupt. So it you might bump into all of this again. But you know what, Megan.

658
01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you interact with it differently, you know, maybe you'll feel like

659
01:15:52.260 --> 01:16:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I want the money I want the benefits. Y'all can kick rocks. I don't, I don't need to be your friend. This is, this is the role you got a couple allies. A couple of people that really know know who you are as a professional

660
01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:06.510
Magan: You just

661
01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You just stay connected with them and you can survive it.

662
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:14.640
Magan: I think I could do that here too.

663
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:18.630
Magan: But I feel like I have a target on my back right now.

664
01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:33.990
Magan: And I know it won't always be there but it started with Sydney and Sydney and Stephanie or Estes and it just feels like retaliation by proxy and they just tag team. So it's just a mess.

665
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, if I work in there and Amy It's gonna

666
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.440
Magan: hurt. Oh, it totally would

667
01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because everybody off if

668
01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not you, it's going to be another Megan, it's going to be another bubble buddy that just because you're in their purview.

669
01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. So don't just be like a boring target, then you're just boring, you're just you won't get hyped up amped up puffed up just

670
01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Commit

671
01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:06.720
Magan: To me.

672
01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's take a look at next week.

673
01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.830
Magan: Next Friday.

674
01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.410
Magan: I know will definitely work on he and Dr. And I'll be on time.

675
01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:30.450
Magan: As long as I don't have anything at work. So, but I should be good. I've been pretty telling my boss that Fridays are an important day for me. I have appointment. Okay.

676
01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.250
Magan: Try to not

677
01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.560
Magan: Have me stay so

678
01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You mentioned meeting again but

679
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You think it'd be okay with with Friday.

680
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:46.170
Magan: I do if something comes up and I meet with them.

681
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:53.670
Magan: And something comes up. Perhaps I could just send you a text and say I like I could use a meeting.

682
01:17:54.870 --> 01:18:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So before you forget though. Take what you just did. See if you can draw three or four little symbols and just have them around you today so that they can start to get into your brain. And so they can make their way to, you know, a sticky on your desktop or something over there.

683
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.890
