00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

2
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.940
Wayne Dal: Let

3
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Me open up a note here.

4
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So how was your last night.

5
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.530
Wayne Dal: Was a lot better.

6
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.740
Wayne Dal: My wife actually took the dogs out for a walk and

7
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.640
Wayne Dal: Had a good time.

8
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.710
Wayne Dal: So,

9
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.580
Wayne Dal: I just, I think I had to just talk to somebody yesterday and just get everything out, you know,

10
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.510
Uh huh.

11
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.780
Wayne Dal: So yeah, much better night.

12
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.290
It's fun. Thank you.

13
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.710
Wayne Dal: Thank you for your help with my medication.

14
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:11.430
Wayne Dal: And just to let you know I'm on two milligrams and two strips, because the bottle says dissolve two scripts that day.

15
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.630
Wayne Dal: So I'm thinking, oh, among humans.

16
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

17
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That was

18
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm yeah

19
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.530
Wayne Dal: I just wanted to let you know that I'm not taking two strips. It's just two milligrams

20
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.010
Wayne Dal: So yeah, but

21
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.710
Wayne Dal: Thanks for your help on that.

22
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Just forward it over to but you don't have to wait for me. Just go on. Just log into virtual clinic and say, hey, please get ahold of Dr. Raphael, she knows that I needed strips not tablets. The, could you reach her

23
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, just go in there.

24
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.500
Okay.

25
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Let's see. Where are we at

26
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: She

27
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we're good there. Um, what did we talk about last time.

28
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you tell me what happened. Was your father in law.

29
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what was it that put you over the edge. Was it him having the pills around or something.

30
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.950
Wayne Dal: Yeah. Was that and you know my wife made a mistake. She

31
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.220
Wayne Dal: Well this time, you know, my wife like legally blind.

32
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:30.270
Wayne Dal: And she ran out of contacts and she can't see. So, you know, one morning, she was preparing his pills and

33
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.790
Wayne Dal: Not the bottle over and a bunch of them went down the sink.

34
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.340
Wayne Dal: You know, so do you have to go on and tell him, and he just like totally flip about, you know,

35
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.270
Because he's tired.

36
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.140
Wayne Dal: You know, so

37
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.720
Wayne Dal: And ever since that day he treated her like crap you know he hardly ever talked to her.

38
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.610
Wayne Dal: And he was just acting horrible, you know, and it's just like me and my wife did everything for that man everything

39
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.510
Wayne Dal: You know,

40
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.420
Wayne Dal: He has my wife has some brothers and you know they don't come around at all how at all.

41
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.210
Wayne Dal: So it's just like it.

42
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.330
Wayne Dal: It made me feel like

43
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:34.440
Wayne Dal: He didn't appreciate anything that we did for him, you know, and he was always complaining and it seemed like everything was it whatever we were doing wasn't

44
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.100
Wayne Dal: The one send it over the edge. Was I call and refill his prescriptions for him when they're ready.

45
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.350
Wayne Dal: To the doctor's office.

46
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.110
Wayne Dal: So I had called. I think it was last Monday I had called three fill his scripts.

47
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.100
Wayne Dal: And a couple of hours later he came in and he told me he called the doctor to fill the scripts and I'm like dude.

48
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.070
Wayne Dal: I already did that you know what

49
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.310
Wayne Dal: What, you know, what's your, what's your deal

50
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.020
Wayne Dal: You know, so I said, you

51
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:17.460
Wayne Dal: You don't need to worry about it. We talked, we and Tory, you know, take care of all this stuff for you. And he was just like, well, you need to let me know and I said you know i i really don't need to let you know anything because

52
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.510
Wayne Dal: We do this all the time.

53
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.330
Wayne Dal: For you, you know, and he and he was just, you know, withdraws and he was angry, and I know what he was going

54
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.440
Wayne Dal: Through me

55
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.570
Wayne Dal: But he didn't need to act out

56
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:43.230
Wayne Dal: You know, so I just told him, I said, you know what I said you need to appreciate what we me and Tory do for you. So we do everything for you.

57
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.980
Wayne Dal: And right away. He just said.

58
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.990
Wayne Dal: I don't need this. And I was just like, What don't you need I

59
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.520
Wayne Dal: Said, I'm letting you know.

60
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.010
Wayne Dal: That, you know, we take care of that. You don't have to worry about it and

61
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.720
Wayne Dal: He just went off on me, call me an asshole.

62
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.810
Wayne Dal: I was just like, Okay.

63
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.600
Wayne Dal: I said, I've been called worse than that.

64
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:23.730
Wayne Dal: You can call me and I saw, whatever, you know. And he said, Well, I don't need this. I'm moving out. He said he was like, Don't worry, I'm moving out. And at that point I just got pissed. And I said, You know what, that's fine. I said, leave now.

65
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.890
Wayne Dal: And

66
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.690
Wayne Dal: He ended up getting on the phone and calling somebody and and packing up a bag and

67
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.480
Wayne Dal: He took off, you know, after

68
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.470
Wayne Dal: After all this you know him calling me names and I admit, I did some

69
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:55.200
Wayne Dal: Like I said some stuff I shouldn't have said and probably made the situation a little bit worse. But, you know, no way, shape, or form. Did I ever tell him to move out of the house or

70
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:06.930
Wayne Dal: You know, I was disrespecting him or anything. And that's one thing to he was just like what you need to have some expect. And I said, you know what I said for five years, I've been respecting I've never disrespected you. I said,

71
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.230
Wayne Dal: You need to have some respect. I said, this is our house.

72
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:21.720
Wayne Dal: And that's when he said he was moving out. And that's all the stuff that happened, but of course you know i i was the bad guy. He told my wife lies because

73
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.680
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I

74
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.580
Wayne Dal: Know it's

75
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:31.350
Wayne Dal: In it's my wife knows, but I think she was kind of upset you know

76
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.600
Wayne Dal: And I know she's glad that she wasn't around when all this happened.

77
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:45.450
Wayne Dal: But I think in a way, she was kind of upset and I kind of felt like I should get my tongue or

78
00:07:46.440 --> 00:08:02.430
Wayne Dal: You know, put a sock in my mouth and not said anything, but I couldn't deal with it. It was just like, enough is enough. And this man needs to know that he's not mistreated and you know he doesn't have to lift a finger, you know,

79
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

80
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:12.840
Wayne Dal: Yeah, and that's what I told my wife. I said, Yeah. I said, he's going to find out now because I don't know where he went. Or who he is.

81
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.370
Wayne Dal: But

82
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:23.190
Wayne Dal: He's gonna find out. And so as the person who's staying with you know they're going to find out how difficult it is and

83
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:32.010
Wayne Dal: It doesn't, that's just, that's just what happened in a, in a nutshell, but if you know how it is.

84
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.170
Wayne Dal: I've been having these feelings for a long time, you know, with him and

85
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:51.150
Wayne Dal: Like I told my wife. This morning I said I don't dislike him I said I love him. You know, I'm just, I got sick and tired of the way he was acting and treating you and and it was just my time to say something and

86
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.280
Wayne Dal: You know, I just told her, like, I'm sorry. It wasn't on your time but

87
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.600
Wayne Dal: It was it was time for me.

88
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you see

89
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: From yesterday. Yes.

90
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome to it.

91
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.950
Wayne Dal: You're lying all the time.

92
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.240
Wayne Dal: And they were too.

93
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:27.330
Wayne Dal: So yeah, that's what I told her, and you know, I'm still here if he needs help you if he needs a ride to the doctor or whatever. I'm, I'm here. You know, it just depends on how he feels and and how he

94
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.440
Wayne Dal: Wants to portray me I guess to everyone else.

95
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:43.530
Wayne Dal: So, but I just let my wife, know that I'm here for him. And I know she's here program, and we'll see what happens. You know, I'm sure he'll be calling her

96
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.780
Wayne Dal: Because he's going to be managing his own medication. Now, and he just can't deal with having

97
00:09:49.410 --> 00:10:05.010
Wayne Dal: His, His prescriptions, you know, taking him by himself and managing them and taking them away. They're supposed to be prescribed. So I'm sure he'll be running out here in another week or so and then he'll probably be calling my wife, making her feel guilty, you know,

98
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So what have you learned about how to let's say you're going to teach

99
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Tori.

100
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How to

101
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Not accept the guilt trip invitation, or let the guilt trip bus pass by. How would you teach her what to do. So in other words, how do you decline the guilt trip invitation.

102
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.610
Wayne Dal: It's hard with her.

103
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.690
Wayne Dal: I just

104
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.150
Wayne Dal: I just tell her you know it's not your fault.

105
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.800
Wayne Dal: And

106
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.360
Wayne Dal: Don't, don't let him make you think it's your fault.

107
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.580
Wayne Dal: You know, and it's really hard to

108
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.940
Wayne Dal: To step around or not upset her or thinking or or

109
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.970
Wayne Dal: Her thinking I'm attacking her, you know, in a certain way.

110
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.750
Wayne Dal: It's kind of hard. I gotta like tiptoe around stuff and and just

111
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.270
Wayne Dal: Not make her feel like I'm telling her what to do or

112
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:28.230
Wayne Dal: Or anything like that. So what I would, I would just tell her is you know it. I already told her. It's going to happen.

113
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:34.170
Wayne Dal: And there's nothing you can do. It's out of your control. You know, you can't control what he's doing.

114
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.940
Wayne Dal: And

115
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:45.360
Wayne Dal: We both know it's going to happen. So when it does, I said, all you have to do is tell him you're sorry and there's nothing you can do for him.

116
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.460
Wayne Dal: You know, but I just, I've told her. It's not your fault.

117
00:11:52.980 --> 00:12:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: So a little bit more specific. What would you say to me if I'm father in law and I say you guys never really cared about me. I'm all does fine, I'll just live on the streets.

118
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:20.760
Wayne Dal: Whatever told him, is I would tell him we took care of him, to the best of our ability. And if that's what he chooses to do, then that's his decision.

119
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And what would your if I if charring was to be told that. What do you think she would say to down

120
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.600
Wayne Dal: Right there, she would probably say something relatively about the same.

121
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.710
Okay.

122
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the key things is, and you may have heard that in the group which is you you hold on to your truth even though I'm saying go on this trip called guilt trip.

123
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You can decline.

124
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to hold on to your truth which is

125
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: My memory of it father in law is

126
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We enjoyed having you here and a lot of ways, I think there was some ongoing tension.

127
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you're more than welcome to be here again. But we do need to kind of have rules of kindness that needs to be in place. If that were to happen again just baseline kindness, just, you know, treat one another with the sort of

128
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Etiquette and polite that you would the pharmacist.

129
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, or the or the bag lady at Safeway.

130
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the you know the or the person at the at Walmart where you would say good morning and you would be kind.

131
00:13:47.250 --> 00:14:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You would use pleasantries. And I think that was missing. And maybe, you know, if we ever do decide to give this another try that would need to be there. Now, that's one of your story right just now you know me right I play out my own little thing in my head.

132
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:09.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So that that would be my thing. But what you got to hear is, I talked about my truth. I didn't take on what he said.

133
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That his, his approach. For example, the guilt trip is it's a manipulation and actually we end up resenting the person quite a bit. If we fall for it.

134
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So instead, you just you just say your truth. Well, I love you. I love you, dad, and

135
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I think we got a little heated. I think there's probably, you and I, probably, I'm guessing I imagine we had both of us some some built up feelings and and we kind of popped off air a little

136
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're always welcome on my home. If you ever need a ride anywhere. You know, I'm here for you. Don't be shy about about asking and I'm happy to to do that.

137
00:14:51.180 --> 00:15:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just leave it alone. You just say that and that and that and that. And again, and again, whatever. The truth is, that's I made that story up but you don't have to follow.

138
00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Their guilt trip. You have to just decline it and just tell your truth.

139
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.400
Wayne Dal: Yeah, and I think I kind of did.

140
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.640
Wayne Dal: I fall because it did bother me a lot.

141
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:25.680
Wayne Dal: But after a while I was just like, you know, I didn't do anything wrong. But I learned the truth. And that was my truth and

142
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.050
Wayne Dal: You know,

143
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:35.190
Wayne Dal: So, after a while, it didn't bother me as much as the things that he said I was just like, whatever.

144
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.020
Wayne Dal: I know what you're going to do. I've been there so

145
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:46.050
Wayne Dal: You know I it bothered me for like a day or two.

146
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.600
Wayne Dal: And then I just

147
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:57.960
Wayne Dal: Kind of said, you know, like I didn't tell him anything disrespectful. I just told him what I felt right.

148
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.450
Wayne Dal: And and

149
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.020
Wayne Dal: What Ray said yesterday was just like

150
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.450
Wayne Dal: made so much sense and

151
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.360
Wayne Dal: I'm so glad that he

152
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.370
Wayne Dal: spoke up yesterday, cuz he, what he said was

153
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.310
Wayne Dal: Really I know came from his heart and I really took it. Yeah.

154
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:38.010
Wayne Dal: And I got a lot of support yesterday and I really enjoyed it. You know, hearing from any feedback from everybody. And it just after after yesterday's felt so much better.

155
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.660
Wayne Dal: You know,

156
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.190
Wayne Dal: So,

157
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what they're for most people don't use

158
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, or you did. I'm really, really impressed. I'm helpful you're, you know, you're setting that stage for other people.

159
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Take yeah that's not too.

160
00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.150
Wayne Dal: And I want to

161
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:06.540
Wayne Dal: I want to and you know a lot of people are are are shy and real secretive and don't want us to know what's going on in their lives, but

162
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:23.100
Wayne Dal: Lou. I feel as if, if you're really having problems, you know, it's better to talk about about what's going on and get some feedback and you know you do feel better and understand, you know, we're strangers, you know, and

163
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:32.940
Wayne Dal: People, some people have a hard time but the way I feel now is just like, you know, if I have something to say. I'm going to say it. And if I'm feeling a certain way. I'm going to say it.

164
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.640
Wayne Dal: Because I know there's there's people in there that support me and

165
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:48.420
Wayne Dal: Really, I could I could care less if if they judge me or think differently about me or if I cry or whatever.

166
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:59.790
Wayne Dal: Because we're all going to the same same stuff. Yeah, when when it comes out into the open when we finally start talking about it, everyone's going to the same thing.

167
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

168
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

169
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Good girl. Very good group very effective. So, that was fun to be a part of.

170
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.300
Yeah.

171
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

172
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's touch on, you know, some other relationships, maybe. And also, you were talking not only about

173
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What the circumstances more for the self medicating behavior. And so we talked about circumstance. And we talked about shifting mindset.

174
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's spend a little bit of time also talking about

175
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Other coping skills.

176
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You know and and what might be missing.

177
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you could be doing

178
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That becomes a habit, instead of the old way of thinking. Which, by the way.

179
00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't go completely relapse. You just self medicated okay the behavior was the same, but it's not it's not the same as giving up on recovery that would have been you dropped out of brain, heart started drinking and taking pills, again, that would be a relapse.

180
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so we're just going to call this just a little, a little slip, but it's so small.

181
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And so now when you had a restart today. What did you notice about where you how your mindset was about the medication and how you want it today to go because now it's the next day we get to see right away, kind of how your mindset is

182
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.800
Wayne Dal: Oh, I just woke up feeling positive

183
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.260
Wayne Dal: I didn't feel like it was

184
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.410
Wayne Dal: Like yesterday it was just seemed like a down day and it was just like, it felt just like there was a cloud over my head. No.

185
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.960
Wayne Dal: But today I woke up.

186
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.940
Wayne Dal: really early.

187
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.430
Wayne Dal: I just felt really positive and

188
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.390
Wayne Dal: You know me and my wife got up with the puppy and

189
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.040
Wayne Dal: Coffee and and

190
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.630
Wayne Dal: Just, just was a good

191
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.560
Wayne Dal: I'm going to get mindset right now and

192
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:24.150
Wayne Dal: As far as my medication goes you know I know I can get back down to where I was, and I'm going to

193
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.580
Wayne Dal: do my best to do it.

194
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:32.130
Wayne Dal: Okay, you know, my goal is still be off Suboxone by hitting hitting here.

195
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.400
Wayne Dal: You know, so that hasn't changed, but

196
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:41.460
Wayne Dal: I know, I know it's gonna be hard, and there's gonna be bumps in the road on the way. But I just got to have that confidence in

197
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.120
Myself.

198
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.670
Wayne Dal: And

199
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.340
Wayne Dal: Just be proud of myself.

200
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:56.640
Wayne Dal: My accomplishments and how far I've come. So that's, that's my mindset to be

201
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.170
Wayne Dal: Back on track and

202
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.520
Wayne Dal: And keep on rolling

203
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Call. Alright, so if we just go with just the facts. We've got went up to two milligrams of buprenorphine which day was. That was it. On Monday, was it on Sunday.

204
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.730
Wayne Dal: It was done it was on Monday when I saw

205
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.770
Wayne Dal: Dr Edelman Edelman, said his name.

206
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.200
Wayne Dal: Yes, on the 13th.

207
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.920
Wayne Dal: And the 13th. Because remember, I was saying that I was having just like

208
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.800
Wayne Dal: Just difficult

209
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: April 13

210
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.160
Yeah.

211
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha, because I've got it, I've got, I've got a note here from for 14 went up to 1.5 so maybe there may have been some minimization. Maybe you were minimizing that time. Okay. All right. All right, so it was actually up to okay up to tip. Okay.

212
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.530
Wayne Dal: It's just good to

213
00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.500
Wayne Dal: Just speak the truth. And that's all I can do. You know, I just want to be honest and

214
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.270
And

215
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's break it down a little bit on on shakes. Tell me how your body felt on two milligrams versus

216
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it originally supposed to be 175 or something. It was

217
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.170
Wayne Dal: It was originally 1.5

218
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tell me the physiological difference. You've already said, the truth. So now I can get into it. There's nothing to hide. What was the actual physical difference between 1.5 and two

219
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.380
Wayne Dal: The difference was

220
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.740
Wayne Dal: I wasn't irritable.

221
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.950
Wayne Dal: Didn't feel tired.

222
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.100
Wayne Dal: I didn't have the heavy legs.

223
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:45.810
Wayne Dal: And

224
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.960
Wayne Dal: Energy to do to get up and do things.

225
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.880
Wayne Dal: I was able to sleep.

226
00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.970
Wayne Dal: I didn't have the sweats.

227
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.220
Wayne Dal: And I didn't feel like this weird

228
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.820
Wayne Dal: I don't know how to describe it. So,

229
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.150
Wayne Dal: Kind of just like out of it. It's just like

230
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.490
Wayne Dal: I swear, like I look at something on the floor and I'd see like color.

231
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.610
Wayne Dal: That wasn't even there, it was just weird.

232
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.000
Wayne Dal: You know, so there was a big there was a big difference.

233
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's slow down. Stay here. Now let's go all the way back to the original taper, of which I don't know the day come back to the original taper period at 1.5

234
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you stabilize at 1.5 looks like had to go up to the cravings. So it looks like I got a little note 131 the end of March.

235
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Had you gone

236
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see. Okay. So had to go

237
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:10.560
Wayne Dal: Up did occur when I was at one and one was just couldn't do it. I was just not feeling well at all.

238
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold on. Don't say anything. Hold on. Did you when you were tapering down to one where you tapering a whole milligram at a time.

239
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so that's I've watched. I've been watching, y'all. That's really fast and I've I'm watching when you guys get down into this

240
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: two milligrams. When you start getting in there. I would recommend you taper.

241
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Like talk with you, Doc. Obviously this is outside my lane, but just as having been a witness. When I see people go down point two five milligram or I see people taper at point five.

242
00:24:51.060 --> 00:25:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not in distress, like you're describing, so I think it's not it's not a matter of that there's a problem with the tapering I think that this is where we you really see the stickiness of these receptors. This is where a big

243
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of biochemical changes happening and what I've watched is, those of you who who say I need to go slower.

244
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: As in the the taper amount. So going down point two five. So I don't, you know, talk with your doctor about does that need to be I I use a two milligrams tablet or, you know, talk with her about how to do it so that you can pull it off with that kind of differential

245
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know whether you need to get a scale that has this this exact little weight. I have no idea about that part. But I've been listening to her and the clients that do it this way, then they don't have what you what happened to you, which is they can't get

246
00:25:51.150 --> 00:26:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling their new normal again. And they end up going back up. So you're not alone up. I just think it was too fast for your body. So when you approach it. Don't approach it like

247
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll never be able to get down again, just see it as I'm going to do it differently. I'm going to go down in a smaller dose smaller taper rate make sense.

248
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:19.500
Wayne Dal: It definitely makes sense. And I know we've we've talked about it a lot, you know, going, going by, you know, half a milligram per

249
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:21.720
Wayne Dal: And

250
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.720
Wayne Dal: I don't know, I just

251
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.340
Wayne Dal: I guess maybe I was just in too much of a hurry.

252
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.360
Wayne Dal: I thought I know now it's just like

253
00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.730
Wayne Dal: I can't be in a hurry. I can I just

254
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: People

255
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got people that are, point, point two five. And they're just staying there.

256
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they tried this other and they're just they're not quite ready it's done quite air. So don't look because here's what's happening.

257
00:26:49.440 --> 00:27:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You're confusing off with down. So don't, we're not on an off taper off a treatment plan. So let's let when you decide I want to taper off that's months from now.

258
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But you'll feel the difference. You'll feel it it, but it's not right now. Can we just call this your tapering down. That's all.

259
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're ready to go off. That's a lot more management from the doctor. There's other support medications that go on.

260
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to be doing this willy nilly, it's not going to just be all of a sudden, it's going to feel really deliberate and on purpose.

261
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This last like two months that you say that's it. Now I'm resolved. I'm committed, I want to do a taper taper off protocol, it's gonna be different, a different medication different frequency that can be checking in with her.

262
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

263
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just say it's what you said you rushed, there's been other times that you've done this, too. And this is, that's okay so that you did this one I'm suspecting it as

264
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't like being at it right you don't like it.

265
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.680
Wayne Dal: No.

266
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.030
Wayne Dal: Like I said yesterday, it's hard to

267
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.020
Wayne Dal: To have to get up and take medication to feel

268
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.710
Wayne Dal: Normal and to go about your day and

269
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:23.010
Wayne Dal: And that's what people don't understand. So yeah, I don't make it

270
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but that just like it's getting in the way of a really. I mean, you put you put all this all these hours of treatment. Right. Right. But I mean, you got to look at as an investment. It's like, well, why am I rushing right at the end.

271
00:28:42.660 --> 00:29:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Can say you're excited right to to be completely free. That's exciting. But, but really honor that this, this is a big deal because it isn't. You're not doing this alone. You're doing it also not not using baby, which has had the tobacco in it.

272
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It had all of this ritual to it.

273
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It was an outlet and it's not there. Okay. On top of that, this coronavirus financial challenges in our personal lives in LA in our personal was son, so just

274
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Put the reins on that fast, fast change just pull back a little bit.

275
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just look at look at some facts here.

276
00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to know your body. It's too fast for your body. So let's do it differently.

277
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But why still, even though you might say, gee, it was nice rain to have had those kind words.

278
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How come you still have this negative inner critic that somehow

279
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You're an addict and write that term itself or chemically dependent depending on sort of how you phrase it

280
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Even this far into your recovery still

281
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what I would call iOS and tonic. It's not something that you welcome. It's still what how do you feel when you think about what you are

282
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.790
Wayne Dal: To be honest, it's shame.

283
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.370
Wayne Dal: Because

284
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.800
Wayne Dal: I knew better.

285
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:33.660
Wayne Dal: And

286
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.150
Wayne Dal: Never a million years. Did I think I would be in the situation. I am now.

287
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on. So notice what you just said.

288
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to tell you you're going to laugh when you hear it back to you.

289
00:30:48.030 --> 00:31:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I knew better, never in a million years. Did I think I knew better. I never knew, I knew better. I never knew in a million years. I never thought, wait a minute. They're complete opposition. What do you mean you knew better, because your mom Drake.

290
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What did he do better.

291
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:11.760
Wayne Dal: Because I've

292
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.640
Wayne Dal: Was I've seen it. You know, I've seen what it does to people.

293
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:18.960
Opiates

294
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.540
Wayne Dal: I guess not really opiates. I guess just alcohol and just, you know,

295
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.390
Wayne Dal: Drugs.

296
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.070
Wayne Dal: On another hand, I just, I guess I really didn't

297
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:55.200
Wayne Dal: I didn't know what addiction was or dependency was, you know, cuz I never thought it could happen to me. I mean, I'm like, people will talk about. I mean, I could get addicted to these pills. I mean, how does that happen. And I mean, so I guess maybe denial. A lot

298
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.570
Wayne Dal: I don't know.

299
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it possible that you started thinking

300
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That this whole field was based on willpower. You make up your mind to do something.

301
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're doing it once you make up your mind to stop by then, if you have good motivation, you'll stop. Is that your earlier.

302
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:15.000
Beliefs.

303
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if it's still lingering. What if there's a part of you that still kind of thinks that you haven't quite let go.

304
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.790
Wayne Dal: There is probably part of me that still thinks. I've done

305
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.020
Yeah.

306
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I never

307
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Have said the word willpower unless it's coming from what I believe is my client. I've never said let's design a goal.

308
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Around it, it's not a thing.

309
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you write it down over there. I've gotta know dying to know

310
00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.770
Wayne Dal: I guess wrote willpower.

311
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.970
Wayne Dal: You know, I'm just kind of just writing down what we're talking about.

312
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but what are you writing about willpower.

313
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:13.350
Wayne Dal: Well, like we just say we're gonna set it we're gonna make a goal.

314
00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:14.730
Oh,

315
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Scratch it out. No.

316
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I'm totally misunderstood.

317
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm asking you if that is an old, outdated non applicable your therapist never uses the word wedding group. Have I ever said you have good willpower. Yours is for shit. You need to work on yours. When have I ever said that

318
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.200
Liberty.

319
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Know I BROUGHT THAT WORD OF today because I'm suspecting it's your turn.

320
00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.440
Wayne Dal: To something I need to stop.

321
00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.770
Wayne Dal: Yeah, don't thinking about stuff.

322
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Because let's just try just try and

323
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to find it.

324
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, tell me what part of the brain do you know all the different parts of the brain. Where does it live well then you know all about it will power. Where is it, which part of the brain left hemisphere right hemisphere part of the limbic system prefrontal cortex corpus callosum were

325
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.630
Wayne Dal: No idea.

326
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know it when you have it.

327
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You know it when you don't have it.

328
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Come on, you do

329
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:44.730
Wayne Dal: Yeah.

330
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so tell me when you know you've got it.

331
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:53.580
Wayne Dal: Is

332
00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.330
Wayne Dal: Going through this program.

333
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.280
Wayne Dal: I think that's

334
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.160
Wayne Dal: Having willpower.

335
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So going through your program.

336
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.030
Wayne Dal: To be strong enough to to admit you know

337
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:15.600
Wayne Dal: I'm dependent. Okay.

338
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.860
Wayne Dal: Stop. So I think that's

339
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.050
Wayne Dal: That's

340
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.450
Wayne Dal: Willpower

341
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take this as mechanized this a little bit.

342
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I admitted. I had a problem.

343
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need to do some

344
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need to take care of some

345
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.160
Wayne Dal: Now, yeah, just, you know,

346
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.880
Wayne Dal: That's my wife, she's getting ready for word. I'm sorry.

347
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one.

348
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Admitted okay so

349
00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an action.

350
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a verb admitted it. I, I think I have a problem.

351
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You showed up for services.

352
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: When you probably didn't want to. And you had other things she probably wanted to do.

353
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that right, yeah.

354
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you do activities in group and an individual therapy that were uncomfortable.

355
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.090
Yes.

356
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had to do behavioral meaning thoughts.

357
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And communication and behavior. So a thought is a behavior communication is a behavior. So is picking something up dropping something off doing they're all behaviors, even a thought is a behavior.

358
00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:05.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had to do behavioral experiments in order to make substantial changes in your life.

359
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.080
Yes.

360
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Name a few of them.

361
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:28.920
Wayne Dal: Behavioral changes.

362
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Put behavior equals

363
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Thoughts

364
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.100
Wayne Dal: I've had to change my my way of thinking.

365
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're writing notes so thoughts communication and actions.

366
00:37:53.580 --> 00:38:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that is not all encompassing but that had some some really big, broad categories that you could probably come up with little evidences of stories. So now take a look at it and say well hat. What exactly have you done

367
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: To change behavior.

368
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.850
Wayne Dal: Positive being positive

369
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey being positive. Yeah, so give me good. Let me and let me hear a positive

370
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Me here was

371
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.320
Just

372
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.180
Wayne Dal: Positive thinking just just

373
00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:43.560
Wayne Dal: Said, but

374
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.300
Wayne Dal: Thinking of the positive and a negative situation or negative

375
00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:01.380
Wayne Dal: You know, whatever the situation may be I've thought about the positive

376
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:08.880
Wayne Dal: Can come out of whatever, whatever it is, you know, I mean, instead of being being on can't do this.

377
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

378
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:18.000
Wayne Dal: I can think of the positive that will come out of a situation or something like that.

379
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And does that take effort to do that.

380
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.310
Wayne Dal: It used to but now I can actually

381
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.850
Wayne Dal: I can just think about something positive pretty quickly.

382
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.110
Wayne Dal: I don't have to sit there and dwell on it and

383
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:44.700
Wayne Dal: Think of something I can just it'll just come to me right away. Well, at least you know maybe this

384
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.900
Wayne Dal: Back with my father in law, who said, well,

385
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.770
Wayne Dal: You know, we really haven't been as strong.

386
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.790
Wayne Dal: Now, and, you know,

387
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.880
Wayne Dal: Maybe it'll be fine. We can

388
00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: My wife.

389
00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:01.470
Wayne Dal: Yeah, now we have all this time together and and

390
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:11.040
Wayne Dal: It's now. Now it should be easy. It shouldn't be hard. You know, we went through all these hard times with the kids and

391
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.550
Wayne Dal: Your guide and now it's our time and

392
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.960
Wayne Dal: It's positive time. Now it's me a new time

393
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's very tangible I've asked you, very difficult question just now I've asking you to to look at your note in front of you and to give me an example. And you gave an amazing one

394
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You look at a situation, and although it was more difficult before you're able to see

395
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the lemonade out of the lemon, you're able to see the sunny side of it, you're able to see the upside of something and we might call that reframing you're able to reframe it

396
00:40:49.920 --> 00:41:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh that's given us a chance to really, you know, my wife and I to talk about some old history with, you know, you and your father or you know it's it's looking at something, how can I make the most out of this moment that is

397
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's an excellent example. So we look at the picture notes again. You just gave a thought as an example of a behavior.

398
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That was excellent. Let's have

399
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: An actual

400
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: One that someone could see not just hear with their ears, while they were saying it out loud or have heard. Oh, that's what you were thinking about, that's great. But they could actually see with their eyes or it could be recorded on a video.

401
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What would be an action that evidences that you are

402
00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Making a behavior change.

403
00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:47.370
Wayne Dal: I think I don't know if this falls under communication or anything like that. But as far as action goes, I

404
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:56.460
Wayne Dal: I've learned to, you know, this is a big deal to say what I have to say and and that's it and

405
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:01.110
Wayne Dal: And I think that's

406
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.650
Wayne Dal: I don't know if that falls under action, but to me it does because people aren't people are used to seeing me differently.

407
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.150
Wayne Dal: Instead of seeing what I have to say and moving on.

408
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What did they, what did they

409
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: What did they

410
00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:20.910
See

411
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: They

412
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.320
Wayne Dal: See me getting angry. They used to see me.

413
00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.690
Wayne Dal: Isolate

414
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.550
Wayne Dal: Instead of just saying what I have to say. Moving on, and

415
00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.390
Wayne Dal: Being happy.

416
00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:40.890
Okay.

417
00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got a cognitive one of thoughts. We've got communication as sort of a combination

418
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Work. Keep going. Come up with another one that's very, very action oriented. See if you can find one.

419
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:08.340
Wayne Dal: Well, one comes to mind. One day when when kind of live here, me and my wife had an argument and

420
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.380
Wayne Dal: I went outside and started doing some yard work.

421
00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:20.160
Wayne Dal: And a couple hours later, I came back in and he said, you know what God

422
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:22.470
Wayne Dal: You may

423
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.730
Wayne Dal: Not realize that there's

424
00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.180
Wayne Dal: Other stuff to do other than drink.

425
00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.280
Wayne Dal: Or get high.

426
00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:36.360
Wayne Dal: So I, you know, I've learned just to say my piece. And I don't know, just

427
00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.710
Wayne Dal: To me what he told me that they just made me feel

428
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Well as he wants to do. He asked

429
00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.700
Wayne Dal: He was watching me you know go outside and rake and pull weeds and stuff like that.

430
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:52.650
Wayne Dal: And you were sitting in

431
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.010
Wayne Dal: Here and you know popping open beers and

432
00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.170
Wayne Dal: You know, I mean, so

433
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.290
Wayne Dal: And yelling and continuing on the argument.

434
00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:09.270
Wayne Dal: So I think to me when he told me that it just, it made me feel proud and it made me happy.

435
00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:16.650
Wayne Dal: But look, he noticed it. And now he knows that he can do other things too.

436
00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So stuff already were hold on to that one.

437
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: We kept pushing or I kept pushing. I want to know a behavior.

438
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: All the telling him, do the right thing, son, do the right thing.

439
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: cannot replace witnessing in real time. You are in a disagreement, you got up channeled that energy when outside raped.

440
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: With his own eyes. He's already feeling the disconnect with you.

441
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: He's probably thinking, I like to have a drink.

442
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: He witnesses, you probably having a similar experience of distress miscommunication frustration, irritability, anger, sadness to such complex human emotions.

443
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And you went outside and rate.

444
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You got through yours through movement through distraction. You got time to think through to breathe and he got to see in real time.

445
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: The healthy way to manage emotions.

446
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And he said it out loud.

447
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: He got to tell you, so many things happen in that exchange.

448
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the painful when you're ready, don't. That's why I'm talking slow. That was an awesome when you get big gold stars for that one. Now watch

449
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, my ears about

450
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready.

451
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Now picture Kenneth is there.

452
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Right as the interaction with your father in law's happening.

453
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it.

454
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And you went and did what

455
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right after

456
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.670
Wayne Dal: What did I do right after I

457
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.990
Wayne Dal: Text my wife and talk to her.

458
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. Okay, what else

459
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.460
Wayne Dal: I started cleaning out his stuff.

460
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.110
Wayne Dal: I started packing his bags.

461
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.100
Okay.

462
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:53.400
Wayne Dal: You know, but I think the the major thing that I did was communicate with my wife.

463
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.870
Wayne Dal: And tell her what what was going on.

464
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Now thinking about if your son. Remember, he's trying. He's trying to work a recovery approach right and it may not just be around father in law, it may be around in March.

465
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you do what you needed to do for your recovery right if your son, basically. Let's say he's a constant witness of what you do and what you don't do what did he see you doing

466
00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: With the subs innovating. Let's just say, Well, what do you see what did he see what could he

467
00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:43.260
Wayne Dal: Was right there with the increase in Serbs, he saw me self medicating

468
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What would he have said if he saw that. Do you think

469
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:47.670
Wayne Dal: You'd probably do.

470
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

471
00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.150
Wayne Dal: I don't know, mad, maybe upset or asking me what I was doing.

472
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you doing, oh, what do you think he would have said back to them.

473
00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:02.940
Wayne Dal: I would have told him that I was

474
00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.300
Wayne Dal: not feeling well.

475
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And might have said.

476
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If this is a doctor's prescription. Why don't you talk to your doctor.

477
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, maybe your son wouldn't have but some sun might have

478
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:23.700
Yeah.

479
00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.000
Wayne Dal: Yeah, definitely. He went to say that

480
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.280
Wayne Dal: Anybody who knows

481
00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.470
Wayne Dal: Like what

482
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:42.780
Wayne Dal: How much medication, I should be taking or whatever, like that's somebody would have told me that right

483
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But in that moment, if your son had caught you right there and said, What are you doing,

484
00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: How could you have done the equivalent of go rake the leaves, what could you have done in that moment with a witness. It's different when we have a witness

485
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.280
Wayne Dal: I could have done.

486
00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.460
Wayne Dal: Something else. Okay.

487
00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.060
Wayne Dal: Just like I did before.

488
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what

489
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:21.060
Wayne Dal: Well, I

490
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:27.270
Wayne Dal: Could have gone outside. I could have, you know, there's always stuff to do around the house so

491
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.070
Wayne Dal: I could go outside and just

492
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:34.680
Wayne Dal: Cleaned up

493
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.410
Wayne Dal: Or something. Okay.

494
00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

495
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do real time now in the moment. So notice that I pressed in on probably some some discomfort on an emotion, you're probably not thrilled.

496
00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: With that, but what was this light for me to bring up the past like march and sort of put it because you were talking about a proud moment and then so I brought up this other one. What was it like to have them sort of sitting there right right there in the front of your working awareness.

497
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.010
Wayne Dal: We just made me realize that

498
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:23.700
Wayne Dal: I just need to be stronger.

499
00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:26.610
Wayne Dal: I need to be

500
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:34.710
Wayne Dal: This word came up yesterday, more compassionate myself and I need to be

501
00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.950
Wayne Dal: Proud of what I've done. And what I've learned.

502
00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that you could find imagining that your son was

503
00:50:50.880 --> 00:51:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Witnessing your decisions as a as a tool for you as an instrument, could you picture that that could be what would my son think right now. What do just for a moment. What would my son. Think about how I'm coping right now.

504
00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:09.660
Wayne Dal: Definitely

505
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: To catch you in the act, you see.

506
00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:13.740
Yeah.

507
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And then later on, six months from now, whenever it's

508
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you assess, or is this a proud moment and you can catch yourself up for now maybe starting with this idea of, if I son were a witness, would I be proud of what I'm doing to model for him, what it's like to meet life on life's terms.

509
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to model for him.

510
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This other way that the he's enough

511
00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The disagreements that sometimes our body feels like crap.

512
00:51:52.530 --> 00:52:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes we rush and we hurry and maybe what was needed was saying out loud, I'm in a rush. I'm ashamed that I still have this darn addiction and I think I heard I needed to call my doctor and saying, you know,

513
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What about that. But again, if the tool is this instrument for you. Wayne. It doesn't mean it's the same for everyone, but

514
00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: For now, maybe being able to have son, what would I do if someone were watching right because. Isn't that how we sort of test our morals, in a sense.

515
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Would I be doing this if no one was looking, would I be doing this if someone was watching you know it's like we kind of check ourselves in that way, or am I doing this because there's no one looking, we can put our, our, sort of our beliefs to the test.

516
00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:48.450
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I think that would work for me because I you know I want to make

517
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:57.030
Wayne Dal: Good example I want to be a good example for all my kids and I want to make him proud, so

518
00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:01.440
Wayne Dal: That would work, definitely worked for me.

519
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And so way, it's a it's a temporary one probably sometime in the future. Then I'll want to pull that one back and then

520
00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll just be you.

521
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you'll have that

522
00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait.

523
00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not proud, in and of itself. I want to feel proud myself and I don't need anyone watching later on. But for now.

524
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just play with this one a little bit just picturing the he were here there with you. Hey, I'm checking myself. Is this something I would do if someone was watching what's really going on. What am I feeling

525
00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm feeling physical distress and all of this tension in this House.

526
00:53:52.380 --> 00:54:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How Am I addressing how am I trying to solve each one of those individually. What am I, how am I cannot. How can I get in the solution here.

527
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you just address them one by one.

528
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're almost at the top of the hour. Let's talk a little

529
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: About what today was like

530
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: How did it feel, what are you noticing that's important for you.

531
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.020
Wayne Dal: Feel. Well, once again, I feel good.

532
00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:34.140
Wayne Dal: To get

533
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.500
Wayne Dal: Good stuff out, talk about stuff.

534
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:40.740
Wayne Dal: And

535
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:47.670
Wayne Dal: I think I really need to concentrate on on

536
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:52.380
Wayne Dal: What we were just talking about of

537
00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:57.690
Wayne Dal: Would I be acting as we're doing this stuff. If somebody was here watching

538
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:00.690
Wayne Dal: And

539
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.950
Wayne Dal: I guess just being

540
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.690
Wayne Dal: Fits

541
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.790
Wayne Dal: May be accountable for my actions or just for myself.

542
00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Accountable maybe

543
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's not the most comfortable

544
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.500
Wayne Dal: Thing and just kind of think things through more before it.

545
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm impressed. Today was a little different. Normally I come up with a catchy little phrase for you. We do some role plays, you have a warm fuzzy feeling, you've got a new communication approach and then you go tested and

546
00:55:49.320 --> 00:56:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Today was different. Today I pressed in on the attic, the addictive voice I pressed him hard and I challenged it really got in there and was like, okay, let's let's have. Let's have a talk right I pressed him hard and did that feel a little, a little different.

547
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.310
Wayne Dal: You know, huh.

548
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I will confrontational even

549
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:13.590
Wayne Dal: Who wouldn't say confrontational just uncomfortable.

550
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncomfortable. Yes.

551
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

552
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I want the addict to be uncomfortable. I have no problem. I will custom swear and how the language of no of his old sailor make my point. I have no problem keeping it real, but to you.

553
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, that's where the, the, the love and the compassion is and what would the next loving thing be what would love to. I just, I noticed in some of the way I was talking with you today that some of the catchy little phrases

554
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: They're slipping away, maybe they're not being remember is that possible.

555
00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:55.290
Wayne Dal: Yeah, I haven't thought about what would love do for for for a while so

556
00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:04.050
Wayne Dal: Uh huh. No, no good said that yesterday and it made me think about here. I haven't told myself that for a long time.

557
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:11.280
Wayne Dal: Couple months, you know. So I always got to keep that little phrase in my head.

558
00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.560
Wayne Dal: Because once I tell myself that

559
00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:19.860
Wayne Dal: It changes.

560
00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.450
Wayne Dal: The way I feel like pretty much instantly, you know,

561
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the mantra. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Let's schedule another appointment.

562
00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:31.980
Wayne Dal: Okay.

563
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.120
Wayne Dal: You let me know I'll be I'll be here.

564
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.230
Pencil

565
00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:07.350
Okay.

566
00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:09.750
Let's go.

567
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:49.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to communicate to the doctor about and you may only recognize it when you get in to group that hey you know you've had some days where you're feeling better and your confidence in using cognitive behavioral emotion regulation skills has improved.

568
00:58:51.330 --> 00:59:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But I would invite you to have a discussion with the doctor about getting back on a taper down, just so that you don't start to think that you can't do it. I don't want you to think that you can't. I think he just went too fast. So just keep that in mind.

569
00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have may 19 at 8am a Tuesday. Would that work for you.

570
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.420
Wayne Dal: Yeah, okay.

571
00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe the invitation. This week I'm just going to talk upside down the invitation. This week might be to

572
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Run that mantra through and

573
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: With the self and with others. What would the loving thing do right now, what would love do

574
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And then also what would love do around this idea of revisiting

575
00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:50.430
Tapering

576
00:59:52.170 --> 01:00:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Just not complicating it with much more than that. And you know, when the voice of addiction comes, you can still use that same mantra.

577
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Those you're going to be an opposition, because the addict doesn't give a crap about love.

578
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So that one could work for you. The same way picture if you had a witness of someone who's respect to are trying to maintain or earn

579
01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, both of those can work.

580
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what happens.

581
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, is there any bridge to today, or are you all set for medication.

582
01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:30.030
Wayne Dal: I'm almost it

583
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I kind of thought so. All right, we'll be good to and it's nice to see you. Two days in a row that will

584
01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:38.160
Wayne Dal: See you to

585
01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:38.910
Wayne Dal: Have a good weekend.

586
01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You too. Bye bye.
