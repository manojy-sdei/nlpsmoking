Sydney Kent: I'm just my list.

29
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.990
Sydney Kent: You know there's up and down throughout the day. I mean, yeah, I guess.

30
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.440
What I mean what do you do when you get to press

31
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.820
Sydney Kent: guitar, piano

32
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.400
Like, you know, I mean, how's everything else going. I know it's kind of a tough time with

33
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.310
This virus and

34
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.180
Sydney Kent: Look,

35
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.410
Shawn Phalen: Did you

36
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.610
Did you want to have individual counseling with me.

37
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.150
Sydney Kent: Um, yeah, I did.

38
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.650
Okay.

39
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:25.470
Do you feel like it would be better if you had it. Maybe it's just like once a month, like as things came up, then you could talk or like

40
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.870
Sydney Kent: Like you know

41
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:40.020
Sydney Kent: Maybe it would be better to get stabilized on your meds. I don't know. Yeah, because it would it would be better for you, like if you had things that you wanted to go for

42
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:56.730
Like step that's that's kind of it like pressing, you know, stuff that you want to try and work through like some goals and all that kind of stuff. So that might give you some time to think about like what would work for you. What would be beneficial.

43
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.730
Sydney Kent: Does that make sense. Yeah. Does that sound right to you or I mean do you have other stuff. You want to talk about

44
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.220
No, no.

45
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.160
Sydney Kent: I'm going to say that how it's so weird, because like I have things I want to talk to. And then when like it comes to the point in like, I can't, I can't even think

46
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.050
Sydney Kent: Okay.

47
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.290
Shawn Phalen: So maybe something you can do is write them down.

48
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.820
Sydney Kent: Right, like just make a list of stuff.

49
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.560
Like even if you just think it's small, doesn't matter.

50
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.360
Yeah.

51
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:51.450
Shawn Phalen: So then that way the session can be really productive for you because I don't know what you want to talk about. You know what I mean, it's like, um,

52
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.200
Sydney Kent: I just know

53
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.140
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, you know, it's like I can only

54
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.600
Shawn Phalen: It's. It doesn't make sense for me to like kind of ask you a million questions because I don't know, doing I'm going to be asking right

55
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.170
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I mean, it's just because this is your

56
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.120
Shawn Phalen: This is for you. This is your time.

57
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.890
Sydney Kent: I'm actually, I'm not. I think of it.

58
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.470
Sydney Kent: Um, I kind of wanted like a talk about, like, um,

59
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.680
Sydney Kent: So I have a hard time like

60
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.540
Sydney Kent: I said, It's like saying things with and I come off as like

61
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.450
Sydney Kent: Like irritated or something and I kind of want to work on that. Like saying things a different way. I'm excited.

62
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.020
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so how do you say things that sound irritating. Why do you think that is

63
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.940
Sydney Kent: Um,

64
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.950
Sydney Kent: Well, I mean earlier.

65
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.680
Sydney Kent: You know, I was a

66
00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.730
Sydney Kent: I open the

67
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.220
Sydney Kent: Open to the door and I for the neighbor. Oh, I can hear myself.

68
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.760
Sydney Kent: And I said that we were getting ready to go to store and I don't know just

69
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.020
Sydney Kent: Sometimes it just comes out like a guarantee.

70
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.490
Shawn Phalen: Do you think, do you think that's because of your mood right now.

71
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.860
Sydney Kent: Or I mean I

72
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.880
Sydney Kent: Mean, it could be. It's always

73
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.700
Shawn Phalen: It was always been like that.

74
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:39.810
Sydney Kent: Do you feel like you're unfriendly towards people know I just our social relationships, just kind of

75
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.850
Sydney Kent: Weird

76
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.050
Sydney Kent: What do you think you are the weird

77
00:06:47.310 --> 00:07:00.510
Sydney Kent: I guess I'm like a more to myself. I'm not a social kind of person. Okay, so that's different than being irritated with people. There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with being to yourself.

78
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.750
Shawn Phalen: So it's kind of like you got to ask yourself, Why are you kind of rude to people.

79
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.160
Like, what do you think that is

80
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:14.940
Sydney Kent: That's it's no

81
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.090
Sydney Kent: It's probably just my thought process like you just want to be left alone.

82
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:31.950
Sydney Kent: Yeah, I guess I like kind of comes off, like maybe the foot, you know, like, you know, but I guess I just need to learn how to safety.

83
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.930
Sydney Kent: Without

84
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:41.520
Sydney Kent: Even when I'm not irritating, you know, phrase, you're like I was talking about earlier. I'm even as well not irritated, like I'm gonna be able

85
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.910
Sydney Kent: To respond to someone

86
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.760
Sydney Kent: And not come off like that.

87
00:07:51.720 --> 00:08:00.240
Sydney Kent: Oh no, have you practice being nicer to people, have you made an effort to be nicer. Oh yeah, and does it work.

88
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.810
Shawn Phalen: So might just be, you know, being really aware

89
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.350
Before you say something

90
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.730
Shawn Phalen: Being aware of how you want it to come out and how you want it to sound.

91
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.810
Sydney Kent: I'm sorry.

92
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.070
Shawn Phalen: Say that again.

93
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.380
What's the matter, what's wrong, tell me what's going on.

94
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.410
Yeah.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.400
Sydney Kent: Awkward day

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.380
Sydney Kent: You know why.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.770
Sydney Kent: Know, it goes back to my mirror kind of thing. Yeah.

99
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.840
Shawn Phalen: Are you having crying jags throughout the day.

100
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.510
Sydney Kent: What does that mean, like,

Sydney Kent: I don't, I don't know.

106
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.990
Sydney Kent: Have you experienced social anxiety in the past. Yeah.

107
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:26.010
So I'm wondering if it will got kind of weird because I was like kind of asking you questions. Do you think that that was maybe had something to do with it.

108
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.710

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.760
Sydney Kent: Um,

116
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.140
Sydney Kent: I don't know if it like I thought about it a few times and

117
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.690
Sydney Kent: You know, sometimes I like

118
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.730
Sydney Kent: How you how you say like a

119
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:32.430

120
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.620
Shawn Phalen: Hmm. So when somebody else's feeling sad. Do you feel sad with them.

Sydney Kent: I just become more aware that it's not me. That's feeling like that right like gonna

125
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.350
Sydney Kent: Say it again. Yeah, so it's somebody

126
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.810
When somebody said New Year's a separate person and you don't have to be sat with them.

127

195
00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:32.550
Sydney Kent: At least just so she knows what's going on with you. So make sure that you're really describing to her how you're feeling and what your emotions like what's happening throughout the day for you. Okay.
