279
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:26.760

N817: Their life revolves around me based

358
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:48.900
Magalie Marcellus: On that

359
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.910
Magalie Marcellus: gives you something to have to be responsible for

360
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.710
N817: Yeah.

361
00:31:58.530 --> 00:31:59.160
N817: Actually

362
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.170
N817: All they want is affection, a little bit.

363
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:12.360
Magalie Marcellus: Way and they good company for your tool.

364
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:27.420
Magalie Marcellus: Is good, right, just in general people and we cover in always tend to may tend to struggle with self esteem. I know we mentioned in the past, you know, some of those

365
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:39.900
Magalie Marcellus: Concerns that you have with self image and things like that. So, um, the more people someone feel good about themselves, the better they you know chances of success. They haven't

366
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:46.530
Magalie Marcellus: Recovery. So I just wanted to just say some statement and see whether those things will be things that you would normally

367
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.650
Magalie Marcellus: Think when it comes to have

368
00:32:50.760 --> 00:33:01.080
Magalie Marcellus: Either a positive self esteem or something that may, you know, when you saw the crease your self esteem. So now, if so, do you tend to be

369
00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.960
Magalie Marcellus: Or not to stand up for yourself.

370
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:10.440
Magalie Marcellus: Is that something you would do you think you don't have that. That's not a struggle for you.

371
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.480
N817: To stand up for myself.

372
00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.760
N817: Yes, yeah.

373
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.860
Magalie Marcellus: You can sign up for yourself. Okay.

374
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:31.590
Magalie Marcellus: Do you. So how do you do that in a way that's not gonna be

375
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:37.440
Magalie Marcellus: intimating for anybody or any type of question because sometimes it could

376
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.090
Magalie Marcellus: It's the way you stand up for yourself that make it effective on it.

377
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:51.660
Magalie Marcellus: So how would you, if you are in a situation where you feel you need to stand up for yourself. How do you make that determination.

378
00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:02.160
N817: Really, I haven't been in that position, a long, long time.

379
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.010
N817: Like

380
00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:17.970
N817: I guess sometimes I do pass. A lot of times on passes, you know, unless it's like really like you know someone sitting here, I have to say somewhere.

381
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:30.420
N817: Then, like I would say somewhere, but most of the time, you know, just act like I don't see what care what what's going on.

382
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.010
N817: And just go about doing whatever else.

383
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.810
Magalie Marcellus: So, so you would ignore the situation.

384
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.700
N817: Yeah, mostly just a normal situation.

385
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:56.460
Magalie Marcellus: Instead of standing up for yourself. So you sent to you would. It would have to be a situation where you feel that you can't ignore it, then that's when you would set up yourself.

386
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.980
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so in those situation.

387
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.310
Yeah. Besides that,

388
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.290
N817: I'm really a

389
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.230
Magalie Marcellus: Passive person you know you with people.

390
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:37.470
N817: But, you know, up here. I don't really have no friends, you know, so I don't get put in like the only person that I deal with nowadays, as you know, my step dad at home.

391
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.370
Magalie Marcellus: It's my sister's house, you know,

392
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:59.190
N817: Know like don't do like stuff like, you know, come over, like do like lock, lock your bedroom door like put stuff up, you know, while I'm there. Like, I'm going to steal something from

393
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.610
N817: I see what you're doing. Don't bring it up.

394
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.190
Magalie Marcellus: Has there been any

395
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:14.490
Magalie Marcellus: Incident where you take something away from them that they feel that they need to

396
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.980
Magalie Marcellus: Make sure they protect their own

397
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.000
Magalie Marcellus: Things when you're around

398
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.250
N817: No, no, that's, that's what like irritates me

399
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.990
N817: Like I've ever did do anything like that.

400
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:39.450
N817: You know, my brother in law. He's such a nervous, like you think everybody's out to get old and repair law.

401
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.410
N817: Even here and I'm known for 15 years

402
00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:52.590
N817: So, you know, like they do weird stuff like that. Like, I don't

403
00:36:53.250 --> 00:37:03.420
Magalie Marcellus: Know, but I'm just having some buddies. Is it like that for everybody, or do you so that is targeted towards you, because they know that you have substance.

404
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.090
N817: Yes, targeted towards me.

405
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:12.270
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so how come you never said anything about it. What do you think would happen if you bring it up to them.

406
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.330
N817: They would just lie and say say that, um,

407
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.580
N817: You know, like

408
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.230
N817: They want to keep the kids out of there or something, you know,

409
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:44.970
N817: They, you know, I've never brought it up because, you know, but it is kind of annoying, but since I'm not in that mindset. Anyways, like I'm not, I don't go over to try to rip them off. Right.

410
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.680
Magalie Marcellus: And it's

411
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.580
N817: It's kind of comical, in a way, you know,

412
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.510
A little irritated and it's quite

413
00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:11.160
N817: Funny. At the same time, you know, cuz you know over the last 15 years, you know, if I wanted to rip them off or ripped him off. You know, steal his money or whatever, you know, I've had thousands of chances to do it.

414
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.150
N817: Never happened but

415
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.240
N817: He still acts like

416
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:25.080
Magalie Marcellus: I said just them, but I know as a sister that she noticed that or

417
00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.010
N817: Like

418
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.910
N817: Yes, basically just him, you know,

419
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.030
Magalie Marcellus: He taught the kids to do to so like if

420
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:41.490
N817: If he's not home.

421
00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.950
Magalie Marcellus: My nieces.

422
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.210
N817: Are there and they let me

423
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.530
Magalie Marcellus: Go to my sister is in his room.

424
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.160
Magalie Marcellus: door locks shut it when

425
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.280
Magalie Marcellus: I would have a conversation with your system if it bothers you.

426
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:16.050
Magalie Marcellus: Maybe she doesn't even know that's been done and if she does know you know I would want to know why they feel that they need to act that way because you're around if you haven't done anything to give them an impression that you would do anything to

427
00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.790
Magalie Marcellus: You know, take their belongings without their permission.

428
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:22.440
Yeah.

429
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:35.790
N817: You know, like I try you know like when I go there, you know, I just want to go over there and like there's no used to shower.

430
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.840
N817: Oh, I try not to really, you know,

431
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.660
N817: ruffle any feathers.

432
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.140
Magalie Marcellus: Gotcha. Okay.

433
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.460
Magalie Marcellus: Definitely

434
00:39:54.780 --> 00:40:05.040
Magalie Marcellus: That would be one of the ways like if you feel that you need to stand up for yourself what you bill for whatever reason you can so that may, you know, sometimes that would work.

435
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.230
Magalie Marcellus: In a way that's

436
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:23.490
Magalie Marcellus: Putting yourself in a similar position where you're not feeling good about yourself because you may have in your head that okay, things are going on, but I don't feel the courage to stand up for myself. So that's one of the

437
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:41.370
Magalie Marcellus: Incident where people would feel that they self esteem is not to where they wanted to be. But, um, but do you feel that you have a good sense of well being and that you respect yourself for the most fun

438
00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:44.460
N817: Oh,

439
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.180
N817: doing really good

440
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:55.110
Magalie Marcellus: Can

441
00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:01.680
N817: I gave myself a lot of credit for you know staying on the program.

442
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:03.600
Magalie Marcellus: You know,

443
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:07.620
N817: And I can see small improvements in my life, you know,

444
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.710
Magalie Marcellus: Or gradual, you know,

445
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:11.970
N817: My wife's getting better.

446
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.560
N817: Not still going down hill. I don't know.

447
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.600
So,

448
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.310
I think that's a good thing.

449
00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.560
Magalie Marcellus: Absolutely. So

450
00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.570
Magalie Marcellus: What would be one of the major progress you notice in yourself.

451
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:51.240
No one, you know, not needing to wake up and spend my whole day searching on drugs.

452
00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.000
Magalie Marcellus: Much time so many years.

453
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.960
N817: It didn't matter if it's from

454
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.790
Magalie Marcellus: That was your focus for the day Chantelle to look for a job.

455
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.440
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

456
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:21.150
That's the main focus

457
00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:30.270
Magalie Marcellus: Now is a big weight off my shoulders over not have that be, like, like the number

458
00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.810
One thing on my mind.

459
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:40.440
And I can actually start thinking about other stuff. I'm looking forward to spring.

460
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.600
And I'm looking forward to my mom coming back.

461
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.640
N817: And just trying to have a normal life.

462
00:42:54.900 --> 00:43:03.090
Magalie Marcellus: Absolutely. There's a definite improvement because they have you better a better outlook on life and

463
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.890
Magalie Marcellus: Putting yourself in a position where you can really be successful.

464
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:10.410
Yeah.

465
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:16.290
N817: And I got another brother up here, Scott, we were raised.

466
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:18.480
Magalie Marcellus: I didn't know

467
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.220
18

468
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.730
N817: He's really, he's really the guy like

469
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:36.150
N817: I used to come. Like I stayed in Ohio for a couple of years. When I first met my father. I went back for

470
00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.100
Magalie Marcellus: You know,

471
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:44.820
N817: appear at first to put me to work all the time, you know, take me 100 trips

472
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:47.520
Magalie Marcellus: But

473

689
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.710
Magalie Marcellus: Really

690
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:08.940
Kari Swafford: You said it's just a wipe down a real quick. In and out. You'll be done in two hours. I had two hours in the kitchen.

691
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:11.250
Magalie Marcellus: Just one area.

692
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:23.610
Kari Swafford: Yeah, we use. There's no way you're going to get all that does all that and the walls and the windows and the blind and the, I mean, come on.

693
01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.100
Magalie Marcellus: So then

694
01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:28.050
Magalie Marcellus: Then

695
01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.150
Magalie Marcellus: Why was needed.

696
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:34.140
Kari Swafford: Yeah, so I ended up having to go back to the next morning.

697
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:35.850
Kari Swafford: And

698
01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:42.330
Kari Swafford: Finish that and then I had another job that I had to do there is

699
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:45.930
Kari Swafford: Good. Give me something to do on Thursday.

700
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:55.230
Kari Swafford: I told her I was like you. You've got to lighten up on the a little bit him like, at first I was good for me because it was keeping me busy like to

701
01:05:55.890 --> 01:06:01.020
Kari Swafford: Write about. I wasn't thinking about Matt and and all that shit.

702
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:01.800
Kari Swafford: You know what I mean.

703
01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:02.250
So,

704
01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:07.710
Kari Swafford: For a little while it was good but now it's just it's starting to become too much.

705
01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:08.880
Magalie Marcellus: And right

706
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:12.180
Magalie Marcellus: And they have some be able to say no to certain things.

707
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:15.630
Magalie Marcellus: Once you noticing that you're getting overwhelmed.

708
01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:20.220
Kari Swafford: Yeah, and I'm afraid to tell her. No, you know what I mean, because she is my boss and she is good.

709
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.120
Kari Swafford: But I'm not doing one

710
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.290
Magalie Marcellus: You need self care.

711
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:33.960
Kari Swafford: Right, so I think she's still use a lot of it like when Matt was home met with with me to work. It was both

712
01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.830
Ah,

713
01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:37.200
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, definitely.

714
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:42.000
Kari Swafford: Yeah, so now you're doing a job for two with one by myself.

715
01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:49.440
Kari Swafford: You know, so like one of those white down quickly now it's wouldn't be such a big deal. Was it not

716
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:50.310
Magalie Marcellus: If it was so

717
01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.440
Kari Swafford: Yeah, but it's not

718
01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.440
Magalie Marcellus: Then definitely he has some yellow

719
01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.690
Magalie Marcellus: Be my understanding with that because

720
01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:01.500
Magalie Marcellus: I know

721
01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.610
Magalie Marcellus: The two of you.

722
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:08.520
Magalie Marcellus: Again, the good part at least you you get something to keep you busy.

723
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.790
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, and that's

724
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.950
Magalie Marcellus: You know, get your focus on other

725
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:15.690
Kari Swafford: Things and it helps with my pain.

726
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:20.070
Kari Swafford: And you know what I mean. So that's always a good thing.

727
01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:22.320
Magalie Marcellus: That's the word

728
01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:23.730
Kari Swafford: I suppose. Right.

729
01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:26.280
Kari Swafford: But you know your body

730
01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.540
Magalie Marcellus: To be able to

731
01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:34.620
Magalie Marcellus: That, well, we went to pay bills.

732
01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:40.890
Magalie Marcellus: But, but then again you know your body after a while your body would shut down if you over and

733
01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.960
Magalie Marcellus: Doing it so. So yeah, there has to be I

734
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:49.020
Kari Swafford: Feel like I feel like I'm really, really burnt out, and then like I had

735
01:07:49.680 --> 01:08:07.590
Kari Swafford: A relapse over the weekend, like I was it and a really old friend like I've known this guy since kindergarten, pretty much, and like you're all just sitting around and we were talking and the next thing I know, I just looked down and I realized I just hit, hit this this ball. And I'm like,

736
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.890
Kari Swafford: Really, I got it. And I looked around and I'm like,

737
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:12.750
Kari Swafford: Did I just really do that.

738
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.310
Magalie Marcellus: Like it was second mainly I

739
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:23.670
Kari Swafford: didn't even think about it just, it was a hit my hand and next thing I knew I was sitting there and I had already hit it, and I'm like, What in the hell.

740
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:25.380
Kari Swafford: I mean,

741
01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.880
Magalie Marcellus: And, but, you know,

742
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.270
Magalie Marcellus: So what did you do when you realize that you

743
01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:33.180
Kari Swafford: Well, it's what did I do

744
01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:40.200
Kari Swafford: Mm hmm. I, at that point, I said, to hell with it and I hit it again. Okay, committed

745
01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.490
Okay.

746
01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:52.860
Kari Swafford: When it came time to either a wake up and be like crap and go to work.

747
01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.150
Kari Swafford: And deal with what I brought on or

748
01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:57.840
Kari Swafford: My been

749
01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:09.720
Kari Swafford: Go get more speed and get high again and whoo off to the races. No, no, like crap and I went to work and I wouldn't took my urine and held myself accountable for it.

750
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:17.880
Kari Swafford: You know i mean i i'm not gonna, I'm not going to beat myself up over it because it was

751
01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.240
Kari Swafford: It was a really big eye opener for me.

752
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:30.390
Kari Swafford: I guess something that I needed to realize I'm not necessarily as far as I thought I was like

753
01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.200
Kari Swafford: Oh, happy.

754
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.390
Magalie Marcellus: Way. Yes, I asked, Sean.

755
01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.170
Mm hmm.

756
01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:37.200
Magalie Marcellus: And that's because sometimes we get

757
01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:37.770
Kari Swafford: We get

758
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:40.140
Magalie Marcellus: Please send anything. Okay, I got this.

759
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:45.240
Magalie Marcellus: Then you end up in a situation. Okay, all of the sudden you try to figure out

760
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:46.650
Magalie Marcellus: What just happened.

761
01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:55.740
Kari Swafford: Like, you know, I was just, I was just sitting here. We were just talking about like second nature. You know what I mean, it was like I had

762
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.680
Kari Swafford: When I realized what I like.

763
01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.290
Kari Swafford: Wow, like I didn't

764
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.450
Kari Swafford: I guess I didn't really realize how susceptible. I

765
01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:07.530
Magalie Marcellus: Saw me

766
01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:09.000
Kari Swafford: You know what I mean, like,

767
01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:09.660
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh.

768
01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:19.020
Kari Swafford: And it just but it was, I think, like I said, I think it was a much needed eye opener for me enemy number one, it just

769
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:19.710
Magalie Marcellus: A lesson.

770
01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:24.270
Kari Swafford: It was a it was a big lesson and where I'm at, with my recovery.

771
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:35.220
Kari Swafford: Yes, I have came in a long, long, long way. But, as you said, I think maybe I've gotten complacent and I just took for granted.

772
01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.210
Kari Swafford: Where I'm at with it all and

773
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:44.280
Kari Swafford: And you know, I guess I allow myself to be in the situation. Number one,

774
01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.910
Kari Swafford: You know what I mean, that was my first mistake is just being in that situation.

775
01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:52.440
Kari Swafford: But

776
01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:58.860
Kari Swafford: I guess just realizing how easily a relapse can happen.

777
01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:00.720
Magalie Marcellus: To me, because

778
01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:01.200
Magalie Marcellus: It was

779
01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:09.390
Kari Swafford: Really just that close like I really could have made the choice when I woke up that morning feeling like crap to go the other way.

780
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.600
Magalie Marcellus: Right, so get you to feel better.

781
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.190
Kari Swafford: Yeah.

782
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.320
Kari Swafford: And that's scary. You know what I mean.

783
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:17.430
Kari Swafford: Uh huh.

784
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:22.980
Magalie Marcellus: But what's important that you realize what happened and that you

785
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:23.790
Took

786
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.970
Magalie Marcellus: responsibility for your actions.

787
01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.790
Kari Swafford: Right. And that, that's how you grow because

788
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:36.480
Magalie Marcellus: It was again. Sometimes it's easy to say, well, you know, you have to stay away from certain

789
01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:37.530
Kari Swafford: Right, people

790
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:39.630
Magalie Marcellus: Places things and then you

791
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.050
Magalie Marcellus: You know,

792
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:43.080
Magalie Marcellus: And after you feel well maybe it's not so bad.

793
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.580
Magalie Marcellus: Then all of a sudden

794
01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:45.960
Kari Swafford: Like

795
01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:49.830
Kari Swafford: With Dr. Davis and like I told the whole group like I didn't

796
01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:53.040
Kari Swafford: Know when we're off to the side like it was

797
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.760
Magalie Marcellus: Something

798
01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.830
Kari Swafford: I discussed with the group. You know what I mean.

799
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.050
Magalie Marcellus: Maybe something they can learn from to I

800
01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:58.350
Kari Swafford: Mean

801
01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:01.080
Kari Swafford: It's something that can happen to each and every one of it.

802
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.250
Magalie Marcellus: So anybody

803
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:03.390
Kari Swafford: Look at you.

804
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.830
Kari Swafford: We all get complacent.

805
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:06.240
Kari Swafford: In our recovery. Yes.

806
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.650
Kari Swafford: Yeah, and I think

807
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:12.360
Kari Swafford: There's some points that all of us take where we are for granted.

808
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.880
Kari Swafford: You know what I mean. So

809
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:15.840
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh. Yeah.

810
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:18.600
Magalie Marcellus: Again,

811
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:28.500
Magalie Marcellus: Applauded you you did you know you didn't stay when you made the slip up, you didn't pay their you pick up and get my backup and

812
01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:31.050
Kari Swafford: Keep moving. Right. And I did.

813
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.260
Kari Swafford: I meant to ask Dr. Jamison, but I

814
01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.500
Kari Swafford: Never do remember. Has anyone heard from Dr. Malik.

815
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.100
Kari Swafford: Like I know he's not

816
01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:47.400
Magalie Marcellus: That's a good question. Yeah, cuz I don't know which country and when are you still there.

817
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:57.510
Magalie Marcellus: I haven't had any update myself and I kind of forgot to even I suppose my the supervisor will be the only one to know if there's any update, but now

818
01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:02.670
Magalie Marcellus: I don't know if his if his back, or has anything

819
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:08.100
Kari Swafford: If you ever happen to think about asked in your supervisor.

820
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.550
Kari Swafford: Yeah.

821
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:13.470
I was just wondering

822
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:18.960
Kari Swafford: Yeah, everything, everything other than that.

823
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:25.800
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, you're, you're maintaining. So tell me about what happened with that because I don't even realize that he was

824
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:43.920
Kari Swafford: Incarcerated or what. Yeah. Matt went to prison and LIKE HE WAS IN MADISON AND THEN him and I were arguing, blah, blah. Whatever we always argue eat calls home six times a day and asked me what I'm doing. And then he gets mad when I tell me what I'm doing.

825
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.240
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm.

826
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.360
Magalie Marcellus: So he doesn't really want

827
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:49.650
Kari Swafford: It.

828
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:50.970
Magalie Marcellus: So then what happened.

829
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.590
Kari Swafford: Nothing, it's just, he wants to call them and argue with me all the time.

830
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:56.820
Kari Swafford: And I don't

831
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:57.990
Kari Swafford: Have time for that.

832
01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.340
Kari Swafford: And then

833
01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:16.800
Kari Swafford: Like he beat some guy up and I guess broke the guy's elbow or whatever and went to the hole and the hole for like 40 days or something like that. And I guess went from a level one to level three.

834
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.410
Magalie Marcellus: So they re

835
01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:29.220
Kari Swafford: Entry level and all this other stuff and like that just tells me that much not doing anything growing, it's just

836
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.770
Magalie Marcellus: Been so you guys been together for a while so

837
01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.530
Kari Swafford: Almost two years.

838
01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:41.550
Magalie Marcellus: But I mean, it's just, okay,

839
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.020
Kari Swafford: So show me is gonna start growing like I don't

840
01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.220
Kari Swafford: Know we weren't really getting along all that great.

841
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:52.110
Magalie Marcellus: Before. Okay.

842
01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.540
Magalie Marcellus: So okay, so so that made even

843
01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.490
Magalie Marcellus: More challenging because

844
01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.890
Magalie Marcellus: I mean, who doesn't need

845
01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:01.230
Kari Swafford: So,

846
01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.040
Magalie Marcellus: Have you

847
01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.010
Magalie Marcellus: Does he know where you stand with a relation to Spain right now or are you doing

848
01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.500
Magalie Marcellus: Did you tell him.

849
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:13.410
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, or do you think he knows

850
01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:16.470
Magalie Marcellus: Did you verbalize that so ham.

851
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:17.730
Kari Swafford: And why was this was

852
01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:23.010
Kari Swafford: He know that he knows he's got to work on him.

853
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:24.450
Kari Swafford: Okay.

854
01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:24.870
But

855
01:15:25.890 --> 01:15:28.560
Magalie Marcellus: Does he know where you guys are in the relationship, whether

856
01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.010
Magalie Marcellus: That how you feel about the relationship right now.

857
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.270
Kari Swafford: Yeah, you know,

858
01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:35.790
Magalie Marcellus: You don't know.

859
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:41.910
Magalie Marcellus: So is he saying that he's going to work on themselves, so you guys can work on your relationship.

860
01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:48.810
Kari Swafford: He said he's gonna work on show he's gonna show me he's going to do this, do that, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

861
01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:53.640
Kari Swafford: And then the actions.

862
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.270
Kari Swafford: Like when he comes home. I'll see what he does, you know,

863
01:15:59.010 --> 01:16:00.660
Kari Swafford: Yeah, it's not going to take long.

864
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:01.860
Kari Swafford: You know, I mean,

865
01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:06.450
Kari Swafford: Usually within about somebody coming home. You know what they're going to do.

866
01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:13.380
Magalie Marcellus: Well, sometimes when they're in there. They may have time to self reflect and they may take

867
01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:15.390
Magalie Marcellus: A look up and you can make

868
01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:16.320
Magalie Marcellus: Some changes.

869
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.410
Kari Swafford: And you can tell the first week, their home, whether they show

870
01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:20.340
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

871
01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.720
Kari Swafford: No, absolutely. Oh.

872
01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.020
Magalie Marcellus: So Dan was, what do you expect when he comes back.

873
01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:26.280
Kari Swafford: Not much.

874
01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:28.830
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

875
01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.220
Magalie Marcellus: So what does that look for you.

876
01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:40.140
Kari Swafford: It looks like I need to just go ahead and let it go like, I happen. You know what I mean like I just

877
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.000
Kari Swafford: Like he

878
01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:45.900
Magalie Marcellus: Was I hear some a little bit that you a little bit ambivalent

879
01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.870
Kari Swafford: He might saw me something different, but

880
01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:52.590
Kari Swafford: I really don't think he will. I mean,

881
01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:56.790
Magalie Marcellus: So you want one. One is, how long does he have to come back.

882
01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:05.670
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so before you know that the time is up. So he's back he's in a house. So then

883
01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:08.310
Kari Swafford: What's wrong. No, he's not coming back in the house.

884
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:10.020
Magalie Marcellus: So why is it gone

885
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.870
Kari Swafford: Mom, Dad.

886
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:18.960
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so what was it before, when he was

887
01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:21.840
Kari Swafford: Taken away.

888
01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.240
Magalie Marcellus: So you guys were in the same house all day.

889
01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:31.020
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, okay. But does he know you don't want him come back in a house when he get release.

890
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.000
Magalie Marcellus: You still

891
01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:34.500
Magalie Marcellus: Owe

892
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.450
Kari Swafford: Doesn't know that I'm working on my house.

893
01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:44.910
Magalie Marcellus: Oh wow, okay. Well that's changing the dynamic. So, okay, well, then it's not like he's coming to wherever he was before.

894
01:17:45.690 --> 01:17:46.620
Magalie Marcellus: So really,

895
01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:55.500
Magalie Marcellus: You have the the controlling of the situation whether you want to allow him to come to the new the new place.

896
01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.330
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, so

897
01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:07.200
Magalie Marcellus: But in the meantime, I guess, you know, you have to see how things work with them and what is he doing for himself before you would make a decision for him to come

898
01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:08.490
Kari Swafford: You can

899
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.210
Magalie Marcellus: Come back in

900
01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:10.290
Kari Swafford: A lot about a person

901
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:13.860
Kari Swafford: How they react to something they don't like.

902
01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:15.330
Kari Swafford: Oh,

903
01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:16.500
Kari Swafford: Yeah.

904
01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:19.020
Kari Swafford: I know Matt doesn't like the bat.

905
01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:26.400
Kari Swafford: That he's not coming home to live with me. And we're not going to be together and all those who wrapped up. I know doesn't like that.

906
01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:30.660
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so that's all I was asking you. What was his reaction does he know that

907
01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:33.630
Kari Swafford: But he really well.

908
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.850
Magalie Marcellus: Causes for someone

909
01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:36.570
Magalie Marcellus: Right, because

910
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:37.800
Kari Swafford: He has nice way.

911
01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:40.530
Kari Swafford: Now he's not being mean to me. He's not

912
01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.520
Kari Swafford: Kidding. He's not blowing me up all the time, yelling, screaming at me.

913
01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:50.190
Kari Swafford: They'll call me about once a week and we have a good conversation. And we just leave that people pushing

914
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:51.420
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

915
01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:55.050
Magalie Marcellus: But he knows that you moved out and he's not going to the place

916
01:18:55.410 --> 01:18:56.340
Kari Swafford: He knows. Yeah.

917
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:58.590
Kari Swafford: We don't have that house anymore.

918
01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:06.930
Magalie Marcellus: And all that. Okay. All right. Well, maybe again maybe he has time to reflect and really want to make some positive changes.

919
01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:09.000
Magalie Marcellus: In his life. I hope you

920
01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:20.550
Magalie Marcellus: Mm hmm. But like you say that, please. Again we he needs to show that he's making that commitment to change before you guys can kind of reconnect again and that way.

921
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:25.920
Magalie Marcellus: Because it's not like you. You have to take him.

922
01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.590
Magalie Marcellus: Because this is where this money. The only place the hat.

923
01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.540
Kari Swafford: Now he has right

924
01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.710
Magalie Marcellus: So you're someone

925
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:37.740
Magalie Marcellus: He has his other places you can go. So then, really, there's no reason to kind of rush

926
01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:42.300
Magalie Marcellus: Things you can take your time to see where it goes and whether he's ready to commit

927
01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:47.220
Kari Swafford: And like I said, you can tell a lot about a person and what they're going to do the first week or home.

928
01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:51.480
