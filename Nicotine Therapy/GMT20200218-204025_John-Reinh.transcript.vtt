00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.280
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Started doing the other stuff. Yeah. I never done heroin or anything math was a big deal.

59
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.710
John Reinhart: Yeah.

SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: So it's been a couple years now since I did it.

62
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.790
John Reinhart: Well, that's fantastic you're able to get off of that. That's

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.590
You

65
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.210
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: It just falls in your lap all over the place. It's like

66
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:52.440
John Reinhart: Well that's why they call this a bio psychosocial because it's biologically, you know, I actually family history, psychologically, you know, some questions there and socially and if you're an environment where that's happening all the time, those things happen real easy to

67
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.710
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Happen and I stay out of I don't even

68
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.580
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: I don't, I live in a little small town. There's one little bar down the street and I stay home and I

69
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.410
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: I don't like to. I like I don't like being that kind of person.

70
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.760
John Reinhart: Yeah yeah

71
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:23.340
John Reinhart: That's awesome. You're on the right road what. Ok. The next question is how did it progress. How did it progress, you know, for you getting on opiates and getting with bright heart health was just

72
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.020
John Reinhart: From high school just manifests, how, how did that look to you.

73
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.870
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Is high school

74
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.790
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Work and

75
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.750
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: How are you used to meet up

76
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:48.030
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Earlier than everybody lived on one end or the other. But there's a buddy in the middle, but I'll meet up at lunch time and do your thing and go back to work.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.640
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Just start doing it every day just

79
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.980
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Started

80
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.940
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: But I can't but you know I see of go off just

81
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.520
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Can't get I can't get right

82
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:19.320
John Reinhart: That's what happens. Man, it's kinda like a cultural thing, I think, you know, it's like hey everybody still go over there and, you know, and then you should add this I'm getting tired of this. And then it's like, wow, I need to have this type of thing huh

83
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.000
John Reinhart: Yeah, just just

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.900
John Reinhart: When was it the worst for you.

87
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.610
John Reinhart: Can you pinpoint any kind of time when it was really bad.

88
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.420
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: I don't know. Well, early never really did it.

89
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.200
John Reinhart: Okay, so

90
00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.960
John Reinhart: It wasn't like an everyday type of thing or whatever deal for you, maybe

91
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.970
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Not mad, but, uh,

92
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.220
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: No way.

93
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.660
John Reinhart: But smoking pot and all those type of things. It was just part of was that

94
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.000
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: It was just something good.

95
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.290
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Girl at school.

96
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:27.330
John Reinhart: Yes, why a lot of people call that in smoking cigarettes gateway drugs, they just kind of lead on to other things with if you got like an addictive mentality or

97
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.810
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Whatever, but back then it was like, we're trying to get away with. So

98
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.610
John Reinhart: Oh yeah you teenager, man. I remember it's been

99
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:37.710
John Reinhart: OK.

100
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.450
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Now just can

John Reinhart: Yeah.

103
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:50.130
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Can't really go without that, that keeps me pretty sure I've been feeling better. The small actions.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:18.150
John Reinhart: Well, I'm glad to hear that. And that's whole thing is along with that. And the, the treatment plan. The main thing is to get thinking clear, clear and clear it so you can function and stuff, you know,

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.810
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: I've been feeling a lot better. Eating a lot lot better.

125
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:28.230
John Reinhart: What was the prescription. What was the precipitating event. Do you have a chronic pain situation where you're in pain all the time like from an injury or

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:57.180
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Rejection he put it all together is completely destroyed and he spent like

133
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.310
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: Four half hours the first night just put it back together.

134
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:03.540
John Reinhart: Wow.

135
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:13.170
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: And he was able to get me. He was a they took the patch up is our God thing. And I was like, Yeah, a little bit like what really

137
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.370
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: I say, Well, I, I woke up.

138
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.970
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: One of the, one of the times when I woke up, I woke up just screaming off the top of my lungs.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.880
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: You know, I was on fire. I just completely on fire, but from the inside out.

141
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.940
SAMSUNG-SM-G920V: ahead with it.

142
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.800
John Reinhart: Oh man, that's, that's that. That hurts. Just thinking about
