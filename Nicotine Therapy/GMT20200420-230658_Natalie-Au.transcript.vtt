Natalie Austin: Oh, good.

9
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.870
Jamie: I'm just with all the

11
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:43.620
Jamie: Yeah, and the phone calls and I had, I was on another clinic. I've been at and it charges me. And so I just I can't afford it anymore. There's not many places that take my insurance around here.

12
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.440
Natalie Austin: Yeah. Nobody you know

13
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.850

Good.

19
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.910
Natalie Austin: See here.

20
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.640
Natalie Austin: So,

21
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.600
Natalie Austin: You have a current prescription for Suboxone them.

22
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:20.760
Jamie: I've had one I'm due for one tomorrow. I was supposed to go back tomorrow. And I told them I probably wouldn't be coming back. I'll probably cancel in the morning.

23
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.800
Okay.

24
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.070
Jamie: $250 a month.

25
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.300
Natalie Austin: And then the prescription. On top of that,

26
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.440
Jamie: Know my insurance pays for their prescription

27
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.750
Natalie Austin: Oh, that's good. Okay.

28
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.420
Jamie: Hmm.

29
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.050
Natalie Austin: Some other clinics. They had to buy the pills there.

30
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.690
Jamie: Yeah, some are that

31
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.030
Natalie Austin: is crazy.

32
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.800
Jamie: It's really hard.

33
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.880
Jamie: Especially with the virus going on and not being able to work for me. I lost my job, due to the virus. So are laid off. So I really can't afford it right now.

34
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.740
Natalie Austin: What, what, what did you do

35
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.240
Jamie: I'm home house where I'm home health care.

36
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:26.040
Jamie: And actually, the gentleman. I was taking care of I i've been self employed taking care of them for 12 years and he they actually put him in the nursing home.

37
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.270
Natalie Austin: Which seems kind of that's the last place to go.

38
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.620
Jamie: I know

39
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:42.120
Jamie: But he had some pre existing things going on before the virus. So he needed to go in there for rehabilitation for a little while, but

40
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:53.910
Jamie: He could have stayed home if it wasn't for the virus seems kind of backwards to me, but I guess they would have had to have a lot of nurses and all that coming out to the House if he didn't go there.

41
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.820
Okay.

42
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.710
Natalie Austin: Wow you around here. Let's try to get people out of the nursing home.

43
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.620
Natalie Austin: That's where all the

44
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.930
Natalie Austin: Code of the codes are rampant here in the nursing

45
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.200
Jamie: I know it's great.

46
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.860
Jamie: I don't know what's true and what's not.

47
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.810
Natalie Austin: I know you hear so many different things, you know,

48
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.580
Yeah.

49
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:40.080
Natalie Austin: Um, so tell me about your story. Um, so, how old were you when you first started taking opiates. What happened was the circumstances, how you got out of it.

50
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.250
Jamie: Well, if she's a nice night and I was

51
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.460
Jamie: Handling a lot of pain, a lot of problems. And I had a doctor prescribed me. I've been to meet roses for a long time now.

52
00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:11.670
Jamie: And I had a doctor. Start prescribing me pain pills for that for quite a few years and at the time of an epidemic yet so I didn't have any I gather, they were addicting or anything. So that was it was started off as for pain and then

53
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.660
Jamie: It just went on from there which pill paying bills is the only thing I've ever

54
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.920
Jamie: Really had a problem with I'm not a drinker or anything like that, but I have not

55
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:37.470
Jamie: Abuse any pills in a long time. I've been on so but I was on methadone for about seven years and I got off of that you've got on the Suboxone and then

56
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:48.600
Jamie: I've been on that off and on for the last five years, while I was on for four years doing good. And I waned off and I weaned off on my own.

57
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.970
Jamie: So it wasn't very successful. Yeah. Well, it was for I did good for a few months, and then I went back to

58
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.410
Jamie: The clinic. And so I've had two unsuccessful attempts of trying to get off but

59
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:18.120
Jamie: It's been about maybe eight months now that I've been back on and just stabilizing I've had a lot of situational stress going on like to

60
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.180
Natalie Austin: Okay, what's going on.

61
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:30.120
Jamie: I just, I had my daughter was via my 12 year old daughter was violated by a close family friend and

62
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.160
Jamie: So we've got the core. It's just the court process, the legal process, the counseling. It's just, it's been a lot

63
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.190
Natalie Austin: On cn rail.

64
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:51.480
Jamie: No, yeah, he's out on bond, and now it's just prolonging even longer because of the virus, they can't they have like shut down. They're not doing court.

65
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.060
I know

66
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.610
Jamie: That's ridiculous.

67
00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.440
Jamie: I mean,

68
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.600
Jamie: People are going to court. I don't know how they pick and choose, you know,

69
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.150
Jamie: But in his case, now it's gone on till July.

70
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.090
Wow.

71
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.300
Jamie: Which will definitely go though.

72
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.160
Natalie Austin: Oh, good. Okay.

73
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.790
Natalie Austin: Yeah, all the proof and everything.

74
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.850
Jamie: Oh yeah, they've got the detectives built a strong case. They've got him admitting everything

75
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.520
Natalie Austin: Oh, good. Okay.

76
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.550
Jamie: Yeah, it's a very strong case prosecutor side. Oh, get at least 11 years

77
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.670
Natalie Austin: Oh wow, that's awesome.

78
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.560
Well, yeah.

79
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.670
Jamie: I'd be nice if they did on type of if he was in his 30s, so that route, you're going to ask

80
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.110
Natalie Austin: Now, so that, yes, it would be nice if they did rehab.

81
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.640
Jamie: That's

82
00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:01.950
Jamie: Sad like for them to go. I mean, it's good. They go to prison, but they need to rehabilitate them before they put them back on the streets.

83
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.070
Natalie Austin: You know, I know. Yeah, I agree.

84
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:14.130
Jamie: And statistically it's bound to happen again when even if it's a year road.

85
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.770
Natalie Austin: I know unfortunately

86
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.960
Jamie: I'm hiding in my laundry room because my daughter's in the other room.

87
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:23.520
Natalie Austin: Oh,

88
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.370
Natalie Austin: So you got on the map.

89
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.480
Natalie Austin: You got on methadone to get off the opioids, is that correct

90
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.740
Yes.

91
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:46.080
Jamie: Well, actually I I started to get off of the opiates and off of the pain pills and I found out I was pregnant and at the time so boxing wasn't even, it was still being studied.

92
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.880
Jamie: So the only thing that was

93
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.350
Jamie: Was the methadone, so I had to get on the Methadone

94
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:53.970
Natalie Austin: Oh,

95
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.660
Natalie Austin: And so

96
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.570
Jamie: That started that cycle, which I wish I'd never done that but

97
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.930
Natalie Austin: It's not hard to get off as methadone hard to get off of

98
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:17.730
Jamie: That some people say it's really hard to get off of but i i really weaned myself down over a long period of time to a really low dose and then started on the Suboxone so it wasn't too hard.

99
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.220
Jamie: Oh, good. Just got another thing too is I never got up on the high dose of it.

100
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:24.660
Natalie Austin: You know,

101
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.860
Jamie: Oh, good. Okay. Around like 130 milligrams a day like

102
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.450
Jamie: Yeah.

103
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.890
Natalie Austin: That is a lot holy

104
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.320
Jamie: I never, never my over 30 which was that's what they started you Atlas 30

105
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.610
Natalie Austin: Okay.

106
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.800
Jamie: Oh wow chisel still

107
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.870
Natalie Austin: Sounds like a lot.

108
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:54.240
Jamie: Yeah, so it's been a I haven't had a problem I have not had a problem, going back to the pills like I don't want that. I just had a problem.

109
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:13.320
Jamie: When I come off of the Suboxone and then I'll go a couple of months, but rather than relaxing onto the pills. I just kind of go back on the soapbox and because I'm there to where I I'm just not ready. I know it's going to be one or the other.

110
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:23.370
Natalie Austin: So, um, when you had endometriosis that your OB GYN started you on pain pills what pain pills were they do you remember

111
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.870
Percocet.

112
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:26.820
Natalie Austin: Okay.

113
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.550
Natalie Austin: And then you can go to the park.

114
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.600
Jamie: That's, you know,

115
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.950
Jamie: He updated and upped it to. I was on by the time that was over he was giving me ox Cotton's

116
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.120
Natalie Austin: What

117
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.530
Jamie: Oh, well, yeah.

118
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.610
Jamie: He was mostly no. But he was definitely a classic which

119
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.890
Jamie: Back then it like I said it wasn't an epidemic get like it.

120
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.090
Jamie: I had never even heard of thing. I didn't know they're addictive at all.

121
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.120
Natalie Austin: You know, until people started getting off for them.

122
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.260
Natalie Austin: Mm hmm.

123
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:08.670
Natalie Austin: You know, so all the all hell broke loose because it was a thing called withdrawal happen. Yeah.

124
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.180
Jamie: So you never know any drugs, no.

125
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.750
Jamie: No. Okay. Oh, that's good.

126
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.140
Okay.

127
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.270
Natalie Austin: So how old are you now.

128
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.800
Jamie: 40 you're

129
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.700
Natalie Austin: If we're in this all started what what age.

130
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.980
19

131
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.500
Natalie Austin: Okay.

132
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.000
Natalie Austin: So, and when did you start getting clean why

133
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.410
Jamie: Start on the method.

134
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:48.720
Jamie: And 2006 at the end of 2006. So how many years that I was born in 1980 so

135
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.240
Natalie Austin: The 14 that's 14 years

136
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:51.900
Yeah.

137
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.700
Natalie Austin: You're 4040 minus 14 seven

138
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.820
Natalie Austin: Yeah 126

139
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.650
Jamie: Yeah.

140
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.570
Natalie Austin: She been clean since 26

141
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:12.630
Jamie: Well well at 20 once I got the methadone. Yeah, yeah.

142
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:34.080
Jamie: I mean, I know, I know, but I don't consider myself clean taking Suboxone like my goal is to eventually I actually am getting because I do have a lot of I mainly click like I probably could get off it, but I do have a lot of the pain. And I think that triggers me when I do have it.

143
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:50.640
Jamie: So I am planning on getting direct to me sometime soon because my I give a lot of problems is to get transfusions every three months because I bleed so heavily and my body doesn't replace the red cells. So I'm no oxygen in my blood.

144
00:12:51.540 --> 00:13:05.910
Jamie: So for many reasons. I'm going to be getting hysterectomy sometime in the near future to help with that. And then my goal would be to get off the Suboxone because I know I'm clean but I'm not clean in my eyes.

145
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:07.290
All right.

146
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.060
Natalie Austin: Um,

147
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.850
Natalie Austin: So, um,

148
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.610
Natalie Austin: So you're on methadone for 14 years there's not there's not a pill. You have to go every day for

149
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.380
Jamie: Yeah, and I use

150
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:29.850
Jamie: Oh, I lived in Cleveland. Yeah, I looked up in Cleveland, at the time, so I was only five minutes away and

151
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.250
Jamie: I

152
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.360
Jamie: Know, I was on the Methadone for 14 years

153
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:47.760
Jamie: I was confused. I didn't. I started on the Methadone in at the end of 2006 and I was on it for seven years and then I got on the Suboxone

154
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.560

Natalie Austin: And

163
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.320

Natalie Austin: So 3833

168
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.360
Jamie: Yeah, that's when I got off the methadone and got onto the Suboxone

169
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.530
Natalie Austin: We will do Suboxone for seven years. So seven and seven. Right.

170
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.420
Jamie: Yeah, well I've stopped.

171
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.550
Jamie: But yeah

172
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.330
Natalie Austin: Did you ever go to rehab or anything.

173
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.600
Jamie: I'm not inpatient no

174
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.850
Jamie: I'VE NEVER I'VE DONE, not even real. Nothing like

175
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.970
Jamie: Just I counseling and stuff that I chose to do on my own, you know,

176
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:20.130
Jamie: And meetings and before I moved where I live now. I used to go to a lot of meetings and I was involved in a lot of stuff, but I live in a very rural community now.

177
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:31.380
Jamie: That's another thing that you guys I'm so grateful because i don't i have to drive at least an hour to get anywhere where I live. So to go to the doctors

178
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:46.620
Jamie: And if I know a lot of them. They want you to go once a week and then I'll move it maybe once every other week, but it's hard to hold a job down and have to take off one day a week, cuz your doctors is an hour away. It takes up to four or five hours out of your day.

179
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.510
Jamie: Right.

180
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.660

Natalie Austin: Some people do both. Some people want to do the group. So, you know, whatever you feel comfortable with.

201
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.270
Jamie: Okay. All right. I just wondering, I know I asked a lot of questions.

202
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.280
Jamie: But I just okay here.

203
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.090
Jamie: And now.

204
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:44.400
Jamie: So it's just once a week on here is what you guys require and then do I have to do the urine screening is that once a week or once a month.

205
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.780
Natalie Austin: Once a month.

206
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:56.310
Jamie: Okay, it doesn't matter. But now I know she said that you take the results off and read them right there, or do I need a mail and mail it to like a lab or anything.

207
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:05.700
Natalie Austin: I don't think so. If they send it to your house. We just take a picture of it, you're not on video or yeah we see we watch you do it on video.

208
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.470
Natalie Austin: Kind of thing.

209
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.420
Natalie Austin: Okay, now

210
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.690
Jamie: Do you have a problem is marijuana an issue.

211
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.540
Natalie Austin: Um,

212
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:22.260
Natalie Austin: Well, we will, if you would like to you to get your medical marijuana card. If you can

213
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.240
Jamie: I want to, but right now I can't afford it. My husband.

214
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.970
Natalie Austin: Arguing around there, are they charging a lot

215
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:40.980
Jamie: Well, it's about two or $50 right now to get started and then my insurance does not pay for it. So I'd have to pay for everything out of pocket.

216
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.750
Jamie: Okay, like, including going to the dispensary so

217
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.910
Jamie: To start off, it's it'd be about $400

218
00:18:52.140 --> 00:19:02.280
Jamie: That's to get your card do everything. But yeah, they actually just made it legal medically legal here just a couple of months ago.

219
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:17.460
Jamie: But on my, my husband just got his. So what I do use it is medical so I'm not getting something off the streets that you got to worry about something else's in it, they know that's something that scares me that

220
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:26.370
Natalie Austin: I mean, the medical grade might not have the THC and I, which is good because the THC up comes up in a drug screen.

221
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.410
Natalie Austin: Yeah, so let's

222
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.210
Natalie Austin: Let's hope that that's not you know the THC form, but

223
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:41.100
Natalie Austin: That's all we encourage you to do that, Elisa your elite your legal and you have it in your system for a reason for medical reason

224
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.220
Natalie Austin: You know, not yeah recreational use.

225
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:52.410
Jamie: Yeah, I really, I only use it night. Actually, to be honest, it helps me calm down, you go to sleep.

226
00:19:55.110 --> 00:20:03.840
Jamie: And another thing it does help me with is when things are stressful, like if you have a roast five or a stressful week or a stressful day

227
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:19.080
Jamie: I'm I mean I'm up to a decent wait now I'm at like 130 but with stress. I can drop 10 or 15 pounds in like two weeks, like it really affects my appetite. So that's one thing it does help to, you know, if I'm really stressed out to help me eat.

228
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:21.360
Natalie Austin: Okay.

229
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.990
Natalie Austin: Well, let's make that a goal, though least try to get the TV and trying to save some money up to get it.

230
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.600
Jamie: Yeah, I get it, I qualify for. It's just financially but I work

231
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.550
Natalie Austin: I work on it. Okay.

232
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.430
Natalie Austin: Okay. Sounds good.

233
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:47.910
Jamie: I just wanted to make sure I was honest and make sure let you know up front. And let me make sure I wasn't going to be a major issue.

234
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.720
Natalie Austin: Yeah, thank you for being honest.

235
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.950
Natalie Austin: Let me go into your chart here.

236
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.560
Natalie Austin: See

237
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.100
Natalie Austin: I want to switch over screens here for a second.

238
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.140
Natalie Austin: I'm not leaving. Yeah.

239
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:12.900
Jamie: So, okay.

240
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.060
Natalie Austin: I'm still here.

241
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.110
Natalie Austin: So what is your past medical history, do you have anything any diabetes, high blood pressure,

242
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:35.550
Jamie: No. The only issue I had is with my endometriosis, like I said, it causes me the chronic anemia, and I have to get the blood transfusions every few months. But other than that, I'm perfectly healthy

243
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:42.690
Natalie Austin: Okay, and your date of birth is one right April 119 80

244
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.530

246
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.070
Yeah.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.660
Up a name for it. Yeah.

250
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:15.180
Jamie: I have chronic anemia and there. It's a big huge word, whatever it is, but it's basically where my body's not replacing the red blood cells and then I have no oxygen in my blood.

251
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:23.970
Jamie: So it makes me very fatigued and weak and my body just doesn't replace as much as I lose

252
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.610
Jamie: Okay, I don't know. It's something. It's a big H word

253
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.380
Natalie Austin: It's not Thrombocytopenia is it

254
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:40.410
Jamie: No, no, no. There's something to do with my hemoglobin, something like that word.

255
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:42.870
Jamie: But it's all

256
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.990
Jamie: So I'll do to my period.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:23:03.300
Jamie: Very heavy bleeding and very painful periods, and for me I healings painful to but like two weeks in between. But it causes very heavy bleeding.

260
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.010
Jamie: Orion.

261
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.620
Natalie Austin: Have you been like that ever since you started the mentees when you were like 16 or whatever.

262
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:22.650
Jamie: No, I wasn't diagnosed with it until I was 19 that's when I started having a severe cramping and the heavier breathing and

263
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:34.170
Jamie: The last five years is when it got worse. I guess the heavier heavier bleeding. That's when the NEA NEA and everything got worse.

264
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.210
Natalie Austin: Okay.

265
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:44.790
Jamie: I like I said sometime in the near future. I'm going to be getting a hysterectomy here. So I wanted to worry about it.

266
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.160
Okay.

267
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:54.750
Natalie Austin: So all this is related to your uterus then everything's coming out of the uterus all the bleeding and

268
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:59.760
Jamie: Yeah yeah everything's related to my menstrual cycle, which is my uterus.

269
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.760
Natalie Austin: Yeah. Wow.

270
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:12.780
Jamie: I guess I get I got real heavy scar tissue in the uterus, and that's what endometriosis causes which that's why women can't get pregnant.

271
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:14.670
Natalie Austin: Right.

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:10.800
That's right.

664
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.710
Natalie Austin: And then whenever you do get it. This is going to be your first surgery.

665
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:23.040
Natalie Austin: You got to make sure they don't take you off the Suboxone and put you on opioids. Okay.

666
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:31.950
Jamie: Yes, this actually have. I have a fear of why I held off on getting it for so long. It's because

667
00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:40.200
Natalie Austin: They do that now. I'm like, why would you do that they take take patients often Suboxone opiates for the three days there and they're like, No.

668
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:42.270
So, whatever. Yeah.

669
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:51.840
Jamie: It doesn't make any sense because you already have the know X owning you so you're paying bills probably aren't going to work.

670
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:53.880
Natalie Austin: Right work anyway. Yeah, you're blocking it

671
00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.900
Natalie Austin: Yeah, exactly. It's, I take it you're taking a tic tac

672
00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.410
Jamie: Yeah, so that was like a fear of mine.

673
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:09.210
Natalie Austin: So whenever we get to that point, just let you know if you need us to talk to the surgeon or whatever, let us know. We'll try to help you out with that but

674
00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:10.680
Natalie Austin: Are you

675
00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:12.660
Natalie Austin: Yeah, you need to

676
00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:16.440
Natalie Austin: Don't let them do that. I've seen that happen so many times.

677
00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.170
Natalie Austin: I just cringe.

678
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.720
Jamie: I've heard horror stories.

679
00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:28.320
Natalie Austin: Let's cuz I don't know if they're not educated on the situation. They know they don't understand it, I guess.

680
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.770
Natalie Austin: And it's kind of a tricky situation but

681
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.450
Jamie: Yeah, as

682
00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.160
Natalie Austin: Long as long as you're aware

683
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:44.730
Jamie: I'm going to tell some doctors more on the side like some doctors don't under especially wasn't a couple years ago, but

684
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:57.300
Jamie: I read only kid into it with some doctors because the way they would treat you know people me and people in general. And it's like, you need to educate yourself on the

685
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.230
Natalie Austin: Next exactly what it is.

686
00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:07.860
Jamie: Yeah, addiction hearing some doctors are ignorant to it.

687
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:23.610
Natalie Austin: Yeah, I don't think we don't take a class in that when we go to medical school. I got a PA school, medical, you know, we have a year's worth of medical school and we we don't cover addiction medicine in our training and neither do doctors that I'm aware of. Unless it's something new.

688
00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.400
Jamie: Yeah, but unfortunately, yes.

689
00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:32.430
Natalie Austin: Yeah, they should I hopefully they have since added that I went to school like 22 years ago but

690
00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:40.830
Jamie: Without everything is these days that they've definitely would have added it

691
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:47.160
Natalie Austin: I hope they have correct but that it's always been a great one liners, they don't they don't understand it.

692
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.980
Jamie: Not at all.

693
00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.840
Jamie: Sorry, I'm walking around, I'm

694
00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:00.810
Jamie: Trying to pick

695
00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:05.640

698
00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:18.000
Jamie: Yeah.

699
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:23.670
Natalie Austin: If you need to go to the bathroom or something you know just hit that we really work with

700
00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:29.520
Jamie: I was wondering, I'm actually curious if you had to be on video, the whole time.

701
00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:34.740
Natalie Austin: There's some of the people don't, because there's so many of us anyway so you could do.

702
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:35.430
Jamie: That

703
00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:37.890
Natalie Austin: You know, if you have to go the bathroom or whatever.

704
00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:40.020
Natalie Austin: It is the dog.

705
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:42.750
Natalie Austin: The dog is screaming in the background, you can hit

706
00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.230
Natalie Austin: hit the mute button while the counselors talking. If you need to, you know,

707
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.110
Jamie: I know

708
00:59:54.420 --> 01:00:05.730
Natalie Austin: You. We have several patients that you have the babies crying and the dogs barking and one guy when he comes in from work. So you hear this Rata tat, tat always hammering

709
01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.420
Natalie Austin: We always ask him to mute him. So he's muted, the whole time.

710
01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:14.280
Natalie Austin: But he still wasn't he has headphones, you still lesson. You know, you're still part of it.

711
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:27.270
Jamie: Yeah, it's just thinking, I don't have any good headphones really my daughter dies. But we have shows on iPhone and you can't use the same kind of headphones in mind, but even just for among

712
01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:28.680
Natalie Austin: Them to

713
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.220
Natalie Austin: Maybe only, you know, pick up your scripture. You can see if they have some headphones. They're not be easier for you.

714
01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:37.290
Jamie: Yeah well to be

715
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.530
Jamie: Around. They're not listening.

716
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:46.590
Natalie Austin: Correct, yes. And it's, it's for your own privacy as well.

717
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:52.560
Natalie Austin: Yeah, but yet 90% of everyone had they were their headphones and if I think Rachelle even

718
01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:58.530
Natalie Austin: She suggested a recommends it, I believe, as well. So

719
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:04.770
Jamie: Well, you do your bed like even like HIPAA. You think you almost might be required to

720
01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:06.450
Natalie Austin: Yeah, exactly.

721
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.170
Yeah.

722
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.700
Natalie Austin: Yep.

723
01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:19.110
Natalie Austin: Everyone said home like especially if you're at work. That's correct. If you're at home. I know you don't, you're not really hiding anything from your

724
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.680
Natalie Austin: Your my guess you could

725
01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:23.820
Keep the

726
01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.090
Jamie: kids run around.

727
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.540
Natalie Austin: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you don't hit them here stuff. Yeah.

728
01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:38.520
Natalie Austin: Okay, looks like everything is done everything on the computer here.

729
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:41.070
Natalie Austin: Um,

730
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.210
Natalie Austin: I think it is the plan. I said, all the plan.

731
01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.670
Natalie Austin: Yeah, okay.

732
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:51.390
Natalie Austin: Sounds good. Any issues with their

733
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.990
Jamie: You saw my prescription to Rite Aid or CVS.

734
01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.830
Natalie Austin: Let me check. I gotta check again.

735
01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:03.810
Natalie Austin: I thought it was

736
01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:08.190
Natalie Austin: I imagine I said it to you. Remember what I said. I said it out loud.

737
01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:12.780
Jamie: I well you said CVS. At first, and then I think you said writing

738
01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.690
Jamie: But I have

739
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:19.080
Natalie Austin: I'm going to charge where I said it. Oh, no.

740
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:24.390
Jamie: It doesn't matter which one, but just so I know where it's going to be

741
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.920
Natalie Austin: I think it was CVS.

742
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.170
Natalie Austin: Whatever you

743
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.440
Natalie Austin: I found right in your in this

744
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:37.080
Jamie: In the computer because I filled out the paperwork. I've done the

745
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:45.960
Jamie: The initial part a couple times. So I think maybe the first time I gave Rite Aid. And then this last time I gave some yes

746
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:49.020
Natalie Austin: Okay, let me check. You have to go

747
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.070
Jamie: It doesn't matter. You don't have to change it. Whatever is in there just so I know

748
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.640
Natalie Austin: I'll go back and look

749
01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.470
Natalie Austin: I don't know.

750
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.780
Natalie Austin: You know how I find out don't under demographics, maybe

751
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:15.750
Natalie Austin: Because it shows up whenever I send the prescription is it's in the box, but I'm not sending a prescription. I don't know how to tell

752
01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:28.080
Jamie: Oh, don't worry about it. Then I I'll just, if I don't if it's not an either one. That was my question. I can just, I'll get him. I know I get messages from both of them. So I'll get a message when it's

753
01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:31.170

757
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:46.200
Natalie Austin: But I think it was CVS, but yeah.

758
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.440
Natalie Austin: Call both of them. I guess I'm sorry I can't get

759
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:49.950
Natalie Austin: It. Well done.

760
01:03:50.430 --> 01:04:00.600

01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:02.160
Natalie Austin: Yes, yes.

764
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.510
Jamie: Yeah, I'm not even going till tomorrow, so I'm not gonna go until I get a message and say that it's Phil

Natalie Austin: Yes, I will do. Yeah.
