32
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:25.770
Magalie Marcellus: Information from those some people that knows really what's going on in. So from just, you know, a regular person walking down the street because everybody's anxious and they're going to make statement that even, you know, make it seems like it's a lot more

Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, and and you know we don't want people to feel that is the end of the world. It is a serious concern. They know but they. This is why

35
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:54.600
Magalie Marcellus: People are being taught how to take proper care for themselves so they don't don't become victim, you know, with that type of illness. So what are you done for yourself to be cautious and, you know, so you can

36
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.160

93
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.470

Right.

170
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:15.120
Magalie Marcellus: That's true. Because a lot of things are changing and people are having financial difficulties because of that. So, so

171
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.000
N817: You know, if you are going to travel anywhere right now. It'd be

172
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:22.170
N817: Best now.

173
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.730

N817: Hasn't dropped down for you.

183
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:06.870
Magalie Marcellus: It is, it has dropped down on this side. So, but it was I think a lot of sin 199. But still, that's a lot lower than it's been

184
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.950
For many years,

185
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.110
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, yeah. I haven't been like that for a while. Yeah.

186
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:23.250
Magalie Marcellus: But in I guess traveling by car, but now you know you don't know every state has their own stuff going on. So,

187
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:35.010
Magalie Marcellus: It's bad Allen wouldn't want to travel to anybody's house unless you come into your, your horn on house and you'll have to really interact with other people, that's been expose

188
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.290
Magalie Marcellus: Her she's better

189
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.490

191
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.670
N817: Yeah, that's basically why she works his

192
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:04.290
N817: Butt. And I asked him this so so how would he do for safety precautions that word.

193
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.780
N817: This door closes at seven.

194
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.990
N817: She wears three and one

195
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.550
N817: And every time she deals with a customer and she got on.

196
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.840
Magalie Marcellus: The counter and between

197
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.240
N817: one paragraph.

198
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:28.710
N817: And then we're down to the last pair, she washes her hands.

199
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.050
N817: She's doing

200
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.500
Magalie Marcellus: Smart asking

201
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.350
N817: Spring Break down right now so

202
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:53.100
Magalie Marcellus: Yes. Wow. They add but we're trying to, you know, have them go back home, cuz

203
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:05.790
Magalie Marcellus: Cuz a lot of well for South Florida and equals out of the beach area where they would normally congregate so that the term.

204
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.760
Magalie Marcellus: So many people from hanging out on the beach.

205
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.110
N817: Close the bars and

206
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:15.810
Uh huh.

207
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:24.600
N817: Pretty much everything is going to be more than 10 or 20 people besides her stores.

208
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.560
Right.

209
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.170
N817: One thing I'm having a lot of anxiety over as well. If they closed the pharmacy.

210
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.520
Magalie Marcellus: That one that's going to happen because they know people need

211
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.470
Magalie Marcellus: They will have to make provision for people to get a prescription or whatever.

212
00:18:45.120 --> 00:19:02.850
Magalie Marcellus: Medication they need if that's going on because I'm sure they have to make some kind of provision for people to have either give them some of the medication. I'M MORE. SO WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH. One day closer look worse. Yeah, why

213
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.040
Magalie Marcellus: Why

214
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.530
N817: Do you think they're gonna open back up.

215
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.700
Yeah.

216
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:16.140
N817: Yeah hopefully they give everybody a couple days. Warnings so they can tell her doctor that

217
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.760
Magalie Marcellus: I have for sure because I know

218
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.870
Magalie Marcellus: Some people I

219
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:29.970
Magalie Marcellus: Have medication that they depend on. So now we didn't just close across the board and for people to be in Grade A nice, especially now the medical

220
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:41.340
Magalie Marcellus: Communities overwhelm so they wouldn't want more people to get sick because you're not getting your medication. So I'm sure they will have a plan. Definitely to keep things going.

221
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.310
Magalie Marcellus: Now, did you get the guys back on.

222
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.210

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.240
N817: $33

227
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:13.320
Magalie Marcellus: So they did finally find your hand mature was the last time you call they want and that actually call back so

N817: Yeah, he was supposed to do that. But he paid the fine.

237
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:47.490
Okay.

238
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.470
Magalie Marcellus: So you guys

239
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:55.470
Magalie Marcellus: Are you back on that program where you can pay the same price every month.

240
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.300

N817: Or how does that work.

318
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.060
Magalie Marcellus: So you still need to schedule an appointment for you follow

319
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.200
Magalie Marcellus: Okay. So you went on, make sure

320
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.050
Magalie Marcellus: You're waiting

321
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.740
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, so you're waiting to get transportation or

322
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.570
N817: Two shows as well.

323
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:46.890
N817: Will be able to be a coach and have transportation again that we can go more than a couple miles or

324
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.020
N817: My mouse.

325
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:51.600
Magalie Marcellus: Shoes.

326
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:52.830
N817: Okay.

327
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:53.880
Magalie Marcellus: All right.

328
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:55.890
Okay, so

329
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:05.310
Magalie Marcellus: So what are the other options. So I know if the if the truck is not fixable and

330
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.030
N817: We know with

331
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:13.350
Magalie Marcellus: All that going on right now. Your mom may be delayed. So what's the next step. Okay, so can you.

332
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:20.130
Magalie Marcellus: Can you look into again to see what's going on with insurance. Yeah, there's no some Medicaid program have the

333
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:38.940
Magalie Marcellus: The bus or the transportation to five minutes. No probably not is probably gonna be a longer way because they're not taking as many people at the as they used to, but they should be able to move vegetation to those medical appointments. If you give

334
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.820
Magalie Marcellus: Me enough to get in.

335
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.650
Magalie Marcellus: Because

336
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.490
Magalie Marcellus: You have

337
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.360
So that

338
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.810
N817: You know, private go to a private

339
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.100
N817: It's only for that type of stuff.

340
00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:57.420
Magalie Marcellus: You

341
00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.220
N817: Had a car right

342
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.490
Magalie Marcellus: But

343
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.550
Magalie Marcellus: Many van or anything like that.

344
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.040
N817: No bus worthy.

345
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:20.940
Magalie Marcellus: Just like the car. It's a private car. Okay, maybe, maybe they have some kind of contract with them. Find the company to come to do it.

346
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:39.420
Magalie Marcellus: So yeah, so you're going to look into that and see whether that's going to be an option for you if those things don't work because I don't want you to kick this new appointment because of transportation and is there any way we can get into a bus or is it too far but

347
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.090
N817: Have no buses again.

348
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.030
Magalie Marcellus: numbers on that area.

349
00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:45.540
Magalie Marcellus: Okay.

350
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.190
N817: I'm just explained, but

351
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.570
Magalie Marcellus: That little some areas who have

352
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.420
Magalie Marcellus: Been on your side has no buses.

353
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.140
Magalie Marcellus: Definitely you need somebody with a mind.

354
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.870
N817: All you have a fun. Yeah.

355
00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.340
Magalie Marcellus: I'm still

356
00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:00.330
Trying to learn

357
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:09.180
N817: Columbus know if I lived in Cleveland may got buses like down, Florida.

358
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.890
Magalie Marcellus: And they go,

359
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:12.900
N817: To

360
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:14.880
But

361
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.010
N817: I don't live in that

362
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:18.630
Magalie Marcellus: City.

363
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.060
N817: But

364
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.010
I think, Well, no.

365
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.750
N817: No, no, I think you're given.

366
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:46.650
Magalie Marcellus: And for my for my study if I know they canceled that appointment by the appointment on my study who is it for, or what is it for

367
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.140

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:10.920
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, cuz I know it takes a while for those appointments. So what can you do to make sure you don't miss that one.

373
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.790
Magalie Marcellus: Can you call tomorrow and see what they say about that transportation service.

374
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.190
Magalie Marcellus: Lightning calm.

N817: I gotta bite.

387
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:21.750
Magalie Marcellus: About

Magalie Marcellus: Depends on the weather, where you don't want to live. Let it because it's not like to mouth. My mouth is still quite a few miles. So we don't wanna you know we don't tell to figure out what the weather going to eat.

391
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.790
Magalie Marcellus: Oh yeah, we want you to be able to get there.

392
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.630
connection there.

393
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.360
Magalie Marcellus: He say you have a sister on the title. Yes, it says my close enough to do right, if anything,

394
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.380
N817: If she's not working.

395
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:37.650
N817: Like if

396
00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.240
N817: She

397
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:48.690
Feels like

398
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.680
Magalie Marcellus: Resources no sometimes

399
00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:03.060
Magalie Marcellus: Especially with something that's important. You know, you have to do the best. Make sure you get it done.

400
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.610
N817: We're just happy that I'm doing right

401
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.600
N817: Now,

402
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.850
Heroin no more.

403
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:24.120
N817: My relationship has been damaged my family, but they have a little fun.

404
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.900
But it's not the point where

405
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:35.250
They would come

406
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:41.520
Like

407
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.910
Magalie Marcellus: A lot like a locker.

408
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.790
Magalie Marcellus: room door saying that

409
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:53.250
You're

410
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:16.560
Magalie Marcellus: You know you're not doing anything. So I'm so has a, you know, to lose their trust. And so then you know you should be okay because sometimes people takes people a while to

411
00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:25.890
Magalie Marcellus: regain trust. You just have to keep doing what you need to do for yourself and eventually they'll know that you done the right thing that you're not there to

412
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.180
Magalie Marcellus: Be any do anything negative towards

413
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.500
N817: It really, you know,

414
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.910
N817: Probably, but they still act like I will. Wow.

415
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.480
N817: That really

416
00:35:52.620 --> 00:36:03.210
N817: gets under my skin. You know, like I can understand more and find him doing stuff like that. But since I dinner, you never have

417
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.500
N817: Enough now about it, you know.

418
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:26.760
Magalie Marcellus: If you say something. What do you think would happen if you if you stop your sister. Wow. What do you think she would say, because sometimes people do things without even thinking about it. So maybe that may shed some light and say, whoa.

419
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:37.050
N817: I'm saying they were, you know, blame it on. She would say all error. Her husband that

420
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.400
N817: Tribal

421
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.520
N817: War, you know,

422
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.440
N817: That I would do something like that so

423
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.660
Magalie Marcellus: If you went into a tension.

424
00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:07.860
Magalie Marcellus: That would at least let her know that you notice those things in that you don't appreciate it may be that may take, you know, there may be more conscious about how they behave in when you come to the house because

425
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.480
Magalie Marcellus: You saying you haven't given many reasons for them to feel like you're gonna

426
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:21.870
N817: Say, well, he'll feel comfortable. I feel I get what we do, don't come over, you know,

427
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.060
Magalie Marcellus: You think that would be one of those fun

428
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.880
N817: Yeah yeah

429
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.190
N817: I think would be, you know,

430
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.780
Magalie Marcellus: It bothers you, because you know

431
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:54.120
Magalie Marcellus: targeted towards you so much again.

432
00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:04.230
Magalie Marcellus: And see know what you feel comfortable because sometimes holding things, you know, eventually comes out in a lot of time when it comes out.

433
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:19.740
Magalie Marcellus: When it's not something you are ready to discuss. It's probably gonna be in a negative way. And as why you know if you can get a step ahead of it and have a conversation just say, you know, I noticed that you know this and this happened, you know,

434
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.980
Magalie Marcellus: Is there a concern.

435
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:32.490
Magalie Marcellus: Basically, you know, I don't. Again, she may be defensive and she may, you know, but you

436
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:45.240
Magalie Marcellus: If it's something that you feel that strong that you need for them to kind of be more mindful of, maybe it's something eventually have to think about maybe have a conversation with justice.

437
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.550
Magalie Marcellus: gonna change if they eat. They don't even know how you feel about it.

438
00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.300
N817: I think they know but they don't care.

439
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.250
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, add the, you know, they know how you feel about it hasn't been addressed.

440
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.840
N817: I think there. I know, I know.

441
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:16.050
N817: It's not like to hide the fact we're trying to be sneaky about it really.

442
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.600
N817: Strict just one of those things.

443
00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.690
N817: But I'm just thankful that you know I have family.

444
00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.970
Magalie Marcellus: I can

445
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.010
N817: You know know you know why the older I get to the

446
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.710

N817: You know,
