Amanda Davis: Well that's right for me.

16
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.560
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever taken the buprenorphine before

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.540
Amanda Davis: Is that Suboxone

18
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:18.180
Dawn Abriel: It's the generic you printer Phoenix. The name of the medicine Suboxone is the the trade name, it's, it's the product name.

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.260
Okay.

20
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.150
Amanda Davis: So different

21
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.230
Dawn Abriel: Is a long acting opioids.

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.580
Dawn Abriel: So you're taking short acting opioids and having to take more and more and your body is very dependent on as you go through withdrawal. When you stop taking it right

23
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.610
Amanda Davis: Yes. So immediately with

24
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:52.290
Dawn Abriel: The long acting, it stays in your body, depending on your metabolism between 24 and 36 hours. So, um, but you've never taken any one any from a friend or

25
00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:09.240
Amanda Davis: I have from a friend. I was really sick in they went and got Suboxone from their mother and she allowed me to try him it it's stable. Yeah, but I was pretty really sick. And I didn't even get

26
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.760
Amanda Davis: A tab full cab.

27
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.950
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

28
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.220
Dawn Abriel: Um, so the the ones that I'm going to order for you depending on you know

29
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.320
Dawn Abriel: I don't know how many you're going to need until we've been interacting. So, Brittany, so they have to play it by ear.

30
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.700
Dawn Abriel: Okay, but you'll you put them under your tongue.

31
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.900
Amanda Davis: Okay.

32
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:44.310
Dawn Abriel: They have to stay there for two minutes and you cannot smoke eat or drink, just before you take your medicine.

33
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.510
Amanda Davis: Okay.

34
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:56.460
Dawn Abriel: If you smoke a cigarette before you take your medicine it cramps down all your blood vessels and it and it constricts the ones under your tongue and you don't absorb the medicine.

35
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.220
Amanda Davis: Okay, so it's

36
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.100
Dawn Abriel: Very important not to smoke before

37
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.990
Amanda Davis: Taking okay

38
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.650
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so let's start with, and the last time you had any kind of opioid

39
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.000
Amanda Davis: I had opiates yesterday. Okay.

40
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.410

Dawn Abriel: And how many were you taking per day.

45
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.780
Amanda Davis: And I

46
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.950

47
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.630
Dawn Abriel: But what was what's the most you've ever taken in one day.

48
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.400

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.880
Amanda Davis: I don't know God.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.220
Amanda Davis: Probably like five to 10

52
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.330
Amanda Davis: And I usually do about a dramedy

53
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.560

Dawn Abriel: Yes, it's natural.

65
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.000
Amanda Davis: For the

66
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.690
Dawn Abriel: Have you ever used IV drugs.

67
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.550
Amanda Davis: No, only in the hospitals. I'm a breast cancer survivor. I've had a double mastectomy, and

71
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.210
Amanda Davis: Drugs that I've ever had.

72
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.960
I don't wait

73
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.280
Dawn Abriel: Do you, do you have the bracket gene, gene.

74
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.480
Amanda Davis: What is that

75
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:37.950
Dawn Abriel: It's all I mean you're, you're kind of young to have breast cancer. So most test for the genetic predisposition that

76
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.790
Dawn Abriel: Leads to early, early cancers.

77
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.010
Amanda Davis: Yeah, probably.

78
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.090
Amanda Davis: I have to look back at my medical records and see, to be sure.

79
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.000
Dawn Abriel: You really want to know that is

80
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.860

Amanda Davis: Yeah, okay.

84
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.120
Amanda Davis: And if you haven't had that

85
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.770
Dawn Abriel: Gene you I mean I can't imagine that that they wouldn't have tested you for that, with, with such early on.

86
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.450
Amanda Davis: Right, with the early onset of the cancer.

87
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.440
Yeah.

88
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.700
Dawn Abriel: Most people say that they developed a tolerance into dependence that was true for you. Right.

89
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.840
Yes.

90
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.770
Dawn Abriel: And any overdoses on any drugs.

91
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.330
Dawn Abriel: Not a medical complications that

92
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.930
Amanda Davis: Up. I've been really sick though from it. Like, that's why I won't drink alcohol.

93
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.160
Amanda Davis: I and I'm trying. I just want to quit everything so

94
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:05.160
Dawn Abriel: I don't think you're answering the question I asked, have you had like an infection around your heart. Have you had

95
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.940
Amanda Davis: I've had on market back no infections. Okay.

96
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.070
Amanda Davis: I've been fairly healthy

97
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.090
Dawn Abriel: But you think the heart attack was dead from doing cocaine or math.

98
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.470
Amanda Davis: And I don't know because I didn't even know I had it.

99
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.920
Amanda Davis: But I was in the doctor's office and they rushed me to the hospital.

100
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:36.270
Amanda Davis: I didn't feel good, but I didn't necessarily know I had a heart attack, you know, until the doctor told me

101
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:53.670
Amanda Davis: So I don't know what caused it, but it did. There was no infection. It took me to the hospital and check me out and it told me what kind of heart attack. I had, I can't remember. They say it's in the whatever area of the heart. I could get those records if you need them.

102
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.190
Dawn Abriel: No, I just

103
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.340
Dawn Abriel: It would really be

104
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.780
Dawn Abriel: Good for you to know this on the top of your tone.

105
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.980
Amanda Davis: Oh, because

106
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.040
Dawn Abriel: If you ever get taken in for something

107
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:15.990
Dawn Abriel: Them waiting to get the medical records, you'll be good before they can get the medical records.

108
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.030
Dawn Abriel: Oh, I'm an emergency doctor by training. I know, Russ.

109
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:21.930
Amanda Davis: You know,

110
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:29.610
Dawn Abriel: People can tell me exactly what what they have, then I know what direction to go. So

111
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:39.330
Dawn Abriel: It would be handy for you to know. Just a few of these like which vessel was affected in your heart that is key.

112
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:40.860
Amanda Davis: Okay. Oh.

113
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.510
Amanda Davis: Yeah.

114
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.770
Amanda Davis: His name, uh,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.870
Amanda Davis: Huh.

116
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.910
Amanda Davis: Anybody else. Oh.

117
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.500
Amanda Davis: Yeah, okay.

118
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.410
Dawn Abriel: Any, any legal issues.

119
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.000
Dawn Abriel: Because of your drug use.

120
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.740
Amanda Davis: No, I'm lucky I have federal background check clear no record.

121
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.790
Amanda Davis: I'm good to go.

122
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.040
Dawn Abriel: People often say that a lot of their day is consumed with

123
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:17.970
Dawn Abriel: Thinking about the drugs binding the drugs buying them using them and then thinking how you're going to get more of them is that been your experience.

124
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.460
Amanda Davis: Um, yeah, it's definitely there.

125
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.210
Amanda Davis: But it's I just I can't take it anymore.

126
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.720
Dawn Abriel: That's when a lot of people get motivated

127
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.260
Dawn Abriel: Right when you when you first started using any illicit drug

128
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.280
Amanda Davis: 17

129
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.500
Dawn Abriel: And what was it,

130
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.860
Amanda Davis: Try black until

131
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.280
Amanda Davis: I was like 37

132
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.130
Amanda Davis: And 37 years old I tried and

133
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.560
Amanda Davis: You know,

134
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.210
Dawn Abriel: And any loss of relationships work problems.

135
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.830
Amanda Davis: I came really slow.

136
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.510
Amanda Davis: I came really close.

137
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.910
Amanda Davis: To that's part of the reason why I'm searching for recovery.

138
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.940
Dawn Abriel: You came close to which

139
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.420
Amanda Davis: My mom said I would loser by dinky cleaned up.

140
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.560
Amanda Davis: Not real supportive

141
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.850
Dawn Abriel: Times. That's what it takes it. You know, we call it tough love. Right.

142
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.250
Dawn Abriel: Don't hang up. Don't hang around if you're going to use. I love you, but I don't like this behavior.

143
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.290
Dawn Abriel: Right, yeah.

144
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.660
Dawn Abriel: And and is this the first program you've been in

145
00:10:52.560 --> 00:11:01.470
Amanda Davis: And I was in a program another time when I was coming off of all the pills. They. The doctor will switch me over to methadone.

146
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:14.580
Amanda Davis: Okay, I didn't. I don't care for the Methadone because you have to go every day. And it's really just a big inconvenience you know it's

147
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.900
Amanda Davis: I don't know. It's hard. I've got

148
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.470
Amanda Davis: Responsibilities I've got to take care of. And I can't afford to

149
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.390
Amanda Davis: Go every day.

150
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.100
Amanda Davis: So,

151
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:39.000
Dawn Abriel: Many people because of the way the opioids change your brain talk about having sleeping anxiety issues are those two for you also.

152
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:46.500
Amanda Davis: If I don't have my medicine. Yeah, it gets it's really hard for me to go to sleep.

153
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.060
Amanda Davis: I'll get diarrhea get hot flashes. I'll get

154
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.050
Dawn Abriel: Those or

155
00:11:52.380 --> 00:12:04.260
Dawn Abriel: I'll get withdrawal symptoms. Those are withdrawal that's different, the opioids themselves cars sleeping anxiety issues. And that's what I'm asking you.

156
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.880
Amanda Davis: Oh, no.

157
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.220
Amanda Davis: It doesn't seem to

158
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:17.880
Amanda Davis: I think I've been introduced to it at such a young age to the doctors because it's all the same feeling, you know what I mean, it's

159
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.770

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.320
No. Great. Okay.

487
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.200
Dawn Abriel: And do you have tattoos.

488
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:59.160
Yeah.

489
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.380
How many

490
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:14.490
Amanda Davis: 1234566 or seven seven

491
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.740
Dawn Abriel: And where they all professionally done no complications.

492
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:20.490
Yeah.

493
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:34.620
Amanda Davis: If they were done at home, they were done with a clean needle and everything. Brand new out of the package.

494
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.230
Amanda Davis: Brand new to

495
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.690
Amanda Davis: You never mix the ink.

496
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:43.560
Dawn Abriel: Dope.

497
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:48.780
Dawn Abriel: So let's talk about

498
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.980
Dawn Abriel: The program. If you're not working.

499
00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:10.080
Dawn Abriel: We like to put people in the daytime. So what you're signing up for is one hour a week of group therapy and one hour week of individual therapy. Have you ever been in individual therapy before

500
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.770
Amanda Davis: No, yeah, okay. I have to do two hours of therapy, a week.

501
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.240
Dawn Abriel: One hour of group one hour of individual

502
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:23.310
Amanda Davis: Okay.

503
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:29.310
Dawn Abriel: And and when you're in group, it has to be

504
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:45.780
Dawn Abriel: No one can be interrupting you. You've got to make it so that you can stay there for the full hour and you cannot smoke during group because a lot of people are trying to stop smoking. So it wouldn't trigger them to see you smoking so

505
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:53.820
Dawn Abriel: You have to be their own time, obviously. And do you know anyone else in bright heart health.

506
00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:03.390
Amanda Davis: Now, but that wouldn't be a problem that makes me excited and makes me feel like I have a schedule things I need to do. Okay.

507
00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.340
Dawn Abriel: So,

508
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:13.080
Dawn Abriel: You will go to the virtual clinic, just like you did to get into seen me

509
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:13.920
Amanda Davis: Yeah.

510
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.330
Dawn Abriel: You have, you have to do that before every individual in every group.

511
00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.020
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And after we're done today.

512
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:34.320
Dawn Abriel: I want you to go back to the virtual clinic at some point today and ask them to line you up to do two more things we need to do an ace survey aceee

513
00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:51.600
Dawn Abriel: Adverse Childhood events. I want to know what your early childhood was like it's 10 questions one time and you're done. The other thing is, before every group, you have to do a survey called the brief addiction monitor or BAM.

514
00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.390
Dawn Abriel: Into the band. The night before an hour before doesn't matter.

515
00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:16.890
Dawn Abriel: But I read every single one of them every single week because you can't always talk about everything that's going on for you. And if I see some red flags going up, but because of the answers. Then I will make a point of trying to get ahold of you and and

516
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.010
Dawn Abriel: See if we can keep helping you.

517
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.120
Okay.

518
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:33.060
Dawn Abriel: So you're going to do that after after this meeting, we write he prescriptions electronic you'll never get a hard copy of a script to take to the pharmacy.

519
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.410
Amanda Davis: So you have to

520
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.730
Dawn Abriel: Tell the pharmacist is my E prescription ready

521
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:40.590
Amanda Davis: Okay, and

522
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:51.720
Dawn Abriel: I recommend that you count your film, the little film that you're going to get before you leave the counter. If you walk away from the counter.

523
00:43:52.380 --> 00:44:10.440
Dawn Abriel: They will not take it back. By law they cannot take it back. They cannot change it if for some reason they accidentally short you that is on you. It is they I deal with this all the time. People forget to count their film and then

524
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:19.320
Dawn Abriel: They it's clearly the pharmacy swallow that there's no way of holding them accountable, unless you're right there at the counter.

525
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:26.880
Amanda Davis: Okay, so I'll count them when I pick them up at the counter. Just to be sure, because I don't want any discrepancies.

526
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.960
Dawn Abriel: That's right.

527
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:28.890
Amanda Davis: That's right.

528
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:33.090
Dawn Abriel: You want to make sure you have the right kind the right amount the right number

529
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.430
Dawn Abriel: For all of it. Okay.

530
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:42.720
Dawn Abriel: I'm also going to give you some Narconon everyone who takes opioids should have some nerve can

531
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:53.730
Dawn Abriel: Them and they'll you're going to get an email that shows you how to use it, you can go to the little website and they'll show you how to use it.

532
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.250
Dawn Abriel: Okay, every month.

533
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.370
Dawn Abriel: Right hurt health will mail you

534
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:09.900
Dawn Abriel: A envelope that looks like this, a manila envelope and on the inside will be a urine cup.

535
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.520
Amanda Davis: Okay.

536
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:21.300
Dawn Abriel: When you get it, do not open it. If you open it. They don't count it, and you have to go to a lab to get your, your urine drug screen.

537
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:22.860
Amanda Davis: Okay.

538
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.060
Dawn Abriel: And have you already gotten your labs drawn from. Have you gone to a class.

539
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.000
Amanda Davis: Oh. Nobody's even given me information about that yet.

540
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.990
Dawn Abriel: Okay, so that's the third thing you're going to ask them is,

541
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:49.590
Dawn Abriel: To have them show you tell you where the nearest quest is you'll go, they'll your say I'm on the international list. I'm with bright heart health, your name should be on the list, the order is there, you get your blood and urine and you're out the door.

542
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:52.500
Dawn Abriel: It should be if for some reason it's

543
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.990
Amanda Davis: Not it's where I class last

544
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.280

Amanda Davis: Bring my ID and myself in and they'll take the blood

547
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.770
Dawn Abriel: You're going to tell them that you're with right heart health.

548
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:08.850
Okay.

549
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.740
Amanda Davis: Right heart health.

550
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:17.160
Dawn Abriel: Right. If your name is not on the list. Do not leave the lab.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.450
Okay.

552
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:25.290
Dawn Abriel: Just call right hard hell and have them fax over a copy of the order

553
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.800
Dawn Abriel: It may be that you're so so new, you have your name hasn't gotten on the list yet but I'm

00:46:45.450 --> 00:47:02.970
Dawn Abriel: If something is unusual in your urine. We have never kicked anyone out of the program because they have creative things in their urine. We just say it looks like you're starting to use a lot of math or whatever. Would you like some more help, you know, obviously you're

558
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.910
