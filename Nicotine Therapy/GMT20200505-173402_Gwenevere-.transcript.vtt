Gwenevere Abriel: Show me picture.

2
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.570
Bethany Shadid: No.

3
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that being held by someone in the middle.

4
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.610
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, so the hands are God, like, because we talked about the Trinity.

5
00:00:47.970 --> 00:01:10.230
Bethany Shadid: Know the hands are God. God created the world he holds you know that's the protection up the clouds, the light coming through is what I visualized is the Holy Spirit, the wisdom part shining a light and then in the middle. That would be me and in Jesus.

6
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.300
Bethany Shadid: And that's that nurturing

7
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.940
Bethany Shadid: The one that we talked about. Yeah. So protect your, your wisdom.

10
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So you look at it, I can see it till you look at it.

11
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you

12
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Recall

13
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of what this week has been like

14
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you notice

15
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.120
Bethany Shadid: It just makes me feel good looking at it.

16
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:06.690
Bethany Shadid: I was just happy that I did it because I was having a lot of like, oh I don't know, I think john and along I am. It's not gonna make sense.

17
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.800
Bethany Shadid: All the self doubt stuff and you know more

18
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.070
Bethany Shadid: Stuff came up and it was nice to focus on

19
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've been kind of drawing up a progressively or all in one day or just today.

20
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.950
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I did a big bulk of it that first day and then little by little.

21
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.820
Bethany Shadid: Adding and and or, you know,

22
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.440
Bethany Shadid: I think my I did the hands first and then I was like, how am I gonna do this. So a lot of thought.

23
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.470
Bethany Shadid: You know, do one aspect and then try and figure out how you're going to do the next one, because you have the idea in your head.

24
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.260
Bethany Shadid: But how are you gonna

25
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.340
Bethany Shadid: Get it on to pay for. So

26
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.530
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

27
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.370
Bethany Shadid: I really like it.

28
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I do too.

29
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm looking at what we discussed last time.

30
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.170
Bethany Shadid: We

31
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I did some em, Dr.

32
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes,

33
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.830
Bethany Shadid: That actually really helped us really been at this is really been an

34
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.320
Bethany Shadid: eye opener of things related to that.

35
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.610
Bethany Shadid: I didn't realize how distress. I was

36
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.180
Bethany Shadid: What I did what you know we taught you know

37
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.170
Bethany Shadid: Relaxed and didn't stay there.

38
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.250
Bethany Shadid: Thought is a little lantern flying away.

39
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.710
Bethany Shadid: But

40
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.900
Bethany Shadid: I

41
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.100
Bethany Shadid: Had to work on getting things ready to do my taxes.

42
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.620
Bethany Shadid: Anyway,

43
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.180
Bethany Shadid: And so I had to go through a mountain of paperwork.

44
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.520
Bethany Shadid: Yes, I believe most of it like

45
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.370
Bethany Shadid: Taking care of there. But what I didn't realize is

46
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.640
Bethany Shadid: I've

47
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.010
Bethany Shadid: I've moved so many times.

48
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.740
Bethany Shadid: And

49
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.190
Bethany Shadid: With my avoidant nature.

50
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.980
Bethany Shadid: Avoided a lot of things for a very long time.

51
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.220
Bethany Shadid: And

52
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.790
Bethany Shadid: It brought up so much going through the paperwork.

53
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.020
Bethany Shadid: Looking at things.

54
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.690
Bethany Shadid: realizing how far I've come.

55
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.930
Bethany Shadid: And how much

56
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.800
Bethany Shadid: How much I haven't dealt with out of sheer you know avoidance of the

57
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.130
Bethany Shadid: Having a deal with my parents or

58
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.650
Bethany Shadid: feeling bad about myself.

59
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.600
Bethany Shadid: I'm just wanting

60
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.330
Bethany Shadid: To not have to deal with something harder to

61
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.660
Bethany Shadid: Realize that

62
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.020
Bethany Shadid: You know,

63
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.340
Bethany Shadid: You don't get a break in LA hardest moments of your life, there's still so much

64
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.700
Bethany Shadid: Demand demanded view.

65
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.710
Bethany Shadid: And

66
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.220
Bethany Shadid: Anyway, I

67
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:18.300
Bethany Shadid: I had quite a few moments where I didn't realize the distress is working its way up.

68
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.620
Bethany Shadid: And then I would, it was kind of like, Wait, why am I feeling this way.

69
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:36.750
Bethany Shadid: So it took a while to realize that this process of going through things that I haven't seen in years and years.

70
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.480
Bethany Shadid: Was going to be a bit taxing

71
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.510
Bethany Shadid: I'm

72
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.690
Bethany Shadid: Like finding

73
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.230
Bethany Shadid: My marriage certificate

74
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. OK.

75
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

76
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And all that that means

77
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: an expectation and

78
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Then not being that expectation

79
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.300
Bethany Shadid: Right well

80
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.790
Bethany Shadid: It.

81
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.050
Bethany Shadid: Was sister just got engaged.

82
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.630
Bethany Shadid: And I'm really happy for her and first year easy and it

83
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.460
Bethany Shadid: Triggered how happy I am for her. But how old

84
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.170
Bethany Shadid: How much I love how carefree she is

85
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.320
Bethany Shadid: an optimistic and

86
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.380
Bethany Shadid: How I really, you know,

87
00:07:48.150 --> 00:08:00.660
Bethany Shadid: She's found somebody you know that she really can be heard her true self with and that makes me really happy for her. And then I looked at myself.

88
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:07.380
Bethany Shadid: You know, in my past marriage and things like that, realizing how much I

89
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.710
Bethany Shadid: I've had to heal and it helped much I still have to do in order to

90
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.240
Bethany Shadid: You know, have something like that I'm

91
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:29.370
Bethany Shadid: Also in it started bringing up really bad memories of

92
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.080
Bethany Shadid: How me being the oldest and

93
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.100
Bethany Shadid: All the stuff we went through my sister told me

94
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:51.990
Bethany Shadid: Not this last yeah yeah the Christmas before, but she told me that

95
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.840
Bethany Shadid: When we were in that abusive situation that

96
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:14.430
Bethany Shadid: She felt so bad for me because she knew that I had it really hard and when she was little she didn't understand why I was getting all this attention from this older book.

97
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

98
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.940
Bethany Shadid: And she was jealous. She says, I remember being jealous.

99
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.240
Bethany Shadid: And you were in my head at the time being so mean.

100
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.770
Bethany Shadid: Because you wouldn't

101
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.570
Bethany Shadid: Let me play with him.

102
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.630
Bethany Shadid: And

103
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.880
Bethany Shadid: She's like, and so the one

104
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.610
Bethany Shadid: Opportunity, where he took me

105
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:47.160
Bethany Shadid: I was like, Haha, you know, thinking to myself, you know, like I got his attention.

106
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.950
Bethany Shadid: And then I realized, you know what was happening to you.

107
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.440
Bethany Shadid: Anyway,

108
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.630
Bethany Shadid: I realized how much of a

109
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.610
Bethany Shadid: Much I

110
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.070
Bethany Shadid: In my life you protector.

111
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah you did.

112
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.730
Yep.

113
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.730
Bethany Shadid: It makes me happy.

114
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.550
Bethany Shadid: That she's so happy.

115
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

116
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.880
Bethany Shadid: But it just brought up so

117
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.170
Bethany Shadid: I was feeling really bad about

118
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.090
Bethany Shadid: The way.

119
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.840
Bethany Shadid: I realized how, you know,

120
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.590
Bethany Shadid: Traumatic. This is

121
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That you didn't. You didn't say out loud that was all in your head just now. It didn't come out of your mouth. What's the part you felt bad about

122
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:02.250
Bethany Shadid: Oh, I felt bad because I was exhausted yesterday.

123
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:13.110
Bethany Shadid: To the point where I could stay awake when I was working stuff like it was falling asleep, what not, you know,

124
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:21.660
Bethany Shadid: And the, you know, initial reaction is, gosh, I'm not even at work right now I'm at home. Why, why, so

125
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on. If that's not move from there. Okay, let's let's see if this is a as an opportunity for for a shift in in thinking for just a moment.

126
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:33.720
Sure.

127
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I say to you during that abuse history because you've told me when I've already done the work around this now.

128
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You've told me so I hope I haven't, I haven't. I don't

129
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: local stations. I don't initiate them. I let you let you decide. Unlike that anyway but

130
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But that was the message and message received so I don't press in on it. I just stand back and I don't

131
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:13.410
Bethany Shadid: Well, I guess I should have done a lot of work around it. Okay.

132
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Because here's the question you're

133
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this, why I'm interrupting you. This is why I'm interrupting. Just because just now, I've heard you basically giving yourself a hard time about being exhausted.

134
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's the part I interrupted you on because when you were little.

135
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The survival mechanism that kept your psychological so that you're not crazy. You're not insane. You didn't go into depression and didn't kill yourself, etc. Like it kept you alive because you couldn't fight and you couldn't run

136
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm guessing that your way to survive was in mobilization with fear.

137
00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That you may, I'm guessing during that traumatic event after event after event that dramatic history that you may have. And you tell me if this is correct, sort of disappeared from yourself in a sense, got away from the body dis associated from

138
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:13.980
Bethany Shadid: This

139
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it happen. Back then,

140
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.060
Bethany Shadid: Oh, okay.

141
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So. So notice what you're doing now.

142
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You just the yeah

143
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: There's another way to look at this with love and compassion. Okay, so what the neat thing is is that science explains this in terms of not being so hard on yourself, but more like this more like you just went in those boxes.

144
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just went into all that history and felt it. And guess what happened.

145
00:13:45.000 --> 00:14:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaustion, the same thing that you needed to do to survive it. The body remembers that right it needed to freeze it needed to escape itself to not be there. Not really feel the full extent of what was going on. So why don't you be grateful this body of yours knows what to do. Okay.

146
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Granted it's it isn't the mobilized one yes you and

147
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You've heard little bits of it along the way. Like, ooh, that anger is not the enemy. Let's use its energy right because it's above the zero

148
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The running and the fighting is above zero, but it's very possible that when you were going through your trauma. You went below zero, which means just regular relaxation is fine for a person who's never had.

149
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: A dissociative traumatic link. But when so even when you're like relaxed. You may wonder, well why why is this not even okay because you could drop into

150
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Knowing all that and starting to come out of the body and not be present with it. So it's not black and white, like, Hey, well of course relaxation is good for everyone. It's not, it can be a trigger in and of itself. So

151
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yours is a delicate complex moment where we kind of kind of come at it a little differently than your, you know, like what you might hear it pop psychology will meditation relaxation. What's wrong with it. It's good for well. Just hold on a minute.

152
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Because if you find yourself starting to drop below that comfort level it's

153
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:25.320
Bethany Shadid: It's very scary to me. And a lot of the Trump memories I have

154
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:37.470
Bethany Shadid: Are not of what like the physical act of what he was doing me a lot of it was waking up in in places I didn't

155
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.090
Bethany Shadid: Work that

156
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.500
Bethany Shadid: Feeling of waking

157
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Up.

158
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.380
Bethany Shadid: And being very unsettled.

159
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.610
Bethany Shadid: Um, that's very interesting to me.

160
00:15:51.870 --> 00:16:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So now you haven't given me those stories because you set this in motion. That's not what you're here for we're addressing this sort of toxic family dynamic etc etc. But I want you to know I am happy to do that with you as much or as little as you want. Okay. Yeah.

161
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:17.880
Bethany Shadid: I'm I'm fair game for whatever, if this is going to help me. It's going to help you know and I mean I've done a lot of work, but I've never

162
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.030
Bethany Shadid: Like it's always there.

163
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.430
Bethany Shadid: And it's been a long time since I've done any work on that period. So

164
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.200
Bethany Shadid: It's fine with me.

165
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Just so I can check in. Did you do some of the EM Dr work during specifically. OK, so maybe that could be a way to look at this and say, well, this could be a

166
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of a precise intervention to experience a desensitization to that history and a reprocessing. So it's so that your relationship with that history so that you don't bump into what just happened and it wiped out.

167
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:54.300
Yeah.

168
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a possibility. But I want to tell you

169
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This has an intense oftentimes

170
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Impact, which means things that you had stored away, start coming in from the unconscious. They started intruding into dreams.

171
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be sort of a more an amplification of how you're feeling for a while until the desensitization happens

172
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But I do em Dr do attachment focus. Cmdr. Which means that stuff of kind of weaving in the Holy Trinity is present. I don't just do desensitization. I just found the other way. A bit reckless I prefer to have the support their

173
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Inner weaving. I think it I've watched it just, it just looks kinder

174
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.830
Bethany Shadid: Well, I'll be honest with

175
00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:06.060
Bethany Shadid: You whenever it comes up, it does stay around for a while. It's very linked to everything. I mean, we didn't even plan on going that route last week.

176
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:21.690
Bethany Shadid: It just came out of what we were doing. And here I am. So, and I, I've been told I have PTSD. I think it's more triggered when it's at the forefront of what's going on.

177
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.490
Bethany Shadid: I haven't had a lot of issues with it in in the past few years, but

178
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:40.560
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I'm totally open to working on this, it definitely still affects me and it affects me more now because

179
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:52.140
Bethany Shadid: In my recent history. My sister. You know as open up this you remembers. And now my family is not denying it anymore. So

180
00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:12.450
Bethany Shadid: All the work that I didn't know it was prior to that, prior to having to accept that nobody, you know, might ever acknowledge what happened. So yeah, I think that ever since that happened it's thrown me a lot. So

181
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So the goal of it would be in its simplest fundamental elements is for you to have a different relationship with that part of you if that happened because if

182
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, when I say that it's right because it's all kind of happening here in the mind.

183
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And the brain and so that when

184
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Some trigger event comes up, it can feel like it happened in the past, and it's not relived that's kind of the goal of it.

185
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.860
Bethany Shadid: You know,

186
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.800
Bethany Shadid: That would be good.

187
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it's a story, it's like you know how sometimes we'll do things where there's this sort of distance from it and we can say, yeah, that happened.

188
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm poor, poor girl right but this piece that I want to add to it today because we're not going to obviously have any time to get into the actual technique, but we'll schedule that I want to say again that if I haven't already said it.

189
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This kid, he was like 13 or something money somewhere around like

190
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:22.860
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

191
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: He

192
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: He he touched the skin, but he didn't touch you. You reserved yourself inside

193
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're okay. And that's the part that that's when I say, what's that relationship. It's like really being able to sort of and I don't know what the story will be for you.

194
00:20:46.740 --> 00:21:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But finding a way to sort of say, this happened. This is how it's affected me. It's how I I do this with these kinds of people. Or I might miss a particular sign with someone else or minimize data or something. I'm doing in my own body.

195
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no shame.

196
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's kind of the destination is to sort of have this this almost distance from it.

197
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this happened. I can feel kind of for a moment, you know, the way we do we go out here. We have empathy. Oh, yeah. No way. No, I'm gonna stay here.

198
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: In my truth. Now I'm okay now I'm safe now. I'm okay now and and sort of have that distance from that that memory, but it happened, and it's it's not

199
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to go anywhere. It's not like anybody can get in there and pull that piece out, but wouldn't it be cool when it comes up to not be in the degree of distress that it it can kind of bring you into that.

200
00:21:49.200 --> 00:22:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Association. So now that you've heard another perspective on what you're labeling as a bad attribute of exhaustion. Can you see how you are designed to take care yourself you're designing your main that way.

201
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:13.080
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, well, it would be nice. So I can talk about the abuse and that part of it is distanced

202
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:25.140
Bethany Shadid: Okay, but how it affected me mentally, emotionally, psychologically, when those things get pulled out right like

203
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:42.360
Bethany Shadid: You know, last week I made the connection of how that relates to this other thing that's when it all get real stirred up again and I i think that's, those are those triggering moments and

204
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:49.980
Bethany Shadid: The exhaustion like learning that piece as much as it's a blessing. It's kind of like

205
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.490
Bethany Shadid: Putting that understanding there.

206
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.980
Bethany Shadid: To prevent the shame in the

207
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.250
Bethany Shadid: You know negativity around those things having a different perspective would be really nice.

208
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, and more than just perspective. I'm imagining. You want to feel meaning body and mind, whatever that that weird combination of how an emotion of sad, how that feels. I imagine you want to feel happy.

209
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I imagine the goal, the destination is I want to be cool with my am yeah we. Okay. I want to be all right. When these pop up when I see. Oh, I was

210
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad to see because notice you were crying earlier. I'm happy to see my, my sister happy and you were crying that is happy. And what was coming out of your mouth and know if you remember, I interrupted you knows like yeah but but what what what

211
00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad feeling. And that's the one that goes a name that you're not naming, that's the one that's the one that still holds you it's that familiar self sacrifice that it's about her her happiness. And what about you that one guessing maybe a piece of it.

212
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.650
Bethany Shadid: Oh yeah, actually, the self sacrifice. I think where you said

213
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:31.110
Bethany Shadid: Look actually thinking about the things I do on a daily basis how I view my life.

214
00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.180
Bethany Shadid: Kind of is like

215
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.360
Bethany Shadid: In sacrifice for

216
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.400
Bethany Shadid: How that affects so much

217
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, that's going to be the one you see how your eyes tell they you may say, all these lovely things, but you're like,

218
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait.

219
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you.

220
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:55.500
Bethany Shadid: What about

221
00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What about you. What about you. What about you, and it is it's not to be expected for a little girl to know how to sit with the absolute confusion of two conflicting needs of self preservation

222
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And self sacrifice. I didn't expect little you to know how to do it. But now you can now we can sit with these together, we can do it together.

223
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to come away with it on in it, it'll be yours forever and being able to sit with these and and still loving yourself and not feeling like this soul wrenching thing that happens. And that's the destination is just came up. Look at that. Oh, yeah.

224
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess it's happened. Look at that. It's happening again. Look at me. Look at that.

225
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And so we can see it just now with the intensity of the emotions came up as soon as that awareness of self sacrifice.

226
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And I, I think that might be a target for us.

227
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when we do some work.

228
00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:58.740
I'm guessing.

229
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.980
Bethany Shadid: Because I see how tight it is to my overall well being.

230
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Your well being and look at

231
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:06.990
Bethany Shadid: It.

232
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And see it easily right with how you are at work with how you are with patients with how you are with family members, I will, I will just again.

233
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That right and you know who gets sacrificed is this this you again and again and again. And it's not working and I and it. It's a lovely one, sometimes

234
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:28.680
Bethany Shadid: Cool skill.

235
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Or out there and and you are deserving of just as much joy and happiness is your sister.

236
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Enough because right you're so unique of a human creature know we all are.

237
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Earned special you have it, because you were born. You're deserving because you're human. And you're loved and lovable, the same

238
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Inverse of that is, there's nothing you did to not deserve it.

239
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.200
Great.

240
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So, these, these are, this is, this has been a sort of five, six year old solution right still with you, right, it's still operating so running the show in this woman's

241
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.450
Bethany Shadid: It really is.

242
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get we think

243
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.360
Bethany Shadid: I'm flexible whenever next week.

244
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

245
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what we got here.

246
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:37.320
Bethany Shadid: I just can't do the Thursday.

247
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Can it be 10am on May 12

248
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.180
Yeah.

249
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's what we'll do.

250
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Spend some time if you could, I'm going to go run this group that starting now. It's a brand new group on Tuesdays.

251
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of just turn towards that.

252
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That picture you drew

253
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: With this new piece.

254
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

255
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.370
Bethany Shadid: Thank you.

256
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.930
Bethany Shadid: I'm excited to work on this. So,

257
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You. I think getting this core issue.

258
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Really might do the trick. So

259
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:27.090
Bethany Shadid: Desperately is. So anyway, thank you. Good.

260
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: To you soon.

261
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Bye bye.
