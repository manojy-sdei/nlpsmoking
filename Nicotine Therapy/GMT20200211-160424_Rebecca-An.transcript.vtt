00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good morning.

2
00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:07.830
Donna Jochimsen: Good morning, Rebecca.

3
00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:08.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.969
Donna Jochimsen: I'm a little bit tired. Okay.

5
00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's going on.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.360
Donna Jochimsen: Oh, it has

7
00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.560
Donna Jochimsen: Just been a really bad week

8
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.940
Donna Jochimsen: My dad, but it might get a little bit better.

9
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.950
Donna Jochimsen: they've discovered after I don't know a couple of years. I'm treating him for constipation and other odd things that he actually has gallstones.

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:51.510
Donna Jochimsen: Which would be one why he's his stomach hurts so bad. So they. Yeah, they did surgery on him. What was I think Thursday night, I believe, or Friday morning he went in Thursday night Friday morning and he came home Sunday.

11
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.200
Donna Jochimsen: Nice and seems to be feeling better.

12
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.070
Donna Jochimsen: Than

13
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:11.730
Donna Jochimsen: That had been an ongoing issue for about two years. We actually thought that he was being a hypochondriac, that there wasn't really anything wrong with me, just wanted attention that was true.

14
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I'm glad they figured it out. Two years later,

15
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.930
Donna Jochimsen: Yep. Two years later,

16
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What happened that made them finally start searching for

17
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:40.050
Donna Jochimsen: You know I don't know I don't know I didn't. It was for one thing, it was a different doctor, we were taking him into the we've taken him into the emergency room, I think, about four times in the last year, just in the last one year and

18
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.790
Donna Jochimsen: Be treated him for, I think, what is that divert. Wait a minute.

19
00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:07.350
Donna Jochimsen: Yes, that that is it twice. And then the third time, they decided that it was a constipation. And so we, you know, started giving him big amounts of fiber and everything that we could think of to get do and it still was happening.

20
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.020
Donna Jochimsen: And like I said, we sort of thought that maybe it was dad trying to get attention because there's always something wrong. I forgot to turn my volume down like that.

21
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.010
Donna Jochimsen: So other things coming in. Well,

22
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.840
Donna Jochimsen: Wait a minute, I want that. All right.

23
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.470
Donna Jochimsen: Okay.

24
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.830
Donna Jochimsen: Anyway, you are there. Okay.

25
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:48.750
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, yeah. Anyway, this we went in as time and they looked a lot further and discovered that he had gallstones. So they removed it. And he seems to be while he's a little cranky, but he seems to be feeling better.

26
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, and you

27
00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:14.010
Donna Jochimsen: I'm doing pretty good. I've actually had probably more time off, and I've had in a long, long time because he was in the hospital for two days. So I had a little bit of downtime, which I haven't had a lot of and I see, okay, and I did do the do the women for sobriety group.

28
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good. Yeah.

29
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.890
Donna Jochimsen: It was a little bit strange. I've never, I've never actually done a chat like that live, you know,

30
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.870
Donna Jochimsen: parties involved, but I'll get used to it and I liked what I saw, I really do. They're very positive.

31
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.400
Donna Jochimsen: You know,

32
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:42.120
Donna Jochimsen: And, you know, just I really liked it. The facilitator did a really good job of keeping things in line and that was good.

33
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good.

34
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.150
Donna Jochimsen: Good, good. Yeah.

35
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, good. Um, and was there a lot of people

36
00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.300
Donna Jochimsen: Well, there was there was several there was probably close to 10 I think

37
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, yeah. Yeah, good. The more the better. You know, really, because you can sit back and

38
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, just kind of watch and monitor and, you know, put your two cents in the great part about it is it's not in person. And so, you know, kind of helps with the anxiety anxiety piece of this whole thing, you know.

39
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.680
Right.

40
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:37.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, you don't have to feel like you're being judged don't have to feel like you're being watched. It's not awkward walking in. However, it is an awkward going into, you know, that can dissipate. Yeah.

41
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.060
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I have a meeting.

42
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.200
Donna Jochimsen: That I go to. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go at noon today, but so I do have an in person group also

43
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.250
Donna Jochimsen: Okay, good.

44
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.350
Donna Jochimsen: That I've been doing for quite a while.

45
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how have you been managing and regulating your emotions.

46
00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:06.030
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I've been a while. I've been walking a lot more than I usually do the weather. It's finally been nice. Like I said dad was in the hospital. I had more time.

47
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:19.470
Donna Jochimsen: So I had to. I had some catching up to do. I had a lot of laundry and all that crap. But when I got done with that i i walk. I spent some time talking to a friend that I haven't talked to you for a while.

48
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.710
Donna Jochimsen: I talked to all of my kids last week every one of them.

49
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

50
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.130
Donna Jochimsen: We all had come from conversations

51
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.510
Donna Jochimsen: I see I did my meeting, I've

52
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:42.630
Donna Jochimsen: Definitely been trying to practice practice mindfulness, not just while I'm walking it. It's gonna take me some practice to do

53
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure, yeah, it does everybody you know

54
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But the more that you practice it, the easier it gets.

55
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It just takes time. Yeah, I've noticed

56
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.640
Donna Jochimsen: More comfortable with it, but it's hard to be focused

57
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:04.260
Donna Jochimsen: You know, and not let my wife, my mind go backwards or forwards, just be focused on what's going on now.

58
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, okay, good. Um,

59
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What else has been going on.

60
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.530
Donna Jochimsen: Oh I quit smoking. How about that on

61
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thursday was my

62
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.930
Donna Jochimsen: Well, Thursday I had been planning on doing this for quite some time.

63
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:40.500
Donna Jochimsen: It didn't ever. It just didn't ever work out. Right. I didn't have the patches or whatever. But I had picked Thursday, which was actually the anniversary of my husband's death and to honor him and and my kids I had decided to quit smoking, so I haven't had a cigarette, since Wednesday.

64
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow. Congratulations. How's it going,

65
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.350
Donna Jochimsen: You know a lot better than I thought. I think I don't know I had completely made up my mind I wasn't wishy washy about whether or not I wanted to do it.

66
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.170
Donna Jochimsen: It makes me an outcast. None of nobody in my family smokes, but me.

67
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:07.380
Donna Jochimsen: I'm always the only one. And I absolutely hate it and I don't I'm getting ready to go up to see my granddaughter's excellent

68
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.310
Donna Jochimsen: And I really don't want to have to be sneaking out behind the

69
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.170
Donna Jochimsen: Building smoking, you know,

70
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.990
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah, I don't want, I never want to be anywhere near them. When I was smoking so

71
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.550
Donna Jochimsen: That means I have to go quite a ways away because they're teenagers.

72
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, yeah.

73
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They can catch on. They'll smell it. The minute

74
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.670
Donna Jochimsen: They knew. They knew. I know that they knew, but I just

75
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:39.450
Donna Jochimsen: Never wanted to ever be able to do it in front of them, you know, but they're very happy to

76
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.780
Donna Jochimsen: Donate all for all everybody's happy that I quit smoking.

77
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.510
Donna Jochimsen: Which is, it's about time, but

78
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.910
Donna Jochimsen: It's actually way.

79
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.610
Donna Jochimsen: way easier than I thought. Yeah.

80
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have, are you on the patch or

81
00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:02.580
Donna Jochimsen: I'm on the patch. I've got I bought about $20 worth of hard candies and I've been going through them. I probably will gain a little way it out of this.

82
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:16.230
Donna Jochimsen: Okay, so I admit I've made this Oreo desert thing and ate the whole damn thing by myself not at one sitting. But usually I would have had a piece and give them the rest away this time I kept it and I ate it at

83
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.710
Donna Jochimsen: That wasn't very that wasn't the most pleasant thing I've ever done actually sick.

84
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.960
Donna Jochimsen: I don't like I don't like sweet things that much, but I just felt the need to eat.

85
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable. You know, when you feel like that, having healthy foods in your house and trying to

86
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.880
Yeah.

87
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:45.480
Donna Jochimsen: This desert thing i i don't know what i think maybe I got it in a food bank like a couple years ago.

88
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.260
Donna Jochimsen: It's been sitting down under my cupboard for a really long time but

89
00:08:50.490 --> 00:09:00.090
Donna Jochimsen: I one night I was just like, God, I just want something sweet and I didn't have anything else. So I pulled that out and I thought it was pretty good, actually.

90
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.550
Donna Jochimsen: But not the whole thing. It took me a couple of days. But I did eat it all. I'm like, oh, that's got to be about 10 pounds.

91
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:21.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you know, especially right now, you know cigarettes are the hardest thing to to let go of and especially right now giving yourself permission to be okay with eating that you know whole dessert.

92
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.580
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what it was.

93
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.070
Donna Jochimsen: What I needed to do. I didn't, I didn't smoke.

94
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:40.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes. See, you know, and just being mindful about what you're putting in your body from from this place forward one of the doctors that I work with told me that, um, it takes about three days to get

95
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Rid of the cravings for sugar.

96
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.330
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah.

97
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.850
Donna Jochimsen: I was definitely craving sugar I and I

98
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:48.660
Donna Jochimsen: Never do

99
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.210
Donna Jochimsen: That's not something that I crave sugar but I definitely was craving sugar.

100
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so, yeah.

101
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:07.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's definitely something to pay attention to. Because I think that's also a big fear for a lot of people. I don't want to quit smoking, because then I'm going to gain weight or, you know,

102
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:17.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And because that's the big thing that everyone tells you you're going to gain weight. Well, they don't realize it's because you're trying to, you know, your body's going hey wait a minute.

103
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where's that substance.

104
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, I need that substance and don't forget the hand of mouth to

105
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Begin with it all. And how long have you been smoking.

106
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.210
Donna Jochimsen: Oh, a long time about 40 years. Hello.

107
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That pattern of this you know that hand of mouth thing is really

108
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

109
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.310
Donna Jochimsen: It is really, really killer Carmel Apple Carmel Apple suckers.

110
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.360
Donna Jochimsen: They help a lot. It especially when it had mouth thing.

111
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good. You've got a lot of good things going on, you know,

112
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how's your anxiety been

113
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.390
Donna Jochimsen: It's been pretty low.

114
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which is good. Yep, you're going to enter

115
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're doing, you know, more things engaging with more people.

116
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Totally stepping outside your box, you know,

117
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's progress that's big progress for you.

118
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Tell me how

119
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:22.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Getting active in your recovery in your life, how is that, how has that affected your emotion regulation.

120
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:46.950
Donna Jochimsen: Well, it's I have not had any what I would consider like severe emotions like real depression or overly happy. I haven't had I haven't had that. So I haven't had to think about it too much because it just hasn't been there, you know, I assume that sometime that I'll still have that, but

121
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.090
Donna Jochimsen: Or at least, occasionally, you know, something will get me excited about, you know, yeah.

122
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.430
Donna Jochimsen: They're really nervous or really depressed or whatever and

123
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:11.730
Donna Jochimsen: You know, I haven't worried about that too much because like I said, I've not been feeling like you know like, yo, yo, emotions like I like I do a lot

124
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:12.660
Yeah.

125
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. When you stay busy, you don't have time to focus on

126
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:17.760
Right.

127
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:19.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

128
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:34.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All of those things. And so it kind of helps regulate them naturally and then learning how to be mindful in when you start feeling it. Come on, being able to say, Okay, I know what's getting ready. You know, I know what's coming. And so really changing starting to change that mindset.

129
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: This is okay.

130
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and then going back at you know taking a quick inventory. I have a roof over my head. I have food in my mouth, I have this I have this, you know, I'm doing everything I can for myself.

131
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:59.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Really kind of helps gain perspective of what's really going on, you know, because, yeah, you know, a thought and a feeling there's a beginning, middle, and an end. If you allow it to go through this process.

132
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, so there's that. And don't forget that you're, you know, when you start feeling especially when it comes around your husband.

133
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know your losses. Your give yourself permission to feel those feelings.

134
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But also

135
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.450
You

136
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Also give yourself permission to step out of it. When you're done.

137
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:23.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

138
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.770
Donna Jochimsen: Don't say I do, I do.

139
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good, good, good.

140
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:36.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when we're just going to keep on pushing forward with you practicing mindfulness and eating healthy and the smoking thing and

141
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:44.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you've got a lot that you're doing going to, you know, Women for Women in sobriety. Right.

142
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or one more source right here.

143
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.290
Donna Jochimsen: my birthright.

144
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And, you know, going to a meeting and again

145
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Taking a look at

146
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Evaluating people for a sponsorship.

147
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:17.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, just sitting back and watching and listening and just paying attention and seeing if there's anybody that you just kind of you're attracted to. What were their life has has made it from where it was when they first got there, when people tell their story.

148
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:31.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you find somebody evaluate whether or not their sponsor you know they're sponsoring. How many, how many years of sobriety. Do they have you know really kind of take a look all the way around, you know,

149
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before. Yeah.

150
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:44.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, jump out there, oftentimes people will will say, Okay, I'm going to get a sponsor and they'll go to meetings and they'll grab somebody who has limited sobriety. Who hasn't worked the steps and their life is just barely

151
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Becoming manageable and that it can be utter chaos and turn you completely off from

152
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That have happened to me before.

153
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.240
I'll see you know

154
00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:01.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: just evaluate and, you know, and listen, uh, you know, is what I recommend you do

155
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before you take that leap.

156
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:13.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And keep doing what you're doing, Donna. I mean, you're on, you know, this really huge awesome path right now, you know,

157
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:23.130
Donna Jochimsen: Well, I've been. I've been working at this. You know what I had bad month relapse before I came to bright heart.

158
00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:39.840
Donna Jochimsen: I had been getting Suboxone at another group, but I my relapse happen. I'm not going to say totally because but partly because I was around people that were still basically using they were fudging our tasks or whatever, you know,

159
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.010
And

160
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.210
Donna Jochimsen: I should not ever be around people like that just

161
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.850
Donna Jochimsen: Don't you know I don't want to. So if

162
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.980
Donna Jochimsen: I left there and then then I

163
00:15:50.190 --> 00:16:00.630
Donna Jochimsen: Had problems when I left. So I've been working at what I'm getting at is, I've been working at this for a while. I wasn't really, really good at it, but I've had a vision is

164
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.590
Donna Jochimsen: I'll say that vision of where I wanted to be okay.

165
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:14.160
Donna Jochimsen: I'm definitely not even close to being there. But, but I do have a vision of how to where I want to get to. And I'm finding new ways to get there.

166
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.030
Donna Jochimsen: So it's been very positive.

167
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:23.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know when you when you the one statement that I learned

168
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From self help groups was half measures to build us nothing.

169
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you know, when I

170
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:48.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When my experience has been that when you go in and you're introducing to you know you're engaging with other people, you can pretty much get a feeler right off the bat on whether or not they're doing it for the right reasons the wrong reasons.

171
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.130
Donna Jochimsen: You can you can

172
00:16:50.430 --> 00:17:01.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and really just just connecting with the ones that are there for the right reasons and not to please the courts or DHS or, you know, but really for themselves, you know,

173
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So identifying that you're the people that you're hanging around, you know, that's a big thing. Because now you know what to

174
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Stay away from you know

175
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:12.780
Donna Jochimsen: Yeah. Yep.

176
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think you're doing a great job. You know, I think that you definitely are doing a great job.

177
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:36.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anything that you want to work on more this week or staying in this in this learning put step by footstep capacity. Is that good enough for you or do you want to

178
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.950
Donna Jochimsen: Know that this is this is for me right this minute this is good. I

179
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:49.290
Donna Jochimsen: Okay, just quit smoking, and I've just joined a new group. I feel like I would like to settle into that a little bit, but

180
00:17:49.830 --> 00:18:03.510
Donna Jochimsen: I'm going to continue working the mindfulness exercises and and you know, that is, that's my one of my goals is to get to where I'm just present in the past or worrying about the future.

181
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:04.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay cuz I've

182
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.030
Donna Jochimsen: Heard of that.

183
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. And that doesn't get us anywhere. But back in circles.

184
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just chasing our tail.

185
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:11.970
You know,

186
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.060
Donna Jochimsen: When I become emotionally unstable.

187
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, yeah, yeah.
