Gwenevere Abriel: So how

3
00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.890
Nicole Bacon: Good.

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:38.220
Nicole Bacon: Got my space pretty cleaned up and making my bed every day. And after our meeting and going to go to Santa Fe and get some more supplies, you're going to make these like rosaries and have like funky rosaries I have all the stuff, but it's just over there.

5
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that something you're going

6
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: To sell this weekend.

7
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oops, I think I lost you. Can you hear me.

8
00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I cannot hear you. It is silent. I cannot hear you. There is no sound.

9
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.950
Hopefully you can hear me either.

10
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it

11
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.560
Nicole Bacon: Had it plugged in, and it was behind the bed just a tiny bit and it was without me know

12
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get a note open here and

13
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I can hear that you are

14
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: following through with some of the things that are sort of the short term task oriented getting organized

15
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that difficult for you to do so, like today and yesterday, has that hasn't been difficult to follow through, or

16
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.610
Nicole Bacon: Um,

17
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.160
Nicole Bacon: I feel like I'm kind of

18
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:31.110
Nicole Bacon: Ramping up to it, like, at first it was like really hard, but it's more of my normal state to have things

19
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.350
Nicole Bacon: Organized pretty organized so um

20
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.070
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I mean it.

21
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:56.610
Nicole Bacon: I'm getting better at it, but a little bit. It's a little tricky because I just kind of let go of everything and didn't care. And I didn't have anything to look forward to. And I do now. That's like probably the major difference

22
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So now having something to look forward to. I mean, how big of a statement is that that I can't can't quite for that one.

23
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.310
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah I'm

24
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:23.670
Nicole Bacon: Usually I would look forward to like a trip vacation or a showing I'm belly dancing at or

25
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.480
Nicole Bacon: Some other event. And I kind of

26
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:36.060
Nicole Bacon: Put those in a timeline in my head, I'm like, Okay, I'm looking forward to that. That's the next thing, but I didn't really have anything on my

27
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.120
Nicole Bacon: Side. I haven't left because of my addiction. You know, I haven't been able to travel or anything.

28
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was carrying on the other day about having a deadline, actually, that matches really well with what you just said.

29
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

30
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.680
Nicole Bacon: Deadlines are good for me, or else. Yeah, or else I'm a master procrastinator.

31
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, cool. So that's convenient. Did you happen to use the 54321. Have you tried. I mean, yes, I know it seems over simplified, but did you try it.

32
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.930
Nicole Bacon: No, I did. Yeah, a couple of times and it helps

33
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. All of a sudden you were there and did you end up spending more time doing the thing than you thought.

34
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:37.590
Nicole Bacon: No, it's usually like I need to do this. I needed to do this and I build it up in my head, I'm like, Oh, such a big thing. It's not using that 54321 is just in the moment. Doing it just get up and do it.

35
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't overthink it right that brain will get in there and say all kinds of shenanigans. Okay.

36
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:43.800
Nicole Bacon: Well, cool.

37
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are yours forever.

38
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Really simple stuff. I know it's kind of silly but

39
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.280
Nicole Bacon: Know the numbers work in your head for

40
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.380
Yeah yeah

41
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, then work. It's a funny thing if you if you ever find yourself really stressed, even in your own house getting from one room to the next, like, Oh, I can't believe I'm late, or whatever, just counting 123412341234 you can push out the, oh my gosh, I can't believe what I just did.

42
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.920
Nicole Bacon: It's a new neutralize it kind of

43
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get your mind on those number counting and not catastrophizing it maybe that body will stay down regulate it, just a little bit lower.

44
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus and then feeding the, oh my gosh, I'm going to lose something or some threat response happening. Okay.

45
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.110
He these windows bit

46
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

47
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.270
Pretty. No, I'm

48
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.630
Okay, let me see where we left off.

49
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We covered

50
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.300
Sleep.

51
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Relationships food. How we doing on food any kind of improvement on make another priority.

52
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.790
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I'm like, I just had a snack earlier today.

53
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.380
Nicole Bacon: I actually made like this muffin low that I can snack on

54
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:37.110
Nicole Bacon: Because I don't have a lot of like ready snacks right now because of my food stamps, not me. So, and then I'm going to grab some snacks from my parents when I go down later okay going back

55
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: How much longer on your antibiotic.

56
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.680
Nicole Bacon: Well, I have a big supply the doctor just said, Take it till

57
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.110
Nicole Bacon: It gets better. So

58
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.500
Nicole Bacon: I have like 90 pills, leaving something

59
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's a long time to be taken that right

60
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:06.840
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

61
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you already noticing and

62
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.870
Nicole Bacon: I'm it it'll get better.

63
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:29.340
Nicole Bacon: And then kind of like flare up. I've been taking epson salt baths and like mud masks as much as I can, like, every day and it's helping

64
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:42.780
Nicole Bacon: I found a website that this guy got rid of it. And he's using all all these different things and I'm just trying to focus on a couple of them.

65
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:43.680
Okay.

66
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: He changed something in his diet.

67
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:48.930
Nicole Bacon: Diet.

68
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.950
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, it's very internal

69
00:12:54.690 --> 00:13:03.270
Nicole Bacon: Cutting down on outside chemicals like laundry detergent, stuff like that, using borax Works. Works powder.

70
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.500
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, just kind of limited with what I can use because

71
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.830
Nicole Bacon: But I'm gonna go do some hair cuts in Santa Fe later. So I'll have a little bit money. I can put towards that.

72
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's confusing who the people you're cutting the hair.

73
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.700
Nicole Bacon: Prius. OK.

74
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So those are heads. You don't mind touching

75
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.950
Nicole Bacon: Know, and I've touched. I've done their hair before

76
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.300
Nicole Bacon: It's more just like new people in the salon space. Yeah.

77
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so a little bit of money there and some curtains and what else

78
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.010
Nicole Bacon: I'm finishing the curtains here.

79
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.950
Nicole Bacon: And just yeah getting supplies to make jewelry grocery chains.

80
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And any more conversation with

81
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Barbie.

82
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.300
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm. Yeah, that's me. Yeah. Yeah, every day. We've been talking

83
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.890
Nicole Bacon: We're right now trying to

84
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.700
Nicole Bacon: Write something now to ask my probation officer.

85
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:31.770
Nicole Bacon: If it would be okay if I could go to Hawaii on a trip to check it out. So trying to figure that out right now. And my probation.

86
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:44.760
Nicole Bacon: Booklet is in Santa Fe, with all the information. So I want to bring that back and see what it says. Under travel. I think you have to get a permit. I'm not too positive

87
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.120
Nicole Bacon: My P O doesn't really get back to me that often. I've tried calling him but

88
00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm looking at the release of information that you completed this was for is it Santiago Cordova

89
00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.310
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

90
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm probation officer. There's a phone number or there's an address school Avenue South East got your date of birth. Okay.

91
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine. Once you do it.

92
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And so what this will do for you is, let's say officer says up, you're in treatment. Okay, well good. I would like to present that to the judge or have it in your file. What he may do is reach out won't reach out to me. I wouldn't give him my phone number. What I would say is

93
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Gives the main bright heart health number he can call they're going to see that release in there, they can create or I can create I use a particular

94
00:15:48.060 --> 00:16:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Participation form you've sent you one actually. And then it can either be emailed directly to him now that I have his I would bypass, you and I would send it directly to him.

95
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: This way, his name on it. And, um,

96
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And if there's any other document. He needs like I don't know what but

97
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm not going to be calling him.

98
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.510
Nicole Bacon: Okay, yeah.

99
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.010
Um,

100
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you later on, say, I'm concerned I want additional support in some way. Now I don't know if you remember, but

101
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Spent a lot of time I'm 14 years in felony drug courts. So for me, I see a judge, I see you know pretrial release officers as more support as part of a team that that helps the client.

102
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:54.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see it, you know, obviously, each person could be a real Turkey and not very friendly and helpful, but overall I see them as a way to augment and help someone stay on track.

103
00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. And so for you this, this fellow. Does it seem like he's reasonable and rational and on your side.

104
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.140
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

105
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.070
Nicole Bacon: He

106
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.280
Nicole Bacon: He just wants to me to be doing good, and not take me to jail.

107
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.350
Nicole Bacon: So, uh,

108
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.620
Nicole Bacon: I did write him.

109
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:30.630
Nicole Bacon: He I guess they came by the House, a while back, and I wasn't here, but my friend was here.

110
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:36.540
Nicole Bacon: And I kind of freaked out and like are they coming to take me to jail because this is all new to me. I don't know what it

111
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:50.100
Nicole Bacon: what it's about. And so I texted him. I'm like, I'm scared like you came by, like, what was that just a checkup, or like what, and he explained. He was like, no, we're not taking any jail just unit checkup. So

112
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:57.300
Nicole Bacon: Because I don't know how this whole thing works. You know, I'm trying to ask about questions and

113
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.310
Nicole Bacon: But basically, the most important things for him is

114
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.820
Nicole Bacon: Me being in a program and getting therapy and also young

115
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And probably, he does random drug screening does me

116
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.990
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah, once a month. Okay.

117
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And getting a job. Does he care what kind of job.

118
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.980
Nicole Bacon: Just as long as it's a job. Cool.

119
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And it sounds like you'd like that. Anyway, so that's not a big deal.

120
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:28.800
Nicole Bacon: All right.

121
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You're working that out with Barbie. Yes.

122
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see what other stuff. We got, um, let's get into this. Let me

123
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Get out of here.

124
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Close the whole thing.

125
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And how stable are you at your subjects now.

126
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.860
Nicole Bacon: I'm

127
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.710
Nicole Bacon: It's still like at night and in the morning, little sweaty.

128
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.980
Nicole Bacon: But just kind of flashes. Not like full on

129
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.060
Nicole Bacon: Just small residual. Pause

130
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember going to that last time.

131
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:32.760
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah, usually happens to me every time it takes a couple weeks for the eyes to like chill out easy

132
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.880
Nicole Bacon: Alright so let me just make a note to myself with

133
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That and when is that two week about to allow us when is like, can we expect some relief.

134
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:48.510
Nicole Bacon: So, last time I talk to you. It was a week. So in a couple days here.

135
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.820
Nicole Bacon: Oh, yeah, yeah.

136
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so in a couple days you expect to have some stabilization there. Excellent.

137
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's get into

138
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, can we do a little bit um of sort of some therapeutic stuff for a little

139
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.970
Nicole Bacon: Bit. Yeah.

140
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to develop

141
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: resourcing for you with you. And these are the three fingers. One is a protected figure in using imagery protected figure I nurturing figure and a wise figure they're really useful and all kinds of places.

142
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just take one of them. Let's just take a protective figure, it can be real or imagined combination of both. And it can also include your adult self. So just as I said What image kind of comes up with a protective figure what comes up for you.

143
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:57.840
Nicole Bacon: I'm

144
00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.590
Nicole Bacon: Like a spirit guide, I would say.

145
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a specific one or

146
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.080
Nicole Bacon: Doesn't have to be just, no, no.

147
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:12.150
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

148
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: But as you're thinking about it, since this is an imagery exercise.

149
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.930
Nicole Bacon: Imagery okay

150
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah formulated, what do you see what are the qualities of your spirit guide and it can be anything.

151
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But we want to kind of be clear because I need to bring it back to it.

152
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.650
Nicole Bacon: Okay, oh protector Wiseman

153
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:36.720
Huh.

154
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Which we just need protective figure right now.

155
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.100
Nicole Bacon: Oh, okay. I'm

156
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.370
Nicole Bacon: Like a woman with long silver hair again. Okay.

157
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Anything else with without

158
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.010
Nicole Bacon: No.

159
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's do the next one nurturing figure someone that promotes your growth your development.

160
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.520
Nicole Bacon: Like an actual person or

161
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Either way, it can be real or imagined combination. This is we get to do whatever we want.

162
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.700
Nicole Bacon: Nurturing okay

163
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:30.270
Nicole Bacon: Um, let's say Barbie right now. Okay. Yeah. Nice.

164
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. She's encouraging your growth your development right to this business piece. Okay, I get it. How bow a wise figure some of that has the quality of wisdom.

165
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.550
Nicole Bacon: Ways, I'm

166
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.320
Nicole Bacon: Shannon

167
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.040
Shannon beautiful

168
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do another activity that one to take very long.

169
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's develop an emotional container. You know how people will use the phrase, sort of a pop psychology phrase of oh you know i compartmentalize that

170
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.050
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

171
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: This would be really deliberately doing it.

172
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, in your own way their own style your own finesse she did picture an emotional container and it has to be big enough.

173
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Strong enough to hold all your stuff.

174
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.710
What do you envision

175
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.370
Container

176
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.080
Nicole Bacon: I'm

177
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.600
Nicole Bacon: I'm

178
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.830
Nicole Bacon: Like a high ceiling house with big windows. I don't know.

179
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.620
Nicole Bacon: My ceiling.

180
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: With Windows. Okay. And another attribute of it this invitation can change it. Don't get too hung up on the on this this particular requirement.

181
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it I've watched it really varies for people. So I'll say it in like almost polar

182
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Invitations so it's big enough, right, that these high ceilings and there's big windows and it's strong enough, this, this is a house right that you have as a container and then next attribute has to do with

183
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: The stuff. Typically, it's like negative stuff I would use this container when

184
00:24:51.720 --> 00:25:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you were activated to a degree that you that too much, we might say, Okay, let's let's put a pin in this. Let's move away and put intensity. Put that imagery put whatever that is. And

185
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it in the container and then we're going to want either a lead for you. I guess like door something and be able to close it pocket. Keep it in there.

186
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.420
Nicole Bacon: Oh, okay.

187
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Or it could be that that stuff will want to stay in there and what is in that house that makes it comfortable enough for that stuff to want to stay and not want to come out.

188
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.730
Nicole Bacon: Okay, okay.

189
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.180
Nicole Bacon: Like, can I have an actual container and then and being the house to

190
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.870
Nicole Bacon: Your knees be one.

191
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to do. You can have whatever you want. What's, what's just gonna

192
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:53.820
Nicole Bacon: I'm

193
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.070
Nicole Bacon: Just like a wooden box. I could put

194
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.450
Nicole Bacon: Intensities into

195
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

196
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: How big is the box.

197
00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:15.090
Nicole Bacon: Um 12 inches by four inches by four inches.

198
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

199
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And how will, how will it stay secure either by locking it or by the fact that it's so comfortable in there for those intensities. That doesn't want to leave.

200
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.380
Nicole Bacon: And it's a it's a lack

201
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, has a lunch and that latch stays closed and you have a

202
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Key doesn't say, look, closed.

203
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.690
Nicole Bacon: Um, yeah, with the key.

204
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.940
And you have to keep it.

205
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're the only one. It's

206
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.340
Okay, it's wonderful.

207
00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's do another one. These are going to serve us later okay we're doing all the preparation.

208
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, you can use them right now if you want to. Who wouldn't want to be surrounded by a protective figure nurturing for your allies figure when we're feeling like crap.

209
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. That's a nice feeling

210
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:14.790
Nicole Bacon: That's a good

211
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:24.540
Nicole Bacon: Kind of when you're thinking about decisions or situations to kind of bring those archetypes out and check in with each one of them.

212
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. I like it. I like that archetype is a cool word

213
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So now let's do another one. Let's do same um I think benefit as the container. Let's do a distancing metaphor. So, may be you know distancing from what you call the intensities. That's a fun word. I like that. I think you just invented a word.

214
00:27:50.610 --> 00:28:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So distancing so I'm on the shore just making one up. You do your own thing. I'm on the riverbank I'm with this real genuine, authentic presence.

215
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Of protective quality assurance and wisdom. I'm here on the shore with that and what I see moving away on a log or leaf is just slowly.

216
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. This distress, whatever this image was but it's slowly. I can see it getting further so that the point that I can't even see it anymore. But it's moving down the river, it's passing away from me. It's moving away right could be a shooting star could be a spaceship could be

217
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, whatever, a car that goes the opposite direction. And in my rearview mirror. I see it. So lots of different metaphors. What would be one that would work for you.

218
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.110
Nicole Bacon: Maybe

219
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.640
Nicole Bacon: I don't know, seeing a deer outside the window like

220
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.740
Nicole Bacon: Walking away.

221
00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:01.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's, let's do it again. Let's do it again. So what I'm going to say is this will serve us you you know how you put that intensity

222
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: In the container right in this box.

223
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be times when what's getting sent away is something negative.

224
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. And I don't want there to be any conflict and use sort of psychologically

225
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.140
Okay.

226
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That dear, all of a sudden, and you'll have to teach me it seemed peaceful and sweet and

227
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.700
Kind.

228
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And but that doesn't mean you can't make that happen. How would all that possible negative intensity be carried away with this dear, how would you

229
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:49.530
Nicole Bacon: Um, yeah, no, but also I don't know about the box like just floating away. I don't know.

230
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, now we're talking

231
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Is it what kind of body of water. We talking about

232
00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.500
Nicole Bacon: I'm a little late, like

233
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Box floating away in LA.

234
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a link you've actually been to, like, can you pull up real images.

235
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.860
Nicole Bacon: Um, it's kind of US mortgage board. And I guess.

236
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: A smorgasbord of real and maybe things you saw a movie or imagined.

237
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:34.710
Nicole Bacon: Of real real places. Yeah, because I was gonna say upon upon doesn't have enough energy that it like doesn't literally goes anywhere. Yeah.

238
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, um,

239
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just message someone and let her know on in session so she doesn't get panicked.

240
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:57.870
Okay.

241
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We have protected figures, we've got a container. In fact, you took that container and

242
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Send it down the lake.

243
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Very nice. I like it.

244
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:14.970
Nicole Bacon: Data

245
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

246
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: We can kind of stay again kind of superficial kind of fluffy out here for a little while longer and let's explore some of the negative cognition that you have will go cognitive behavioral for a while, it doesn't get us too deeply into

247
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, our storyline in general. What's the predominant negative thought that just

248
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.300
Nicole Bacon: That that I'm wasting my life away.

249
00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you know, you've said, at times, mostly, you know, through written message that you self sabotage.

250
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the relationship between

251
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I look around, I assess myself right and this is I'm wasting my life. Is that what's what it's like I you comparing yourself to someone else, or what, how does that assessment come about.

252
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.370
Nicole Bacon: Um,

253
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:35.880
Nicole Bacon: Mostly it's like you know I have a, like a goals or goal list and I hadn't been getting to any of those and

254
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:38.580
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

255
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.070
Nicole Bacon: And with this self sabotage. It's like

256
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:55.200
Nicole Bacon: When I'm told to do something. I don't want to not do it. Even when I tell myself sometimes.

257
00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:11.220
Nicole Bacon: And it's, um, this skin issue has like really affect you may self confidence. So it's like all like kind of

258
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:14.460
Nicole Bacon: Combined

259
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:20.070
Nicole Bacon: Together with oh I'm not getting anything done but

260
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:28.260
Nicole Bacon: I don't want to go get stuff out in public, cuz I'm embarrassed about me skin and it's just this little cycle.

261
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:29.640
Nicole Bacon: But

262
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:40.230
Nicole Bacon: Breaking out of being self conscious about my skin because, I mean, what am I, I don't want to be a shut in high maintenance.

263
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what's out there for you in the world. You don't want to be a shut in what's out there for you.

264
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.240
Nicole Bacon: Um,

265
00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.820
Nicole Bacon: I'm just embarrassed about my skin right now because it looks horrible.

266
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Has someone said that to you, or is that

267
00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.150
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, my, my grandma has

268
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.700
Nicole Bacon: Told me to put makeup on. Since I was like in middle school.

269
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.550
Nicole Bacon: And she'd like point out pimples and stuff. So I guess I still have some of that.

270
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's kind of a painful thing to hear from a grandma.

271
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.820
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, biggest booty.

272
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you know, I noticed ground wasn't included in your list of quality figures.

273
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.650
Nicole Bacon: No, no, she's a pity me of

274
00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:51.660
Nicole Bacon: Everything I mean I love her, but like she's trained herself to be really fearful really judgmental really scared.

275
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:57.630
Nicole Bacon: All the things I not don't doesn't feel good to be around.

276
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: People that are scared often lash out and they take out all that fear and in right and it affects you and other people

277
00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.850
Nicole Bacon: And I found that also

278
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.170
Nicole Bacon: Some people try to

279
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:25.680
Nicole Bacon: They when they're fearful, they tried to control. It's a lot of trying to control people i i i realized that

280
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.710
Nicole Bacon: A couple days ago with my parents.

281
00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.680
Nicole Bacon: I hadn't really realized that about my dad, but I'm like oh

282
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a story.

283
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:37.980
Nicole Bacon: So my dad.

284
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:41.160
Nicole Bacon: I needed to pay

285
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:50.610
Nicole Bacon: The last booth rent for the salon and my dad gave me $300 right and

286
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.920
Nicole Bacon: He's like, did you get a receipt you get a receipt and

287
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:04.530
Nicole Bacon: Just kind of like scared like climbing over and over again. And I'm like data that I got it, like, whoa.

288
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:13.500
Nicole Bacon: Cuz that's triggering and I told him dead. Please don't call me over and over again. So it felt good to stand up for myself and put that boundary

289
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:14.460
Okay.

290
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back to help

291
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: He's been controlling or do you see the logic and reason and what he's doing.

292
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:39.900
Nicole Bacon: I see, I see it but but it's a fear. It's a fear it. I feel it as fear when he, when he's calling over and over again. And I feel it in my body is fear.

293
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.750
Nicole Bacon: That he's sending me and so yeah i get i don't want to feel that

294
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, his fear it.

295
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.170
Nicole Bacon: And you feel. Yeah.

296
00:36:54.510 --> 00:37:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you said it before, with Barbies text texting back and back like that's the second time you've said that

297
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know of anyone

298
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.080
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, it's a big pet peeve of mine.

299
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We've called it a trigger before

300
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:19.620
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, like, I mean that I feel like if required, over and over again, that's like an emergency like somebody like hurt or something like

301
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:34.560
Nicole Bacon: It's almost like, to me, people. It's like crying wolf type of thing. It's like oh my gosh this is everyone when I call back when somebody does that. I'm like, I think it's okay like oh yeah I'm just trying to get hold of you. My

302
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.290
Nicole Bacon: Wow, kind of obsessive there.

303
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, it seems over reactive

304
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.670
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, and boundaries to like

305
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.850
Nicole Bacon: I get if it's like

306
00:37:51.930 --> 00:38:00.840
Nicole Bacon: Okay, you're, you know, like my Dad's going to the grocery store and I know he's going to get groceries and oh, did I want

307
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:06.030
Nicole Bacon: This thing or that thing. Like, I get it, but I just I

308
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.380
Nicole Bacon: Um,

309
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.500
Nicole Bacon: Yeah I don't get that white people do that.

310
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.560
Okay.

311
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it your assessment that

312
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: they've always done that, that different types of people do that, that it's based on context here.

313
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.550
Nicole Bacon: It could be contacts. It could be type of person that

314
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.820
Nicole Bacon: Is not too familiar with boundaries, I guess.

315
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:38.760
Okay.

316
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your dad's sounds more like he's worried about whether you spent the money on something you know you didn't agree on.

317
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.640
Right.

318
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that typically his disposition to miss trust you and that's no time. Okay, so it's it's a temporary passing thing.

319
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be right, trying to help.

320
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.910
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, and I communicated with him about what's going on and

321
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:15.990
Nicole Bacon: I just think he he thought the worse and

322
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.620
Nicole Bacon: I, I, I don't like feeling

323
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:38.010
Nicole Bacon: That emotion projected at me. That's one of the major things like I put so much space in between me, my parents, the fear and the worry projected at me. It hurts physically I it hurts me

324
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:50.490
Nicole Bacon: I don't know, being an only child. It's like I'm just really sensitive to them. I'm really in tune with

325
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.490
Nicole Bacon: Their energy and yeah when it's projected at me. I guess a

326
00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.470
Nicole Bacon: But I communicated to him about what's going on and everything's fine.

327
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know boundaries go both ways.

328
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:05.970
You know that. Yeah.

329
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering how yours. Let's say there's are invasive and there's just all this energy coming at you.

330
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how to mechanized what to do, aside from avoidance right now, picking up the phone.

331
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: assertive communication which you did, and you're proud of yourself for saying, hey, these, these back to back, things are not interpreted the way you think they are.

332
00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. But there's another thing that you can do.

333
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You can change the filter. You can change the interpretation or do zero interpretation.

334
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So an interesting thing, right. You say they're projecting it. It's this sort of that's bad.

335
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: They're doing that and you see it every time. And every time. There it is. There it is again they're doing this thing. I don't like Why did they do this thing. It hurts me, why are they doing it.

336
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can decide to stop interpreting

337
00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: It's freeing

338
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:28.650
Nicole Bacon: I feel like I did that with the with Barbie because we had the conversation of

339
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.820
Nicole Bacon: There was a miscommunication that happened and

340
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:45.660
Nicole Bacon: Now we don't talk until the evening and I flipped it in my head as excitement instead of anxiety about it.

341
00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:47.730
There we go.

342
00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is a little different. Okay, that's how it feels in you. That's like my body that

343
00:41:55.830 --> 00:42:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: gut wrenching experience or tightness here i can i can interpret right because excitement and fear experienced the same way. Oftentimes, and so we can label it differently. That's a real skill and it can work for you.

344
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But there's something about being an intelligent insightful woman that can be a bit inconvenient.

345
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.280
Yeah.

346
00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.830
Nicole Bacon: That definitely

347
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

348
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:24.480
Nicole Bacon: Right, I'm like, oh, can I go back to being a little more naive. I'm a little happier than

349
00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and that's what you can do.

350
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You the obligation to interpret and allies is a choice. You can start to take things people do and say at face value, and let them work it out.

351
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me I'll be an example right out here all analyze myself.

352
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You just it's enough for you to just reflect on your own preferences, your own needs your own once they change.

353
00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And there's new vulnerabilities and all look come tired undefeated. Oh, nope. Now I'm inspired I'm here, I'm right here. I'm okay. But you don't have to take care of them emotionally no have to do the analysis for them.

354
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And what

355
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:15.750
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

356
00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you do or what's going on.

357
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.880
Nicole Bacon: It's hard for me not to start analyzing

358
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought so.

359
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:24.810
Yeah.

360
00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I gotta tell you, it takes no one boy. Let me tell you my turning this this awareness off right I see patterns, all the time. I see.

361
00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, with a pattern. So guess what if there's a pattern. Well, it's probably going to happen again just like it just did.

362
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right so seeing patterns all over the place and habituation and look at that reinforce it. Now, that's, that's not going to go anywhere, anytime soon. Right. I can't not do that. But I can

363
00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit with the fact that

364
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: not my job to control it, change it. I just tether very quickly to do. I like this. My. Okay, what's my preference right now. What's my need turning the attention away from this is catastrophic. How could they be doing it again. Right. That's a neural network. Instead, it's just

365
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I did it again. I started analyzing I feel it. I feel it in my chest. I feel it in my shoulders. Let me be present without let me get back into my body may be here again, let me be okay let me be in this relaxed body again that I can do.

366
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.730
I can do that can be

367
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:40.230
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

368
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: No one's saying your, your aptitude, because we do, we're going to see things very quickly. It's what we then do

369
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.850
Nicole Bacon: With that information. Right. Yeah.

370
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'm inviting is you can choose not

371
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: To do all this interpretation to do

372
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: What really you've gotten quite adept at doing it and probably for for adaptive reasons, but you might be over adaptive, you might have really cultivated this skill name, it's time to cultivate another one.

373
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.150
Nicole Bacon: Yeah. Yes. And

374
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:35.310
Nicole Bacon: I think that finally just like Bridget in my head about being able to switch the lens and and bring it back on myself in relation to because for years. I'm like, I'm so sensitive. How do I tone it down and

375
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:43.620
Nicole Bacon: I think that just helped it click in my head of how to bridge all that and it's just

376
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:54.120
Nicole Bacon: Goes back to myself and and not going too deep in like was this person mean by way we go to, you know, like

377
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.510
Nicole Bacon: And realizing that

378
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:14.940
Nicole Bacon: people's perspectives are completely different. And maybe they don't have that capacity to even know what the frickin talking about if I even start to analyze like it um it yeah and then it can help me.

379
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.090
Nicole Bacon: not waste time and energy and my, you know, just

380
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:28.770
Nicole Bacon: I think that's healthy right now, you know, getting bounces like not getting too deep into anything

381
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.070
Nicole Bacon: Too. Yeah, but yeah.

382
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's neat that you found that that awareness, because it's pretty common for for folks like you to not only be told, You're too sensitive, but to label yourself that too because it feels like too sensitive because you feel everything

383
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So intensely so you you have that skill and you probably can about having this for a reason, we typically do things because it's

384
00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: In self preservation. It has kept us safe, it has it has served us, but you've got that one figured out, you're not going to become an insensitive turd.

385
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to be a bad friend that's going to happen. Okay, you've got that empathetic thing. And yet, it's not going anywhere. You can you can turn that kindness.

386
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Inward right oh you know how to really see here someone else you can do all that. Oh, it's this time to really turn it towards the self really this is long, long, long overdue.

387
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.130
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

388
00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's review where

389
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Our next appointment I only had two written down actually must have put this together with

390
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Our first meeting.

391
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I have put away.

392
00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, I have these written down. I have February 11 to 12 and then I have February 13 at 12 and you haven't gone to a group yet. I've noticed

393
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:13.320
Nicole Bacon: At 12 and yep yep

394
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Now the lab situation, the drug screen is it resolved.

395
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, and just remind me, which day you went and did it.

396
00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.720
Nicole Bacon: Before I met you on

397
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:31.380
Nicole Bacon: Tuesday.

398
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, we're okay. Okay, so, um,

399
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'd like you to do is

400
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I'll let I'll let I'll let this week go okay let's reconnect. Let's get next week, spot on. Okay.

401
00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:54.030
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

402
00:48:54.270 --> 00:49:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no reason for you to not make it to your group. And I think you were liking Monday at one right

403
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.360
Nicole Bacon: Yes. That works.

404
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.490
Nicole Bacon: Monday at one. Yep. Yep.

405
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.460
Nicole Bacon: So I make sure I have all these in my okay

406
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have Monday one to to to to to to to to to Tuesday at 12 as well as Thursday at 12

407
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yay. Yeah, so

408
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.100
Nicole Bacon: The same pains.

409
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And so, Natalie should be able to continue forward for a while because I think you wanted some predictability there, right.

410
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.810
Nicole Bacon: Yes. Yes, definitely.

411
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's your takeaway today. What's important for you. What do you, what did you notice about yourself. What's important to you.

412
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:55.890
Nicole Bacon: Just turning the focus this way. Yeah, you know, because

413
00:49:58.290 --> 00:49:58.860
Nicole Bacon: Um,

414
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:11.430
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I've been focusing on too much external and then that, you know, it shows because I haven't been taking care of myself as, as well as I wanted to. And even just

415
00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.190
Nicole Bacon: Saying that in my head.

416
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:21.330
Nicole Bacon: I can feel my energy flowing different you know it's kind of like more of a building up instead of a

417
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:22.890
Nicole Bacon: I don't know.

418
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.630
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

419
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:25.890
Okay.

420
00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So if anything changes. And you notice yourself spending a lot of time in the thought romanticizing something around that addictive behavior just reach out, send me a quick text a little stress signal some kind. And hey,

421
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a lot. I can do via texting. But I will say, hey, are you able to meet in zoom and let's see if we can de escalate what's going on. Or I might remind you of some, some of the skills that you've already told me that are working
