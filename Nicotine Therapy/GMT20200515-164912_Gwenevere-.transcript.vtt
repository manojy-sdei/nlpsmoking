00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I was saying hi

2
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.630
Nicole Roybal: On the audio.

3
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What kind of a day. You haven't

4
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.700
Nicole Roybal: Not that long. Yeah.

5
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're not awake for a long

6
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:57.120
Nicole Roybal: Time. Ever since this whole I know even I haven't been quarantined like that like everything just started. I've been like so easy that I don't want to get up in the morning. It's weird because I know I don't really have much to do besides go to grandma's me right well

7
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: How would you feel about starting to set some goals that are more

8
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Invested in school and in work maybe resume concepts things that have to do with kind of getting back in the world because we've got time, right, because we're kind of

9
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Still on pause. So there's time and there's no real intense pressure. Nobody's saying, Hey, you got to go do this. So it's kind of

10
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.320
Nicole Roybal: My resume is already up to date and everything and just working. The only thing about

11
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.580
Nicole Roybal: working right now or just period is like I feel like everyone's going to continue to have to wear the facemask for a long time.

12
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:50.460
Nicole Roybal: And I can't, I can't work with that stupid math a little crazy. I go into the store for 10 minutes and I am like drenched my face is drenched in sweat. I cannot handle it. I don't know how the workers do it.

13
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.850
Nicole Roybal: I can't. I hate being hot. I can't stand being high, where can I get high.

14
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just be let's just see how real that is are you telling me that

15
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: If your parents kicked you out of the house and Daniel is not in your life, you wouldn't get it done.

16
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.460
Nicole Roybal: I guess I would have to but

17
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:40.050
Nicole Roybal: I know like the resources that are helping me with money right now it's just like my grandma because money for helping her out and stuff, you know, but I'm okay with money, but I don't have like money to where I could like afford my own living expenses.

18
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so just right there just noticed that. What I did was say let's talk about the future for a minute as play around with you know that that imagery that you wrote out, you know, there's the left side kind of what's present. And then there's the right side kind of what you want.

19
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you kind of put a mask over the whole thing.

20
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And that mask really

21
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: is secondary to setting. Yeah, so you don't know that. I don't know that I heard you. But what if that's just an excuse to not

22
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Get back into your life. What if I'm on Gabba pen is an excuse or what if I want to drink is an excuse. I'm just throwing it out there just in case something like that might be happening. What do you think's really going on.

23
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.430
Nicole Roybal: About drinking because anytime I have worked a dream and a

24
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.570
Nicole Roybal: Man dial actually talking about that last night you like I'm

25
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.320
Nicole Roybal: Over

26
00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:02.520
Nicole Roybal: I was jungle with her all the time, I was just talking to people. And so I wasn't able I do so timid and shy. If I wasn't drinking, I'd be so scared to go to the customers and ask them if they want to sample.

27
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:14.400
Nicole Roybal: I would just let them continue but when I was drinking. Oh, I'd be all over one example. One example, not caring about people and just like because the job is to interrupt. People like kind of that's what they told us.

28
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.900
Nicole Roybal: Right. Like it doesn't matter if you're in the middle of conversation go up and try to get the sale, but um

29
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.360
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. And I think because of that. And then any job after that anytime I have to interact with people. I felt that

30
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.510
Nicole Roybal: I was scared of who my silver self was there is

31
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.380
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I

32
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.410
Nicole Roybal: Need to drink. So I guess that is a major factor in the working again. I'm afraid of feeling you might need to

33
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay right there. Let's rewind and go into

34
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The job.

35
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a sample server.

36
00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: demanded that you be very friendly that you overcome, which means ignore the fact that people really don't want to be interrupted. I know when I'm shopping. If I wanted a sample, I would go over so

37
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's not the right job for you. Maybe it's not this big head trip. Maybe it's just not the right job for you. And in order to do it. You have to be trunk. Do you see it's not the alcohol. It's the fact that it wasn't the right job fit.

38
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.800
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, but I did the same thing when I worked when I was doing the medical assistant thing I was working at a kidney specialist and to

39
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:39.330
Nicole Roybal: Not be nervous and not like because they said I was too insecure and I apologize. The time I make the smallest mistake and

40
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:49.140
Nicole Roybal: There was just like on me about little things. So I was like, oh my god, I have to change my personality. I have to be this person that they want me to be so like we get really nervous and I didn't drink and then

41
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.820
Nicole Roybal: Okay, and then I'd be talking too much and then that was bad.

42
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but

43
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicole, we're, we're, we picked up on that in therapy, we were

44
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We talked about it. It's not ignored. It's getting addressed in here.

45
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: We're normally at a workplace. They might say, oh, that's Nicole, she just apologizes a lot or

46
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Your boyfriend might say, just stop right but that's not what we're doing in here. We're really slowing down and we're trying to take a look at

47
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What those apologies. We're doing for you it's it's not acceptable to just call you summarily a word like insecure. I don't, I don't see that I see that those apologies. We're keeping

48
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The peace, you learn to do that very early on, it keeps people from arguing and I think you learned it. And now you just do it loose as much as you breathe.

49
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just automatic. You don't even think about it.

50
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because someone calls you insecure doesn't make it true.

51
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's. Why don't we

52
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we take off where we left off last time.

53
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: We were doing something kind of big and it had a lot to do with all the things you just mentioned, believe it or not, there is connection to it.

54
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Because of course it has to do with you and how you see yourself what you believe in, are your core beliefs. Did you spend any more time after we had met kind of sitting with it and thinking about a little bit more

55
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe not.

56
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.140
Nicole Roybal: Every time we have therapy. I'm talking about what we talked about

57
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.670
Nicole Roybal: The rest of the day. But honestly, right now, I cannot

58
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.930
Nicole Roybal: Me what we talked about last time written down.

59
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Notes in front of me. So

60
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:02.340
Nicole Roybal: Okay, yeah.

61
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I've got some notes here. So let's see, um,

62
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You had woken up 30 minutes ago. I've taken care of. I haven't taken care of Pena Penton

63
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: spent three hours on the phone. Okay, so

64
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, broken

65
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: After grip on Tuesday and towards the end, real life. Daniel only love me for my looks. I wanted to ask him a question to love me for my looks are who or who I am. And so then we went, we went into was exploring. Who are you, I said, Well who are you then do you know yourself.

66
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to really ask someone

67
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Do they love you for who you are. Do you even know who you are. So that was kind of that was a big conversation, it's an important one.

68
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.550
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, actually.

69
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.600
Nicole Roybal: Last week okay yeah that was the week before

70
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:13.740
Nicole Roybal: But yeah, I did end up having that conversation with him and he said that he does love me for a lot of things about me like it's all my trades when I'm sober and so that he didn't like my traits when I was drinking and that's what made him fall in love with me with my silver so

71
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is that what is he like

72
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:26.670
Nicole Roybal: I remember exactly the words. And I want to ask me to repeat them. Can you again because I can't remember, but I don't. He said, just like that. I'm carrying that I listen to him. I'm

73
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:41.820
Nicole Roybal: Usually there for him when I'm not the one I'm not drinking. I usually well I don't know I always had a job when I was drinking, but he said that I would help them out like financially and stuff to sober like I'm more like

74
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.880
Nicole Roybal: Like wanting to do it can be a little more smarter, more comprehensive

75
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.300
Nicole Roybal: Okay, nicer about it.

76
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So caring

77
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.000
Nicole Roybal: And

78
00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You're a good listener you're financially reliable you he can rely on you to follow through. If you make a commitment about paying a certain bill you'll follow through. You'll keep that commitment.

79
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. It's nice. What was it like

80
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:20.700
Nicole Roybal: About me lately. NOW, I'VE BEEN SOBER continuously. You know, I noticed a lot more things that he likes about me now.

81
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.220
Nicole Roybal: That you didn't know before so

82
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this encouraging or discouraging for you to hear these things that he he likes about you.

83
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.130
Nicole Roybal: Encouraging actually

84
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.040
Nicole Roybal: Really good. And like just

85
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.270
Nicole Roybal: Push me like this. Remember, stay sober.

86
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.920
Nicole Roybal: You know, it's always in the back of my mind.

87
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:51.930
Right.

88
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So one of the reasons why if you take away this this notion of

89
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's stick with this topic. Let's stay here.

90
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.100
Nicole Roybal: And really

91
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Really do a thorough job of investigating it

92
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just see some of the things that you said that you kind of

93
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Endorse which means you kind of like the words you saw as core values that you see in yourself. Okay. Some of them were

94
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Clever, the core values are patient's family job.

95
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, those are mine.

96
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think you saw me. I am outgoing. There we go. Did you write this down. Outgoing

97
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of energy.

98
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

99
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Blunt

100
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: About certain topics course believe, other people can be better and change.

101
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there more that you can think of without pulling up a list there really, it's likely that you've been that way since you were a little girl and

102
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.210
Nicole Roybal: I really

103
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.400
Nicole Roybal: Are you cut out when you're saying something little girl.

104
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let's pull away for a moment from

105
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm trying to get you to focus on is less about you didn't do anything wrong.

106
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Less on what you value.

107
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: More on who you are more focus on. Who are you,

108
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to get a piece of paper. This, this might help hold on a second.

109
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: might end up doing this activity in groups someday, but for now we can just do this together.

110
00:13:43.980 --> 00:14:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: 1234 kind of looks like like that I've done these targets before these circles. So see if you can write in the middle of the page. Do a circle, not too small, but it's going to have the word perception in it but but make it come try and take up the whole page. If you can

111
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.300
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, we

112
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Got this one.

113
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.970
Nicole Roybal: Cool thing and active coping or

114
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It happens to be circles, but it has nothing to do with that.

115
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.820
Okay.

116
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Trying to take up the whole page and you'll have

117
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: 1234 lines.

118
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so let's do

119
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: redraw it so that you can see. Let's do this first one.

120
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this together. I think the very center will wait on that one. Just a little bit. Let's do this doughnut one this one that first ring.

121
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this one here. We're going to hold off on the center. We're not going to do that one just yet. We're just going to do this one. I want you to label that one how I want to be perceived

122
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And leave for a minute. You can write in there. But that's how you're going to label it. So this is how I'm doing it, I'm labeling it kind of like, right on the edge of it.

123
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll show you like I'm labeling that like like the edge of how I want to be perceived and then I'll be able to write some words in there.

124
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.700
Nicole Roybal: But okay.

125
00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:05.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever.

126
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a graded assignments.

127
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside of that,

128
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's label that one kind of the way I did like right up next to the line.

129
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This will be labeled

130
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to leave that last one in the outside empty for a minute.

131
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's let's put some

132
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put some words in these two that we have so far. Once you to look at that title of that first donut how I want to be perceived once you write some words in there.

133
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This one in here. This first donut.

134
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how I want it. I'm going to do it with you. Okay, try not to filter too much.

135
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: How I want to be perceived

136
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

137
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it with you. So I'll share mine.

138
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.830
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I got you. Okay, gotcha.

139
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.430
Yeah.

140
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a good refresher.

141
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: A few words for that first one

142
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:58.560
Nicole Roybal: I put responsible, respectful happy, confident, not a pushover offset the sugar.

143
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.200
Nicole Roybal: Content fulfilled respect. Respect myself.

144
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just make sure that what you have in there is how you want to be seen perceived how you want the outside world to view you. Yeah, yeah. Okay, great. So I put you didn't even need my example. You did such a great job. But let's play with on what was that one. Not a pushover.

145
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm words like I can't tell what it is because I can't tell if someone's not a pushover because they are wise, they're assertive, they're confident. I can't quite tell when someone is a pushover.

146
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What are they missing.

147
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:56.550
Nicole Roybal: Like

148
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.880
Nicole Roybal: Like

149
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:09.480
Nicole Roybal: Like more like like you can't step all over me and like, like if you told me to do something. I'm not going to be like that. You say, jump on I'm gonna be like, how high

150
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.700
Nicole Roybal: Up all over me.

151
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.290
Right.

152
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you know that has that

153
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:34.800
Nicole Roybal: I used to be that way before. I used to be really quiet and i was i wasn't always loud with my voice. I was always really quiet and everyone was over, talk to me.

154
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:47.610
Nicole Roybal: And I will literally be talking everyone to start talking. And I'm like, What the hell, like no one listens to me. So I really wanted my words to be validated. So I started yelling like talking loudly and

155
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:55.170
Nicole Roybal: But before that no one would pay attention to me and I just feel like everyone just walk all over me, Nikki, go do this, you will do this.

156
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

157
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. So there is some words, let's try these on. So there's passive, which means

158
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't assert and speak up for what you want. So the opposite of passive is I believe it is assertive where you'll assert they'll ask for what you want, you'll share your opinion, is that possible, that is assertive, let's, let's take a look at that definition, see if you like it.

159
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.520
Nicole Roybal: I see what the web that word.

160
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I

161
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.240
Nicole Roybal: Think that might actually make more sense.

162
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, let's take a look at it. Let's let me see what else synonyms. They've got here for that one. See if you like it.

163
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: They've got I'm

164
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Confident forceful self confident positive bold decisive, that means once you make up your mind. That's it. You're going to go for it, assured self assured self possessed.

165
00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Self assertive authoritative strong willed insistent firm determined commanding bullish dominant. That seems a bit strong

166
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, those don't seem to I wouldn't have put those in there but domineering, I wouldn't have put assaulted but feisty. That's a cute word pushy.

167
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Push full never even heard of it that phrase before, but you get the idea. Is there anything kind of you like

168
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.340
Nicole Roybal: Like self confidence, self assertive.

169
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so write those in there because that's how you want to be seen.

170
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to take a second and see if you included

171
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: How you want to be seen.

172
00:23:55.650 --> 00:24:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that makes sure that there's no conflict that stuff that you do right that giggle that, see, see if there's something that that serves. See if that does something for how people view you

173
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can't come up with it will come back to it, see if you can figure out what it is you want people to see about you and how you pull that off is with the giggle.

174
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing, nothing. What

175
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Friendly friendly. Okay. You want to be viewed as friendly. Do you think when you

176
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.330
Nicole Roybal: People think I'm being rude and my statements. That's why I laugh I can

177
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Write it down. But friendly.

178
00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see what happens. We're not going to do analysis of it. We're just going to move to the next one. As soon as your. Do you think that's a pretty good list the one you've got so far.

179
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:04.560
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

180
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's go to the next one, which is

181
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What I think

182
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Of me

183
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Put it all in there.

184
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: All the words of what you think of you try not to censor it or edit it.

185
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm not already. I don't like this list of all

186
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: The words I'm writing down

187
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know how to spell.

188
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That word look up that one.

189
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me know if you need anything, looked up.

190
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: See

191
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: May not get through this whole activity today, but that's okay, right.

192
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of a big one.

193
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.070
Yeah.

194
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.650
Nicole Roybal: I found out my little sister.

195
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.860
Nicole Roybal: My baby sister.

196
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: How old is she,

197
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.840
Nicole Roybal: She's 21

198
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

199
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.240
Nicole Roybal: Here's my little sister. So I'm like,

200
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.590
Nicole Roybal: Writing down spirit. Yeah.

201
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel like you've got some stuff in there.

202
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:09.750
Might be

203
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, I noticed as I was talking with you and looking up that word I added I added some more to it so you can as they come up. You may go back in and and put more words, let's go to that outer ring and this one.

204
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's label it authentic self.

205
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's define that a little bit. Let's define it in a sense that it is the

206
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The unchanging you the you that

207
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You were born, the you that is sort of this spiritual being in a physical body, it's you.

208
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can. So call it authentic self. And you probably will recognize it by going back and remembering

209
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Who you were when you were four and five years old.

210
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of describe that little girl. See if you can write down some words. Try not to overanalyze it could let the let this exercise, do the work for us.

211
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.420
Nicole Roybal: Remember anything from that, you know,

212
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay well as far back as you can before. So the key is to do it before you turned about seven because at about seven we start comparing ourselves to other people.

213
00:31:44.550 --> 00:32:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: If I said in the classroom when you were five Hey everybody who's the smartest in the class, all of you guys would raise your hand. Could you all feel smart and then you realize, who's the smart one in the class. I said, Who's, who's the strongest one.

214
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's Joey It's Joey It Sarah. Sarah super so she's strong

215
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: They start to compare

216
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to catch that age before you did that.

217
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how early, you were saying that you were kind of quiet.

218
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:22.740
And shy.

219
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That again.

220
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:26.490
Yeah.

221
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.580
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, cool.

222
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so go keep going back let your mind, try. It's going to be a bit of a challenge you, you have adjusted. A lot of marijuana. It's messing with your memory.

223
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of keeps pruning things. But let's try. Okay. Alcohol didn't help either. So let's just see, see if you can catch some things. So just look at your page and say, well, who am I

224
00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.430
Second,

225
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, try that on when you were just doing you

226
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Not in reaction to someone else's opinion, not because someone wanted you to be something, but because that's just you.

227
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How many words.

228
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:30.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a few

229
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.310
Yeah.

230
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.670
Nicole Roybal: Like I remember like settings and everything. I'm just

231
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.650
Nicole Roybal: Like

232
00:35:44.310 --> 00:36:00.330
Nicole Roybal: Like story like experiences like so that actually happened like like remember the classrooms. I remember exactly how they look how setup. I can think of like any thing that happened to say like, okay, so I'll tell you the word I did get I got good friends because I've always like

233
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:07.800
Nicole Roybal: Okay, this one nice energetic opinionated and I feel like I was at the shoulder.

234
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:09.030
Oh,

235
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

236
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So nice high energy opinionated, but a pushover.

237
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:19.080
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

238
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And those were all the authentic self right when you were just little yeah okay

239
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more. A little bit about

240
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: How you distinguish on one hand, you were opinionated and, on the other hand,

241
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You were a pushover.

242
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.670
Nicole Roybal: And I knew those are going to contradict themselves.

243
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.930
Nicole Roybal: loud, loud.

244
00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:02.700
Nicole Roybal: My friend, like, you know, when the kids. Yes, or rent around and you're just like loud like that, you know, um,

245
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:17.190
Nicole Roybal: I guess I feel like my life with my mom and like my family. I was more like. When I was kid have more opinionated, like I tell them

246
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:24.030
Nicole Roybal: how I felt about the situation but like with my friends, I wouldn't. My friends, I will just be like, be quiet.

247
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Even even very

248
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Each age five even age five, you are shy.

249
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:34.650
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

250
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's distinguish

251
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.720
Nicole Roybal: My friends,

252
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.020
Nicole Roybal: Not be my friends.

253
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.120
Nicole Roybal: Stay quiet and even at that age. I did that because I

254
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.480
Nicole Roybal: Didn't want to lose my friends.

255
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so look at the word push over again. So notice

256
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: It's almost like so if I'm a pushover.

257
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because of something that existed before that. So let's see what comes before that so pushovers almost the effect

258
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Of who you are. So what's under what is it that you are. It makes being a pushover possible. So because you're a blah, blah, blah. You are a pushover.

259
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.980
Nicole Roybal: OK, so the word opinionated. Maybe I shouldn't have put that in authentic self.

260
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you did well wait, don't, don't take it out because we're different with different people.

261
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm not sure. You want to take it out. Yeah. Because if when you were with mom and dad when you were little. And you would say, Hey, you know, that's fine. Give me that. I don't like that. If that's where you how you were in your home. Then you want to stick with it.

262
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.330
Nicole Roybal: Report like this.

263
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture at school. So, picture, right, go ahead.

264
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:15.570
Nicole Roybal: With my friends at school and other people would have opinions. I guess I would kind of just like if my opinion, if I had my own opinion and it didn't.

265
00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:28.500
Nicole Roybal: Line up with. There's, I guess I would just kind of just let their opinion, be the opinion and mine, doesn't matter because I don't want them. I don't want to start a fight over something. I don't know. Maybe I'm just trying to like put it together right now.

266
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, exactly. Think

267
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.940
Nicole Roybal: I love their opinion.

268
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.390
Nicole Roybal: Mine or what they thought I

269
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.860
Nicole Roybal: So,

270
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

271
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just see something. I wonder if pushover belong to me now.

272
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering

273
00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if push over

274
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering if push over belongs in a different donut. Look at the labels again.

275
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: See if it belongs

276
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now there's there's another one that we haven't labeled by the way and it's in the middle.

277
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's how other people see you

278
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's perception, so you

279
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You may end up wanting to put something in there too, which we haven't done that one yet. It's that one is perception meaning. That's how you are perceived. So I'm going to put perceived by others because then I'll remember the label better

280
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wondering, where do you think now that you know that that's there. Do you think that push over

281
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Is how you wanted other people to see you.

282
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you did you want to be seen as were you seen as, in fact, and that would be the center where you seen as a pushover.

283
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.260
Nicole Roybal: I feel like yeah I don't want, I never wanted to be a pushover. I feel like I won.

284
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So that would, it would go in the middle, push over in the middle. It sounds like what you wanted was friends.

285
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll just leave that like that. So maybe push over it really goes in there. And let's take out

286
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I don't know that that's really you you see it. You got to be really careful about

287
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that really you

288
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: a pushover or

289
00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you see a picture when you were with your friends and you saw friends you liked

290
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you wanted to keep them.

291
00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Who are you as a five year old around those other kids.

292
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: At home, you might be

293
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

294
00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:24.240
Nicole Roybal: I don't like I think I always went off of what people told me I am so when I'm kind of

295
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.030
Nicole Roybal: I can't I'm used to people.

296
00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Well, that's what this exercise does it pulls the layers away, it pulls them away. Right. That's what we're doing. So

297
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: How about all share. I'll share with you mine and you'll get a sense I just did it myself. Okay.

298
00:42:46.140 --> 00:43:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think, I think my authentic self is because I got a picture of me as a little person right I think attention seeking affectionate needy sensitive

299
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Cautious

300
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I put uncertain and scared together.

301
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncertain scared bossy.

302
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I was bossy, because I could picture myself in gameplay. I was always like I always knew like as a boss everybody around, right, like I know what to do. I'm still doing it.

303
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And I put playful I wherever I can find play when a crack a joke. Um,

304
00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I forgot. Um,

305
00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's not really young.

306
00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I think that's good. So notice my words, they're not necessarily great are they, they're not like I don't even like a lot of them. I don't really like attention seeking not thrilled with that.

307
00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: needy. I don't like seeing that but i think i was i think i know there's various reasons why I might have been that way but there it is.

308
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Sensitive I was aware of my surroundings. I could feel at a very early age. Other people's feelings. I was empathetic. I was sensitive to my environment.

309
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:28.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's who I am. I think today. It makes it possible for me to pick up on really subtle things with people to get makes me a good therapist. I think without it. I would suck.

310
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I do

311
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm now. What do you think of your own what

312
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Say it again.

313
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:52.170
Nicole Roybal: I added to my authentic self. When I heard you say that because that I forgot about that word. Yeah, there's a different way than you meant I meant more sensitive to like

314
00:44:53.610 --> 00:45:00.630
Nicole Roybal: Like my own feelings like I would get my feelings hurt real easily, but I think people would say, and I'm still like that. I still very sensitive

315
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So keep it.

316
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: There because I don't know that there. I might use this, it goes both ways. It means I'm going to feel my feelings deeply

317
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I might even be able to feel your feelings deeply. So, um, and it's funny, I would. I don't even have empathy on any of these that's kind of interesting, but I'm not going to change it. Once I've made this. I'm going to step back and I'm so, so you're noticing sensitive was added.

318
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: who you really are not having to compensate for what someone else wants not having to change because you perceive someone else's mirroring back of what they want none of it. This is just you.

319
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we do a compare and contrast so I use the word attention seeking Did anything come up for you around that.

320
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:11.760
Nicole Roybal: Depends. But like, I'm not sure exactly like it's like half and half. Like I would seek attention by the same time, I wouldn't, I wouldn't like it wasn't ever like

321
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:21.270
Nicole Roybal: Wanting to be the center of attention. Like I never wanted like that. But I did want that when I was older, I keep going back to

322
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.320
Nicole Roybal: When I was

323
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.200
Nicole Roybal: Quiet and I started to be loud, going back to that.

324
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Can Can you picture maybe being little and seeing a parent.

325
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Around you like as early as you can. Maybe she or he was, you know, preparing food. They were busy doing something, or maybe they were helping you. Maybe they were transporting you in a car. Can you picture any of that being interacting with them when you were little.

326
00:46:53.070 --> 00:47:02.820
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I think I have so many brothers and sisters that I would just get like Lost in the mix. So I never

327
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:10.140
Nicole Roybal: Had attention on me because attention was on everyone like any and everyone else.

328
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:17.220
Nicole Roybal: I've always told my parents and I told you this to, like, I've always felt like since I'm the middle child. I never got as much attention.

329
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I don't think I

330
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.800
Nicole Roybal: would seek the attention, but I wouldn't get it so

331
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a word out there for that.

332
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There's this thing.

333
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an ambivalence. It's like it's it's it contributes to this thing called reactive attachment, which means we long for it, but we don't trust it. We long for it. But will it be there. We long for it. But will it be there.

334
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's this well I want it, but it won't be there for me.

335
00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You see that does that start to get closer to the experience

336
00:47:59.160 --> 00:47:59.970
Nicole Roybal: No matter how I learned

337
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Am

338
00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: ambivalent right ambivalent. Um, let's see if there's a less fancy one that's pretty complicated to. Let's see.

339
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Miss trusting but but maybe maybe who you naturally are is notice that I went I wrote the word needy and it's that same thing you just did mind feels like I wrote the word needy and attention seeking

340
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's the same story you described. That's how I felt.

341
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: As in, I want this thing, but it's unavailable to me and for you. It might be. I want this thing attention, but there isn't enough to go around.

342
00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not for me it's not available to me they're getting it. Yeah.

343
00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of like that. So let me. Yeah.

344
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you, what do you think it

345
00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.540
Nicole Roybal: I think needy. Definitely.

346
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it, throw it in there. See if you like it.

347
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean

348
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.110
Nicole Roybal: I mean, I would seek the attention, but

349
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.220
Nicole Roybal: Not really in class, though, like in class. I wouldn't see

350
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:32.460
Nicole Roybal: Right, like whenever everyone raises their hand to answer the question, because they want to be. I was

351
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but but hold on, hold on, hold on.

352
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: That's in response to an environment. This outer ring, don't put anything unless it's you.

353
00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:51.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Who you it's you that you were born with not to adapt to your environment.

354
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Just you. I know when I can picture.

355
00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I I wanted something I wanted something and

356
00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I put affectionate. I know I wanted you know I had it to give, I wanted to accept it. I know I wanted cuddle snuggle. I know I wanted that kind of thing. I know I'm a snuggly kind of person. I can tell.

357
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How about you.

358
00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:24.570
Nicole Roybal: Oh yeah, definitely, but not back then I am now.

359
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What, wait, let's check. Do you think you weren't snuggly because your environment.

360
00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't there for you.

361
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you were born wanting, kind of, oh, that's a laugh. Look at that lap that labs empty, I want to hang out and want to hang out and a hug over there. Do you think naturally you are

362
00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to say. Huh.

363
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, maybe we'll come back to that.

364
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the connections pretty crappy well let's we got only a couple minutes left here.

365
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you share a little bit about what this when you look at authentic self. And then you see worse.

366
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: When I think of me.

367
00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how the words change.

368
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If they change how they change.

369
00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:33.930
Nicole Roybal: A lot more words. What I think with me.

370
00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And how about

371
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: How you want to be perceived. What about those

372
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.590
Nicole Roybal: Two.

373
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there overlaps, as in

374
00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Or the same words that are in how you want to be seen and who you are.

375
00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So the authentic self is who you are.

376
00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.440
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

377
00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And then that first full donut is

378
00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. What do you have in there for how I want to be seen and perceived

379
00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:30.720
Nothing matches side, depending. I was happy.

380
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. So you're going to add happy. You think you are your core right happy.

381
00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I like that one. I like that one, too. Me too. I'm going to put that one too.

382
00:52:50.640 --> 00:53:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, actually I better not in order for this to work. I'm not gonna, I'm not going to add. I'm just gonna leave it alone. So I noticed I had a lot more words me see 1-234-567-8912 345 1-234-567-8910 I had 10 and how I want to be seen. But the real me the outer ring was 1234567

383
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't think any of them are the same.

384
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: None of them are the same.

385
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I am attention seeking affectionate needy sensitive playful bossy and scared.

386
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And how do I want to be seen smart. I want to see be seen as a safe person non threatening. Those are kind of all the same thing, generous funny professional good mom analytical confident independent

387
00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What you put in your

388
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.870
Nicole Roybal: Room. I want to be perceived

389
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:01.470
As

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:12.120
Nicole Roybal: I responsible, respectful happy, confident, not a pushover content build respect myself.

391
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:17.820
Nicole Roybal: self confident solve assertive friendly and smart.

392
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.310
Nicole Roybal: Officer, probably, same thing.

393
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you notice a theme about how you want to be viewed in what that what you did you notice, kind of an overarching theme.

394
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.870
Nicole Roybal: Confidence.

395
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think

396
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:50.670
Nicole Roybal: I noticed confidence is here a lot. Well, not a lot, but it's on how I want to be perceived then

397
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:55.080
Nicole Roybal: When I put when I put I think of me. I put in confidence.

398
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

399
00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:57.480
Right, yeah.

400
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then out on the outer ring.

401
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any of those words out there.

402
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.390
Nicole Roybal: Well, I think of me.

403
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:10.560
Yeah.

404
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: authentic self. Do you have any that speak to this notion of confidence and then I gotta jump out of here and run a group

405
00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:42.840
Nicole Roybal: One thing just this whole exercise itself just finding things out about myself. I'm just writing them down and knowing that I do have these traits and things about me that are good. So I think that just exercise helps a lot to

406
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.710
Nicole Roybal: Help me set myself a little bit more

407
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

408
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I share my my impression of

409
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You're welcome. Um, can I share just a little quick impression of you.

410
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, quick. I don't have time. I won't go on and on about it, but I'm really intrigued that you wrote

411
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of words around looking like as in my eyes looking at you that I see you as confident. Right.

412
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:29.100
Nicole Roybal: I'm listening. Sorry, this fucking stupid.

413
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It is what alcohol was a solution for

414
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: She see that

415
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.720
Nicole Roybal: Oh, yeah.

416
00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So finding that when you know go look at authentic self again go when you go look later on when you leave here and look at it and see if you can find

417
00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Where that confidence in who you are is like really sitting with whatever those things are

418
00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: They're just right.

419
00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be confident in those pieces, not because you thinks we want you to be a particular way. That's enough. Right there. Just those pieces way on the authentic ring.

420
00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to be anything other than that. And I think when you really sit with it. The giggle will fall away the notion that you have to be anything other than who you are at a Costco at wherever

421
00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to change who you are to accommodate me us we. You don't have to, you're good enough, just the way you are.

422
00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe spending a little bit of time with that.

423
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I better. I better bounce.

424
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll see you

425
00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In a fight. Okay.
