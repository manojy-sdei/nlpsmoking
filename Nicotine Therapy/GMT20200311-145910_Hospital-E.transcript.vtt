TCL A501DL: This is where I'm at.

46
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.370
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it sounds like your counselor may not

47
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.880
Joan Kandel: Understand Suboxone very well.

48
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.950
Joan Kandel: She doesn't yeah she

49
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.940

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:37.170
Joan Kandel: Yeah, well, even the books tell us that it works and it doesn't make people high, it just stabilizes the brain. So she needs to read different books.

52
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.360
TCL A501DL: And I will tell her that

53
00:05:42.630 --> 00:06:01.260
Joan Kandel: Because it's very science based this treatment is very based in evidence and science and. And so, you know, there shouldn't be a reason for anyone to feel ashamed or stigmatized to be on this medication because it's it's it's a really good good treatment for addiction.

54
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:12.120
TCL A501DL: Yes, it is, it is in. I actually went around to different clinics within my area because I could tell you, I don't have a vehicle and

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:25.170
TCL A501DL: They want me to be there five o'clock, which the buses here don't run that early on or before five because they only take the first five people, or they have like a two month waiting list.

56
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:31.710
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Okay. So that's why, that's why you're going for this rather than going to back to a clinic.

57
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:40.740
TCL A501DL: Yes, yes, yes. So it was really hard because my, my family doesn't live in the same town. Yeah, I mean,

Joan Kandel: 10 patients.

302
00:23:52.740 --> 00:24:01.170
Joan Kandel: And and it's always the same time every week. So you'll get to know the other people in the group. It's a real good way of getting support, so that'll be really good.

303
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:06.360
Joan Kandel: And it's, there's a therapist there and a doctor there.

304
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:13.770
Joan Kandel: And so the group. I'm wondering if you can do Tuesdays at 430 in the afternoon.

305
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:26.670
Joan Kandel: Okay, good. So we'll put you in that group I'm, I'm the doctor in the group and Dominique Is the therapist in the group. And it's a very nice group, you'll meet really good people and that'll be every week.

306
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:36.450
Joan Kandel: And what you'll so that's Tuesdays at 430 what you'll do is every Tuesday, call the virtual clinic, which is the number that you called at four o'clock.

307
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:43.080
Joan Kandel: Okay, because they'll have some paperwork for you to fill out and they want you to check in early so that you're ready to start the group at 430

308
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.540
TCL A501DL: Okay, so that will be the original number. The 40408 number

309
00:24:48.570 --> 00:25:04.050
Joan Kandel: You've got it. You've got it. That's one to keep in your phone because that's the number to call. If you have any questions. If you need anything, and also every time you have any kind of appointment. That's the number to call and then they'll give you the days number to call for the group.

310
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.000
Joan Kandel: Because that changes all the time.

311
00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.130
Joan Kandel: Okay, it won't be this number.

312
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.700
Joan Kandel: That you

313
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:10.560
TCL A501DL: Okay.

314
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.520
Joan Kandel: Okay, good. And then I'm going to be

315
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.840
Joan Kandel: Putting the prescription in in the computer.

316
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:25.110
Joan Kandel: After we get off the phone here and I'm going to be prescribing this Suboxone

317
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:42.300
Joan Kandel: And I'll just keep you at 16 milligrams a day for now and it may, you know, maybe in the future we can kind of taper down on that. If you're feeling stable and people or we can leave it at 16 we probably won't go up from that. It sounds like you don't need to go up from that.

318
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.130
Joan Kandel: That's a good stable dose. Yeah.

319
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:44.850
So,

320
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:52.830
Joan Kandel: The other thing I'm going to prescribe for you is, is a naloxone Narc can do you know what that is.

321
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.840
TCL A501DL: I've got like three of them.

322
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.670
Joan Kandel: Oh, you already have three

323
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.420
TCL A501DL: Right now, yes.

324
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.100
TCL A501DL: Okay, giving them.

325
00:25:59.130 --> 00:25:59.580
Joan Kandel: Okay, good.

326
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:11.550
Joan Kandel: Yeah, we like to have everybody to have it. So I'm going to prescribe that to you if you feel like you have too many of them and don't need it. You can tell that pharmacy to just hold it until you need it. But it'll be at the pharmacy, if you need it.

327
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.030
Joan Kandel: Those are good to carry around with you everywhere, take

328
00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:20.100
Joan Kandel: It on the blast because you never know when you'll see somebody in the war zone use

329
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.180
TCL A501DL: Use

330
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.380
That right

331
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:33.240
Joan Kandel: Okay, so one thing with the groups is that will need you to have some earphones.

332
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:39.810
Joan Kandel: Just so that nobody around can can hear just so that it's a confidential space where people can talk and nobody can hear.

333
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.270
Joan Kandel: And the other thing is there's no smoking or of any kind in the group's

334
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.670
Joan Kandel: Just out of respect for everybody.

335
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:55.410
Joan Kandel: And, and I think that's it for now. We have other things, but we'll talk about them later.

336
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.450
TCL A501DL: Okay. All right.

337
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.590
And you have

338
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.250
TCL A501DL: A blue pick up the prescription

339
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.200
Joan Kandel: So I'll put it in today. So by this afternoon. They should have it ready to

340
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.100
Learn

341
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.440
TCL A501DL: Some great

342
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:11.400
Joan Kandel: Nice. Good.

343
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.330
Yeah.

344
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:32.400
Joan Kandel: Yeah, you're welcome. And so I will. So I'm going to give you enough to get through to Tuesday, you'll have a dose for Tuesday and then Tuesday afternoon, we'll see each other in the group. And then, and then you'll be able to pick it up for your Wednesday dose.

345
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:38.700
Joan Kandel: So I'll give you a week at a time. Okay. And the other thing to tell you is that they're going to be

346
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:51.090
Joan Kandel: Scheduling you for a therapy session a one on one therapy session and that's that's a requirement of the program. So you do the groups, but you also do individual and

347
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.500
Joan Kandel: So that'll be a really important appointment to keep

348
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.440
Joan Kandel: And I don't know when that is but they'll get in touch with you about it.

349
00:27:58.770 --> 00:27:59.850
TCL A501DL: Because I would love

350
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.240
Getting

351
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.070
TCL A501DL: Yes.

352
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:03.780
TCL A501DL: I need to

353
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.910
Joan Kandel: Perfect. That's what you will do

354
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.230
Joan Kandel: Good, well, that's great. Okay. Christine It's a pleasure to meet you.

355
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.070
TCL A501DL: And I'll see you on Tuesday. Okay. Have a great rest of your day.
