00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.480
tracy jackson: This off here.

73
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.100
tracy jackson: I'm guessing you can hear that echo

74
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.720
tracy jackson: Not too bad. Echo

75
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.390
SSB504R: That I heard earlier, there was a click, though. And I said to the guy. He couldn't hear it. Yeah.

76
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:30.540
tracy jackson: Sure. Okay. So I'm in the dosage, you're on the eight milligrams, is that sufficient for you. Do you feel that your cravings are controlled and

77
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.190
SSB504R: That's when to

78
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.850
SSB504R: Say no.

79
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.710
tracy jackson: Uh huh.

80
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:42.930
SSB504R: Yeah, it's maybe a pill and a half. I'll take it. I'll take one and then sometimes we'll take another half of one if I'm craving it

81
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.390
tracy jackson: Okay, and

82
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.990
tracy jackson: Have you taking

83
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:58.410
tracy jackson: One or potentially One pill in the morning and a half, two in the afternoon or one and a half pills in the morning with last do all day. No.

84
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.780
SSB504R: No one in that one and a half throughout the whole day did you have the later, they don't think

85
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.900
tracy jackson: I see. Okay, so

86
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.100
It seems to be

87
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:19.740
tracy jackson: The reason I ask is, you know, when sort of prescribing buprenorphine. You can, it's ideal if you just have to take it one today and that when those can last you the whole day rather than having to take it.

88
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.360
SSB504R: Every 12 hours right

89
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.050
SSB504R: So would it be better to take more than that. The initial those morning

90
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.300
tracy jackson: Yeah.

91
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:37.860
tracy jackson: But it seems that if you were able to take 12 milligrams and you could either try all at one time or eight in the morning and four in the afternoon that that will be enough for you to work with.

92
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:45.660
SSB504R: That's I see it seems to work best if if I do four in the afternoon is if I take 12 together. I seem to get a little, a little

93
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.470
Busy

94
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.800
tracy jackson: All right. And how about the last time you use here one

95
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.030

tracy jackson: No. Okay. Do you know what Narcan is

317
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.730
tracy jackson: The reversal medicine. Okay.

318
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.230
tracy jackson: The

319
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.740
tracy jackson: I think

320
00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:05.460
tracy jackson: Those are all the questions I have for you. Let me just make sure are you currently experiencing any withdrawal symptoms at the moment.

321
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:06.900
tracy jackson: No.

322
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:12.870
tracy jackson: Chris

323
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:16.530
SSB504R: Sorry.

324
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:17.940
tracy jackson: That's okay.

325
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.740
tracy jackson: Okay. Yeah, I can. It's just kind of coming, coming in and out a little bit. Okay, so

326
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:36.510
tracy jackson: This is how this typically works at right hard at bright heart health. So I'm so sad. I can't see me try one more time to get you to start this video.

327
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.990
tracy jackson: Here with me or not.

328
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.590
SSB504R: I'm here, I just got there's no option for getting

329
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.190
tracy jackson: Started here story it

330
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.970
tracy jackson: Just doesn't want to do it for some reason.

331
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:19.530
tracy jackson: Here is the story of how things work typically right heart. Okay.

332
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.310
tracy jackson: In order to

333
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:40.020
tracy jackson: Be a part of the program. We just need to get a baseline urine drug screen and some baseline labs checking things like liver and kidney function and all that kind of stuff, if it's possible, like you said, you just got those labs and you're able to get a copy of those and send to us.

334
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.410
tracy jackson: We need other things. So I just recommend people to go ahead

335
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.160
SSB504R: Well, I just need to go get the labs done

336
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.180
SSB504R: To get those

337
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.530
tracy jackson: Yeah yeah

338
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.940
SSB504R: 22 papers something or do I just go into question.

339
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:02.040
tracy jackson: Yeah, you're just going to quote and you're in the right heart system and

340
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:08.070
tracy jackson: They'll just pull it up in the labs will essentially be there. I'll also have a care coordinator call you after this

341
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:15.300
tracy jackson: Until also send you an email with all the instructions that you need about this but. So just to start, we get a baseline drug screen.

342
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:28.050
tracy jackson: And some baseline labs. After that, at least to get started. You're already quite what we call induce right you're already on a stable, this would be from nothing. So starting today and what pharmacy do

343
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.030
SSB504R: The Walgreens on the Camry

344
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.160
tracy jackson: And what town is that

345
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.120
SSB504R: It does do

346
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.240
tracy jackson: In the distance

347
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:50.730
tracy jackson: I can just write this down. So I'm starting today, and I'll call you in just a week supply. Okay. The buprenorphine until we have a chance to get the last fat at bright heart health, because it's telemedicine in order to

348
00:29:52.200 --> 00:30:02.010
tracy jackson: We'll have to set you up to see one of our therapists that does what we call a we're have more intense bio psychosocial assessment of you, and then you'll see that therapist individually, at least to start

349
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:13.800
tracy jackson: Once a week and the online. All this is online, obviously, and then you'll, you'll see either me or somebody else once a week in a group.

350
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:20.610
tracy jackson: And that group is just to make sure you know you don't have any side effects from your medicine, everything is okay.

351
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:32.610
tracy jackson: Again, we start out with two meetings a week just to start out, it's not that you will always necessarily have to have two meetings a week if everything stable, but we want to make sure that you're doing well and

352
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:38.430
tracy jackson: There's, you know, you don't need any additional services right

353
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:46.500
tracy jackson: You will be getting a notification of what the possible times for those groups are so for instance.

354
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:56.250
tracy jackson: You will have a meeting with a therapist, they'll do the assessment. The other group medicines. I'm sorry. The other group visits once a once a week.

355
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:06.480
tracy jackson: To have the there's a possibility for two of those every month to be with me. So I didn't tell you anything about me but I'm a, I'm actually a pain specialist

356
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:18.450
tracy jackson: I used to be an interventional pain specialist, you know, did all the writing of the abuse did all the things obviously every time started to realize like, like you have always known that the system really harms people

357
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.190
tracy jackson: And a lot of guys

358
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.550
tracy jackson: In soccer, yeah.

359
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:29.460
tracy jackson: So, you know, I became a yoga instructor and acupuncture is to help coach sort of an amateur

360
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:41.250
tracy jackson: Gut brain nutritionist sort of person. So basically I have these groups. So there are people who some one of their main mode of motivations to us in the first place is because it helps their pain.

361
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:48.420
tracy jackson: So in these groups that I do twice a month, we try to talk about things that are by scientifically valid in the literature.

362
00:31:48.750 --> 00:32:00.420
tracy jackson: And that you can do from wherever you are, no matter if you don't have any money. So, you know, whether it's free resort, you know, free just basis basically coping skills training to try to do things to help manage pain.

363
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:10.860
tracy jackson: On top of your spots and to help manage flares right and reduce your craving. That's an optional thing. You don't have to get, you know, choose to go to those pain grits, you can just go to the

364
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:19.170
tracy jackson: They're more like recovery groups, you know, as, as her purse about time management every week, but if you'd like it a little additional

365
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:26.970
SSB504R: So I've learned with by our goal, though, so whatever you want to call it experience with opiates.

366
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:34.650
SSB504R: Is it the more you take the more not necessarily more pain relief you give me something worse and

367
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:43.920
SSB504R: Right, that might go to any more is Tylenol and ibuprofen and it works as good. I feel the pain down

368
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.670
SSB504R: Sure, it's going to try to train myself a long time ago that don't take more is that gets sicker and sicker.

369
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.740
tracy jackson: Man it folks.

370
00:32:54.090 --> 00:33:01.050
tracy jackson: For sure. And there are other things, like I said, if you're interested in learning more you know about and we're talking about everything from whether it's

371
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:16.890
tracy jackson: acupressure points. You can do or meditation or communication skills or music therapy or sound therapy or anything like all these different sorts of things we kind of talked about, not everything works for everybody, but the idea is that we just expose you to different things that

372
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:21.300
tracy jackson: Are major changes. Yeah. So that's one thing. So

373
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:30.990
tracy jackson: You don't have to decide on that. Now we'll just kind of get you stabilized in the program first with the therapist and then in a group just every week, checking on your Suboxone or honestly

374
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:43.140
tracy jackson: Ultimately, what's your stable. The drug tests are all clean. That kind of thing. And then we can extend your prescriptions out longer and longer, but it's sort of a thing that you know you've got to show up.

375
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:51.060
tracy jackson: Sober to them, you know, to the meetings are not disruptive, you know, all that kind of stuff. So it's just kind of a little

376
00:33:51.990 --> 00:34:04.950
tracy jackson: To make sure that everybody's doing the right thing. The way the drug, the drug, the drug tests work and you've called the virtual clinic. Correct. Correct. You have the numbers to the that's the call just now to check in for this meeting.

377
00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.020
SSB504R: And no, I would

378
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:08.820
SSB504R: Just add

379
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:10.230
tracy jackson: Okay.

380
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:18.660
tracy jackson: Said, there'll be some to a group of people that are staffed 24 seven like this. So any issues you have, at any point, day or night.

381
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:31.470
tracy jackson: You can call on zoom this bright heart virtual clinics have any questions you have, you can call them again, we're not out to punishing you know understand that, you know, addiction is a very up and down thing and that

382
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.280
tracy jackson: Our job is to keep you safe and

383
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:48.390
tracy jackson: Alive and hopefully along the road to a stable recovery, so that you can, you know, parent and work and do the things that you want to do the best you can. Right. But, you know, if you

384
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:58.080
tracy jackson: If you feel like you're struggling, you know, let us know. The may have, you know, may have to shorten the amount of time between prescriptions or whatever. But we just want to make sure that the

385
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:05.430
tracy jackson: Amount of interaction that we have with you is what you need, right, if you are stable on Suboxone and everything is out and you need nothing

386
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.590
tracy jackson: You may be able to see us once or twice a month right but if if you need more or less.

387
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:23.190
tracy jackson: The goal is not to be not to punish you or kick you out of the program. The goal is actually to keep you in the program so that you can continue to get the support that you need, as you go along. Whatever your journey to recovery is going to be

388
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.490
Oh,

389
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:24.960
SSB504R: Yes.

390
00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:34.680
SSB504R: Was known as isn't. What's the prescription that I did get last time was for buprenorphine pills and not not for Suboxone per se. Now,

391
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.190
He

392
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.930
SSB504R: Says, and they can they be the strips instead of those nasty. Cool. Yeah.

393
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.060
tracy jackson: We can give you a script so still be Suboxone

394
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.870
tracy jackson: It'll still have your accent and ever met. But yes, I can get you the film's for sure.

395
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.320
SSB504R: I don't think the people knocking kills actually having the locks on it, but it doesn't

396
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.810
It doesn't really matter.

397
00:35:54.180 --> 00:36:04.140
tracy jackson: That person yet. So that's the thing. The other thing that the way they'll do the drug strength is they'll mail you a package. So what's the proper address for you just to make sure

398
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.630
SSB504R: The 709 number 32

399
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.390
SSB504R: But you might want

400
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:17.070
tracy jackson: To just make sure that if you move if something changes and you move. It's your responsibility to let us know.

401
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:27.660
tracy jackson: If your address or contact information is different because what we'll do for the drug screens is we'll actually mail you a package. When you. It's time for drug screen do not open the package.

402
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:38.610
tracy jackson: You'll actually call in to this virtual clinic and they'll actually watch you open the package and open the cup and then you go pee and then you bring them back and turn it around, all that kind of crap, right.

403
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.150
So,

404
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:50.100
tracy jackson: Yeah, anyway. They don't want to pee. But they made the point is don't open it up until they've done it. But that's how they do the drug screens here.

405
00:36:50.880 --> 00:37:06.900
tracy jackson: And compliance with your, with your groups, the groups, both your individual with the therapist in your group therapy. Those are mandatory if you skip groups, for whatever reason, it's going to affect the length of the number of pills that we can give you. Right, so

406
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:07.980
tracy jackson: Like about like

407
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.050
SSB504R: Ages, so like the Methadone clinic so

408
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:11.850
tracy jackson: Yeah, so you're kind of

409
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:20.970
tracy jackson: Used to. Yeah, you're kind of used to this sort of thing. I mean, some of it is we have to jump through legal hurts a lot of it is because we want to make sure that you know

410
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.880
tracy jackson: That we're touching base because if you're having a problem. We want to know so that we can

411
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:31.620
SSB504R: We don't want to give someone like a serious narcotic. You know, watching like I'm dying.

412
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:31.800
Yeah.

413
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:42.720
tracy jackson: For sure, also with your first perfect this are messing with your first prescription of Suboxone I also write your prescription for Narc and just to have in the home and

414
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.530
tracy jackson: So they gave me some of that on the one I got.

415
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.810
SSB504R: Seven days, but I could take some water.

416
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:55.920
tracy jackson: Yeah, I mean, it's like if you have it in the home. That's fine. I still am sort of required to write it when I write a similar thing for the first

417
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.220
Time.

418
00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.730
tracy jackson: But it's also good to have and just know that

419
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.390
tracy jackson: That it's a spray

420
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:19.140
tracy jackson: And it depends on, I'm not sure how much your son knows about this or knows about in our town or whatever. But, you know, if you have a adult in the home to know how to give it to you in cases they are or just to let them know if you can't wake you up the call 911 and just to say that

421
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:24.840
tracy jackson: The pills and you have an arcane in the home because that difference in five minutes. Right.

422
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:30.540
tracy jackson: I don't want anything to happen, and certainly it's more risky. If you start taking things like benzodiazepines are

423
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:31.860
tracy jackson: The things we

424
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:32.700
SSB504R: Absolutely. If you

425
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:39.660
tracy jackson: If you just take it as prescribed and you've been on it a week, you should be fine, but always just it's a strong IP. So that's why we want

426
00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:41.610
SSB504R: I've taken it before to

427
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:44.070
tracy jackson: You. Yeah.

428
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:44.790
SSB504R: It is very strong.

429
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.380
SSB504R: doesn't have that feeling to it.

430
00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:49.440
SSB504R: So started last few days, sometimes. Yeah, yeah.

431
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.750
tracy jackson: And when you think about your motivation for wanting to stay on this about fun

432
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.150
tracy jackson: What comes up for me.

433
00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:09.600
SSB504R: And my boy, and it's is a quality of life and he have a smile on my face and you're watching TV and kicking back in the morning or like walking in circles like sweating.

434
00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:10.950
Right.

435
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.690
SSB504R: Crab

436
00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.980
SSB504R: Draws like I mean shocked and all attain this comes back.

437
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:33.660
tracy jackson: And it's good to you know will always ask this in groups, you know, because it's very easy. As you know, I mean, you've been using the sentences for quite some time. You know when your body hasn't been making them for a very long time.

438
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:50.340
tracy jackson: You know, there is this sort of craving, it changes sort of your brain is always good to if you can think about it and just making some reminder for yourself whether it's on your phone with an alarm or posting up or asking your son is just some something some accountability.

439
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.290
tracy jackson: Markers around to help you remember why you want to

440
00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.940
tracy jackson: stay clean when the craving. It went

441
00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:00.750
Right.

442
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.490
tracy jackson: Have you, have you ever participated in anything like in a

443
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:07.680
SSB504R: Long time ago.

444
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.470
tracy jackson: Is that something that appeals D.

445
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.420
tracy jackson: No. Okay.

446
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:19.920
tracy jackson: All right. And then last thing, again, this is just kind of a little checklist. So this is these are just yes no to these questions.

447
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:27.360
tracy jackson: So detect opioids in larger amounts or over a long longer time period than you intended

448
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:29.280
SSB504R: Um, yeah.

449
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:34.860
tracy jackson: Have you had a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to put down a control your iPod.

450
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:43.500
tracy jackson: Would you say you spend a great deal of time and activities necessary to obtain us or recover from I believe

451
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.790
tracy jackson: You have craving or strong desire to use opioids.

452
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:56.910
tracy jackson: Have you had recurrent yeast, resulting in a failure to be able to fulfill your major obligations that works for him.

453
00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.910
SSB504R: Yeah, there

454
00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.330
tracy jackson: Have you continue to use despite having persistent social or interpersonal problems.

455
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.420
tracy jackson: And then

456
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:19.080
tracy jackson: And like you said. So you mentioned you had not had any physical injury or complications from your abilities as far as, you know,

457
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:26.520
tracy jackson: But you do have tolerance and withdrawal that you told me. Okay. All right.

458
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:48.390
SSB504R: They seem to become right badly. They don't even mess really today with myself of methadone. Another one milligram a day walk out of that place and anxiety as for about two weeks straight and then when I started using it. I just, I was hired one day in and out with his craft.

459
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.900
SSB504R: To look like. So what's missing. And I think about the

460
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:56.850
SSB504R: Oil was like, oh, wow, well better who serves

461
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:57.780

tracy jackson: Right back. Yeah.

463
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:01.500
That's

464
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:07.140
tracy jackson: So that's the hard part. So hopefully to what will happen after this. Like I said, the

465
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.290
tracy jackson: The notes.

466
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:17.280
tracy jackson: For this meeting, not, not this number, not this this zoom number, but the number you call before to check in.

467
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.600
tracy jackson: Remember these are that number right after this.

468
00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.070
tracy jackson: Uh huh. No way, that's my number. I think

469
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.360
SSB504R: Or the throwaway number

470
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.980

tracy jackson: To call them back. You'll need to fill out two things. So one will be. Bam. It's a brief addiction monitor just to get a baseline and they'll also assign you to a therapist.

474
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:53.670
tracy jackson: Appointment and do one other little questionnaire this damn thing. It's very brief, brief addiction monitor, but you have to do that before every meeting.

475
00:42:54.030 --> 00:43:02.940
tracy jackson: So when you call them for these group meetings, I told you that you'll have once a week. They'll want you to fill out this and this is just a way again that we sort of follow in track your progress over time.
