1
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.650
Lauraluj87: Alright.

2
00:00:47.580 --> 00:01:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me open up a note here, we probably should today really come up with a plan. I think you're probably attending double the amount of services that you need. So let's come up with a plan. Okay.

3
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.300
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

4
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.600
We'll come up with something

5
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.200
Lauraluj87: So you got me. Did you get my message yesterday, day before yesterday. I don't remember Thursday.

6
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.070
Yeah, right. Yeah.

7
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna just type something I'm dummy. It's literally 20 seconds away from. Let me just write this tiny little intro here in New Mexico in div id, you will therapy 327 27 and right now it's appointments nine your time right

8
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.640

Gwenevere Abriel: This is our first

10
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.020
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

11
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a

12
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: First individual therapy following bio psychosocial

13
00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

14
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Group missed yesterday client to attributing it to you are attending the you said federal

15
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.730
Individual through our

16
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:24.330
Lauraluj87: Yes, it's like for mental health and stuff. And it just happened to be the same time as the group and I didn't realize it till like last minute I thought what I told you guys a long time.

17
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.700
Lauraluj87: Okay wasn't trying to

18
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.060
Lauraluj87: Say, do you want to keep me on Tuesday, I guess, right.

19
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.390
Let's

20
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put slow down just a little bit.

21
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

22
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back up a little, just a tiny bit. Let's go to didn't realize

23
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now, let's just say, whoever schedules these appointments

24
00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Would they say, oh, this is this appointments been in place for a while now with you know it was there that appointment was there for a week or something.

25
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.370
Lauraluj87: Yeah, okay.

26
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, you didn't realize maybe wasn't because it wasn't in in your phone. It wasn't

27
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:24.660
Lauraluj87: Logged in the calendar. Oh no, I have my at my agenda or whatever but ok so I have my I op that I do with the federal government, whatever, like, and I go, Monday through Wednesday. Okay, but that got cancelled because of the whole coronavirus bullshit.

28
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.140
Lauraluj87: Okay, so, because the group got canceled. I forgot about the individual counseling that I have to go to

29
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:42.030
Lauraluj87: So I knew about the problem but I totally spaced it out, and I knew about group, but then I just forgot that I have to go to individual. So what I like, I have to go to individuals that make sense.

30
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:54.000
Lauraluj87: So whenever I scheduled the group appointment with you guys. I thought I didn't have to go to individually mart and Target the reminder on one day about individual and I realized, oh sure, yes.

31
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's

32
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably that space of. It sounds like you maybe with the uncertainty with the changes in schedule, maybe not having looked in the phone and really seeing kind of looking ahead, looking ahead, double, double booked kind of thing.

33
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. All right, got it. Alright, so let's look ahead, let's talk about. And you know what, with so much change going on next week, could be different, too. But assuming things stay the same.

34
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about your I O pay for a moment.

35
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.740
Lauraluj87: Did you

36
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear. Did you hear that your I. O. P. And I'm assuming that's a three hour group.

37
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it cancel until April 15 or cancel for the foreseeable future.

38
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.470
Or

39
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What they say

40
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.400
Lauraluj87: Hands until further notice.

41
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, okay.

42
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.180
Lauraluj87: That's my Monday, Wednesday 11 to one. Yeah.

43
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.770
Okay.

44
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.600
Lauraluj87: But I mean, they can still make Tuesday. If we do Tuesday, you know,

45
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so let's do that. So group stays the same. You've got Tuesday 7am is still in place. Nothing needs to change. Correct.

46
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.180
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

47
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay cool so group stays the same. And now when is and this is what I got to talk to you about

48
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I, and you and this

49
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapist.

50
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't they can't be going on at the same time.

51
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.150
Lauraluj87: They are

52
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's why I'm going to go nice and slow. I don't want it. I don't. I need a name. You can make up a name, if you want, but give me a name of this therapist that you are seeing once a week for individual therapy. Just give me a name, so I can refer to this person by name.

53
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.980
Lauraluj87: When Donna. I think it's her name a

54
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Lead on it with an L.

55
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. OK. OK.

56
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.570
Lauraluj87: OK.

57
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok so Madonna. So here, so I'm going to give the philosophy behind it. So just imagine that you had to prescribing doctors for buprenorphine.

58
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: One. One of them is saying, hey, you need to take it three times a day and you take 24 milligrams. And then you have another doctor is prescribing at the same time, and they're saying, Take it once a day, and only take eight milligrams, you have conflicting prescriptions.

59
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not going to know which one. And they might contradict each other. So think about it like that in the talk therapy.

60
00:06:46.260 --> 00:07:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's what Donna and myself. So Donna and I have our treatment plans and they might be in contradiction to each other. So it's not ethical to have to have the same treatment provider.

61
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.500
Lauraluj87: But what if she doesn't prescribe like medicine.

62
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do it again. I'm gonna do it again. Let me try it again.

63
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you have

64
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To chiropractors

65
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.830
To

66
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So to chiropractors, let's say you have two therapists Madonna and Gwen.

67
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.220
Lauraluj87: Okay.

68
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This is an analogy. You know what an analogy is

69
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay I'm. That's what I'm doing. So we're almost there. I think we've almost got it. If these two chiropractors are treating you and one of them believes that you

70
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta know crack the back like this, or whatever. And this other one does it again, and it's already been done, you might get injured.

71
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

72
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.130
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

73
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you can't have you, you wouldn't want to have to have the same practitioner treating you at the same time.

74
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Might get you might get hurt. Okay, so hold that hold that thought and now

75
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.590
Move over.

76
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now move it over to let's say you were seeing a psychologist social worker mental health clinician marriage and family therapist, and that's what we're going to call. I think we're gonna

77
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: She probably has one of those licenses. Right.

78
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.580
Lauraluj87: Probably

79
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.630
Yeah.

80
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: She probably

81
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.230
Lauraluj87: She probably said

82
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: She probably starts the day with how you feeling. How you doing,

83
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:43.980
Lauraluj87: Right, yeah.

84
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.180
Lauraluj87: Continue.

85
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so

86
00:08:50.280 --> 00:09:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That is what you're receiving from me. You and I are working on not only relapse prevention, we're working on underlying thoughts, feelings beliefs trauma history relationship communication. So here's what's happening, you have to

87
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't have to

88
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: She if she knew that you were seeing me she probably would say the exact same thing. I'm saying, which is you can see both

89
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:24.690
Lauraluj87: Well,

90
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.440
Lauraluj87: She told me

91
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.880
Lauraluj87: Well, because like she can't prescribe medicine. That's the problem. So I don't

92
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

93
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Okay, listen, we're gonna get it. We're almost there. Watch.

94
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't prescribe medicine.

95
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't you're talking to a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist.

96
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I am not, I'm not a doctor. So now, do you see it, you're seeing two therapists.

97
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.370
Lauraluj87: Okay.

98
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Can't do it.

99
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch. Here we go. You're going to get it with this one, your doctor.

100
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: For medicated assisted therapy happens to have the same last name right, Dr. Dawn of real, is that correct

101
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, she prescribes your medication.

102
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:18.870
Lauraluj87: I

103
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I am not a doctor.

104
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You probably came to bright heart health. I'm guessing for buprenorphine. Is that correct,

105
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.380
Lauraluj87: Right, yeah.

106
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of this particular program is that you go to medication check in. We call it group.

107
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: you're asked to go there. We check in. And during that check in period. She says, Are you having any symptoms any new medications started discharge any symptoms. She prescribed your medication during group.

108
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:55.980
Lauraluj87: Okay.

109
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You and I need to address behavioral mental health underlying issues.

110
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.650
Lauraluj87: And you can't meet with two different diversity.

111
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. You got it.

112
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.770
Lauraluj87: You got it. Okay.

113
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.970
Lauraluj87: So,

114
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're okay. Yeah.

115
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the

116
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.290
Lauraluj87: medical team on you.

117
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so we're going to work at what now you get it, and now we're in the problem solving mode now we get into what to do. So let's, let's figure out what's going on here. So, um, is it safe to assume that

118
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: This

119
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapy that you're receiving from Madonna is in a court order, it's

120
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.250
Lauraluj87: In a probation. Yeah.

121
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Supervision document.

122
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.550
Lauraluj87: Yeah, they call my patients my shit. Yeah, yeah.

123
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so here's my question. This is where we got a really, really listened closely to this one.

124
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how it would sound if I was talking to my PO. It'd be like this.

125
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.850
Sep

126
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: My supervision document says that I have to see a therapist once a week. Does it have to be through the federal blah blah blah Bureau with Madonna P O says, I don't know.

127
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You say, Well, here's my situation I very much need to be in the M. A. Ti program which is dedicated assisted therapy where I get my buprenorphine otherwise I will go into such severe withdrawal. I run the risk of relaxing.

128
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And part of being in this program is they require that I see a therapist. So I'm already receiving therapy.

129
00:12:44.220 --> 00:13:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Through a licensed therapist through bright heart health. I get two things medication and therapy so PO whatever your name is, can I stop seeing Madonna and I can have bright heart health, send you a letter participation to show you that I'm attending therapy with when

130
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And the people will say, I don't know.

131
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me find out.

132
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I wish people would say, yeah, doesn't make a difference to me just get it done. I don't know what they're going to say, but the document rarely do they sometimes they do. I suppose they might say, you have to receive it through the federal blah blah blah department if that's the

133
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.190
Case.

134
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes a difference. We would want. That's where we start

135
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.770
Lauraluj87: So I have to ask my PO. Basically, if I can just see you instead of seeing her correct

136
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And the way I would phrase it would be more like can we look in my supervision agreement. My PO document does it say specifically, I have to see.

137
00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: A therapist through the federal Department of whatever or can I see a therapist through bright heart health. I think the P O is probably going to say, I don't know, let me look at it.

138
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The more specific you are, the more we could skip a couple steps. If you do it your way might work. But they need to put their little eyes on that document.

139
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.080
Lauraluj87: Okay.

140
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.650
Lauraluj87: To agreement, say, I have to see a

141
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.790
Therapist through

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.600
Lauraluj87: The federal government or can it go through, right.

143
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

144
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have that document.

145
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We could look at it together and see if it says it

146
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.490
Lauraluj87: Yes, yeah.

147
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That might be things along a little bit

148
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Because some some drug courts are there's only one treating

149
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.860
Lauraluj87: Agency.

150
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So, actually.

151
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Here in Broward County.

152
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.040
Lauraluj87: And

153
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You go to

154
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Court and

155
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: There's only one program.

156
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to go to that one.

157
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.400
Lauraluj87: Smiling

158
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: As a requirements page with like 15

159
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.270
Things.

160
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.270
Lauraluj87: Anyways, well,

161
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's probably one page that has a list of, of all the things requirements you have to do like humanity service, you have to pay a

162
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine.

163
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.460
Lauraluj87: To defend never met. Yeah, cuz your region.

164
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So read where it says must attend either counseling treatment therapy. See if you can find that line.

165
00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:01.980
Lauraluj87: Seven submit to a testing for parameters substance by the tutor after testing.

166
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:11.580
Lauraluj87: participate in a program of inpatient or outpatient substance abuse therapy and counseling is judged by the patrol officer.

167
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:12.990
Lauraluj87: Wait, what's up.

168
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, you're on to sound like a really, really, really good. I only

169
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I only understood up until the word substance abuse. Tell me read nice and slowly. What comes after that, I think we're onto something.

170
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:36.120
Lauraluj87: Substance abuse therapy and counseling if directed by the trial Service office or supervising officer.

171
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice it doesn't say what entity. What agency, what organization in must be from

172
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.570
Lauraluj87: You notice that that's a good thing, right.

173
00:16:48.990 --> 00:17:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Well I bad, good, bad, that's up to you to to feel, but what that says to me is in that sentence. It doesn't say who you have to receive it from

174
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So it says to me if I'm. What's your name,

175
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.030
Lauraluj87: Anthony Carter.

176
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd be like, Listen, Mr. Carter.

177
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I do that thing I just did.

178
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.660
I'm

179
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm already receiving treatment of substance abuse treatment through a licensed therapist.

180
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Who will provide a participation letter to you, you'd have to sign a release doesn't take but two minutes to do and the organization can send you a participation letter to show you that I'm attending weekly individual therapy. I'm also attending group.

181
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

182
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that you're going to have to worry about the group, but this might become relevant to you so you can continue to get credit for group for attending group, you might want it.

183
00:17:52.320 --> 00:18:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But what you can say is, you know, my IoT was canceled, but I am still attending one hour of route therapy, a week.

184
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Which by heart health can also include in a participation letter so I can get a letter stating, I'm getting it through telemedicine.

185
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, for some people, Laura.

186
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: The how I put this

187
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The normalized acceptance that this is just as good as in person.

188
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Not everyone buys into it yet.

189
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So, I mean,

190
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.740
Lauraluj87: I know it's coming.

191
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.870
Lauraluj87: Okay, yeah. Good. Okay.

192
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I happen to have watch because I've been working with some people for years in here and

193
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It's working. So I'm excited. I think I'm like it works. It works great. In fact, it's more convenient than having to take a bus, find a ride.

194
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I ain't got gas money like it works for people that sometimes can't get

195
00:18:53.130 --> 00:19:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: To the appointments. So I think it's working. I truly do I think people are they're going back to school. They're keeping jobs, their relationships are changing their communication with their children, their families.

196
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Their substance use has really transformed. So as far as I'm concerned, I feel very confident to say that this works just as well as in person therapy, but not everyone knows that yet. This is so new.

197
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.700
Lauraluj87: I get that, I guess, I get it.

198
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So do you kind of know what a plan might be for you kind of questions to ask. Um,

199
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:30.720
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

200
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:31.470
Yeah.

201
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.660
Lauraluj87: Yeah, so, but there is a possibility to say no. Right.

202
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, here's what what could happen.

203
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If your PL says no, then you say, then I'm in a situation because my my substance abuse program requires that I attend psychotherapy with them.

204
00:19:52.590 --> 00:20:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So you could say, What do you want me to do peel. Can I maybe tell the Donna that will will pick this up after I take, I don't know what your substance abuse.

205
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Treatment plan program. Your plan is. But can I pick this up and a year from now, I'll meet with her later, but right now I'm receiving this treatment.

206
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: With bright heart health. I don't, I don't know that he's just going to say no. I think he probably just needs more information. He may want to talk to me. You want to know may know more about the program.

207
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's it's it's not a diss

208
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.260
Lauraluj87: Because you're also going to need

209
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: him not to Madonna to

210
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:31.860
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

211
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So this gets a little

212
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.810
Lauraluj87: See her on Thursday of next week.

213
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.190
Lauraluj87: Again, what time

214
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.590
Lauraluj87: During the same time as group.

215
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you bet. You say, grew up. I thought your group was Tuesdays at seven. So I guess I'm confused.

216
00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.840
Lauraluj87: When is your because I thought

217
00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:04.380
Lauraluj87: I thought that we changed it to Thursday, what you bought that over 30. That makes sense. I think it was Tuesday.

218
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on, let me just get inside your records.

219
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm lost.

220
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't keep up. I like your music. Okay, I just figured out, so we can't keep doing this, you can't. It has to this call has to be right away.

221
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.580
Lauraluj87: Yeah. Okay. So let me get in here, see what's up.

222
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:35.400
Lauraluj87: We got new one because I after I joined the group. I thought I was joining a group, totally, like, that makes sense.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It would be ideal if I helped you with it because I'm good at making each other. One correctly, but if not more, you happen to have Anthony Carter's business card.

285
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:45.720
Lauraluj87: Right.

286
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.530
Lauraluj87: Maybe

287
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not urgent. I just thought, well, if you put it up on the screen. I could look at it. I would know his proper spelling his title is addresses, phone number,

288
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: All of those pieces need to be correct on the release of information proper spelling is title phone number address email. We're going to need the email because that's probably how we're going to send the participation letter.

289
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.790
Lauraluj87: Yeah, yeah. I get it for you.

290
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:39.870
Awesome.

291
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me something, um,

292
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You were with Brother boyfriend fiance husband who you hanging out with right now.

293
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:53.760
Lauraluj87: What

294
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you safe to go to restroom living room. Some other room to talk for a little bit.

295
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.720
Lauraluj87: Yeah, okay.

296
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:12.630
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

297
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the things that you identify that you want to work on.

298
00:29:47.040 --> 00:30:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: When we very first met was I want to continue to stay sober and this is my medication use on want to, this is a this is an interesting one.

299
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.830
Pretty cool, you identified

300
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You said I want to learn to control my anger better

301
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. So let's lean into that one. Just a little bit and see me.

302
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.670
Lauraluj87: Trying to understand like terms.

303
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Your terms. So I can see what you mean by that.

304
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the problem with your anger.

305
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.210
Lauraluj87: Um,

306
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:34.890
Lauraluj87: I don't really know me, I guess I just, I get angry about, I don't think so, like my dad was telling me something stupid like I don't know.

307
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:44.640
Lauraluj87: You have to go home at night and then I get really mad about it because I'm not a kid anymore and like it just doesn't like

308
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:55.110
Lauraluj87: Okay. So me and my stepmom already had this agreement where if I'm going to be home pastime. Just leave became the grill. And I can go and whatever. Right, that's, that's the limit

309
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:13.350
Lauraluj87: But my dad was a wall nice warm up. It's not. And it's like, no you don't, because you already figured this out of 30 figured out a plan that works, but he insists on, you know, just being the pen. And the thing is, he lost his chance sent me a long time ago. That's just how I see it. Yeah.

310
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:19.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's one word. I missed. He lost trust a long time ago. What did he lose

311
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.430
Lauraluj87: He lost his chance to pay me a long time ago when

312
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:23.940
Lauraluj87: He

313
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: When he abused you

314
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.160
Right.

315
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

316
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.730
Lauraluj87: Right, yeah.

317
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:40.710
Lauraluj87: I lost respect for him. My the years and now at this point, like, Yeah, I get asked to live with him into court orders, but it's just because, of course, that's it.

318
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And did they know that you're a survivor of abuse from him. They know that

319
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.600
Lauraluj87: Yeah, he was on paper.

320
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

321
00:31:51.420 --> 00:32:00.750
Lauraluj87: He has a job that second district or is he will check the date. So he you know he looks really good on paper. That's why nearly three days yesterday, regardless of what that

322
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.600
Lauraluj87: And I didn't hear myself.

323
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

324
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But they do.

325
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: One more time. Um, you know, they'll be with telemedicine, it'll be hard for me to hear you sometimes

326
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: He the courts. Your PO. They know he is a perpetrator yes or no.

327
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:27.660
Lauraluj87: No, okay, he abused me they don't know that he's you know that you should know

328
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. They know physical abuse, they don't know the sexual piece.

329
00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay. I got you. I just needed to really hear it just one time.

330
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.560
The defendant

331
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: We were in the car with your step mom. I was like, wait a minute. You're living with her right what

332
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I don't know that it's a big mystery about why you're angry.

333
00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.740
Lauraluj87: Man, but I mean it is what it is.

334
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.560
Lauraluj87: So I can't really say.

335
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:15.000
Lauraluj87: That I can't be that mad at him because he is the reason I'm out looking to get on paper. Yeah.

336
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you're having to sit with what is this

337
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Conflicting sort of gratitude. On one hand, you're grateful you have a place to stay.

338
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.050
Right.

339
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the other hand you have unresolved trauma with this man.

340
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:35.940
Right.

341
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:37.620
Yeah.

342
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So it makes sense that you would be irritable with him, so I don't know that you're the problem. I don't know that you and I would say, you know what I'm trying to say like

343
00:33:50.340 --> 00:34:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That might keep distance that might be what's needed, we might need a some distance, but he doesn't think that everything's fine because everything's not fine.

344
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.400
Lauraluj87: Right.

345
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.390
It's not fine.

346
00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm assuming you guys never he never atoned can never went to prison. There was no accountability. No.

347
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.510
Lauraluj87: Because like I said he looks to the states and we got it dropped. Yeah.

348
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

349
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.080
Lauraluj87: You know, it's still there.

350
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So, on top of that aura.

351
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: This was also confusing for me, you're in the car with a woman right your step mom. You guys seem to be kind of

352
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost pals like you get along really well. Right.

353
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, well, okay, in the car, it sounded like that.

354
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.860
Lauraluj87: Yeah, because of what she said her

355
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Because she was right there.

356
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.450
Lauraluj87: Right, yeah.

357
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why it's really important that when you and I need nobody so that

358
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel me

359
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I want. Yeah, I want you to be able, if you want to be angry if you want to be sad if you want to just

360
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever feelings come up. I need you to be able to feel like you can just let it fly and not have to worry about protecting someone else's feelings, try and protect some relationship, you know, to me, it won't be therapeutic benefit if you can't just like

361
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: These people

362
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

363
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.590
Lauraluj87: My headphones helpful.

364
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it helps a little because you don't hear my side.

365
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But my side really is your information really is the most important piece. So I really as much as you can. So what you might say to people is they and it's true. You actually cannot be in group when you're around someone else. You can't be in group when you're in a car with other

366
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.400
Lauraluj87: On your I couldn't mean group. I didn't know they want individual. Yeah.

367
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.310
Lauraluj87: I know in group, it's a violation of policy right

368
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. And I'd like you to be alone for individual therapy to it won't be useful. It won't be so you can always dump it on me. You can say, well, this therapist. She's. She's trippin. I don't care. You can throw me under the bus.

369
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.050
Lauraluj87: Okay.

370
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:16.950
Lauraluj87: I have

371
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a lot of trademarks on my face.

372
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:21.300
Or

373
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm used to it. Just throw me under there. Just a therapist and mushy cuckoo.

374
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, um, but between you and I

375
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

376
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. Now we're getting to it.

377
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

378
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, so she in the car. She was like, Oh, I already know everything.

379
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.190
Lauraluj87: Fake

380
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was like, that doesn't sound right.

381
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.470
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

382
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you I believe everyone needs to have somebody that they can

383
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:26.940
Talk.

384
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And just be real with

385
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:31.710
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

386
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can't say it. If someone else's around

387
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.040
What

388
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Laura.

389
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.150
Lauraluj87: Do you ever

390
00:37:51.750 --> 00:38:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're at the house. Do you ever notice anything happened as far as like you kind of have a knot in your stomach or you feel like your body has more tension. Do you feel this sort of

391
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: physical effort.

392
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

393
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.040
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

394
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel it.

395
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:17.430
Lauraluj87: What do you mean

396
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.080
In your body

397
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The tension of

398
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.950
Lauraluj87: When you're in the house going

399
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:25.800
Lauraluj87: In here.

400
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.000
Yeah.

401
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So you'll notice

402
00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: In doing work with me that I'll ask you questions like where are you feeling that in your body. That's what all mean, sometimes people will feel like a tight chest or they'll feel their, their stomach turn, they'll feel nauseous, or they feel all this tension in the shoulders.

403
00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So everybody's body responds to stress a little differently.

404
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm learning is one of the places for you.

405
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this hypocrisy, right, of being in a house where they say they care about you.

406
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:12.690
Lauraluj87: Right.

407
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Do

408
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, there's this myth right when you're around people, when there's conflicting information one place that your body may register it is you're going to get zapped somewhere in your in the throat.

409
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this the sound really strange to you.

410
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.000
Lauraluj87: It makes sense. Okay.

411
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And and so if people if people have never had any kind of therapy before this can sound really kooky

412
00:39:52.650 --> 00:40:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But over time, you'll start to hear some things in group and and you might start more and more and more to pay attention to your body's response to

413
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.360
Lauraluj87: To make sense.

414
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so

415
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.480
Lauraluj87: Because the body of

416
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Amazing it perceives threat.

417
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It will know instantaneously before you can even come up with a word for what's going on, instantaneous. It knows. Something's up right yeah you know because your heart beats really fast before you can even like say someone just walked in the room, or there's danger. It knows

418
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That's my point, the body will pick up on perceived threat.

419
00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And hypocrisy, by the way, it will pick up on it before you'll even be able to come up with a, with an explanation and words for it.

420
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's amazing. Now, but it's kept us alive, it's kept you alive. It's not going anywhere. It's, it's the reptilian brain right it's the limbic system that says, you're in danger.

421
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the sympathetic okay so

422
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I have, I have to explain. I have an inner ear issue. So I have to turn my head up and

423
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Down some

424
00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Because some people get yeah

425
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.910
We get offended when they do that.

426
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good.

427
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.110
Um,

428
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We have in our bodies, you and me, same, same as everybody we have

429
00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Basically all animals have this to humans have this special thing. And I'll get into it later. But we have two systems, one's a sympathetic nervous system, the one that gets you to fight.

430
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Or to flee that one sympathetic nervous system. Does that sound familiar maybe from school or something.

431
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.970
Lauraluj87: Yeah yeah

432
00:41:51.480 --> 00:42:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know it because your heart will race all your blood will go to your large muscle groups like your biceps to your thighs.

433
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And it'll, it'll be available through your heart because your heart is going to be racing fast, but the blood leaves certain parts of your body, it leaves your stomach because it's no time for digestion. Okay.

434
00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: When it's time to find somebody in the right lane time for that.

435
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So what happens is it not only does it leave our gut.

436
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It leaves the prefrontal cortex to all that's where we feel super smart. We were like,

437
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:27.600
Lauraluj87: We

438
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Can think rationally. You think about cause and effect that is not important, when all we need to think about is, is punching someone or running away.

439
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the sympathetic nervous system.

440
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So, you with me so far.

441
00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.620
Lauraluj87: Yeah, there you go.

442
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So you

443
00:42:53.910 --> 00:43:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You asked me a question you wanted to know about. What does that mean, what does it mean sympathetic nervous system is getting activated around perceived threat. So I didn't know what you how much you wanted to know.

444
00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to know the biology behind it.

445
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:17.880
Lauraluj87: Yeah, kinda a well I know I guess what, why is it knowledgeable, I guess.

446
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, why is

447
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to make sure I'm being useful.

448
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.370
Lauraluj87: To bring it up, I guess.

449
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because I thought you asked, what does that mean perceived threat. So I was I was explaining the biology of

450
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.250
Lauraluj87: It. Yeah. No, you're good.

451
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Okay, so we're talking about the same thing.

452
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:38.520
So,

453
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Biologically biologically

454
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You will perceive threat and I'm glad you did. Because it has kept you alive and has kept me alive.

455
00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a good thing.

456
00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes. So notice how I said there's a sympathetic nervous system. There's something else, Laura.

457
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: There's the para sympathetic nervous system and what it does is it does freeze.

458
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's fight or flight.

459
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: In the sympathetic nervous system. There's also parasympathetic which makes us do this.

460
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's a coping skill to

461
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: When we can't fight and we can't flee. Our body tries to keep us alive in a different way in mobilizes us

462
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:35.250
Lauraluj87: If

463
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And that an analyst or two reptiles will do it if they're in a literally freeze so feign death dead.

464
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And

465
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's pretty cool. Um it but you don't think about it. Just do it because it's an instinct. Okay.

466
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:56.460
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

467
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So here I'm getting I'm gonna get you there. You want to understand perceived threat right

468
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:04.590
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

469
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: When we perceive threat.

470
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Instinctively, our hearts gonna race and we're gonna we're gonna either respond with a sympathetic response system where we're ready to argue

471
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: fight or run, but some people will respond differently.

472
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It will flow into immobilization, and they might pass out.

473
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's not quite as common as people dissociating some people in a high perceived threat.

474
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Will

475
00:45:53.400 --> 00:46:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: disassociate so it's down here, huh, that's the frees you up to see. So I never thought we might get somewhere with this. So if I'm familiar with people doing that I'm familiar with people where I'm going to tell you what often, you said you do this association thing, right.

476
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be, and you tell me if this is true.

477
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: In your original traumatic event.

478
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: For people that couldn't run

479
00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And they couldn't fight.

480
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The way they

481
00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: handled it was they immobilized they just froze.

482
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When they're ready.

483
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

484
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's common for people that suffered a sexual assault.

485
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Or people that are molestation survivors. Cuz, cuz when you're little you're immobilized you can't can't fight can't run

486
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:51.060
Lauraluj87: Great.

487
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So if that's the case.

488
00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see something here. Something smell something register something

489
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That is even remotely close to that original trauma, you might associate you want me

490
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You do that kind of thing.

491
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:18.090
Lauraluj87: Yeah, I mean into, like, like you said, like I'm like

492
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

493
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Michael, what just happened you where'd you go

494
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.940
Lauraluj87: Like, no way.

495
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

496
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you see it now you can see your body is trying to take care of you. The best way, it knows how so that's a good thing. Okay, it's trying to keep you alive. It's trying so that you psychologically are not overwhelmed.

497
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, it, it worked. Maybe to keep you alive in some situations it just might not be adaptive and currently because what

498
00:47:54.900 --> 00:48:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: When you originally. I'm just talking biology or we're not telling any stories. I'm just explaining because this is what

499
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: happens to all of us.

500
00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: When the original event happens

501
00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: The hippocampus, the part of the brain that stores all your memory.

502
00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:14.190
Yeah.

503
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The timestamp didn't get didn't get timestamp.

504
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:22.470
Lauraluj87: So what happens is if

505
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I smell something that is even remotely close to an original stress event.

506
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That whole memory feels like it.

507
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Feels like it's happening right now.

508
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:38.310
Lauraluj87: It makes sense.

509
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Because at the time of the event, all this cortisol was rushing through the body and the the hippocampus is completely covered with

510
00:48:51.690 --> 00:49:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: cortisol receptors and it messed with the memory it. There's probably big pieces of it that are forgotten like important pieces and the timestamps not properly put in place.

511
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So it can feel like if you saw something heard something smelled something tasted something and all of a sudden you're reliving this

512
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:14.070
Lauraluj87: This experience in

513
00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's because that isn't in the past. It literally didn't get the stamp it needed

514
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it's cool to hear about the science that it's not just our imagination.

515
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.410
Lauraluj87: This is like biology zero

516
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's cold, and we get to, we get to learn these things because our instruments for measuring blood flow in the brain get better and better and better. And so now I can explain it biologically, where before I only had psychology to explain it.

517
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I've got biology. And that's kind of cool.

518
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:56.790
Lauraluj87: Well, I, well I like being able to explain it in more ways than psychology cathartic people don't believe in psychology

519
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You got that right. Boy, let me tell you, that's the true yeah

520
00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:04.860
Lauraluj87: I mean that whenever I was dumb whenever I was studying psychology or then that

521
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:13.770
Lauraluj87: Like, I bet about 50% of the cost dropped out the version that first semester, whatever about 50% of my psychology class dropped out.

522
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:15.990
Lauraluj87: Oh, believe it or not.

523
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:19.470
Lauraluj87: On it and they said it was because it was too hard, don't understand or number

524
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's our science is finally catching up with

525
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about how many religions out there, believe in things like the importance of breathing.

526
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.980
Lauraluj87: Even right

527
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about native culture, Indian, you know, Asian, Indian Hindu Buddhism. I don't know much about Catholicism or

528
00:50:50.760 --> 00:51:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Christianity. I don't know whether they pay any attention to that part. But there's a lot of really, really old information around the importance of the breath.

529
00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:02.910
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

530
00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And what you're going to hear and I'll probably do it next time because we're running out of time is I'm going to teach you something called belly breathing.

531
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll give you the science behind it.

532
00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll teach it to you.

533
00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And the neat thing about science. You don't have to believe it.

534
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:28.290
Lauraluj87: For it to work because me. Yeah.

535
00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:29.100
It's true.

536
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:38.370
Lauraluj87: Yeah, I don't know, like I went on like in second grade. I actually told my mom that she was lying to me because

537
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:48.690
Lauraluj87: God wasn't real. And I brought her the evolution like thing I brought her a whole book on emotional and she thought what teacher was teaching you evolution. And I was like, my second grade teacher

538
00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:55.020
Lauraluj87: And ever since. And I don't know. I've had my own belief in science. So, yeah, yeah. But she was

539
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: She was on the show.

540
00:51:58.170 --> 00:51:58.890
Lauraluj87: So, man.

541
00:51:59.070 --> 00:51:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, her little

542
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Her little doesn't believe in God, you know, she was freaking

543
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:08.100
Lauraluj87: Out. Right. Right. Yeah. So then, ever since then. I never got that much.

544
00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:09.540
Lauraluj87: But yeah

545
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:12.930
Lauraluj87: It is what it is. Yeah.

546
00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a way to still have spiritual connection.

547
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: With something right. I agree. Yeah, don't you think

548
00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:29.970
Lauraluj87: Yeah, I totally I know luck with that totally agree with that. But I don't think that is a god quote unquote personal

549
00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:32.520
Lauraluj87: But everyone had their own belief. You know what I mean.

550
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we touched on some some some pieces of some science about individual stress response. We talked about the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system and next time. Um, yeah. And you can text me. You can email me. You can call me and

551
00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.000
Let's get real clear

552
00:52:58.740 --> 00:52:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah.

553
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.870
Lauraluj87: Sorry, my PO

554
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're looking for is, you want your PO to be okay with stopping Madonna and continuing with Gwen, so that he gets up and he and we can send him a participation letter. That's what we're trying to get to.

555
00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:20.310
But

556
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I do want to work with you. I want to be able to address those underlying pieces that dissociation part but it's going to take time so that you and I have trust like you can trust me, and I said, it takes some time.

557
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, I got you. Yeah.

558
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so

559
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When do you think you can get back to me like what by Monday or

560
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:47.910
Lauraluj87: Something like oh yeah yeah

561
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.500
Lauraluj87: Okay, yeah.

562
00:53:50.040 --> 00:54:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Or even today if you hear a little something something I'm going to gonna text you my email so that if you want to email me. Maybe it's easier than texting. I don't know. You could also send it to your chemo or, you know, I don't know what but it'd be good for you to have it.

563
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.370
Okay.

564
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.320
