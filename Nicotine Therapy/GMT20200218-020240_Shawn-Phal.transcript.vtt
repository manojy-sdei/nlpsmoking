00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.840
XT1710-02: Good. How are you doing,

2
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:46.650
XT1710-02: Today's not my best day or this week is not my best week but it is what it is. How are you, oh well, everything I my job on Friday and I lost it deserving Lee, to be honest. But I did was nothing I could do about the situation. I just this. This was inevitable, to some extent.

3
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:59.370
XT1710-02: I really love my job and I really loved my boss and I worked my ass off. I mean, Mike performance was not simply flawless but it was like 150%

4
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:12.690
XT1710-02: And my boss. It was a very good friend of mine, and he just I did everything for him and he just told me in the worst possible way at the worst possible time

5
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:25.950
XT1710-02: That he was implementing up his wife's personal business into the spa man that she was just going to. And by the way, I love the woman I had no problems with his wife.

6
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.230
XT1710-02: Just the way he stuck her in and the way it just

7
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:42.960
XT1710-02: It took me so long it took me two years to literally to the day that he told me that this is happening, which was Thursday of not last week, but the week before

8
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:55.800
XT1710-02: It took me two years to that Thursday to get it to get the spot exactly how I meant for it to be, how I was hired to make it the last step was hiring.

9
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:10.350
XT1710-02: The fourth qualified aesthetician and we finally on Thursday morning hired perfect person for this and there's the afternoon. Just the way he told me, and he told me how soon. It was going to be

10
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.500
XT1710-02: And I just at first I was really upset, but I was at least like able to talk like a normal person.

11
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:39.630
XT1710-02: And then I worked even like Friday, Saturday, and Sunday Monday is my official day off. I didn't go to work at all. Sometimes they stop in and then Tuesday last week I came in and she just she shouldn't have done this, but she just destroyed the room that he was giving her

12
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:51.870
XT1710-02: And I didn't get i don't know i really i was just, I couldn't handle it. And then she threw she didn't mean to, but she just disrespected like everything

13
00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:06.210
XT1710-02: She threw like the facial towels that we use for for clients faces on to our dining room table next to a burrito. It was just, it was just like, I just felt violated.

14
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:28.170
XT1710-02: And I had a horrible, horrible panic attack and I had to leave for two hours, and I couldn't even go in. Well, I just couldn't even be there. And my boss got really upset at me because he felt that I was not being a good friend, because we've always been friends, but I felt like

15
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:42.180
XT1710-02: If he were being a good friend, he should have told me, way ahead because he's known me for so long, and he knows that having like, you know, a rug pulled out from under my feet, especially about something that important as the spa.

16
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:54.210
XT1710-02: It wouldn't have gotten well and then the thing is that the changes that he implemented, there was going to be so much supervision on my part.

17
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:04.290
XT1710-02: In and now we just hired this third person. I haven't even like worked her into the like the the swing of things.

18
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:20.850
XT1710-02: So in addition to this, I have to supervise myself and to more people and not just supervise but we would have to rotate rooms, because we would be out a room and just just a sheer thought of this

19
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:34.350
XT1710-02: threw me into a frickin frenzy. I couldn't even I couldn't even right now. I still, even if he would have called me right now and offered me my job back. I wouldn't be able to handle it.

20
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:50.670
XT1710-02: And I just so I finally thought I got it going that and then this person that we really trusted and she just got hired and she was going to be awesome. And I could finally just like relax a little bit

21
00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:10.530
XT1710-02: In it, and it all went to hell and I somehow was expected to handle it all and I begged him to help me, at least, because he implemented this Valentine's Day weekend. So she started doing this on Tuesday he only came in on Thursday and by Thursday I was a basket case.

22
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:23.850
XT1710-02: She just continued evicting us with this like kind of a half friendly smile on her face and the rest of the girls just kind of stood there like kind of surprised by what was going on.

23
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.840
XT1710-02: But I

24
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:38.220
XT1710-02: He All I'm saying is he should have handled it just a little bit better. And then he blamed it all on money because somebody screwed him as well.

25
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:48.930
XT1710-02: And cost him a ton of money was his sister, which is typical because I can't stand his sister, which is why we, the two of us are really good friends, his sisters just an awful person.

26
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:58.050
XT1710-02: And then he told me what his sister did and I would have helped him i would i get i get it that he can come to an employee for alone.

27
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:07.290
XT1710-02: But if he would have just like swallow his pride and come to me as a friend and said hey Deanna I need to change the spot, a little bit.

28
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.200
XT1710-02: Can I have some money.

29
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.210
XT1710-02: I and then

30
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:26.790
XT1710-02: Nick, you could pay me back next year, but he just all of a sudden changed everything took a room away and dismantled everything that I built and was surprised that I wasn't beside myself.

31
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.790
Shawn Phalen: So,

32
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.890
I'm

33
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.410
XT1710-02: Are you financially okay I'm do you have, yes. Okay.

34
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.230
Shawn Phalen: So I assume you're going to start looking for another job.

35
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:58.410
XT1710-02: Will up right now this will happen in the week of my also might my court date is this Wednesday in 48 hours so I haven't done anything really except

36
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.910
XT1710-02: Right, like a goodbye statement of very nice one.

37
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.050
XT1710-02: Bay. I have, I can. I'm not presented right now.

38
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.720
Shawn Phalen: What do you mean a goodbye statement.

39
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:24.720
XT1710-02: Like I just dropped the girls, you know, very sorry I couldn't help anymore and I did a very, I think I said it exactly how I felt. And it was no it was genuine, I said.

40
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:34.980
XT1710-02: I worked so hard. The girls at level like two of the girls, not the girl. We just hired, but two of the girls knew that for the last two years, I'd pretty much lived at the spa.

41
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:46.290
XT1710-02: I mean, I worked. I spend at least 11 hours. They're not to mention personal time there because I felt that it because I loved it so much, and I got it to be so perfect.

42
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:57.960
XT1710-02: That if I had an anxiety attack. I would go to work and I'd actually go to that room and chill out so that place was very special to me and you know I explained

43
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:07.170
XT1710-02: That I'm very sorry that I abandoned my didn't mean to. But also, I couldn't stay because I was so overwhelmed.

44
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:13.500
XT1710-02: It was never going to be not only was it never going to be my turn to focus on myself.

45
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:20.670
XT1710-02: But it was about. I knew for sure. And I actually told him, I said, I'm not even asking you for money to do this.

46
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:40.260
XT1710-02: Because I can't even put a number on this because I don't think I can do this. So it would have all crumbled. And I basically said, I was like, I'm so sorry if I let anybody down by like just disappearing like this, but I couldn't let anybody else even more down by

47
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:57.030
XT1710-02: Industry in the clients they love me so much. I couldn't have the clients see it start falling apart under my control. The thing is, my boss specifically said, and you're the coordinator, you have to make this work. But I just couldn't

48
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:08.460
XT1710-02: I don't know why he would think I could like he knew that I couldn't. And I was just asking for a little bit of help in just a little bit of thought on his part.

49
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:17.430
XT1710-02: But he was more upset by what his sister just did this so he has this business, but the business doesn't give them enough to live on.

50
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:27.060
XT1710-02: So he worked full time for his sister as headquarters coordinator for all of her because she's the franchise owner. The name owner

51
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:38.310
XT1710-02: And he is the franchisee underneath her with a bunch of different other franchisees and he used to oversee everybody. And I guess she fired him because she didn't meet his services anymore.

52
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:57.570
XT1710-02: So he started driving Uber, but he didn't tell me any of this, and if he would have. That's the thing. Like, I get that. He's my boss at work and not my friend, but he can't like flip flop like this back and forth, either. Tell me everything and ask for help. As a friend.

53
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:07.680
XT1710-02: And I'll help you. Like you were asking if I was financially stable. Yeah, I could buy this spot from him right now. And I know that he would appreciate it.

54
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:17.010
XT1710-02: But I can't work under his sister. The reason I was in a position that I was in was because I was really familiar with this company.

55
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:34.920
XT1710-02: I could I could run it half asleep, which I often did, and he was the perfect like non anxious boss, because I have too much anxiety. So he took a big chunk of not responsibility, but when like when

56
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:49.890
XT1710-02: He paid for a bunch of stuff. He made a bunch of decisions like cool clear headed and I dealt more with like every day, day to day like customer service. Right. And I did fantastic

57
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.340
XT1710-02: So, uh huh.

58
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.620
Shawn Phalen: Okay, you see you have your court date.

59
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:02.700
Yes. Okay, and talk to me about what's going to happen a court date.

60
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:11.130
XT1710-02: They're going to assess whether or not I made substantial progress and they would return my son to me.

61
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:21.090
XT1710-02: Or they would tell me what I should still do more of, or what I'm doing wrong because I still never had any kind of clarification.

62
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.760
XT1710-02: And then I would go from there.

63
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.100
Okay, are you ready for court.

64
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.200
XT1710-02: Yeah, if this spa was hanging over me know

65
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:41.340
XT1710-02: Let's why I said, I'm glad that he didn't even like call me or ask me back. I hope he does.

66
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:54.480
XT1710-02: But I hope that he takes whatever like he can take care of whatever he can, so it won't be so terrible to go back into this destruction.

67
00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:14.640
XT1710-02: But as far as my cord goes you know at this point I'm just, I'm going to go in the best that I can. I'm not gonna talk. I have my I have my wonderful attorney who has no anxiety whatsoever and she'll handle whatever she can for me and the rest is in universe his hands.

68
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.780
Shawn Phalen: Word. Where's the, where's the court word you go to court.

69
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:30.960
XT1710-02: Are you familiar with San Diego. Yeah. So it's in downtown San Diego know it's in Vista. Okay, now this Florida.

70
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.650
XT1710-02: Okay north county court. Okay.

71
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.810
Are you nervous.

72
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:47.790
XT1710-02: A yeah I'm nervous because when they they start, they often insult me the other side and I get really upset right

73
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.580
Shawn Phalen: Now it's gonna be there or no.

74
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.000
XT1710-02: I don't think so. But I never know what this guy.

75
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:56.520
Okay.

76
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.090
Shawn Phalen: So you need to just get, you know, prepared for Wednesday, right. Uh huh.

77
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.020
Yeah.

78
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.580
Shawn Phalen: Because that's it's important to you know that's important, you know,

79
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.560
XT1710-02: That's why, like I said, I'm not dealing with this job right now.

80
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:33.960
XT1710-02: And I did apply for unemployment, but I do realize that it's presidents day so I wasn't expecting a call until tomorrow at the earliest or not even a call an email confirmation. Right. And then I take like weeks to actually get interviewed. Right. Okay.

81
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.120
Um,

82
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:54.450
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so, yeah, you know, the goal is just to be as calm as you can possibly be. On Wednesday, and you're right you don't tell you just sit your attorney talk go in there just kind of have blinders on. You don't really listen to what the other side is saying.

83
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.360
You just go in

84
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.900
Hold your head high

85
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.190
And then you'll know what you need to do.

86
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.410
XT1710-02: Yeah.

87
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.590
Okay.

88
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.510
Um,

89
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.350
XT1710-02: Are you feeling depressed, no. Okay.

90
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.930
XT1710-02: I'm, I'm a little upset over something else that

91
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.710
XT1710-02: I have something else on my mind. So if I look a little upset, it's because I'm upset for somebody else.

92
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:41.130
XT1710-02: But they're, they're not pertinent to the situation. So one of my friends is just going through a lot of stuff I was with her today.

93
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.400
XT1710-02: So, yeah.

94
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.240
Shawn Phalen: Well,

95
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.620
I know it's disappointing when you put your heart and soul into something that's hard.

96
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.860
But you know you're the type of person that can bounce back really fast.

97
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:17.880
XT1710-02: That's why I wanted to check out. I actually emailed after it happened, I emailed to solo salons and Phoenix salons. Do you know those know

98
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:23.760
XT1710-02: And there is salon suites for people to work separately. They just rent. Yeah.

99
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:42.840
XT1710-02: So one of them already answered me, but again, I didn't really expect it presidents day. So hopefully we'll talk tomorrow and maybe I'll tour one of the rooms. Sometimes there's date. I don't want to leave too far from where I am right. So I want to rent something right about here.

100
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:56.610
XT1710-02: Because I just I can't start. I can't put this much thought and effort into somebody else's business. Anyway, I agree. The thing is, I don't know what he was one. I don't know what he was thinking

101
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:12.150
XT1710-02: I'm not a well woman. I get it. I also had so many other things like I was a single mom, I live 35 minutes away but I gave him everything I had and I was always there.

102
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:19.020
XT1710-02: I took care of everything and somebody with my experience, I've 13 years experience and what I do.

103
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:35.160
XT1710-02: I could have had if I wasn't crazy, like if he feels that Dina was crazy. Dina lost her temper Dina Dina lost your mind. Yeah, but a sane person with of my caliber would not be working for $16 an hour for two years.

104
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:51.750
XT1710-02: There's a reason why I took this job and stayed with him. It was because it was just the right environment where I could handle everything and I worked for a friend. So the friend understood that I had some limitations.

105
00:16:53.220 --> 00:17:05.100
XT1710-02: What what what he wanted. What more he wanted for for $16 an hour. I honestly don't understand, and I work, I would stay at work at least 1011 hours. Yeah.

106
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.020
Shawn Phalen: Well, it doesn't sound like it was performance based. It sounds like

107
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:23.160
XT1710-02: My name yeah tempers and situation, but it just what I can't imagine how he didn't know that I won't be able to handle this emotionally or physically

108
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:42.120
XT1710-02: And if he thinks that I'm way too temperamental which is basically what it said that I was screaming and all this other stuff. He was so nice to me, poor guy barely was able to fire me he was shaking and twitching. I had to get him water twice. While he was firing.

109
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:44.880
Yeah.

110
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:54.420
XT1710-02: So then we went outside I offered him a cigarette, because he was just really stressing and then

111
00:17:55.050 --> 00:18:08.700
XT1710-02: He told me what his sister did exactly. And it was just like, and I kept saying, I was like, you know, I wouldn't have done that to you. If I were under position. I wouldn't have. But we all know who she is. You should have come to me.

112
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:21.600
XT1710-02: So then he helped me load up my car gave me a bunch of money which I can't cash the check because I know he needs more. So I'm going to have him keep it for another week or so before I cash it

113
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:32.640
XT1710-02: And I was on my way and then I did right that there's so many things that he could have just handled better and that I, you know,

114
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:48.300
XT1710-02: If like knowing me if he wanted more out of me. He needed to give me either time or help and he didn't give me either. Like he says that he gives me four days he gave me four days notice

115
00:18:48.990 --> 00:19:08.280
XT1710-02: Which he did. That's true. But I guess I was starting to and that's not enough, by the way, because even right now. I'm not as upset about losing my job as just thinking of those ugly as black sheets on my beautiful spa bed that she just destroyed the room.

116
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:33.030
XT1710-02: I don't know, I just, I'm so upset about that room if he would have just helped like involved me somehow in this or if maybe I carry these things out. Or maybe I had some sort of input into what was happening just having I had no control over anything and I just fucked up well okay so

117
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.440
Shawn Phalen: If you can try and just put that

120
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:59.850
XT1710-02: I'm not, I'm not that I'm like I'm upset about it, but I'm not like

121
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:12.990
XT1710-02: I'm not, I'm not falling apart. I fell apart over the room that was for sure, but once the room was gone. It was almost better to be fired because it was just

122
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:22.890
XT1710-02: It's like I had to be fired. We have to break up basically in order to start again we have to break up. Yeah, right.

141
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:35.970
Rhonda: Tired. But I'm not sure if I'm coming down. So I just felt real weak and like I'm fighting something off or something. I'm not sure what it is, actually, yeah.

142
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:37.680
Shawn Phalen: It's been going around.

143
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:44.220

145
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:59.820
Rhonda: Well, I've had two knee replacements and the second one was in July. And then, um,

146
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:13.050
Rhonda: And it takes a while to recover from those and I still have some pain in it, but it's not terrible. And I haven't been on pain medicine for a while, accept this whatever this is. And

147
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:19.920
Rhonda: I'm still struggling with it because it does make me kind of sick, so I have to cut it down to really minute dose.

148
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:29.160
Rhonda: Minute and take so friend with someone asked the doctor, this week to switch it to the pills or, I don't know, someone said the pills or ease

149
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.830
Rhonda: I have no idea. It's the same medicine. It's just different form. I have the strips. Yeah.

150
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:47.790
Rhonda: And so it made me definitely ill for two days. The first time I took it. I took a whole strip, but I think I swallowed it. So I know how to do it right now, but I only want a little tiny bit. Just enough to relieve the pain.

151
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.390
Rhonda: And be able to get up and around and do exercise and do what I need to do so.

Rhonda: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm in. I'm in recovery and I've met a number recovering addict and I've had problems with that in the past, but I also have health issues that cause pain. So I'm in a catch 22

154
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:27.480
Rhonda: So I decided to try this because someone had told me she did and it worked for her and she wasn't like like taking drugs, every day, but she had she's had issues health issues and had pain. So she was

155
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.280

168
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:50.190
Rhonda: And I had to, they wouldn't let me come back to work right away because my back was working with disabled children and the girl was got all excited and

169
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:58.590
Rhonda: I went to pick her up and she did something and I cracked my back. So I had to go in and they put me on medicine.

170
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:10.980
Rhonda: And I couldn't not work because a single I had separated and I was single parenting, whatever. And so I ended up getting caught up in that whole scene again.

171
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.840
Rhonda: And then

172
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:25.320

173
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:44.820
Rhonda: Right. So then, someone said, oh, do you know try the methadone and and so I did that. And for me that was just another addiction. Yeah, the doctor ended up putting me on the maximum dose. And I was like, not doing well. So I started tapering myself down off of it.

174
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:51.570
Rhonda: And then I moved up to where I'm at now. And I just, I got off of it.

175
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:59.850
Rhonda: And then I had a few years and then I was working full time and stuff like that, going to school and then my niece started acting up

176
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.290
Rhonda: And

177
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:10.770
Rhonda: So I could hardly walk. I was in so much pain that I was in a walker and I'd lay on the couch and just mound. I mean, it was terrible.

219
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.150
Shawn Phalen: How many. So two of your sense of schizophrenia.

220
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:46.080
Rhonda: Actually I three all three. The youngest one lives in this town with me, but not in my with me. He lives down the street and he's actually taking his medication now and he's very stable. He lives on his own.

221
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:55.350
Rhonda: And he's doing much better, but he developed some drinking issues when his dad died, but he's tapered off now and he's more stable.

222
00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:57.690
Rhonda: So,

223
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:07.050
Rhonda: Um, I don't know why they all have it. And I don't know whether it was the two young oldest ones. It was from drugs or

224

Rhonda: I don't know how that disease works. I do know that I used to work and and mental health facility bring meetings in for people like that that we're in.

225
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:27.240
Rhonda: Yeah, and I used to bring a meeting and because I have a heart for them because of the fact that

226
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:45.300
Rhonda: You know, my brother had it. He's really good. He's doing very well today, he, he doesn't eat take any drugs or alcohol and he takes his medicine. He's very responsible has a car, a good life basically the poster child mental health and he

227
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:56.850
Rhonda: So he was at the same hospital. So I started like volunteering there. Then they wanted me to be on their board because they knew what I had dealt with and stuff and

228
00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:08.820
Rhonda: That I was in recovery and you know all this stuff. But I didn't get involved with the board because I was working full time at Kaiser and I was also raising my daughter was little then

229
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.860
Rhonda: And I didn't want to be overwhelmed with responsibility. So I just kind of brought meetings once or twice a month.

230
00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:22.380
Rhonda: And I would get duly diagnose people to come in and share the meetings and stuff and share with them.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:49.410
Rhonda: Um,

256
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:58.260
Rhonda: I was going to mental health here because I'm I was having anxiety issues again. But I didn't want to take medicine.

257
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:05.580
Rhonda: And I wasn't sleeping right and I started feeling not right. So I went into mental health and asked them if they could

258
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:16.770
Rhonda: And I want I was having pain and the other knee didn't want to take the drugs so they gave me something called Gabba Penton yeah and then they gave me something to help me sleep. That's not addictive.

259
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:39.900
Rhonda: And I saw somebody there. Very briefly, but that didn't work out. And then before that I saw somebody in town here for like couple years, and she's the one that got me into the meetings here and she helped me quite a bit and but she's not around anymore, so I'm

260
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.370
Rhonda: Good.

261
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.770

263
00:37:50.190 --> 00:38:07.380
Rhonda: I'm sad sometimes because of well like today, when I when my son. When I found out that he's locked up again in that horrible place. It just, you know, when a true child's days adult but still my kid and I, it makes me upset because

264
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:18.060
Rhonda: You know i mean stuff. There's circumstantial stuff that cause stress and problems, but then to deal with all that stuff. I used to go running

265
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.110
Rhonda: I used to run like a couple miles a day.

266
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:30.660
Rhonda: And I can't do it anymore with my niece and that was always my biggest strongest coping tools exercise meetings writing

267
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.300
Rhonda: All that stuff therapy to get myself together, you know,

268
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.610
Shawn Phalen: You knew why your son got locked up.

269
00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:44.970
Rhonda: I'm trying to find out. I don't know why he got locked up there. He's not like

270
00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:58.050
Rhonda: I think that he was in trouble with the law. He stole something and then he got in jail. And then he ended up violating his probation over and over again. And then they sent him.

271
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:08.310
Rhonda: To prison, and he got out pretty quickly after that and then was on the street and ended up in trouble again so

272
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:18.870
Rhonda: I know I saw him last year when I went to the NA convention in Sacramento with my sponsor and so I saw all my friends down there and I went there. I saw him.

273
00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:27.750
Rhonda: Man, I saw my other set of two and I don't know why he's locked up. I gotta find out he must have violated his parole somehow

274
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:42.810
Rhonda: I don't know, you don't really have contact with him. Well, I wrote to him. He gave me. He wrote me a letter and I wrote to him back. Today I send it out and I put money on my phone so that he could call me and talk to me.

275
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:51.810
Rhonda: And I'm going to find out from his parole officer tomorrow, what exactly because last week when I called they they wouldn't tell me

276
00:39:52.230 --> 00:40:01.980
Rhonda: But I think they need to tell me because he's my son. I mean, they usually do. I don't know. I think it was a on call worker or something and he couldn't tell me

277
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:22.230
Rhonda: Tell you, so I'll find out i mean it's it's his responsibility, but it's not like I I don't live near him, but at the same time, it's still, it bothers me still. I can't help but let it bother me. I want him to be happy. I want to be successful, he's so smart, intelligent

278
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:32.970
Rhonda: And he developed, you know, addiction at a very, very young age. So I just he's 40 okay

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:39.330
Rhonda: He's he has two kids and he's 49. Where does he live
