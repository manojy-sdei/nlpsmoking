290
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:30.180
Christina ’s iPhone: Butterflies mermaids flowers all sorts of stuff. The moldings, you can move them to the dresser, which makes it look like it has been. I guess we'll move some, it makes it look original 3D so on so forth.

291
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.400
Christina ’s iPhone: Something, people will use the stripes, you know, make it look

292
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:45.570
Christina ’s iPhone: like something out of a cartoon almost like if you watch Beauty and the Beast. The talking arm wrong.

293
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:50.550
Christina ’s iPhone: Way. Yeah, she was like all the purple and stuff like that.

294
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.780
Christina ’s iPhone: stencils use those for the flowers and stuff.

295
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.720
Christina ’s iPhone: They can be really calm and they can be really loud.

296
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:13.980
Christina ’s iPhone: The next one I'm going to be doing is going to be yellow like a canary yellow or mustard yellow and then I'll be using the transfer their blue flowers.

297
00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:27.630
Christina ’s iPhone: So that's going to be really different. And then I'll do some gold metallic stripes on the side and use some of the stencils. So put some flowers on the inside of the drawers. It's going to be a

298
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:36.000
Christina ’s iPhone: Nice way different, out of the box for me, usually I do calm earth colors and so on so forth because they're easier to sell.

299
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:51.060
Christina ’s iPhone: Well this one I'm not even worried about the cell thing. I'm just want to try something different. Maybe it will sell faster. I'm going to do in tables with it. So it'll be a full set. Yeah, so it's

300
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:59.760
Christina ’s iPhone: That sounds fun that online. I've seen the inspiration online and I was just mesmerized by it. So,

301
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.530
Christina ’s iPhone: I figure

302
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:11.610
Christina ’s iPhone: You know lady was probably in a much bigger city that somebody bought it much, and I don't sell things usually for much over $200 a dresser.

303
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.460
Christina ’s iPhone: You buy him for 30 you know

304
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:20.040
Christina ’s iPhone: But the set. I'm going to be putting on there for 500 just let it sit there

305
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:27.420
Christina ’s iPhone: So I've got hope chest that I need to do jewelry box that I need to do. I've done that I've Julia walks before

306
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:36.120
Christina ’s iPhone: Thanks. Hello. Pretty easy. I've got three other dressers out in the garage and I stack them up.

307
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.850
Christina ’s iPhone: Because of the surgery.

308
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:47.250
Christina ’s iPhone: And then just never got back to him. I've got my own furniture that I better do to dressers and a bed set that I have to do for myself. I've just

309
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:53.460
Christina ’s iPhone: Been holding on to like to everything else before my stuff, you know,

310
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.440
Christina ’s iPhone: Yeah, so it takes a lot of work stripping them down to nothing. First

311
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you got

312
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.070
Christina ’s iPhone: To get the best price to take all the crappiest stuff so

313
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.590
Christina ’s iPhone: But yeah

314
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.350
Christina ’s iPhone: Wow, that's what I'm going to get back into

315
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thinking amazing definitely

316
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:20.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, well, we are done. Um, is there any questions that you have for me.

317
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.400
Christina ’s iPhone: No, I mean,

318
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:34.800
Christina ’s iPhone: I know you'll be asking questions in the groups. So, and just recently. I KNOW I DO THAT YOU A. I don't know if you have that stuff on chart.

319
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I could probably look and see

320
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.140
Christina ’s iPhone: The ones through right heart, my last one pissed me off.

321
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because then

322
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:54.630
Christina ’s iPhone: It came up positive for Matt me it looks like that on the pictures. Anyways, I went in the clinic and dropped it off and said, I want you guys to rerun this

323
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.160
Christina ’s iPhone: But

324
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.580
Christina ’s iPhone: They did. And I haven't asked them yet, because everything started happening all this Kobo thing.

325
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.620
Christina ’s iPhone: And so I haven't gotten back they haven't got back to me. They were pretty sure it was getting negative because

326
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:22.200
Christina ’s iPhone: The light is pink. You know, there's just two lines. And then there was lightest pink line. The second one was there. I could see it. They can see it, but you guys couldn't see it. Bright heart couldn't. So that was considered a positive

327
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.200
Christina ’s iPhone: I don't know if it was considered a positive

328
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.210
Christina ’s iPhone: And so that's the kind of stuff that I get concerned about with bright heart is like really

329
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:36.360
Christina ’s iPhone: You know we're supposed to trust this program. But if it's coming up positive and we're not doing anything then

330
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:52.620
Christina ’s iPhone: You know, and my counselor Tony goes, oh, they don't give a shit. I'm like, ah, I don't want to hear that either you know it's good thing I've got more than one people backing me up, you know, behind me because

331
00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:55.410
Christina ’s iPhone: I don't want no mistakes.

332
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, the doctor put in

333
00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:06.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your note for your drug screen on the 11th is not the one you're talking about

334
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.140
Yeah.

335
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She put in here. This is likely false

336
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Patient reset retested it open door clinic and was all negative

337
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.170
Christina ’s iPhone: Okay, good. Okay.

338
00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:34.650
Christina ’s iPhone: Okay, thank you. But that's what I wanted to know, because I hadn't checked with anybody, and I was concerned about it still my next one is coming in the mail, which I think that's another weird thing when they send you a an email saying we have shipped your next test.

339
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:35.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know

340
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:40.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It takes. It definitely takes a little bit to get used to this format but

341
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:45.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, everything seems to be really gearing in this direction.

342
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. Yeah.

343
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:55.920
Christina ’s iPhone: Well, because of, I mean, even before this Kobo thing started. That means you know we were already in this having to deal with this on the phone.

344
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:56.880
Christina ’s iPhone: From home.

345
00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:09.030
Christina ’s iPhone: And it kind of made it easier for people to go into us. Anyways, we already were uncomfortable with this got comfortable with it. And so now we have to be comfortable

346
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:17.760
Christina ’s iPhone: Being everything. I mean, even with your clinic. We're doing it over the phone now. So here, next thing we'll know we're taking our own blood work though.

347
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:18.870
Right.

348
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.540
Christina ’s iPhone: I don't know.

349
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Last I heard, quest was still taking people so

350
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:26.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Taking

351
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One at a time.

352
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:35.460
Christina ’s iPhone: I could just see a stick in our hands through a little window so they could get our blood, you know, out of our beings.

353
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.350
Christina ’s iPhone: Yeah, the little window the pharmacy window, your yard through

354
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:50.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know and they say they clean it really good at it. I I seen a post like that on Facebook about somebody going and getting their nails done.

355
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know where the nail salon where it was a, like a cartoon.

356
00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:07.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, the lady was behind the lady that does your nails was behind glass. And so she was showing up Nicola, what color you want. So they put it, they just put their little fingers right in there, you know,

357
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.250
So she

358
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.980
Christina ’s iPhone: Could happen.

359
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:13.080
Christina ’s iPhone: Thing.

360
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yep, I saw a movie once where

361
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:23.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It was a futuristic movie where in order to get your fingernails done you just put your finger in the sewing machine. Did you

362
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:23.550
Christina ’s iPhone: Yeah.

363
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:23.970
You know,

364
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:25.410
Christina ’s iPhone: Yeah.

365
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.110
Christina ’s iPhone: Well, I mean they the ones that you stick a mouse over your face on your face painted

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I

367
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.910
Christina ’s iPhone: Think, maybe some people go back to basics, I hope.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:39.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

369
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.860
