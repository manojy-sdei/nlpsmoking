00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.760
Matthew Montano: I don't know. I don't know if it kicked in it to two and two days, maybe I'm just having a good day. But hopefully it's going to work. Okay. Absolutely.

22
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what I like is that she filled a prescription right away. I love that you are noticing the alarm of having

23
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: These negative thoughts. So notice how it took me saying out loud. Are you having suicidal thoughts. Notice that what you were doing was clumping well you know as depression.

24
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Calling it depression. I definitely invite you in the future to be quite precise. I can't get out of bed. I'm skipping work. I haven't eaten.

25
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't enjoy activities like I used to like it's really the, you know, especially sleep is probably the number one change when people are out of whack and the needle starting to turn one way or the other. Sleep tends to be a really big indicator when there's change there.

26
00:02:46.350 --> 00:03:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Which you mentioned something that had to do with an acting out behavior that for you real quick, getting a hold of a sexual partner. I think might be one, like, ah, want to want to go there. Is that right,

27
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.980
Matthew Montano: Getting another getting another sexual partner or

28
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought I heard you were concerned that you might just start hooking up with people.

29
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:26.220
Matthew Montano: If that if he if I, I see that he's hooking up with people I might get the urge to just start throwing my body out there and I don't want to do that. Yeah.

30
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Tell me about that. Tell me about why you don't want to not not just sit, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

31
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Just, I want to hear your answer to that question. I want to know you.

32
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to put my book, the whole body is coming out so

33
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta, I gotta have it there.

34
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

35
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.470
Matthew Montano: Work it out. I told you.

36
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.730
Matthew Montano: Yeah, okay.

37
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Why didn't you don't want to do it just

38
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:16.770
Matthew Montano: Because I have I have respect for my body. I'm 31 years old. I've done that in the past and that that that temporarily gratified me and then it makes me feel like shit afterwards. Okay, gotcha.

39
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you recognize that. But you also recognize, but it's only it's one one piece of input away from you, deviating from the health of your body. So watch

40
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If he's gonna go do it screw my the health of my body. Watch how fast it leaves. Yes. You believe in treating your body right yeah right now, today, huh. What if he's doing it, fuck it.

41
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, just sit right in my clothes.

42
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, yeah, I mean, I feel disgusted with myself and I like it to myself. But if he's doing. I'm going to do it so

43
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Look how close it is, it's right here.

44
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.920
Matthew Montano: There's

45
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That again someone else's behavior outside of you determines

46
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Your happiness, your behavior like a puppet. You are run by what other people do. And I don't want that for you.

47
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.200
Matthew Montano: I want you

48
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: To be on

49
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your own man determined by your own morals, your own beliefs and values. So I have noticed just in here just in this these couple minutes that we've been together it's you're already not talking over me.

50
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.480
Matthew Montano: You're right.

51
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So that intensity is called hyper verbal in sort of this clinical world is is is down just a little bit, even from the last time I saw you in group and even more so, from the previous time in individual. Are you feeling

52
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.960
Matthew Montano: Yeah, yeah, that

53
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Urgency i gotta tell her I got to tell her.

54
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.210
Matthew Montano: Right, yeah.

55
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now that could be a good sign that can be a hey I'm okay with myself. I'm okay could be

56
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said you're having a good day.

57
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.720
Yeah, well,

58
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.370
Matthew Montano: What's up,

59
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think you've been doing

60
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: To create this good day. What do you think you've done

61
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:33.510
Matthew Montano: I have been hanging out with friends that match my values. I'm the ones that that

62
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.150
Matthew Montano: I've been going to the gym.

63
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.370
Matthew Montano: And

64
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.890
Matthew Montano: I haven't been drinking

65
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:55.050
Matthew Montano: I've been been. I've been. My friends have like my friends are like, Oh, you're going through a breakup. Let's go out and drink. Let's go out and do this let's let's go party and I've been

66
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:04.740
Matthew Montano: Turning that down, you know, and they're good people. They're just a little bit younger than me. You know, I'm 31 there they're 20 there 2324 25

67
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a party waiting to happen right there.

68
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.870
Yeah.

69
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:21.390
Matthew Montano: Yeah, like I have this I have, I have this really gorgeous friend and I found out a lot of information about Ryan from her yesterday.

70
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:34.350
Matthew Montano: The entire like the last few months, we were together, he was hiding so much stuff for me so I it's like it's kind of a relief, like I was like he was who I thought he was

71
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's hold that that's a that's an important little nugget right there.

72
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, he was who I thought

73
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:53.880
Matthew Montano: Now, and the whole time I was fighting myself to make myself being key was this who I wanted him. Yes, yes.

74
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And that can create a lot of arguing right

75
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a couple bites. I'm just gonna

76
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.270
Open up at all.

77
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a couple bites. I want you to to eat. I'm glad you're eating and I'll let me just get a note together while you're eating that's that works out. That's okay. So we're turning, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead. Think Tank go like dink dink dink

78
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.110
Dink okay

79
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask you something. I asked you, I asked you this before to

80
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Might get a different answer this time.

81
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you want to spend time

82
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about right. It's almost like a buddy.

83
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Or because we did that last time.

84
00:08:53.550 --> 00:09:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you want to have a therapeutic experience where there's a potential for new information to come up

85
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you might experience healing or you might experiencing, you might experience insight that you didn't have before. And you've had a couple of those before you've had it through some of this regression inner child work I did with you.

86
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's more of a therapeutic intervention sometimes therapy is just us chit chatting and and me listening. But what do you want from today. What's, what's the higher need for you.

87
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.530
Matthew Montano: I would say therapeutic

88
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.450
Matthew Montano: Yeah yeah

89
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.530
Matthew Montano: I'm ready, I'm ready to

90
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring that bring it

91
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.940
Matthew Montano: Out there beyond

92
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah. Okay. So let me just take a peek at what resources, you've already developed while I'm doing that you can take another snack.

93
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.670
Matthew Montano: Okay, I wouldn't go to breathe out from like the best burrito place in town. So

94
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.850
Matthew Montano: Look, a good New Mexico Brito

95
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

96
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I got nothing here.

97
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.840
Matthew Montano: In Mexico, green surely

98
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they got nothing. They don't even know what that is out here.

99
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:07.620
Matthew Montano: Mm hmm.

100
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.280
Matthew Montano: But just in New Mexico.

101
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. So I'm revisiting, what do I have. I've got protected figure. Okay, I don't have written in my notes. I want to do a couple things real quick develop this

102
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: The emotional container. Did we develop one of those with you yet.

103
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.620
Matthew Montano: Or do you mean

104
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so doesn't sound like it so

105
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say what that says okay hasn't done it. So let's do this. This is a metaphor. This is an imagery. This is right. Brain Stuff. This is your creative mind. Okay. Okay.

106
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:53.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to create with you. Now you're going to be the one generating it, but I'm going to make a note of it. And then I can use it therapeutically. So what I want you to think of is, I want you to imagine

107
00:10:54.630 --> 00:11:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: A container that is big enough and strong enough to hold all your emotional stuff. And the first kind of things that come to mind.

108
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff.

109
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Because there may be times the end of a session where you're activated, you might be in distress, and I might say, oh, we don't have enough time to finish a particular intervention. Let's take that and gently. Let's put it in this container. Let's lock it.

110
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's put it aside until you and I can safely unpack it again.

111
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's a bit of a metaphor like compartmentalization know how you said, I want to be happy. Today I want to go to work and I want to be cheerful. I'm going to send out a goodbye. That would be one of those moments where we go

112
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's put it in the box, doesn't mean in the box. Does this airily so close your eyes. Give yourself permission, I won't be staring at you, I promise I'll look away. I'll look down. But I want you to because I'm picturing one myself.

113
00:11:53.550 --> 00:12:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to picture a container that negative emotions, maybe negative memories, maybe negative bias or opinion, maybe inner judgment. The disappointment, whatever it is.

114
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be put in this container.

115
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.970
Try and get an image in your mind and let me know when you've got that.

116
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:16.890
Matthew Montano: Okay.

117
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You got a container.

118
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you describe what it is, how big it is, what it's made of the locking system if it exists.

119
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:33.180
Matthew Montano: It would be a really big black box that has

120
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.840
Matthew Montano: A huge lock on it. Okay.

121
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you and which kind of lock. We're talking key combination fingerprint, which got

122
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:44.970
Fingerprint

123
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:47.370
Okay.

124
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's it made of

125
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.610
Matthew Montano: It's made of

126
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.280
Matthew Montano: solid steel.

127
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Really big

128
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Black solid steel box about how big

129
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.790
Matthew Montano: A big

130
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.920
Matthew Montano: I would say about

131
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.600
Matthew Montano: The size of this room.

132
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Like 20 by 2030 by 30 which got

133
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.550
Matthew Montano: I don't know what she got over 4020 by 2020 by 20

134
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, feet. Beautiful.

135
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And another metaphor. This one is a distancing metaphor, the one we just did is a container go in

136
00:13:49.800 --> 00:14:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And sit right there right this metaphor is a distancing metaphor. So now think about, and I'll give some examples. And then you let your creative mind come up with something okay that lands true for you that you like.

137
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it's I'm standing on the shore, I've got all my my team of

138
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Protection and nurturing some wisdom with me and what I see floating away on a ship.

139
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You know is that container.

140
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller, and I can't even see it anymore. But I'm here on the shore feeling all these resources, but I'm watching this get further and further away.

141
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people to spaceship.

142
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:52.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Goes way into outer space, a balloon. Right. The floats away can't see it anymore. For some people it's on the ocean or it's a stream or it's a river or it's a train and those cars are getting further and further and further away.

143
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, what comes up.

144
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.890
Matthew Montano: A rocket ship send you that out into outer space.

145
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.000
Okay.

Matthew Montano: Quickly.

147
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's it in two hours quickly.

148
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

149
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no time for a slow ship. Hmm.

150
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:17.670
Matthew Montano: Easy.

151
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To get get get

152
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep Okay rocket ship nets are going to be our distancing metaphor.

153
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: For that's lovely.

154
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:33.930
Okay.

155
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's start to develop your anchor room.

156
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: With this sometimes can take many sessions, but it's useful even in its development. Now I want you to for a second.

157
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Close your eyes to don't have input coming in here think about

158
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you feel the most stuck.

159
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you keep trying to throw your solutions at something, but there it is again.

160
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the dilemma, where, where are you feeling blocked.

161
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.550
Matthew Montano: I feel like

162
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.670
Matthew Montano: I have for my life I want a family.

163
00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:01.320
Matthew Montano: And

164
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:09.510
Matthew Montano: I have worked. I keep working towards this. And there's always a brick wall coming up.

165
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.740
Okay.

166
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how to name that brick wall. Not that is because that's a metaphor. What do you think that brick wall is

167
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.730
Matthew Montano: My relationships with others.

168
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.100
Matthew Montano: Specifically,

169
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.740
Matthew Montano: My partners.

170
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say that brick wall were there and it spray painted on it was a label. What would you spray paint on their

171
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.490
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing that came to mind trying not to edit yourself to

172
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Sensor.

173
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.000
Matthew Montano: I need help.

174
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I need help.

175
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. I got you. So there's probably some powerful truth and truth and now you got to that one pretty quickly. Yeah.

176
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.460
Alright.

177
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this.

178
00:18:53.580 --> 00:19:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, there it is again another relationship right and it's it's got that same spray paint on there, I need help.

179
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When you look at that wall.

180
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the emotion that you feel, and I know this isn't your favorite place to go.

181
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.970
Matthew Montano: I'm, I'm very anxious. Right now I'm starting to get very anxious

182
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That you are

183
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.080
Matthew Montano: Yes, we're getting

184
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.130
Ready.

185
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I need help.

186
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of vulnerability in sitting with I need help. Like, will I get it. Have I look to the right resource for it. What will happen if I don't, what if I sit with not knowing where the help is will I recognize it when it's there.

187
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, there's a lot going on with identifying I need help.

188
00:19:49.560 --> 00:20:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you picked the right person. Am I it was it's another one. If it's a man. What if it's a woman. What if it was my mom. What if it's a friend, what is helpful like really recognize it if it's there. Well, I know how to use it. I mean, yeah, anxious

189
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:05.880
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

190
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.670
Matthew Montano: Yeah, all those thoughts going through my head. Yeah.

191
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not anxious

192
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I know the answers in there in you and we can get there. I'm not worried we have this propensity right this longing to be fully expressed we we want it. You know, we want to be whole

193
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Inflation

194
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The informations in there. It's not going to come from a piece of wisdom. Some nugget. For me, it's not going to come from me. It's going to come from you.

195
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.660
Matthew Montano: Yeah, see, when I get anxious my shoulders. Start tensing up and

196
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:44.970
Matthew Montano: Somebody's

197
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoulders are tensing right

198
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.190
Matthew Montano: Very they tense up very much inches.

199
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: How old is that turn in. Let's go in and

200
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.150
Matthew Montano: It's i was a kid.

201
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How old are we talking about a five year old 10 year old. What are we talking about here.

202
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.900
A

203
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.210
Matthew Montano: 13 year old.

204
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.870
Matthew Montano: When I first started doing a

205
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:21.630
Matthew Montano: I'm dealing with figuring out that I was gay myself in my own head. I couldn't tell anybody.

206
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.850
Matthew Montano: Because it wasn't like it is today like kids come out like when they're five years old.

207
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:30.540
I

208
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:43.170
Matthew Montano: I had to hold it in or, you know, or I thought I did. At least it wouldn't have been that bad. I probably would have been easier if I came out cuz you know there's always that you know bullies and stuff.

209
00:21:44.910 --> 00:22:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So, go, go. Nice and slow, let's let's honor the fact that your body's sending you a message. There are times maybe when you've ignored it. But not today. So go to those shoulders and really acknowledge the wisdom that your body just sent you a message. And isn't that amazing

210
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing, your body part that first

211
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The body caught that there's a perceived threat going on quite of your might ask us to do something go somewhere feel something.

212
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It registered fast.

213
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so really honor that that you a lot of information in this body of yours.

214
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want you to hold on to this this age of 13. This is an important one and just remind me again. I think we may have started this, but I don't have the note for us. We'll start from scratch. What

215
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What nickname this 13 year old that you'd like, I don't want it to be a versus just 13 year old have a nickname. If we're going to have sort of this child.

216
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.680
Matthew Montano: I'm

217
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:07.470
Matthew Montano: My friends just always called be mad, but my mom is called me MP, it's my net first two initials and then p

218
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now pay attention to your shoulders. Hey, MP how you feel in

219
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.860
Matthew Montano: Those were those were the good times with with my family so that

220
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.540
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

221
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it then. So MP is a welcomed nickname. It's not like oh

222
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Nice. That's the nickname will use to differentiate Matt from in this adult versus MP is a 13 year old. Okay.

223
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

224
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.110
I'm just going to see

225
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Empty. Now that's the only time

226
00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That true. The only time. Now there's three times that I referenced history, but it's not much

227
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's how old we just did that one there's what's the nickname, and then later on in this exercise, we may not even get to it. Today I'll be asking you. Another question that has something to do with the past, but not much. The reason why I say it right now is

228
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This exercise seems like it's just recalling the past, but it's not going to really let your creative mind get in there and give you information.

229
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's not your creative mind, it might be your body

230
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body might be sending you a message or your stomach may turn your chest. Make it tight your larynx your fair and Ferris right just all this might something might happen. Here are the jaw. It could happen anywhere in your body. Notice the sweating hands.

231
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Any message that comes up any change. I'm interested in

232
00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know censoring

233
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.910
Matthew Montano: I want to know.

234
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know those messages. Okay.

235
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, I want you to picture.

236
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This home you're in

237
00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're adding a room it's any size everything you could possibly need in it. It has all the resources it has everything that MP

238
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.290
And need

239
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:27.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Allow the creative mind to fill that space to design it exactly how he wants it to kind of bring me into that that world. What you see what you feel what you hear all of it.

240
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.220
Matthew Montano: I

241
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:40.200
Matthew Montano: I do have a nice apartment. I have but MP at that time.

242
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.940
Matthew Montano: would have expected to be a little bit further along.

243
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's try this again. We're gonna come out again. Number one, there's no way to do this wrong, can't do this activity long

244
00:25:54.030 --> 00:26:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to invite you right now to notice that you did, possibly a comparison you you're doing my job. You don't need to

245
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:04.110
Matthew Montano: Okay.

246
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know you've been doing the work being an analyst and psychologist and helper for people. I'm here to help you. I'll do, I'll do the guiding for you.

247
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to catch that first image, you get to tell me. Ah, it's this color. It's the size

248
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what's in it. This is what I smell. This is what I hear, Oh, I just caught something else this and then this and then this and then this you doing that analysis.

249
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to do it. Not today, because you don't actually know what we're doing. So you don't have to get ahead of it because you don't really know

250
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.490
Matthew Montano: Yeah, okay. So I would have said no.

251
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:46.380
Matthew Montano: Okay.

252
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. Close your eyes. If you're willing

253
00:26:53.040 --> 00:27:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to summon up that awareness that you still have this sense of I need help. When it comes to these intimate relationships.

254
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And that shoulders register. Oh, that's the truth, boy.

255
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: There's something there, and he oldest recollection is on age 13

256
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to add a room on to this apartment and it gets to be exactly what you want.

257
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Try and allow your imagination to come up with the size with the shape with every little detail in this room and just pre associated tell me what what you see what you, what you notice in there.

258
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you, your time.

259
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:49.920
Matthew Montano: I thought of something right away. I thought maybe a room with a baby at it, maybe, you know,

260
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Go back to the

261
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.210
Matthew Montano: Default

262
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wrote it down, close it stay there with it.

263
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice now there's a baby in

264
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice where the babies at where you are.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:23.820
Matthew Montano: The baby is peaceful wherever you said in my arms are in his crib my

268
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:34.500
Matthew Montano: Maybe my partner's somewhere in the house and everything's peaceful in that in our home.

269
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Look, let's get into some details. You're doing great, hold on to it. Close your eyes and not let your imagination. Fill the walls, the ceiling and the floor and give me some details about what you see

270
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:58.890
Matthew Montano: I see.

271
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.540
Matthew Montano: Nice, nice stuff in my house.

272
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.050

277
00:29:52.320 --> 00:30:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There is fairness that that tension, because I'm a messenger since age 13 which should it go back

278
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to go back to this this awareness of MP

279
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to

280
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a sense of maybe his needing help with something.

281
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And I want you to develop a room for what MP needed

282
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you don't allow that room to be added on to the song that you're in. Now I want you to picture a room.

283
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What color is it

284
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:42.510
Matthew Montano: What

285
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:50.610
Matthew Montano: A soft color, just something peaceful. Yep.

286
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.570
Exactly.

287
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect peaceful color.

288
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice that this room is got windows have window treatments. Yeah, see, so it was hard to go there before we went to adult, you're going to have the courage to go into this this room. It's gonna it's gonna be perfect.

289
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna have absolutely everything

290
00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: That MP needed

291
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to get there.

292
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What color. See if

293
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You can commit to a color.

294
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Separate colors.

295
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

296
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.590
Matthew Montano: Maybe a purple.

297
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And it could change later. That's fine for now it's purple. Is it a pastel like a soft purple or

298
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.770
Matthew Montano: Actually I was I was said, purple, but I was thinking like a like a sky blue

299
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: feel a sense of peaceful with that color.

300
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.740
Matthew Montano: Yeah. In that situation, we're talking about, hey,

301
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Look around the room and see if there are any windows in there.

302
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.680
Matthew Montano: There would be lots of with big windows.

303
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: windows open is there blinds or curtains. What do you see

304
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:48.570
Matthew Montano: Outside the windows, a nice bright warm summer day pretty clouds in the sky. The windows are open. There's a light cool breeze blowing did

305
00:32:54.990 --> 00:33:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: feel there is out here. We're coming into that window just allow your

306
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Allow your skin to feel up that cool air just came in. I feel it.

307
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it increases or decreases, but you can feel the distinction that windows open and I can feel the cool air it's moving so you can feel it.

308
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice the temperature is it just right. Is it a little too cold alone too warm. Was it just right.

309
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:32.220
Matthew Montano: Just right

310
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn your attention now to once you're here.

311
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Catch that uncensored first thing and key. Here's what

312
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:54.360
Matthew Montano: First thing that came to my mind is like any issue. I was facing that day, just being able to

313
00:33:55.530 --> 00:34:01.740
Matthew Montano: Be in there talking to my mom about it and her comfort.

314
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling okay so in order to feel her comfort. What do you think you need in that room just for this imagery. What do you need

315
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.610
Matthew Montano: Just her sitting on a nice couch next to me just

316
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely.

317
00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And it seems so

318
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I know ani. So, that's okay. We're getting it. We're getting just what you need.

319
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: We need that comfort.

320
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing like

321
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing like it now.

322
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unconditional and it's safe. And that's what

323
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You can get a tissue.

324
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want

325
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Important didn't show up.

326
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:28.920
Yeah yeah

327
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots to do with this room, but you just found something pretty important that MP needed

328
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: didn't have it.

329
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to have that

330
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to have that with you always.

331
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Because, look how intense that is

332
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What thoughts are accompanying the tears. What do you think

333
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.850
Matthew Montano: Was a good month

334
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.510
Matthew Montano: We're just, you know,

335
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:12.450
Matthew Montano: I felt like the times I needed her. She didn't understand me.

336
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.210
Matthew Montano: And we could communicate

337
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:21.630
Matthew Montano: And and my dad was there for me when I needed it. But it was, you know, I really want my mom to be there.

338
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.450
Matthew Montano: Was a lot of them.

339
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:32.010
Matthew Montano: And and then after she got her mum and dad divorced

340
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.470
Matthew Montano: You know, the family pretty much my brother only have a brother and

341
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.960
Matthew Montano: And his wife and

342
00:36:40.980 --> 00:37:01.770
Matthew Montano: hurt their kids, they just kind of abandoned her I was still there for her even though you know I felt like my brothers older than me. So he got the better years. It seemed like him. My brother and her head. You know more of a understand me, maybe because I was more emotional than my brother.

343
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.370
Matthew Montano: Just keep going. Yeah. And my, my mom.

344
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:19.620
Matthew Montano: There is a bit when she would take shoes. We they were doing foster care, they were taking care of foster kids and

345
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:30.840
Matthew Montano: There was, we would take him some foster kids. There's a girl that was having a lot of issues and my mom, I would watch her be there for her like I want her to be there for me.

346
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:41.250
Matthew Montano: And I think it's because she's so I was a guy. So she didn't understand or connect that I was a very like I had, I guess.

347
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:47.310
Matthew Montano: I was very emotional. She understands that. Now, when she does it. You know, there's just all that

348
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:56.970
Matthew Montano: We can't, you know, can't go back and fix that. But you know, I, you know, she was there for

349
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:05.790
Matthew Montano: There's a few foster kids that were girls that she was there for because there were kind of she caught when cutting himself, and she was. I remember her embracing her and

350
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:13.080
Matthew Montano: I remember that girl was having a problem at school. One of the other girls were picking on her and she went over there and she was gonna

351
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:27.090
Matthew Montano: She went up to those girls and was like, you know, you know, F with my, you know, my daughter, she called her my daughter and I wanted that but but the issue. I was dealing with was with I was gay. You know, so it was a lot of

352
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's we're right here at the top of the hour. Let's feel better. Matt, I want you to bring into your imagination.

353
00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The nurturing figure that we developed before, bring it into your imagination right now bring in

354
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.420
Matthew Montano: Know what the what which figure

355
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.430
Matthew Montano: Nurturing nurturing

356
00:38:48.120 --> 00:39:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Had you want to add mom during those years, you're welcome to right where you see her capability of giving exactly what you needed. She hasn't given to someone else, but it is a resource.

357
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It is available to you. So let's work hard. We're going to put this negative stuff, we'll put some of that maybe in the container. Maybe we'll send it

358
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: In a rocket ship. I don't know yet. But first, let's get very immersed in the quality surrounding you right maybe on that couch maybe picture your mom.

359
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Working what you need. Maybe she's holding you maybe she's rocking you, what do you see that would feel just perfect nurturing

360
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:45.030
Matthew Montano: Meet me just telling her how my day went well wrong her hugs me

361
00:39:46.230 --> 00:40:00.030
Matthew Montano: And maybe me crowding, you know, letting it out and and her, you know, same we're going to fix this. We're going to go fix this. I'm going to do whatever I have to, to help you fix this.

362
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we will fix this.

363
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Real there's you know that you've got some some training conditioning early on about crying. But that doesn't belong in therapy therapy. We cry and we get mad.

364
00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.460
Matthew Montano: I never cry so it's

365
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.590
Matthew Montano: I never pray

366
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So so so today will not get too much into judgment. Take your right hand and put it under your under your armpit here taking right

367
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Take your left hand and bring it across your body

368
00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Around your shoulder.

369
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Deeply into it and then wants you to picture the sensation of your mom holding you just feel it.

370
00:40:53.520 --> 00:41:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But whatever judgments pass by, or even rocket ship away as quick as they come. They disappear into the atmosphere and beyond. And instead, feel the touch that arm.

371
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And breathe into it. Just be present with touch.

372
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being contained that you get to let it all out.

373
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Whatever happened that day hard day.

374
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: reassurance that we will fix it.

375
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: The press and hold on.

376
00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Just keep breathing into it.

377
00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: picturing it empty is perhaps on the couch and you've shared your day.

378
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And she

379
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.330
Matthew Montano: Took a pillow.

380
00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and she knows just what to do.

381
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You folks you

382
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, everything's gonna be okay. We will fix this.

383
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: She knows what to do. You don't have to take care of her.

384
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: She's taking care of you.

385
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You just get to do you

386
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.750
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, there's no wrong way to do you

387
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's completely contained her arms and it's safe.

388
00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: The day. Good day, bad day an off day a medium boring loss, a blessing. But, there she is all the same.

389
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: With it. Let that imagery be so really see it.

390
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, where's the perfume and bring that awareness to mind be be present with the scent.

391
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.480
She holds you

392
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's quiet.

393
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just

394
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: No snow judgment.

395
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is it I am okay

396
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.880
Matthew Montano: How true is it

397
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.030
Matthew Montano: Right now.

398
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:40.080
Matthew Montano: I feel so bad you feel better when I do cry never cry so

399
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Be I'm okay.

400
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you give yourself permission to be okay or not okay who you are, what you're feeling right now.

401
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.020
Matthew Montano: Okay.

402
00:43:58.410 --> 00:43:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

403
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look

404
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me find out one to seven seven is it's absolutely true. I'm okay, or a different number one is I'm not okay.

405
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Seven is I am totally okay.

406
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.510
Matthew Montano: So I'm gonna I'm gonna be okay I'm

407
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna be okay.

408
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on my way.

409
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.850
Matthew Montano: Above away. Yeah.

410
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: My much like we will fix it, there's a movement towards the solution. And there's confidence in the solution.

411
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it was. We start to bring today to a close. What would you like to either put in the container or send a little bit further away if you want to. Otherwise you welcome obviously to sit with with tears.

412
00:44:47.910 --> 00:45:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's what would feel good to be close to those intense emotions don't want to come across like I want them to go away. I don't want to send the wrong message. Okay. And if you really I don't care if you cry, the full time.

413
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, but for you.

414
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to do what we feel like you can enjoy this day of yours, what we feel nurturing protective and why

415
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.930
Matthew Montano: Well, you said, what would I send away and then or what would feel nurturing

416
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do my image. Let's say we're at

417
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: NASA right and we're going to watch the ship when you get to keep is nurturing

418
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: With you. Someone hugging you you have wisdom.

419
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have protection, you have a dog. Dad, you have God, you have your gym, buddy. You're on.

420
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude your teams right here.

421
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.080
Yeah.

422
00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself permission to picture it. What would the dog be doing will be dead be done.

423
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't, don't let judgment bias any that you get exactly what you want. Over here, and this is this is the landing and the spaceships about to take off. What's heading out into outer space. What's sending what's going away.

424
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.860
Matthew Montano: My, my ex relationships quite away.

428
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:42.900

429
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Here and you picture your dog.

430
00:46:50.550 --> 00:47:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got all the nurturing what what is this belief that you will be everything you want to be. You will grow into this man that

431
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: All of this potential it's right next to this person offers nurture and support around your growth and your development.

432
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.050
architected and safe and off goes

433
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.520
Very fast.

434
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I think has a field to be lived here on earth as those go away fast.

435
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.420
Matthew Montano: Sounds good.

436
00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:34.770
Yeah.

437
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That's neat. And that

438
00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's today. That's what you get to do today, spend time. You could visit those negative networks, what if, what if, what if, what if, or you could spend time with your team be present with something important happening when your shoulders register with tension hands are sweating.

439
00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Something's happening. Maybe it's unconscious but pay attention to the messages so your body surround yourself with your team.

440
00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What do I need to do with all y'all around me. What do I really want to do. Maybe you want to work out. Maybe you want to eat something healthy you want to call a friend, maybe I want to sleep.

441
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Make your decision there with all around you, the likelihood that you will go do something that hurts your body that betrays your moral compass is decreased so much. Okay.

442
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So bring them around when you're about to make a decision about what you do today and see if you like, who you are, for the day.

443
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a decision to make. See if you like the choices you make with all of that resource around you. The dog right the quality of your dad and the protection and your trends.

444
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:56.580

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're, you're my last schedule client. I'm sorry. I ended once somebody throws me off and everybody kind of gets the shuffle.

463
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:22.440
Nicole Bacon: It's okay. And I tried to check in and they're taking a while so I thought I would check in after

464
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That sounds like a plan. I like it thinking

465
00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

466
00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You get a note open for you.

467
00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. But you can tell me kind of how sleep has been how eating has been. How you doing, kind of on those fundamental physiological things

468
00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:54.390
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, a lot, a lot more sleep than usual. I've been eating.

469
00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.630
Nicole Bacon: My fridge is packed so I've been eating a lot too. Okay.

470
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: To the point of eating emotionally or eating to fuel the body.

471
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.290
Nicole Bacon: Eating to feel like

472
00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the sleeping. Is this I'm depressed. I don't want to get out of bed sleep on defeated, or is it a I'm just fatigue and by golly, I just need to sleep.

473
00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.770
Nicole Bacon: I think it's a fatigue.

474
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.540
Nicole Bacon: What

475
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's from is this from you know you're you're bringing in this heavy duty medicine at the Suboxone I'm staying up late. Like what's the fatigue. Where's it coming from

476
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:33.270
Nicole Bacon: Um,

477
00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:50.370
Nicole Bacon: Well, every time I drive to Santa Fe and come back. It takes a couple days for me to like, I know it's fatigue, I guess, travel for me right now is fatigue, for me, so

478
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:51.870
Nicole Bacon: It's kind of building

479
00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.520
Nicole Bacon: That backup. Yeah.

480
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You do you think it has something to do with going to Santa Fe.

481
00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.070
Nicole Bacon: Probably, yeah.

482
00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:00.660
Okay.

483
00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you at in recovery sort of phase of this are you on third day you and the first day when when you come in. How long you been back from from there from Santa.

484
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:18.450
Nicole Bacon: And when do they come back because third day think third day

485
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is the first time, at least in the recent history that I've seen this decline and energy. What I've been witnessing over the last few sessions has been a steady

486
00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Vitality I've been watching this increased confidence. I've been watching that and today is the first time I'm seeing it go down a little. Am I picking up on the right thing.

487
00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:38.670
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm. Yeah.

488
00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're calling that fatigue.

489
00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what about during the day. What about how you're feeling when you're awake.

490
00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.740
Nicole Bacon: Oh, fine, fine when I'm awake. Yeah.

491
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

492
00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You were good before

493
00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:57.120
Nicole Bacon: I just don't

494
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Know it's fine and some

495
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: How many hours a day, are you, how many actually are you sleeping.

496
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:07.890
Nicole Bacon: Probably like

497
00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:10.620
Nicole Bacon: I don't know, like 12

498
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:28.920
Nicole Bacon: See, what did we do last time I guess what's new is I got my prescription for Quinn as a pan and I'm trying to make sure that like China.

499
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.950
Nicole Bacon: Not easy too much because it's at the smallest small stuffs.

500
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Prescribed it

501
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.220
Nicole Bacon: I can grab it. Okay, well,

502
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: This is, this is like high trust.

503
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.040
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

504
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, well, I'll take the doctor's name to

505
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:08.880
Nicole Bacon: Christina Carlson

506
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the dosage there.

507
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.540
Nicole Bacon: Point five milligrams

508
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:17.310
How often

509
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:21.990
Nicole Bacon: Take one

510
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.410
Nicole Bacon: twice daily, and that's a little bit too much for me. I realized

511
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

512
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:35.010
Nicole Bacon: So that's what's been going on with this leaked and stuff too.

513
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.720
Nicole Bacon: And as for me, it's like a half daily

514
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, so after

515
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What time of day are you taking we'll call it maybe

516
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course of a milligram what time of day.

517
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.810
Nicole Bacon: At night.

518
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:03.150
Nicole Bacon: But when I was following the directions that I mean I was out

519
00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Powerful, it's a very powerful one. That particular substance. I'm, I'm sure that Dr. Carlson Christina cross with you. This is one of the ones that if you do become chemically dependent on it.

520
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:31.410
Nicole Bacon: Oh, I know you can have seizures. I have friends have been dependent on it and I don't want to be dependent on it. I just want to use it when I need it when I'm feeling

521
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.610
Nicole Bacon: Something, sir, like, well,

522
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

523
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get into anxious and let's get into that.

524
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you are what you did is it sounds like you now have learned your body, you now know that's too much. It has quite a powerful effect. So you respond to it. Well, that's exciting. You won't need a lot and

525
00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What happens. You get to sleep.

526
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get into maybe finding out where you doing it as directed, or as needed, over the last, how many days and the differences

527
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't notice I was feeling anxious or Blab and I took it anyway because I wanted to do what the doctor said so, which was it went, what do you think was going on when you were taking it.

528
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.590
Nicole Bacon: I'm anxious

529
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:29.280
Nicole Bacon: Or honestly I was using it. When I was feeling like I wanted to go use. Okay.

530
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so something's happening at night.

531
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:33.210
Mm hmm.

532
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get into it. Let me hear about it. Let me hear what was the stinking thinking going on in there.

533
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:45.270
Nicole Bacon: Um me at night.

534
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:55.170
Nicole Bacon: That's when I kind of feel like I haven't done much during the day. I want to go do something

535
00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're bored.

536
00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:05.700
Nicole Bacon: I guess bored or anxious. Like, that's kind of when I would go get stuff.

537
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:07.950
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

538
00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you feeling right now.

539
00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Okay, so are you. Where's boredom.

540
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:22.560
Nicole Bacon: Right now I don't know cuz I just kind of woke up.

541
00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:25.620
All right.

542
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The opposite of boredom is what

543
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.630
Nicole Bacon: Excitement

544
00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:33.510
Nicole Bacon: getting stuff done.

545
00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.750
getting stuff done.

546
00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: At night.

547
00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going backwards. You going backwards and say, did I get stuff done. And I'm not excited. Is that what's happening.

548
00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:53.640
Nicole Bacon: I think so, yeah.

549
00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And so you can get excitement through substance.

550
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.730
Nicole Bacon: So I and I haven't had this refilled for like a month or two.

551
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:09.090
Nicole Bacon: This prescription

552
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.870
Nicole Bacon: But it doesn't help me go to sleep. Real, real easy.

553
00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So the pluses. It's an amazing medicine.

554
00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Dirt cheap these days. That's a nice thing downside get chemical dependence and you're trading one for the other. That both depressant also dangerous to be using at the same time. So,

555
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I love that you're using it in moderation. I'm assuming. Dr. Carlson knows that you're on Suboxone

556
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:44.730
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

557
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

558
00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk more about

559
00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A specific day. Let's take

560
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This one we noticed. Oh, yeah.

561
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I like how the end of the day when

562
00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And I felt maybe board or maybe there was more to it than boredom, but we'll find out. Can you pick a day will analyze that one.

563
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.870
Nicole Bacon: Um, see.

564
00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:16.470
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I guess yesterday.

565
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:19.530
Nicole Bacon: I was feeling a little

566
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.660
Nicole Bacon: Like fatigued from the, from the subs.

567
00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:33.810
Nicole Bacon: And was trying to get motivation and go do something and clean and I just kept getting back into bed.

568
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.930
Okay.

569
00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:45.060
Nicole Bacon: Then I was thinking, Oh, I'll take that and I'll feel better tomorrow.

570
00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The we call it Xanax because it's basically the same thing.

571
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: And is this. That's what she thought you take, and then you thought to be a better, more energetic day

572
01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:01.080
Nicole Bacon: Better tomorrow. Yeah.

573
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a true you feel better today.

574
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:09.960
Nicole Bacon: I do feel better. It just, it's a little groggy waking them.

575
01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:20.010
Nicole Bacon: Not like Benadryl groggy, like that's extra like will all through the day, but like initially waking up.

576
01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.820
Nicole Bacon: It's a little bit harder. Okay.

577
01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How many minutes. Have you been up already.

578
01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.860
Nicole Bacon: 30 minutes

579
01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:35.520
Nicole Bacon: Okay. I mean, I was wriggling around for a little bit and my cat was like, man. Yeah, my

580
01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Not for long. Okay.

581
01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:39.360
So, yeah.

582
01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it might be wise to come up with

583
01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What to do at night.

584
01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And

585
01:00:55.140 --> 01:01:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's assess who you have right now. There's been times where we've had, I think it was

586
01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Me see Barbie, Barbie, Barbie, Barbie okay so Barbie was up in your life. Let me just do a little check in and see if she in your life and he was

587
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:15.780
Nicole Bacon: Talking and we have all

588
01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:29.190
Nicole Bacon: At all. We had a big miscommunication and her family bought me a flight before I could check into even see and

589
01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:37.830
Nicole Bacon: She left it off like oh I need some time and then I wrote her a couple emails and then nothing

590
01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I want to point something out.

591
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: See what you think of, do you know that when I had invited you to come up with a think it was a nurturing figure, Jr. You thought or her

592
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.790
Yeah.

593
01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of that now.

594
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:21.000
Nicole Bacon: It's the same type of figure that I realize it's like the same type of figure that Allah was that Barbie is like the same type of person that kind of gets a fire lit under my butt. But in the long run, it's, it's all

595
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:29.910
Nicole Bacon: It all for them it's doing stuff for them. So it took a minute to realize that

596
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but that's okay. That's yours. For now, you know it, you'll recognize an L a Barbie that you can recognize that creative juices are flowing, but maybe exploitation is happening.

597
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:45.870
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

598
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

599
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah okay so let's revisit nurturing figure it's too important. We just can't risk getting it wrong. It's just too critical let's revisit it again.

600
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So scan.

601
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: real or imagined.

602
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: In your life.

603
01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no mixed message there was no rug pulled out from under you.

604
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This person wants me to grow and develop into everything that is possible.

605
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I want my happiness.

606
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: catch a glimpse WHO IS IT what is IT

607
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:31.500
Nicole Bacon: Cheyenne

608
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: He's she's your wise figure. So she also shares

609
01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And attributes attribute of nurturing to

610
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.780
Nicole Bacon: I don't know about nurturing

611
01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:45.810
Nicole Bacon: Guys.

612
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:52.170
Nicole Bacon: I can't really think I mean, my mom and away, but she scares me sometimes.

613
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not going to

614
01:03:53.850 --> 01:04:03.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Have the can have a mixture. That's why we're working hard at this don't don't have to push it. So you notice how you're rolling it out. And that's not Shannon, it's not mom. There's, there's, it's not consistent

615
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go more metaphor. Let's go more animal. Let's go more to sort of that spiritual

616
01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: shaman Rell let's go to movies you've seen, let's go to novels. Let's go to archetype. Let's go expand that resource.

617
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.330
Nicole Bacon: Hmm, um,

618
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:33.630
Nicole Bacon: I don't know, like my own like

619
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:36.360
Nicole Bacon: Wise.

620
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.540
Nicole Bacon: higher being, I don't know.

621
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep looking. Let's try something in school to remember seeing someone who

622
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, got you.

623
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.470
Nicole Bacon: Miss Kofi

Gwenevere Abriel: Did she wants you to grow and develop in your own unique way.

625
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.190
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

626
01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because she benefited from it, but because she just has that like oh my students, look. Look how unique she is. She's going to turn into exactly what she's supposed to. She's going to evolve into her own unique self.

627
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:26.160
Nicole Bacon: Yeah. Shoot, I mean, she was always my favorite teacher

628
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.900

Yeah.

633
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Now check in with your body and see if this. This is really working for you.

634
01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe that Miss goes he wanted the best for me.

635
01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you have that quality, maybe you can pull in this recollection of her voice.

636
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that that sense of nurturing your development and growth.

637
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Any resistance anything get activated in your body that's saying no, that's not quite right.

638
01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.190
Nicole Bacon: No way.

639
01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Does far out. We got it.

640
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And that could change to that's fine. There's no wrong way to do it. Just want to make sure that it's useful.

641
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:30.870
Nicole Bacon: But is it better than it's like a physical person in my life or

642
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it better. Um, that's a really loaded question.

643
01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Would also be better than none of my clients ever had any trauma that they were never hurt disappointed let down abandoned abused molested, I mean, yeah, I would be better.

644
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:53.010
Nicole Bacon: Right.

645
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.390
It happens.

646
01:06:57.330 --> 01:06:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Know there's

647
01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:02.070
Nicole Bacon: A lot of people don't like have those

648
01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Know a lot of people don't

649
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:05.610
Nicole Bacon: Realize in their life. Right.

650
01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. You are, you are normal. You are normal. The fact that you had to work hard to find that image.

651
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:13.920
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

652
01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: My population you. This is my piece right here, the ones that mean you don't need the therapy if you've already got it.

653
01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right.

654
01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:24.660
Yeah.

655
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Then immediately go to MOM, DAD. GRANDMA you meet people Elma sister right we immediately they

656
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Like this. I know the now not not not my peeps.

657
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:41.760
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

658
01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I say real or imagined giving you just this vast array of permission.

659
01:07:50.700 --> 01:08:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Because people betray us they've heard us. They are selfish. They wouldn't, you know, we can forgive and all that, but it's real. They do, they do exploit us they

660
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: They do, and how do I live in this world. Nonetheless, and love anyway risk. Anyway, how do I get from here to there. How do we navigate this. That's the work

661
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.410
Right.

662
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To get the answer.

663
01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:17.760
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, definitely.

664
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So, Miss go see. And then for protective figure check in with your body. Make sure this still rings true to check and make sure there wasn't any people pleasing going on when we first developed it, okay, you have a spirit guide woman with long silver hair for protective

665
01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Can add more to it. You can add more figures. It doesn't have to stand alone.

666
01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:58.920
Nicole Bacon: Sure, I mean sometimes I think of Joel my partner that diet as like

667
01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:02.550
Nicole Bacon: He wouldn't want me to be doing stupid shit.

668
01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:09.630
Nicole Bacon: Tell me how to write good protector type

669
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

670
01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to check in on that one, too, to see if it's got any ambivalence to it.

671
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just try this on as the scenario of Joe We're here with me and I was talking to him, would he and I see eye to eye about mental health spiritual health, physical health. Would you say he and I would see eye to eye or we might have a nice sparring match about what's healthy

672
01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:45.390
Nicole Bacon: I don't know.

673
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a real stretch

674
01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:56.970
Nicole Bacon: Well, that's like, I mean, when he was alive, maybe. Yeah, you guys would spar, but to me and how I imagined him.

675
01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:17.340
Nicole Bacon: I would imagine him that he'd walk to the best for me and that he sorry that he showed me the drugs and he wouldn't want me stuck and he'd want me to be the best that I could be because there was points, other than the drug use, where he was teaching me a lot of

676
01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:35.130
Nicole Bacon: I was growing exponentially with him other than the drug use and all aspects. So spiritually about the world like he was like a guide guide, he was he was my guide who is my spiritual guide while he was alive.

677
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so hold that truth check in with your body. I know it's scary and risky sometimes, right, because maybe I'll say something right but don't worry about it. I'm more interested in your opinion, not, not mine, mine is not not as relevant and important as your yours is the important one.

678
01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So get close to that quality.

679
01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Of Joel right

680
01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you feel safe with that quality.

681
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.110
Nicole Bacon: No.

682
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay, we have this other stuff taught me exponentially. He was the guy. It's okay.

683
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let me ask you something. Let's, let's use a point of departure. Let's use

684
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Those just start with me.

685
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to look at me and I want you to maybe say um I'll trust some things about to

686
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: See if any of. That's true. I'm trust some sounds fishy.

687
01:11:55.410 --> 01:12:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm making you say it. So you can say whatever you want, right, because it's not it's forced it's

688
01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:03.840
Nicole Bacon: Controlling something fishy about you.

689
01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: About you suspect. I don't feel completely safe with you.

690
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.590
Nicole Bacon: Know I feel completely safe, you know,

691
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you do.

Nicole Bacon: Those years of therapy. I don't know. It's just like like

710
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:49.710
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, like a guide person.

711
01:13:52.260 --> 01:14:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So watch what happens. Try and make contact and I know it seems really funky. But there's a lot that happens when we're looking at each other and we're stuck with this Tele health stuff. So just see what happens to you if you say

712
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know. I'm making you do it so you can always kick it right out the door, but I want you to pay attention to how you feel. This is where the

713
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not digging for a compliment. But I'm going to, I want you to say thank you. When I'm here for

714
01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What are those things. See what happens. But say it to me but but hold on to yourself and don't look away if you can

715
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.870
Nicole Bacon: OK. OK.

716
01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So the work is, see what happens, how you feel when you say thank you. When a beer for. See if you can name it.

717
01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.150
Nicole Bacon: Thank you, Gwen affair for

718
01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.250
Nicole Bacon: believing in me and giving me

719
01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:58.140
Nicole Bacon: Some, some extra chances

720
01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.710
Nicole Bacon: And seeing that I do want to change and grows, seeing that part in

721
01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How you feel. Having said that,

722
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:12.420
Nicole Bacon: I'm not going to cry.

723
01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And is it real. Do you actually I know I made you do it. Um, but that's gratitude.

724
01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Up but to be grateful to someone is to risk that someone might pull it away from us. It's a scary vulnerable place to trust someone to believe that this resource might be available that this is real, can I trust this

725
01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:40.560
Right.

726
01:15:43.620 --> 01:16:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so then sad because what if it's gone. Or, you know, because in the past the Barbie. The Elena, there's been an exploitation, then a switch. Will it happen again, you know, is this promise. I'm making is it real. The she really want me to to she really see it's scary.

727
01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:05.430
Yeah.

728
01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, there's this poem

729
01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And one line. It goes something like this. I'm going to, I'm horrible poetry. So I'll probably annihilated, but I'll do my best. Okay, there's one line has to do with it's easier to betray your benefactor than a weight new benefaction

730
01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's so heart wrenching to to need to write to get right to really lean on someone when some of the heartache and wounding is around trust and

731
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's easier. You just

732
01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Not lean not need

733
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:49.380
Nicole Bacon: My yeah

734
01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're right, you're right about that beautiful question you asked earlier. Isn't it better to actually have a real person and

735
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously it

736
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:02.760
Would be convenient.

737
01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But you recognize something here and I happen to know my intentions are good. I do you know so I can trust them. Like, I trust myself. I happen to be someone that I actually really do care about people.

738
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think you picked a good person to to have a little bit of vulnerability with I think you registering something,

739
01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I know her very well be.

740
01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's look elsewhere. Let's scan again.

741
01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's scan. Again, the whole history. And let's look again for features of this

742
01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone believed in you someone that believed in you right someone that gave you extra chances

743
01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.390
And

744
01:17:55.470 --> 01:18:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: In their present you read in their presence you recognized your own desire to want to change. Those are the people

745
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That you want to draw in

746
01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: When you notice in yourself. I want to change.

747
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Their accepting I've got this forgiveness. Right.

748
01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And they believe in you.

749
01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Know how they can exploit you with how they they see you not what they can get from you.

750
01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the tricky. Good.

751
01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.070
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, kiwi and James has been

752
01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.880
Nicole Bacon: People like that. Definitely.

753
01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.150
Go over here to your

754
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Your figures over here on your list. I'm going to go to

755
01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.930
Nicole Bacon: And scarlet. I mean, scarlet from the sun.

756
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:59.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Scarlett and Kaylee, and James

757
01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:16.410
Nicole Bacon: Kelly and James Yeah, like, yeah, they all believe in me, they all give me lots of chances and they, I think they already know what's going on, but they haven't pressured me to be like tell me exactly what's going on.

758
01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, meaning the addiction.

759
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:21.990
That's, yeah. Okay.

760
01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So if, if, do they land more with the quality, much like Miss go see

761
01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: As in nurturing. They want the best for you. They want you to grow develop

762
01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:46.530
Nicole Bacon: Scarlet. Definitely. Yeah. Cuz I mean that coincides with making money and building playing tell she's the owner this on so

763
01:19:47.820 --> 01:20:01.050
Gwenevere Abriel: What about protective because we're trying to cultivate this other one we saw it in here with me and what we registered with some of these features does Scarlett Keely, or James, do they kind of have this embodiment of a quality.

764
01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.020
Of protector.

765
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.100
Nicole Bacon: Scarlet. Yeah, a little bit. Definitely.

766
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there ambivalence about that. Are there times when she's a scary threatening.

767
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:20.640
Nicole Bacon: Know, she'd know always she wants is the best for me and

768
01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:30.300
Nicole Bacon: Sometimes she doesn't know that I'm fatigued, or whatever. And she's like, let's

769
01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:32.550
Nicole Bacon: You know,

770
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.940
Nicole Bacon: Let's work on building clients for you.

771
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So little sometimes there's a misalignment so check and see what let me hear out loud, what quality about her symbolizes pro Texan.

772
01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.650
Nicole Bacon: I think I have all these just like food.

773
01:20:57.090 --> 01:20:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrong. There's no

774
01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Wrong, you know,

775
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:13.920
Nicole Bacon: Protection protection, protection. Those are my parents protection protective though who because I get protective over my friends who gets protective over me.

776
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.070
Nicole Bacon: I don't know. Right.

777
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why we're having trouble with this one.

778
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:19.950
Yeah.

779
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:21.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

780
01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:22.380
Nicole Bacon: No.

781
01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But we saw it in here with me. And so what we did was we recognized it in here with me. And we started again to scan.

782
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you hurried and it's no we don't want to rush it. We don't want to grab the parents and you know we need this to be legit because this is the inner weaving. We're going to be inner weaving this into some of these negative cognition.

783
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no no we gotta get this. So it's the truth. It's your truth.

784
01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And if it means that we use an imaginary figure than we got to do it.

785
01:21:52.740 --> 01:22:04.770
Nicole Bacon: Well, is there like, Okay, well, my friend, Derek from back in Portland. He checks in on me every couple months about my addiction. I don't know. Is that protective

786
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what comes up and you picture, Derek. If I were to say, Okay, we're going to have Derek, we're going to have Miss Cosi scarlet Keeley James and Shannon all together interacting as this team resource team. And by the way, you're more than welcome to have me there too.

787
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:27.720
Nicole Bacon: Until. Yeah. You too.

788
01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:28.320
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

789
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want, you can have me as the protective figure

790
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:32.910
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

791
01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:36.330
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. So there's not a real person.

792
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:37.860
Yeah.

793
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm definitely

794
01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I hope. And it's true. Um, that's a phrase I use a lot. I'll tell the doctor. So I'll say I see my role is very much not only protecting each individual in in a group setting.

795
01:22:51.540 --> 01:23:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: But sort of the whole group. And as you talk to, because people will come at you and I need to protect you. And so I really resonate with that role so that that fits really well with me. And so you can have that anytime

796
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can. Yeah, please. Maybe there's something you've seen me do especially around

797
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I couldn't write fast enough, but my belief in you feels like protection. I believe in you. I give you chances and you get to have this experience of a desire to want to change in the presence of someone protecting you. I wanted

798
01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.980
Nicole Bacon: When someone's protecting me

799
01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to grow. I feel safe when someone's protecting me

800
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:37.140
Nicole Bacon: Definitely

801
01:23:38.190 --> 01:23:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: There we got it so therapist also common just to throw in the your normal

802
01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Case, just in case you wanted to defend, there's this weird. It's not your

803
01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:52.830
Therapist.

804
01:23:54.120 --> 01:24:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. We got Shannon for wise, we've got Miss Kofi scarlet Kelly and James and if these change shape that's all fine, too. OK. And then for now we have

805
01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:05.580
We have

806
01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapist, or do you want name do you want when one of your we want in there.

807
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:14.310
Nicole Bacon: When got it therapist Quinn. Okay.

808
01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me see when we got are doing good. Let's see. Let's do a little bit more. I want to check in on something I want to check. First, let me see how you're feeling. Now, we had a little bit of a moment earlier. Let me, let me see how you're doing at this point.

809
01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.050
Right feeling

810
01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:43.680
Nicole Bacon: A little sweaty and saying this questions. I'm like, I don't know.

811
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.090
Nicole Bacon: Because a lot of my I feel like a lot of

812
01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.760
Nicole Bacon: My people that have had those roles for me, have been

813
01:24:54.780 --> 01:25:03.120
Nicole Bacon: Switching around and changing throughout my life and especially like now so

814
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:16.530
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, there'll be people that are really in my life. And then they'll just poof disappear. That happens to me a lot. I'll get real close to someone and then they poof disappear and

815
01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:22.140
Nicole Bacon: So that's a lot of my leg trust and getting close to people issues.

816
01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the psychology behind this. I'm a pretty transparent person. There's no big mystery of what I'm doing the psychology behind it is

817
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: The fact that you can recognize these features and qualities and others means they're true in you and they don't actually disappear. There's no fluff.

818
01:25:45.150 --> 01:25:45.510
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

819
01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So they're there. And so the ultimate goal is not dependence. Of course, of course. I don't want a client to be dependent I want right interdependence this nice flow of give and take, and

820
01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The ultimate goal is you're going to recognize these things in yourself and they don't disappear and you get to be there for yourself again and again and again and you get to use this imagery and over time. It's just, it's all you.

821
01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:14.550
Nicole Bacon: You see me.

822
01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine, we can use for some people it's it's some archetypes, or it's animals or it's some you know one person had Iron Man.

823
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

824
01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Just make sense.

825
01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.220
So,

826
01:26:36.630 --> 01:26:36.900
Right.

827
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But notice that what came up was, well, that's all fine. Yeah. Yeah. But it may disappear, and can I can I trust it will be there for me because there's this transient nature of history for you. It's just puts it disappears.

828
01:26:52.110 --> 01:27:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But again, the goal is, it was you all along. You were there all along, and it's just this sort of forgetting somehow. And it can be really old can be like since tiny tot or even in your general week right it's me versus this outside world and how do I be okay with being me and

829
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: People just

830
01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of either never learned it, or maybe forgot. And so it's just going to be this remembering and integrating the resources that are really are there for you. Okay.

831
01:27:25.770 --> 01:27:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's a neat way to do it through metaphor and imagery

832
01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

833
01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that we had that discussion kind of check in with your body and see what charge is still left. Let's do a scan just sort of maybe work it through. Feeling. Feeling are paying attention to your cap.

834
01:27:47.430 --> 01:28:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice how it crosses in some places, maybe it's warmer in some places and fill your hair kind of notice the hair even temperature changes at the top of your forehead notice your eyes, nose, your cheeks inside your mouth just notice your neck throat and those shoulders.

835
01:28:10.890 --> 01:28:11.940
Nicole Bacon: My shoulders.

836
01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on with those soldiers right

837
01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Here.

838
01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:17.760
Yeah.

839
01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:21.510
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

840
01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. Their messengers.

841
01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:32.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And all you need to do is just pay attention. There's no judgment. There's just what is

842
01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay attention to your natural breath.

843
01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to the texture that you notice on your arms and and how it might change as you pay attention to your hands.

844
01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:54.210
