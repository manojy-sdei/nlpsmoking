April E: And I guess she was one of the supervisors favorite on that line, because any other line. I didn't have any problems, but my boss told me to fight it because he said I'm a good worker. And this is a temp agency.

167
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.570
April E: That I've been working for for a long time.

168
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:40.740
Richelle Direny: And. But then, but then when you said that you keep getting fired from the job yeah this is through the same agency that you they've been sending you on different

169
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:57.300
April E: I know I've actually don't think I've gotten let go from them ever but due to this what's going on.

April E: You know, so I don't know.

177
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.830
April E: You know how some women get a certain age to where they get jealous of other women.

178
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:45.090
Richelle Direny: But then this is about. Remember we talked about this, the last time you said that you feel it's that because of the

179
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:53.340
Richelle Direny: Culture in which you work of the, the women in their age group, and you are a little bit older, you feel like the

180
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.100
Richelle Direny: You're being they're being picked over you or they're

181
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.020

185
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.460
Richelle Direny: So,

186
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:35.580
Richelle Direny: I think it's just kind of like okay for the last job, let's just go with the Nice job. How long were you there before they they

187
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.510

April E: I was there from yeah

189
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.980

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.760
Richelle Direny: This is the last job.

193
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.280
April E: Yeah, that was FedEx

194
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.690
April E: Fast paced our promise.

195
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:15.090
April E: Unless I needed help, and it's come up and you have to move so fast on that job.

196
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:25.740
April E: Here you're kind of throwing you're throwing boxes, but you're pushing them to the world fans to the side about and everything like that and

197
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.660
April E: So, but I was by myself.

198
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:41.880
April E: Power, you know, on a bell, and I would mean splitter. I love the job, but it was a part time job.

199
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:51.300
Richelle Direny: Got You Got You Got terminated or did they just, um, what is it,

200
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.980
Richelle Direny: Later.

201
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:57.600
April E: Because

202
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:13.080
April E: That went to the doctor and I was feeling really weak and there's no way I could push 30,000 boxes that night. So I went to my doctor and she filled out

203
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:31.260
April E: A slip for me that she wanted me off for three to four days it was 22nd to the 25th and I talked to my operations manager every single night.

204
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:54.960
April E: He said, I would be okay just fine. Don't worry about it. I'M GLAD YOU KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME, AND THEN JANUARY 31 she took me in the office and said, Well, I, bro. It didn't work. I couldn't fight for you. I said, really, he's like yeah and I hate to tell you that, but he's quit since then.

205
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:03.120
April E: And he was there for years, but I guess every six months, you can go back there and reapply

206
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.180
Richelle Direny: And this is a

207
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:16.260
April E: It's a FedEx, but understand it, like in January, February, you only get like 10 hours.

208
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:24.360
April E: You know, come Christmas time one year, you know, we was going over eight hours tonight.

209
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.950
April E: They hired so many people that

210
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:39.210
April E: You know, we didn't get nearly as much hours so I held on that job for days long as I could but I think it was because

211
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.480
April E: I was seeing mental health. Doctor, which had me on Adderall.

212
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.500
April E: I was more focused and

213
00:22:50.670 --> 00:23:00.240
April E: I told him, I said, I only want this for my work, I don't want to throw anything else. So I'm not going to be taking all the time, only one more thing.

214
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.760
April E: And

215
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.620
April E: That seemed to help because my, I just can't.

216
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.670
April E: scatterbrained you know

217
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:30.480
Richelle Direny: But do you think that, do you think that you, um, because of maybe the medication that you're on and just kind of things that's going on with you medically make you you know if you're scattered green as you're saying maybe forgetful. Um,

218
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.520
Richelle Direny: Yeah, it's affecting the job.

219
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.430

226
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.640
April E: Little

April E: So, you know, and How long am I going to be on this planet.

364
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.560
Richelle Direny: This is what I would recommend to temp agency.

365
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.010
Richelle Direny: This is what I would recommend April, because you have a lot going on and you got a lot like you're kind of focusing on

366
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:52.080
Richelle Direny: And it kind of taking you like in so many different directions and things to think about.

367
00:36:52.560 --> 00:37:02.040
Richelle Direny: You're saying that there is, um, the Amazon in your area or you are is hiring. What I would suggest is that you can you follow that.

368
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.310
Richelle Direny: Instead of like kind of continuing on.

369
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:05.940
Into

370
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.910
Richelle Direny: You said it's in Cincinnati.

371
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.180
And

372
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.290
April E: He had that damage on it.

373
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.650
Richelle Direny: And that's the four hours away. Yeah.

374
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.790
Richelle Direny: Is there anything else that you can

375
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:27.510
Richelle Direny: Identify and do while you're here in where you are because what part of Ohio. Are you in

376
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:36.120
April E: Mansfield, Ohio, and I think I've had three jobs a year.

377
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.410
April E: Including surrounding areas.

378
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.800
April E: So look for jobs at a time.

379
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:57.090
Richelle Direny: But I would recommend that you stay kind of focus on, you know, seeing him instead of an agency if there was something else, like is there like a local store like a Walmart or something like that you can apply and workout.

380
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:09.630
April E: I'm sure but I did retail and I loved. I was the manager of goodwill. I loved it.

381
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.400
April E: And

382
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:25.830
April E: I ended up getting fired to have no idea. I've never read I got unemployment from them because they find that they fire you for some reason you employment.

383
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:28.560
Richelle Direny: Yes.

384
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:40.980
Richelle Direny: Yes, that is true. Yeah, you need when you get terminated if there's not a reason or any kind of clause or it wasn't a reprimand or a write up prior for the same reason you can get unemployment.

385
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.980
April E: Rate.

April E: Say that again.

390
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.490
Richelle Direny: Good no good to continue what you were saying the last job that one.

391
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.320
April E: The last job, I had no

392
00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:30.510
April E: It was fast from 2000 to 2007. That's the longest job I've ever had.

393
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.500

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:49.890
April E: Worked in emergency room.

397
00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:59.760
Richelle Direny: So the jobs that you've had.

398
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.440
Richelle Direny: Longevity in it.

399
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:11.880
Richelle Direny: Um, maybe trying those applying to that and seeing where you are and seeing if you can get a, you know, you get a job.

400
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.500
April E: Put that down.

401
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:26.880
April E: Why I smoke so no hospital around here hires you

402
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.700
April E: If you smoke.

403
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:42.990
April E: So you guys well quit smoking, well you know what I've added I quit everything else. And I don't have a desire to quit smoking ready bored to death.

404
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.690
April E: So,

405
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:52.680
April E: I had this dream is because I believe in pay to get a workout.

406
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.640
April E: There's a lot of things I gotta think about Rochelle and

407
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:16.260
April E: One of them is maybe I need to go see a back to the center like the center is a rehabilitation counseling, you know, and

408
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.320
April E: Still have

410
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:38.820
April E: But I'd be moving with my brother, which moved down to Cincinnati. He is a cop.

411
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:44.460
April E: And sister is

412
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.930

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.560
April E: And, you know, they all got

414
00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:57.990

415
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:02.430
Richelle Direny: Look like I said

416
00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:05.280
Richelle Direny: I

417
00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:18.330
Richelle Direny: There is just, there's just so much going on. And, um, you know, maybe when the next time that we meet, we can just sit down and kind of think about, like, kind of go over your work stream kind of and make a plan accordingly.

418
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:32.100
Richelle Direny: To see what jobs. Have you had the ones that that you've been on the longest kind of what what transpired. Because right now, you're feeling somewhat hopeless about getting jobs and losing them and not really knowing the reason why you're losing them.

419
00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:33.150
Richelle Direny: And kind of

420
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:43.080
Richelle Direny: You know, kind of like picking that apart. Um, so let's when we need the next time. Let's Let's Let's like review back a little bit more in depth.

421
00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:51.990
Richelle Direny: Because I think that that will give you a little bit of a little bit of hope as to understand what is it that you need to do to improve. Maybe you're employable.

422
00:42:52.440 --> 00:43:04.170
Richelle Direny: For your abilities skills and or just being able to identify so you'll know what to work on for that next job that you go for and not feeling so defeated because of the people you work with.

April E: Yeah.

424
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.530

April E: I know I say more focus that I have my Adderall, but that it's a controlled substance and then I know my Xanax me. It helps me know girls are talking to me and I'm picking up a broom, you know, but those who controlled some

427
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:56.340
April E: And they don't you know and then I'm on the Savvy tech, which I need to get off to that if I was off, it would probably prescribed me. I know they would both of those, because that's what I need. But you can't get that stuff in Ohio. When you're on.

428
00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.270
April E: Suboxone or whatever.

429
