4
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.820
iPhone: Hi. I was

5
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.710
iPhone: A little

6
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.930
iPhone: Little meditation.

7
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How are you okay crazy how are you

8
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.750
iPhone: Oh, it's been that way for about a week so little crazy. Yeah.

9
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.530
iPhone: I think there's a lot of planetary action.

10
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.910
iPhone: They're

11
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.810
Going

12
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Holy cow. It's just been one thing after another and for you for the week.

13
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.160
iPhone: Yeah. Yeah, just a little bit crazy.

14
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.040
iPhone: Yeah, it's like the full moon which

15
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.760
iPhone: Was a delayed reaction over here.

16
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Until it feels here too.

17
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:47.820
iPhone: Oh, I'm, I'm, do I feel quite good quite I've been physically very fatigued, but mentally quite good.

18
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.240
iPhone: Working a lot

19
00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:12.180
iPhone: Yeah, and just maintaining this week. I didn't do anything, usually I try to get out and do something at least on my weekend days to qualify as fun, but I just decided to rest this weekend, and I'm glad I did it. I stayed in jammies all one day and I felt very good about it.

20
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, we need days like that, don't we

21
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.590
Uh huh.

22
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.740
iPhone: Yes. Excuse me. Yes.

23
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.440
iPhone: And been working on my energy and trying to keep it clear and

24
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.050
iPhone: Doing those types of meditations, or you know affirmations.

25
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.170
And I'm working

26
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:51.990
iPhone: I don't know. I'm not sure it's, um, this is, this one is kind of a whole probably just about a five day journey I've included people with me. People that have been on my heart and people that I know could use it.

27
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.710
iPhone: Excuse me I'm releasing energy now.

28
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.110
iPhone: But I wish you know i already committed them to this program. So there are along for the ride.

29
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.220
iPhone: I was still caregiving

30
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh god.

31
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.110
Yeah.

32
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.730
iPhone: Yeah.

33
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how's everything been going on at home.

34
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.330
iPhone: A little silly.

35
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:33.510
iPhone: A little silly. I think he, my husband has not smoked pot for a few days or something. And so he's acting like a two year old who lost his baby blanket.

36
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.530
iPhone: Yeah.

37
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long

38
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is, how long have you been smoking weed marijuana. Sorry.

39
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.790
iPhone: Probably

40
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.590
iPhone: Oh, probably his whole life, and he had

41
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.480
iPhone: He had quit drinking 27 years ago, but then about 17 years ago or

42
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.990
iPhone: Somewhere along there started smoking pot.

43
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And has been smoking it

44
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.750
iPhone: For most of this whole time.

45
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:13.560
iPhone: And he quits once in a while, but everyone around him suffers for it. So usually, some will say, why don't you just go fucking smoke.

46
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.300
iPhone: And

47
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:27.300
iPhone: And something I haven't said that, and nobody. I don't think my son has said that and but I think he's hoping that will say that he's misbehaving so terribly

48
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:38.850
iPhone: But that's what that is. I it was funny because I was thinking about it earlier. He's just so stupid when he smokes, but I forgot how he is when he quit.

49
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:51.150
iPhone: So what is it. So that's his journey. And if he content, you know, if he wants to do it without pop that would be nice and nice change for everybody.

50
00:05:51.540 --> 00:06:05.220
iPhone: But that's what you know his journey. I'm not playing the game. I'm not, I'm not caressing him and soothing calming congratulating him for a job well done. I'm just not. I'm just not getting involved.

51
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, that's not a bad idea.

52
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.420
iPhone: Yeah, kind of keeping my mouth shut about the whole thing.

53
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:20.160
iPhone: And pretending like I don't hear his moans and literally verbal moans and groans and

54
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.650
iPhone: So yeah, he's an ever present thing but I I've kind of tuned them out. I've tried to

55
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, so did you

56
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Were you able to get over to that shop.

57
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.890
iPhone: Yes, I stopped in the shop, but I didn't get a massage. Yet I stopped in and sat

58
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.950
iPhone: And actually canceled my massage that I had last Friday, cuz I was just

59
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.100
iPhone: I was just too tired.

60
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.250
iPhone: I wanted to go home instead

61
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.670
iPhone: By Friday, but I had stopped in over the weekend and just sat for a little bit.

62
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.500
iPhone: And

63
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:16.830
iPhone: It felt good it felt good. It's, you know, I have all these ideas of wanting to do things for me. Yesterday I saw something about it, an acrylic painting class.

64
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:27.750
iPhone: And gosh, I would love that. And I might look into that all these things always sound good when I sign up or when I think of it, but then it's like a chore. When I have to

65
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.370
iPhone: Learn the time comes.

66
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To

67
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.610
You. Yeah.

68
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.200
iPhone: Yeah.

69
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The class.

70
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.370
iPhone: The class. It's just one month.

71
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.860
iPhone: It's just one, four weeks, two hours on Tuesday nights.

72
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:58.440
iPhone: So that might be nice and not too much and Tuesdays at like today Tuesday. If I still have some energy, you know, to give. And it's very close to my home. So there's not many reasons I shouldn't go

73
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.250
iPhone: So I will inquire further I got it on

74
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.250
iPhone: Their website this morning, but I did not

75
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.180
iPhone: See what I need. It's all have to make a phone call.

76
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

77
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.210
And

78
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:26.100
iPhone: I think I, I used to be so creative and loved doing various things and haven't done anything for a long time in that area. I think it'll be very good for me.

79
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.840
Every part of my

80
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think it will be too. I think that massager be good for you to

81
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.740
iPhone: Right, right.

82
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:36.390
iPhone: Right.

83
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.720
iPhone: And funny that way, Rebecca, cuz

84
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:52.350
iPhone: I don't know what it is, because I know I'm worth it. And I know I love it. But if someone at work needs me. I go, oh, they need me at work. I better take care of them first.

85
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.060
Hmm.

86
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.010
iPhone: I know

87
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It is

88
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.920
iPhone: Pattern. I don't know.

89
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.140
iPhone: I'm not sure.

90
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.110
iPhone: Because I do feel worthy of it.

91
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:06.630
iPhone: But

92
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Remember you've been a caregiver for how long.

93
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.390
iPhone: Yes, decades.

94
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how old is your son.

95
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.490
iPhone: 27

96
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:25.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so, you know, a minimum of 27 years you've been a been a caregiver to somebody other than yourself.

97
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.120
Yeah.

98
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so, you know, that's a long time to

99
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be caring for everybody else.

100
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:47.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's why it's that's why it feels the way that it does whenever you go to do something for yourself and you'll take that side route to help somebody else first because that's what's natural

101
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.270
iPhone: Probably, yes. Yeah.

102
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.070
iPhone: Yes, so I have to break the habit.

103
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, at least at least work on it you know be be

104
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Be willing to do something and commit and honestly when

105
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:18.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you said that you didn't go to your massage, but you're thinking about signing up for a class that's four weeks, two hours long.

106
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And Raj is

107
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.360
One hour.

108
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.270
iPhone: I'm like,

109
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:35.580
iPhone: Right. I know, I know, I know you're right. Yeah. Okay.

110
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:37.410
iPhone: Right.

111
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's all we were talking about you doing is committing one hour one time.

112
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.210
iPhone: Right.

113
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.100
iPhone: Period. Right.

114
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:53.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, I do have to tell you, walking in and sitting in the place and being able to sit there, you know, is a step forward.

115
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.800
iPhone: You know, yes, yes.

116
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you did do that.

117
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, right.

118
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's one step.

119
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:12.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would definitely i i think that i if I were you, I would commit to something that's only a one time event before I expand

120
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

121
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't care what is something that's a one time event that you're able to go to

122
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Before you commit yourself to a month and then not go

123
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.350
iPhone: Okay yeah that's that's a good idea.

124
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:29.970
iPhone: You're

125
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:37.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Busy, you know what I mean. And I get it by the end of Friday. The only thing you want to do is go home and turn the world off.

126
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.210
iPhone: I understand it. Yes.

127
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, totally understand it.

128
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But what about like on a Saturday. What do you

129
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you have running plans on Saturdays. Are they open

130
00:11:50.010 --> 00:12:05.610
iPhone: No, no. Not often. No, it depends on, you know, the calendar once in a while I'll get a ticket. We have two beautiful theater here. And if I, if there's something going on and I can grab one of the back row $20 tickets. I'll, I'll get tickets for that or

131
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:21.720
iPhone: the Saturday before I went to the Giants fan fest. So I got out of the house and went to the city. So I kind of had to push myself because I would have would have been just as easy to stay home and I you know what I was proud of myself that I went

132
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Mm hmm.

133
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.230
iPhone: Yeah, you shouldn't because I went and I

134
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.810
iPhone: Made a day out of it. I just enjoyed it. So I was yeah I did that.

135
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.900
iPhone: So you do the one time thing.

136
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:38.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

137
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:47.640
iPhone: Yeah, actually I did and I did something else. The week before it was like, Okay, this is good. I'm you know I am trying

138
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.860
iPhone: Last week I committed to not doing anything. And, and I was I was okay with that.

139
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.660
iPhone: My body really needed it.

140
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.820
iPhone: Good. But, um,

141
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that's important. Sometimes just not to

142
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.200
iPhone: Do, right, I have a commitment, so

143
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:10.830
iPhone: And it's to go to the theater for music thing. So I'll start off the weekends with thing and I don't plan for it to end there.

144
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.170
iPhone: I think I'm a capital P procrastinator.

145
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.230
iPhone: I'd like to sign up for things

146
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.600
iPhone: Maybe even pay the fee.

147
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.500
iPhone: Yeah.

148
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But yeah, the idea is great.

149
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:41.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it sounds like a good thing. But when it comes down to going you know i mean if they take commitments and when you're working full time and you've got a family take care of, you know, it's really hard to commit yourself to something outside of what you do.

150
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.530
iPhone: It, it's

151
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.200
iPhone: Yeah, I didn't realize so hard. But yes, I do.

152
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.570
iPhone: Mm hmm.

153
00:13:50.610 --> 00:14:04.230
iPhone: Well, the world is turning. Maybe I'll just start committing myself to a walk, several times a day, you know, and a 30 minute walk that would be nice for me. I'll bring my hat to work and get outside and

154
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That would be good. I

155
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.470
iPhone: did that for a while. And that was a good idea. I did it last year.

156
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.800
iPhone: And then it stopped, but I can, I can try that again.

157
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.470
iPhone: I will try that again.

158
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's free.

159
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.010
iPhone: Yeah.

160
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.390
iPhone: Yes.

161
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, it is. Yeah.

162
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.410
iPhone: Yeah.

163
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To do that.

164
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's going to be hard, you know the the transition to

165
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, being a caretaker to caring for yourself first.

166
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:38.730
iPhone: Uh huh.

167
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a hard. It's a hard transition, but once you start doing it. It gets easier every time. And then you look forward to being able to, you know, do these things and get out and venture on your own and take care of yourself.

168
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it just takes sometimes it just takes an awful lot, and I get it.

169
00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.680
iPhone: You know, busy. Yeah.

170
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.410
iPhone: Yeah. You take care people to oh

171
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.120
iPhone: Yeah.

172
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.490
iPhone: Yeah.

173
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.060
Yeah.

174
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what else is happening with you.

175
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:27.870
iPhone: I have to share something that happened last night because I don't know where it came from. I told somebody. It was like a past life must have been a past life. Remember, it's because the something came on from the New Hampshire primary which were a few days ago.

176
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:41.460
iPhone: But they were talking about all the candidates and i just i started sobbing with this deep emotional. I didn't even know what it was about. But I was sobbing.

177
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.830
iPhone: And I'm

178
00:15:46.410 --> 00:16:02.250
iPhone: You know, usually, along with something like that. I'll feel pride or I'll feel fear, but I didn't feel it wasn't identifiable and I can only compare it to when I saw Stone Mountain many years ago.

179
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:10.020
iPhone: I saw lived through parts of that I just sobbed and I believe in this stuff, but somebody told me

180
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:22.710
iPhone: A few years later that I in fact one of my past lives. I was a southern little southern girl whose brother went off to the Civil War and never came back.

181
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:36.720
iPhone: And so I thought, that's why. Oh, that's why that movie hit me so much. You know I made that comparison. And I'm not here to debate past lives or anything, but it was that kind of feeling from this debate.

182
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:46.230
iPhone: Or from the seeing these candidates. They weren't even debating it was just talking about an election and the possibility of one of them winning

183
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:58.470
iPhone: Or maybe there was fear because one of them. What might not win and. But I was so emotional I just it floored me I'm sobbing not crying not touched, but sob.

184
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

185
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:11.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think there's like two pieces of that number one you are pretty passionate about what's going on with politics and then don't forget that you're grieving.

186
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:26.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you're going through this whole process of healing and grieving, too. And we don't get to choose when our emotions go crazy or what triggers them, but we just get to sit through them right

187
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

188
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:37.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so that's a perfect time whatever the whatever was said whatever the event was that triggered, you know that emotion to be so strong. I'm glad you said in it and got that stuff out, you know,

189
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.790
iPhone: Yeah.

190
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.840
Yeah, and

191
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.270
iPhone: So it was just

192
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:51.240
iPhone: I just I hadn't you know it was. Whoa. What is this, and I know it doesn't have to be identified. But it was so big it was like, oh,

193
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:51.600
Yeah.

194
00:17:53.820 --> 00:18:02.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You kind of lie, you lie. You know what I mean, you really have a lot you know you've got grief and loss going on, you've got frustration, you know, you're trying to

195
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:12.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: work or learn how to take care of you. First, I mean you got all these things that are happening on top of the world's falling apart with our politics. So, and it's something that you know you're extremely

196
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Passionate about

197
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.670
iPhone: Very true. You're right. Yes, yes.

198
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.500
iPhone: Yes.

199
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:29.520
iPhone: Yeah yeah yeah I even yes you're right, because I envisioned a new t shirt or sweatshirt and I envisioned all of us marching

200
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.350
iPhone: We have to make a statement, we have to get active, we have to change.

201
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:41.220
iPhone: My shirt says no more all this and then list a few that most toward things he's done.

202
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.290
iPhone: So, yeah.

203
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.810
iPhone: Oh, nice. Oh, good. I'm

204
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:51.000
iPhone: Anything. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I just, I was floored by it.

205
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're in that pro

206
00:18:54.510 --> 00:19:00.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: When you're in that process. You know, again, little things can trigger it stress can trigger it.

207
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: TV shows.

208
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.870
iPhone: Can trigger. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

209
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.600
iPhone: Very much so. Yes.

210
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So the important thing is is that you sat through it. You felt it walk through it processed it right

211
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.930
Yes.

212
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.920
iPhone: Yes, I did. Yeah.

213
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I'm glad you were triggered by politics.

214
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.370
iPhone: You must have needed that release, you know,

215
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah so need. Yeah.

216
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.980
iPhone: Quite, quite deep

217
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.540
iPhone: Yeah.

218
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.820
iPhone: Yeah, you're right. It doesn't have to be explained. And it yeah said

219
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:47.490
iPhone: I forget the other things that are underlying on a daily basis. Yeah.

220
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:54.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you just got to give yourself. It's all right. You know what I mean, you're in this place of growth and

221
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Motions grow to, you know,

222
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They've got to be released. Definitely.

223
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.300
iPhone: Yeah.

224
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.170
Right.

225
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.730
iPhone: Yeah, it's much better to have them come out and stuff them.

226
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because they came out in all different, crazy ways, you know, we get physically sick.

227
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:20.010
iPhone: Began panic attacks, anxiety, you know, it just comes out.

228
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sideways.

229
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.070
iPhone: If we don't deal with rice. Right.

230
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.370
On

231
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.750
iPhone: Right.

232
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So what has been happening with you.

233
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.840
iPhone: Not much, not much.

234
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:47.700
iPhone: Not much. I know I haven't found my voice or used my voice as I feel like I should be in my relationship. Still, but I'm not ready to go there.

235
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:59.040
iPhone: And I'm not ready to go there. I'll see if he stays straight for a few, you know, a few a week or two more. And then maybe I'll talk to him, but

236
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.170
iPhone: I've kept my mouth shut, and at times. I've actually felt my throat.

237
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:13.680
iPhone: I had an article the other day that when it sees and I'm sure it's just my voice to be heard.

238
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:24.630
iPhone: A little chicken. Still, I don't want to open that up yet, because once I open it up. There's no going back.

239
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.550
iPhone: And

240
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:41.580
iPhone: He had talked about. He always toys with me in with his. He said that he was going to put you know go away for a week to 10 days and I get so excited and

241
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:54.600
iPhone: This and that. And I'm already I'm already planning to take a few days off of work just to enjoy my house while he's not fair and and then that falls down. You know, for this reason, or that no matter

242
00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:02.520
iPhone: How much I even contribute towards it. As far as getting them out the door that falls apart and

243
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.580
iPhone: So I was disappointed there. I don't think he'll be leaving as he had talked about next week.

244
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:18.840
iPhone: And I was very disappointed because I had it planned. Oh my goodness. I had it planned. Oh.

245
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.790
iPhone: But I'm

246
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:24.690
iPhone: Gonna go

247
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:31.350
iPhone: There he was going to just drive from here to Kansas. He's got two daughters there.

248
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.080
iPhone: And two granddaughters

249
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.500
iPhone: And he was going to take a road trip.

250
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.610
iPhone: And why do we change his mind.

251
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.760
iPhone: I'm not sure.

252
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.360
iPhone: Maybe because I was too enthusiastic.

253
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.800
iPhone: I'm not sure.

254
00:22:54.060 --> 00:23:04.920
iPhone: Why he changed his mind. I don't know yet, for sure. Maybe today, I'll have that complete answer, but um but i don't i don't like I said, I don't want to talk too much.

255
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.170
iPhone: Right, so I haven't

256
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's probably a part of why you

257
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Were so emotional. The other day to

258
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:25.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you've got this this underlying thing that you're holding in, you're not, you know, you don't have your voice, you're not speaking what's really going on. And that plays a factor to and how it comes out.

259
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.640
iPhone: Yes. That makes sense.

260
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.100
iPhone: Yeah yeah

261
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.350
iPhone: Very true.

262
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.230
iPhone: It's like I've got all the right answers, but

263
00:23:44.640 --> 00:24:01.350
iPhone: I haven't formulated the motions yet to go along with it. I'm holding them close to my heart. You know what I know, I know what he's been for 30 years I i I'm not gonna put them out there yet. I'm going to put them out there when I'm ready. And when I'm ready to deal with it.

264
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:03.840
iPhone: So,

265
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:09.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Understandable just, you know, be careful with their with holding resentment.

266
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because that makes us sick to, you know,

267
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.070
iPhone: Right. Yes. Yes, I know it does.

268
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:33.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's part of their is why it's so important that you you know amp up your self care as well you know that you take care of you do things for you that are good and healthy.

269
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because it puts you in a better mindset to to be able to walk through

270
00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:44.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Into right ready cheap, you know, do whatever it is that, you know, turns out you're going to do.

271
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:49.740
iPhone: Right, yes, that's true. I can see that. Yes.

272
00:24:51.510 --> 00:25:02.970
iPhone: Yes, it took all I had for the weekend to not share his depression which he was screaming from the mountaintops and

273
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:09.540
iPhone: And I just let him have it, boy, did you know I didn't let him have it but I let him.

274
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.320
iPhone: Know that

275
00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.130
iPhone: I didn't

276
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:19.320
iPhone: Have to pick it up for him. Yes. And that was it, that sure was an easy because he was so big about it but

277
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:21.600
iPhone: I just

278
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.440
iPhone: I don't want to do that so

279
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.510
iPhone: I don't want to fix him so I'm working on me. Yeah.

280
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.950
iPhone: Yeah.

281
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what was his response when you hit it and get the normal response from you.

282
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.100
iPhone: He got a little louder.

283
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.900
iPhone: And the event I hadn't heard

284
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:56.670
iPhone: But I just, you know what I did, then I then I went and turned on music so that I had something else. Filling the air instead of his moaning groaning things, whatever it was.

285
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:06.660
iPhone: I turned on the music, which isn't unusual in our home. But it wasn't john and he didn't turn it on and he usually does. So I did that.

286
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.870
iPhone: And it wasn't that I did it with an aha, or with a smirk, but I

287
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.830
iPhone: Great with just this. This is what I'd rather have

288
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.380
iPhone: That was nice.

289
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And grounded out all the other

290
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.630
iPhone: Yes, he for me, it did for me it's dead. Yeah.

291
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long has it been since you

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.400

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.520
iPhone: Since I've what

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Responding to have

iPhone: A I'll probably I'm probably a month.

297
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.990
Maybe to do

298
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.520
iPhone: It's all going along with

299
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.210
iPhone: My new way of doing me

300
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.620
iPhone: Mm hmm. Because before when he did it and

301
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:09.630
iPhone: I would take my pills and participate, whichever you know was our normal go to chain.

302
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.900
iPhone: Right, and so it's just been a few months, maybe three probably three months.

303
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.890
iPhone: Because I think it was you who said that you have to do things differently or I have it written down.

304
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I looked at it often

305
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:32.100
iPhone: And I know that I have to do it differently because insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results.

306
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.360
And

307
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.380
iPhone: And we were swimming in insanity. So

308
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.040
iPhone: So for a few months, and

309
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.750
iPhone: It's funny because I he does get louder and

310
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.780
iPhone: But it's just

311
00:27:49.950 --> 00:28:02.130
iPhone: Yeah, I'm, I'm kind of playing a different game. Then he's participating in at the time and I don't, I say a game lightly. I don't mean network, but the game that we always played

312
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:13.740
iPhone: You know he's he's on a different board game than I am. But he's making the same moves and it's not even working with it because I'm rolling dice now and he's still doing something else, but

313
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.430
iPhone: So we're playing different games at this point.

314
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:19.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Hmm.

315
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:21.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think it's crucially

316
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.300
iPhone: Right, yeah.

317
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.280
iPhone: It feels good to me.

318
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:31.980
iPhone: It's not a spiteful thing and it's not a resentful thing. It's my new survival.

319
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.320
iPhone: That's what it is. Yeah.

320
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's taking care of me.

321
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.760
iPhone: Yes. Yeah, right.

322
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.340
iPhone: Yeah.

323
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:45.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Which

324
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.260
Happening.

325
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.350
iPhone: It does have to happen because I remember thinking, well, if I take four pills at a time.

326
00:28:54.510 --> 00:29:05.910
iPhone: When he does that, and that wasn't unusual that was not unusual. It was I had said this in group early on, boy, was he, my biggest trigger

327
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:12.210
iPhone: Because he would get going. And I would get going. So, something had to change.

328
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:18.180
iPhone: Yeah sides. Yeah, yeah, it was thought it was so obvious so quickly.

329
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.740
iPhone: What what was going on in my mind so

330
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.080
iPhone: So this is working for me. Yes.

331
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, yeah.

332
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.830
Absolutely.

333
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And he hasn't questioned or

334
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.150
iPhone: Know,

335
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's going on.

336
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.730
iPhone: No, no, no.

337
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.680
iPhone: No.

338
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.240
iPhone: No, he seldom does. He's usually too focused on him.

339
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.490
iPhone: Yeah, he's, he hasn't asked her a question.

340
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:54.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

341
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:56.760
iPhone: Yeah.

342
00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe at some point he might

343
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You think

344
00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.070
iPhone: I don't know. I don't know.

345
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:07.920
iPhone: No.

346
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No.

347
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.340
iPhone: Unfortunately, yeah.

348
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.150
No, I don't.

349
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:29.010
iPhone: You know what he said to me last week. It was the most bizarre off the fucking wall saying, I'm sorry I throw that out sometimes I'm getting really much better. But that's part of my

350
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.920
iPhone: Thoughts of him. It's just what's a fucking deal

351
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.830
iPhone: But he was going to

352
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:51.840
iPhone: Since I'm working and he's not used to always laugh at me first of all about making dinner because I'd start thinking about it in the morning he thought that was the funniest thing you're thinking about dinner. It's not until well now he understands what

353
00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.940
iPhone: About dinner helps with

354
00:30:54.750 --> 00:31:05.550
iPhone: Mm hmm. So I made it chicken and beautiful. You know, the roasted chicken one cold weekend and with the carrots and potatoes. So we had leftover chicken.

355
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:21.480
iPhone: And so he was going to make our well I make our casserole. It's the family castle, but he was going to make casserole. I said, oh, right, you know, and he's gonna do it this way or that way. And he says, I said, I don't know if we have broccoli, because it's a big user well

356
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:29.010
iPhone: I won't use broccoli. And so I said, well, think about it, because you'll need to put something in place of that.

357
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:33.420
iPhone: Right now, or I'm just trying to help him give him.

358
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:52.740
iPhone: Because he doesn't know at all the basics, or how and he said, okay, maybe I'll do this or that and I you know I was he went he was telling me we were actually involved with a third person and I see. I said, Yeah, but so I I come home from work. I'm so excited about this casserole.

359
00:31:54.120 --> 00:32:02.910
iPhone: And he didn't make the casserole because he was afraid I would make fun of him. If I did it if he did it wrong.

360
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.580
iPhone: And that's how his life is

361
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:24.090
iPhone: He's always afraid I'm gonna make fun of him so he'd rather not even try. But this came out. And I thought, you know, I didn't respond at them, or I probably did respond I said that's that's fucking sad, isn't it.

362
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:32.880
iPhone: I said, No one should live that way. And then I didn't say anything else. Of course I did indeed I wasn't hungry at that point and

363
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.780
iPhone: I think it was a day before Valentine's Day.

364
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.220
iPhone: And we sat with that of course he said nothing else.

365
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.170
iPhone: And

366
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:55.410
iPhone: Valentine's card was very simple, very didn't say anything inside, actually. And I just, it said it was a quote from Shakespeare and then I just wrote

367
00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:19.320
iPhone: However that may be, Donna. We went through Valentine's Day, you know, very low key. He had nothing card for me to and I forgotten all about it until you and I are talking. We've never discussed the per diem capsule which he can't attempt, because he's afraid to laugh at them.

368
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.130
iPhone: That's sad. That's very sad.

369
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:25.440
iPhone: And

370
00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:28.710
iPhone: What could

371
00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.360
I had it sounds like

372
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.810
iPhone: We were talking about it over the weekend.

373
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:43.350
iPhone: But the weekend came and went, and I guess maybe that was part of his loud banging and stuff, but I didn't bring it up, and neither did he

374
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did that hurt you. And he said that

375
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:55.530
iPhone: I don't know if it hurt me. I just thought, Boy, that's just so fucking sad.

376
00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:05.670
iPhone: casserole. The either. I don't know. I thought it was a sad STUPID, AND IT. NO, IT pissed me off more than it hurts me

377
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.440
iPhone: Because I thought he is playing baby.

378
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Peters playing maybe

379
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:15.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe

380
00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Maybe it was just an excuse to get out of

381
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:25.260
iPhone: Making it. Right, right, right, which is which is probably number one reason.

382
00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doesn't make dinner often

383
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:46.410
iPhone: No, no, no. He does not. And when he does, he usually doesn't start it until I get home with stuff that should have been started either in the morning or hours ago. And then I end up finishing good or doing it.

384
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.530
iPhone: When it's when he first

385
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:57.660
iPhone: came home from work, like I told you a while ago was very unexpected and not the plan.

386
00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:03.330
iPhone: He was having fun with dinners. Well that lasted about two weeks.

387
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:12.660
iPhone: Where he was looking up recipes and I think he was doing them with joy and now he does them with anger and resentment.

388
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:14.370
iPhone: And

389
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.530
iPhone: It's just stupid.

390
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

391
00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, well,

392
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm glad that you're honing in on yourself.

393
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:31.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah, you don't want to feed into the rest of that stuff or let it drag you down.

394
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:40.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, I know with the process that you're going through and the things that you were trying to work on, you know, it's important that you, you know, keep doing it.

395
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you'll figure it out.

396
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.190
iPhone: Right. Or he won't great one. That's not my problem.

397
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.190
iPhone: Right.

398
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you guys thought at all this week.

399
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.340
iPhone: For no good.

400
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.280
iPhone: No we tiptoe around each other.

401
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:04.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's that

402
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How's that new boot dresser.

403
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.270
iPhone: Oh, it's still as is

404
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I had to choose OUT OF IT, BECAUSE I HAVE TO MOVE THE HEAVY BOXES.

405
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.520
iPhone: To see what shoes are in there. It's useless.

406
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:22.680
iPhone: Yeah.

407
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:38.190
iPhone: I have to wait for it to get warm because it's out in the garage and it's cold out there and on some warm day hopefully I'll get out there and make some use of it right now. It's useless. It's just shoots piled on top of each other.

408
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.510
iPhone: And no order or no suggest

409
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:47.850
iPhone: Yeah, her a

410
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thing for the mass. Right, right.

411
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.420
iPhone: Right. Right. Exactly.

412
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.480
iPhone: Please don't touch my things

413
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.820
iPhone: But, um,

414
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.170
iPhone: Yeah. Nope, the booth. It's not working.

415
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Either side. It's funny because it's like most other things he does.

416
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:15.030
iPhone: He puts things in storage. Last year, he's paying for this huge storage.

417
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:24.480
iPhone: Because he thought we were moving and the things he took to storage are the things we use all the time. So I've just had to go and buy new

418
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:30.120
iPhone: It's the same with the shoe thing is all my shoes are piled up. I don't know what's in there. I just

419
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:38.100
iPhone: You know, but shoes. Last month I bought two pairs of new shoes because my shoes are in there somewhere. But I'll be damned if I'm gonna

420
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:59.880
iPhone: And I have a torn rotator cuff. So he's got him in huge moving boxes my shoes that I have to go pull out and dig through. He said, Oh, well, I'll help you move the boxes and thinking, not always. Here I have to. It's the shoe box is not working the shoes. The shoes closet.

421
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:02.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

422
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:08.880
iPhone: Half thought out half thought out, great idea but not implemented, just like everything, everything

423
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:12.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, but

424
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:13.770
iPhone: I don't want to go there.

425
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.050
iPhone: I think we're almost out of time.

426
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.020
iPhone: So,

427
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.120
iPhone: Tell me where does a bunch of resentments.

428
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:30.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just tell me what you're going to do for the next couple weeks and that is going to really kind of hone in on you.

429
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:47.910
iPhone: I'm going to continue to set aside time for me and then go to continue to find enjoyment and pleasure and things that I commit to I will not commit to us.

430
00:38:48.840 --> 00:39:00.540
iPhone: But I will go back to the massage store and I will go there. I will try to go there every week. And if the weather stays as it's been I'm going to, I'm going to start walking a few times a week.

431
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:12.660
iPhone: Outside away from my clock out of the work building and at a good time of things. The fresh air and the walking will be just a great prescription for me.

432
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it should. Very much so.

433
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm just kind of wait on the on the painting class.

434
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:23.610
iPhone: Yeah.

435
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:27.630
iPhone: Yeah, because then I end up beating myself up right

436
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:40.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, we don't want that. We don't want any more that you know be right all baby. So see if you can get out intake. A 30 minute walk, you know, that's a start. You know what I mean, it's

437
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:41.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A

438
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.190
iPhone: Good start. Yes, you're right. Yeah.

439
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:45.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah.

440
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:54.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you're gonna start walking on good days because the weather's very

441
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:55.590
If he

442
00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:58.770
Kind of comes and goes.

443
00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:09.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And just, you know, keep doing what you're doing down a you know you're focusing on you. You're not engaging in the drama. You know, you're just kind of letting it be

444
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's really a good place to be.

445
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.250
iPhone: You know,

446
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: allowing him to own his own behaviors. You know, it's good.

447
00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Parenting to okay and allow yourself to have those rest days too, by the way.

448
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.290
iPhone: All pajama days. Okay.

449
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.030

476
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:50.040
Teddy: I missed my internet if I turn on the internet, kind of like the video.

477
00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:58.260
Teddy: It was cutting out the volume and everything but alternate on and if it cuts out or just have to go back to the audio.

478

Hello.

481
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Today, I think we are just doing an individual, we're going to spend a little bit of time together.

482
00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:22.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get to know each other a little bit because I think the plan is is that you and I are going to be working together individually.

483
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:32.790
Teddy: I kind of really didn't really have the time or like the need really think they just made a suggestion to me to do an individual. I've been on the program for

484
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:38.340
Teddy: Like already almost two years and I haven't really done any new

485
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:38.850
Bow.

486
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:46.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any issues have have any issues came up or anything.

487
00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Lately extra stress from home life or

488
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Loan reason that they suggested

489
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:58.170
Teddy: I think I was just maybe having like a bad week or something like that, like just feeling a little bit depressed, but

490
00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:07.980
Teddy: Like nothing out of my normal what I always feel like it just, you know, we got the new doctor and stuff and he didn't really like know the way I am and stuff. But you know, I just

491
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Was a new doctor

492
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.110
I'm

493
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:18.540
Teddy: I forgot.

494
00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.500
Teddy: But I saw the same

495
00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.710
Teddy: She like again. I don't know.

496
00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.260
Who's your counselor.

497
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.710
Teddy: Like the tip of my tongue. The Dr.

498
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:43.650
Christopher

499
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Christopher

500
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.010

501
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:56.970
Teddy: I i've been tapering and I just started tapering again and still Dominique Is my counselor.

502
00:43:58.830 --> 00:43:59.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

503
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that the thing is is that Dominic isn't going to be seeing

504
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Clients individually at this point.

505
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm looking. I've never

506
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:15.960

507
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:18.150

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Has the taper been going

515
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:52.980
Teddy: It's like it always does, you know, a little bit rough in the first couple days and then once I get used to it. I do slow taper so

516
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How many times have you done them.

Teddy: tapers well I just started again.

518

Teddy: Finish.

544
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:00.750

549
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.640

Teddy: Ratings actually been really good.

555
00:47:50.040 --> 00:48:01.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so I think what the idea is, is for you to get engaged with individuals right now while you're going through your taper. I think that that's probably what it is and

556
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:09.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, to, if in case you need any kind of added support while you're dropping down in milligrams

557
00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I know that

558
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dr. Coleman is really what

559
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:17.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good.

560
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:29.520
Teddy: Well, no, I'm just saying that I had tapered before I never really, I never did individual kind of or even like doing individual counseling it before really like this.

561
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.220
Teddy: It's not necessary.

562
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:36.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. What about just checking in with me for

563
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The next couple weeks where you're going through your taper.

564
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.040
Just checking on your process.

565
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:52.890
Teddy: That's fine if that's what you guys want to do. But, you know, like I said, I've tapered before and I've never had any issues or problems with it.

566
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you taper completely off before

567
00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.710
Teddy: No, no, I'm like I said, I started at

568
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:12.780
Teddy: 60 milligrams and I over the last two years, I've gotten down to eight. The just a real slow taper and for like three months. I didn't take her at all because with the changes over there because facility.

569
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.390
Teddy: Was the main reason behind that.

570
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:22.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now you feel more secure and more comfortable to begin it again.

571
00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:24.390
Teddy: Yeah.

572
00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:30.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's the goal is it to be completely off Suboxone or get down to a lower dosage, or what is the goal.

573
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:36.750
Teddy: Yeah, to eventually be completely off. Okay.

574
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:41.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And how long did you give yourself, did you think it was gonna take

575
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:53.280
Teddy: Like, I think I'm right on track about where I want to be. Because if I go too fast. I feel like I'll get the withdrawals and stuff will just

576
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.270
Teddy: Yeah, more of an uncomfortable feeling, you know, than anything.

577
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:05.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I get that. Very much so. So how about that we, you and I, we just kind of schedule.

578
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:13.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: For the next couple weeks we can even go by. We leave you want to while you're going through this taper.

579
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:16.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You might check ins, do some

580
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.630
Teddy: You do a group by like once a month.

581
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:26.640
Teddy: We do like once a month, because I'm really strapped for time, you know, mostly, and then I know like

582
00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:36.630
Teddy: I get out right at like 530 and by time. I rushed home and everything. It's, it's like rushing everything to get to a six o'clock appointment, you know,

583
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.620
Teddy: And like with my schedule and stuff like that. It's

584
00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:53.910
Teddy: Sometimes any reason that I might have to work later or something like that. Now that it's getting warmer, you start working later as well.

585
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:55.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, what do you do

586
00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:03.750
Teddy: It. We can just like scheduling once a month, and I'll have a better shot of, you know, meeting that goal.
