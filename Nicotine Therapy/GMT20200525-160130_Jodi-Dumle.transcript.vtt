Holly Roddenbery: I've been

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.840
Holly Roddenbery: I've been doing better.

6
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.130
Holly Roddenbery: But I needed some rest as of lately.

7
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:37.500

9
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.930
Goals.

10
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:54.660
Holly Roddenbery: Okay and I totally forgot that I had therapy. This morning I didn't rather than my calendar. So I apologize for that. I'm just the second, let me get this untangle

11
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.810
Holly Roddenbery: Oh, right.

12
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.670
Holly Roddenbery: I'm gonna go downstairs to my

13
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.480
Holly Roddenbery: Okay.

14
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.940
Holly Roddenbery: So,

Holly Roddenbery: Good morning, are you good afternoon.

16
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:14.070
Holly Roddenbery: I'm finally taken a break from everything just to take time for myself. And in that I just kind of let my schedule go didn't try to push myself. I just read as I needed to rien.

17
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.530
Holly Roddenbery: Just fasted and

18
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:27.270
Holly Roddenbery: Just kind of took time for myself that I needed, apart from john apart from family just to focus on me.

19
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.420
Holly Roddenbery: And it was so good.

20
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.450
Holly Roddenbery: And

21
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.840
Holly Roddenbery: It's been helpful.

22
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.210
Holly Roddenbery: I don't

23
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:49.290
Holly Roddenbery: I know it must have been such an emotional wreck likes last time that I spoke to you that I honestly, I can't even remember.

24
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.200
Holly Roddenbery: All that I said just telling you about my pain and done.

25
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.680
Jodi Dumler: Didn't come through.

26
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.070
Holly Roddenbery: I'm

27
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.080
Holly Roddenbery: Sorry.

28
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:49.320
Holly Roddenbery: Just remember my goals and I met those things with that I think I told you that I didn't have peace about trying to drive home in this coronavirus

29
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.190
Holly Roddenbery: In fact, since then.

30
00:10:54.210 --> 00:11:03.210
Holly Roddenbery: You know out all I haven't been doing nearly is just taking care of myself doing the best I can to look after john ward and need help.

31
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:06.450
Holly Roddenbery: And

32
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.250
Holly Roddenbery: Just

33
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:17.490
Holly Roddenbery: Seeking what I need to do and trying to live a better life for myself.

34
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.120
Holly Roddenbery: Because I knew that I did put john before myself.

35
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.750
Holly Roddenbery: And I don't mean that because that's not that's not how I

36
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.460
Holly Roddenbery: That's not what gives me strength and that's not what take cares takes care of me. So I guess.

37
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.470
Holly Roddenbery: Our relationship on that end is is better.

38
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.180
Holly Roddenbery: He may not like certain things about it but

39
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.930
Holly Roddenbery: Too bad. It's, it's better for us.

40
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.710
Holly Roddenbery: We're learning how to build some trust in each other and some patients with each other.

41
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:14.790
Holly Roddenbery: And on the drinking in to which is what I, you know, was was talking with you about

42
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.360
Holly Roddenbery: And how fearful and worrying that I was for his life.

43
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.610
Holly Roddenbery: And I'm not saying that there's nothing to be worried about as far as that.

44
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:36.840
Holly Roddenbery: I'm learning that there's a difference between being worried and worried and being mindful and to just

45
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:47.280
Holly Roddenbery: Rather than telling him telling other people telling her just learned that just to pray about it.

46
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.460
Holly Roddenbery: And leave that there.

47
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.860
Holly Roddenbery: And strange things have been happening around here.

48
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:04.080
Holly Roddenbery: Since I since I've kind of let go of that and let go of trying to control that.

49
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:13.140
Holly Roddenbery: I know sometimes bad things have to happen before there's good and

50
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.150
Holly Roddenbery: John was arrested this past week.

51
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:19.950
And

52
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:30.450
Holly Roddenbery: He left went outside and apparently car almost hit him and he was drinking some words and

53
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:32.400
Holly Roddenbery: Me.

54
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.320
Holly Roddenbery: It was bad.

55
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.390
Holly Roddenbery: But

56
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.610
Holly Roddenbery: Knowing him.

57
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:47.730
Holly Roddenbery: I wouldn't got him out whenever he couldn't get out just to look after, and it's not a patient person.

58
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.110
Holly Roddenbery: And it would have been like

59
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:59.670
Holly Roddenbery: A whole lot of blame put on me if I didn't go and get him whenever

60
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.500
Holly Roddenbery: The police officers called and said that I could

61
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:15.240
Holly Roddenbery: And he tried to to put his anger and his defiance for what he did wrong on me.

62
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.650
Holly Roddenbery: Like there's just I'm amazed at

63
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.170
Holly Roddenbery: How I was able to take a stand before him and just say, Look, no, this is what I did. This is the truth.

64
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.180
Holly Roddenbery: You are asking something of me, that I cannot do for you.

65
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:36.720
Holly Roddenbery: You shouldn't be mad at me.

66
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:43.710
Holly Roddenbery: And you don't don't harbor this don't place this on me and

67
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:56.970
Holly Roddenbery: Why are you upset you work through that because I'm not going to accept that being put on me and

68
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.530
Holly Roddenbery: But you know what, it wasn't ugly. It wasn't like

69
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.130
Holly Roddenbery: It was firm and loving

70
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.390
Holly Roddenbery: And he, I don't know how his processing through that.

71
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.980
Jodi Dumler: There hasn't been any yelling in the last week.

72
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.530
Jodi Dumler: Between the two of you.

73
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.610
Holly Roddenbery: So much um

74
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.110
Holly Roddenbery: There's been a lot more progress.

75
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.950
Holly Roddenbery: tense moments. I don't know. I can just sense presence in the midst of all of this.

76
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.980
Holly Roddenbery: And help

77
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:49.260
Holly Roddenbery: No, I don't know. All I want is now that I've just been praying and looking at myself and like

78
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:57.180
Holly Roddenbery: All I really want is just God's will be done in this situation in this relationship.

79
00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.040
Holly Roddenbery: And

80
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.040
Holly Roddenbery: I can even see how this relationship has taught me things that I've needed to know and understand about myself and

81
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:21.270
Holly Roddenbery: And you know about mainly about condemnation and not letting myself.

82
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.550
Holly Roddenbery: Except that

83
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.920
Holly Roddenbery: If it's not something that's

84
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.660
Holly Roddenbery: That's

85
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.690
Holly Roddenbery: loving and kind and given to me in the right way.

86
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.450
Holly Roddenbery: I mean I'm learning to hear people and what they're saying.

87
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.450
Holly Roddenbery: But not

88
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:53.400
Holly Roddenbery: Except hurt and the blame that they're trying to place on me for something that is unnecessary.

89
00:16:59.070 --> 00:16:59.490
Holly Roddenbery: And

90
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.010
Holly Roddenbery: That has been

91
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:08.520
Holly Roddenbery: Really good for me because I've had a lot of that. Just put it on me.

92
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.580
Holly Roddenbery: And I know we all

93
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.580
Holly Roddenbery: Do that to each other sometimes

94
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.620
Holly Roddenbery: And

95
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:35.790
Holly Roddenbery: I know that I've been just like running from my personal relationship and

96
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.840
Holly Roddenbery: Just running from God owners that relate and

97
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.580
Holly Roddenbery: And toiling doing a lot of work and not just taking care of my heart and

98
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.520
Holly Roddenbery: Paying attention to

99
00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.810
Holly Roddenbery: What I should be doing or what I need to be doing.

100
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:10.200
Holly Roddenbery: Until I just got so slow. And so filled up with just emotions being overwhelmed.

101
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:27.630
Holly Roddenbery: That I couldn't do anything else, but stop and just look at the issues that I'm dealing with. Look at my warrior and my anxiety and my fears and do some tracing to see what's going on to handle those kind of things properly.

102
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:40.770
Holly Roddenbery: Obviously one of them may have mentioned to us about my dog being in Georgia with my mom.

103
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.200
Holly Roddenbery: And

104
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.990
Holly Roddenbery: I'll be forthcoming with you that I'm

105
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.840
Holly Roddenbery: Aware. I moved from North Carolina or after I left graduate school.

106
00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:16.020
Holly Roddenbery: To do an artist to I went to an Artist Residency, and I wouldn't have been able to go to that Artist Residency and keep my dog and you know when it was like a tense moment I wasn't sure what I was going to do john was saying you shouldn't let a dog control you and

107
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.780
Holly Roddenbery: You know, make decisions for you and and

108
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:35.700
Holly Roddenbery: Keep you from opportunities and stuff like that. And I was like, yeah, that kind of kind of is right and I haven't been able to take care of them. Good. Now even because doing grad school and he's getting older and

109
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.070
Holly Roddenbery: Then I just kind of felt to them the heart that this residency.

110
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.160
Holly Roddenbery: getting shot and

111
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:51.510
Holly Roddenbery: You really believe that it was something that Lord was leading me to to

112
00:19:52.620 --> 00:20:02.160
Holly Roddenbery: Hear or know that my mom would be the one to keep my dog Holly, did that and she said, no, at first.

113
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.620
Holly Roddenbery: About keeping my dog and then she turned right around and said,

114
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.170
Holly Roddenbery: I'll keep them.

115
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:29.550
Holly Roddenbery: You know, bring them on over here and it did and it was really grateful for the opportunity to go off to this Artist Residency and, you know, I've been paying her payment on a show. Let me to keep my dog.

116
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:42.300
Holly Roddenbery: And then, uh, you know, obviously I've told you she's gotten unhealthy and she doesn't need to be looking after my dog because of the Chrome virus and everything.

117
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.830
Holly Roddenbery: And

118
00:20:49.380 --> 00:21:06.270
Holly Roddenbery: I my sister had been kind of telling me that she didn't need to be looking after him, and I knew that and obviously after I did the Artist Residency I ended up over here and getting a job and not having a place for my dog still and

119
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:12.000
Holly Roddenbery: It was a very frustrating situation because it's something that I can't resolve.

120
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:31.680
Holly Roddenbery: Happened in there just kind of knew my mom's let's let her know that Jonathan weren't doing well and

121
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.560
Holly Roddenbery: That didn't

122
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.360
Holly Roddenbery: Change your mind and said,

123
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:59.580
Holly Roddenbery: I don't keep her dog anymore. And before she said that I felt like it will end. She's gonna say, I'm not going to keep your dog. And so that has been something tense in the midst of my relationship with my mom, my personal relationship with guide.

124
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:06.180
Holly Roddenbery: And john and it's just been kind of a very

125
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:19.260
Holly Roddenbery: Tense pressure situation that I haven't known how to what kind of moved to make to bring the the the aid that's needed

126
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:21.690
Holly Roddenbery: And

127
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:30.510
Holly Roddenbery: That is that my dog is pretty sick and he still has life been admitted that appointment.

128
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:49.380
Holly Roddenbery: And I might and that said you know he has it wouldn't be cruel to keep him alive right now with all of those problems that he's facing physically. This is more of a familial issue anyone recommend I put the dog down just fix problem.

129
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:56.940
Holly Roddenbery: That this needs to be agreed on between my mom and I least

130
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:05.010
Holly Roddenbery: Because my mom has a stroke and some cyclic thinking and really compassionate and loves animals.

131
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.200
Holly Roddenbery: And I do too.

132
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:18.540
Holly Roddenbery: She every time I mentioned that that might be what I have to do to solve the problem for her. She gets angry with me and

133
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.000
Holly Roddenbery: And just kind of keeps a lot on me or tries to

134
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:39.570
Holly Roddenbery: And I can't really get her to understand that this isn't something that I can fix and that if she thinks that I need to come down there to take care of her, and to live with her right now and take care of her to

135
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.560
Holly Roddenbery: That she might lose me on the way and still have the problem of the dog.

136
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:50.820
Holly Roddenbery: And

137
00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.810
Holly Roddenbery: So it's just been kind of stressful.

138
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.050
Holly Roddenbery: Trying to navigate this issue.

139
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.470
Holly Roddenbery: And

140
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.520
Holly Roddenbery: Really what I'm hoping will happen through it.

141
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:22.890
Holly Roddenbery: Because I don't know that it's right now. It's not something that I can fix. I know that she doesn't need to be looking after him. But I also know my mom is kind of a weak and fragile place where she actually needs more help.

142
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.230
Holly Roddenbery: She needs more caretaking I believe

143
00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.730
Holly Roddenbery: And she's falling lot

144
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.400
And

145
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.780
Holly Roddenbery: She's also refusing help

146
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:48.780
Holly Roddenbery: So,

147
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:59.340
Holly Roddenbery: I've been in touch with my pastor and Georgia who looks after our family and just

148
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.570
Holly Roddenbery: Praying over this situation.

149
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:21.570
Holly Roddenbery: But it's a stressful thing to go through for me to want to be there for so many people

150
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.160
Holly Roddenbery: And

151
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:29.700
Holly Roddenbery: Not at the ability to do that to change or fix things.

152
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:45.630
Jodi Dumler: Is it solely near fear the virus that's keeping you from going home. The summer or are you hoping to still go at some point.

153
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.590
Holly Roddenbery: I would hope to be able to go at some point.

154
00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:03.300
Holly Roddenbery: Because I don't want to just, you know, I don't want to be selfish. And I think that that's the lesson that I feel like I needed to learn

155
00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.150
Holly Roddenbery: Through this entire situation is to love more selflessly

156
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.250
Holly Roddenbery: And sacrificial

157
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.150
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, that's been less than three. Because truly, I can't even judge john

158
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.060
Holly Roddenbery: Why, he's going through and point fingers at his drinking because

159
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.850
Holly Roddenbery: I understand.

160
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.020
Holly Roddenbery: Understand, not having the ability

161
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.940
Holly Roddenbery: And I don't know if he has the ability to fix that.

162
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.970
Holly Roddenbery: Yes, as far as I guess going home.

163
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.700
Holly Roddenbery: I'd want to know that it was safe and I'd want to know that I was in a better place.

164
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.610
Holly Roddenbery: And perhaps that

165
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.510
Holly Roddenbery: That john was in a better place to

166
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:27.300
Holly Roddenbery: Because I

167
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:36.570
Holly Roddenbery: Things are rough for him right now too, and I really do care about him. And I think that

168
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.950
Holly Roddenbery: I kind of feel like leaving him would be

169
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.320
Holly Roddenbery: Something that's not being asked me know

170
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.400
Holly Roddenbery: At least right now.

171
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:04.050
Jodi Dumler: I think all of that is something that you need to actively remain

172
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.480
Jodi Dumler: In prayer and looking at

173
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.350
Yeah.

174
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:17.280
Jodi Dumler: It's been very many months that you have talked about and felt bad about not being able to be there for family.

175
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:29.760
Jodi Dumler: And be it that you're going to ideally return in the fall, and you have a position way for you and work that you need to do in the fall and then

176
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:36.060
Holly Roddenbery: I'm not even sure if that I need to be doing that, to be honest with you.

177
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.010
Jodi Dumler: The return or the position.

178
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:50.460
Holly Roddenbery: The position, like, as I've as I've been praying and just taking time for myself. I've noticed that I have other passions and desires.

179
00:28:51.900 --> 00:29:03.330
Holly Roddenbery: And your if that's what I need to be doing. It's working at that school and serving that school, I'll gladly do that. I love doing that.

180
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:15.060
Holly Roddenbery: And I know that I have the job with the jewelry business and I've been learning a lot there. But I also have personal dreams of having business.

181
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.780
Holly Roddenbery: And I don't want to spread myself too thin.

182
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.140
Holly Roddenbery: And that's what I felt like I was doing

183
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:33.990
Holly Roddenbery: I've been given her lot as far as my dad left me and don't want to make sure that I'm taking that and being care about and

184
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.410
Holly Roddenbery: Investing it suppose

185
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.450
Holly Roddenbery: I might want to have my own jewelry business.

186
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.720
Holly Roddenbery: But I want to be able to know that it's the right time and and pursue that the right way.

187
00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.270
Jodi Dumler: Right.

188
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.190
Holly Roddenbery: And I think that this is a good location for that I do.

189
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.920
Holly Roddenbery: But ever know. I just think I need time to

190
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.460
Just

191
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.630
Holly Roddenbery: Be with myself right now and feel

192
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.110
Holly Roddenbery: Because I had lost my dad.

193
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.810
Holly Roddenbery: And

194
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.990
Holly Roddenbery: I was in the midst of semester.

195
00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.900
Holly Roddenbery: And up realized if I don't take time to process through crieff

196
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.870
Holly Roddenbery: It'll handle me and I'll link painting on everyone.

197
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.240
Holly Roddenbery: So right now.

198
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.040
Holly Roddenbery: Thing talk happened to have my Fable and go through

199
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.050
Holly Roddenbery: With the estate and how that mom feels

200
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.330
Holly Roddenbery: That she's been turned on.

201
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.880
Holly Roddenbery: By her children.

202
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:26.250
Holly Roddenbery: And as I try to be there for her three legs. She has so much pain that she turns and throws a lot of darts at me.

203
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.670
Holly Roddenbery: Saying that I don't know if my dad and

204
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.640
Holly Roddenbery: If it weren't for her.

205
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:41.220
Holly Roddenbery: That she that my dad would have just like

206
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:56.640
Holly Roddenbery: Nobody would have cared for him, would he wouldn't have had that time and what hurts is I know that's true. I'm grateful for what she did the sacrifice she made by taking care of him.

207
00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:08.580
Holly Roddenbery: And that was something that she had on her heart to do that she wanted to do. But I'm thinking of because she's had a stroke and

208
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.250
Holly Roddenbery: She kind of went about the whole

209
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.830
Holly Roddenbery: Payment being

210
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.300
Holly Roddenbery: Hard

211
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:30.810
Holly Roddenbery: I feel too bad that my brother and sister won't

212
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:46.470
Holly Roddenbery: Take care of her back, because I think that we show you. She's our mother, we should look after her, and she should build, you know, dignified by how she took care of her dad.

213
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.770
Holly Roddenbery: So it's been bothersome to me that the brother and sister.

214
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.130
Holly Roddenbery: Can't see that and

215
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:11.010
Holly Roddenbery: When I tried to help her whether the emotionally or financially sometimes her pain in her brokenness causes her to turn her back on me.

216
00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.770
Holly Roddenbery: Sometimes I wish that I could fix everything.

217
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.440
Holly Roddenbery: In a panic about that you

218
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.560
Holly Roddenbery: Just understanding that there's some things that I can't fix here.

219
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:49.350
Holly Roddenbery: And yes, I guess if I, if the opportunities right

220
00:33:53.040 --> 00:34:01.800
Holly Roddenbery: Then I'd go down and so you're nervous about flying. And also, you know, pretty tired and worn out about driving

221
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:08.040
Holly Roddenbery: So that's truly what I have it made millions to to go down there just yet.

222
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.360
Holly Roddenbery: And I want to know what the right thing is

223
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.470
Look,

224
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:30.330
Jodi Dumler: You guys your apartment where you are, where you guys live justice and allow animals, I take it,

225
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:42.840
Holly Roddenbery: I'm right john owns this house. And he also owns a lot of nice rugs. My mom did too. And she allowed animals to to

226
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:45.090
Holly Roddenbery: Get the best of that.

227
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:52.830
Holly Roddenbery: And then she'd like to complain about that. But also, she's letting her own animals do that too.

228
00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:59.400
Holly Roddenbery: And so I I wouldn't have a place for him.

229
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.170
Holly Roddenbery: In this partner.

230
00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:14.520
Holly Roddenbery: And and it's from what I've heard from other people. It may be challenging to find a place to read that allow me to have a dog.

231
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.690
Jodi Dumler: So I asked you last time.

232
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.310
Jodi Dumler: And my big concern, of course, was sci fi

233
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:42.360
Jodi Dumler: And I wanted to know, why is where if it were to be unsafe where you go, what do you have in place.

234
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.200
Holly Roddenbery: Will have in place.

235
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.400
Holly Roddenbery: I do feel stay down here and my partner.

236
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.610
Holly Roddenbery: I know that john

237
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.050
Holly Roddenbery: Requirement out. You said outside of my partner. Where do I feel safe.

238
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.490
Holly Roddenbery: I don't have a place

239
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.520
Holly Roddenbery: I mean, I would go to my mom's in Georgia.

240
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.300
Holly Roddenbery: But sometimes I don't feel safe very

241
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.590
Holly Roddenbery: Because

242
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.280
Holly Roddenbery: Sometimes she likes to take advantage

243
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:25.740
Holly Roddenbery: Okay.

244
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:42.810
Jodi Dumler: Do you have any friends that not that you're going to move in with them. I just mean if you need to go for a night.

245
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.640
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah, you were to call

246
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.080
Holly Roddenbery: A ballet, but have people that work in their houses.

247
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.070
Jodi Dumler: Most of the time.

248
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.360
Jodi Dumler: Do you feel safe, where you are like truly say

249
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:07.560
Yes.

250
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:30.330
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah I did in that was just, I guess.

251
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:39.300
Holly Roddenbery: This change that I needed to make was just really happen, the firm foundation and my own relationship in life.

252
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.270
Holly Roddenbery: And not letting

253
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.770
Holly Roddenbery: People

254
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:50.670
Holly Roddenbery: twist my heart and twist my hand.

255
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.740
Holly Roddenbery: Into

256
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.840
Holly Roddenbery: Feeling like it's my fault for their pain.

257
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.800
Holly Roddenbery: And in some ways, it might be because of hurtful things I've said

258
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:11.610
Holly Roddenbery: And I can't necessarily take that back. But I can tell them the truth in a loving way.

259
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.260
And

260
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:29.430
Holly Roddenbery: But yeah, as far as like feeling safe just having that firm foundation in my own heart and my own life. Makes me feel safe emotionally

261
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.090
Holly Roddenbery: And it gives me strength.

262
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.340
Holly Roddenbery: Then I need to just handle some of the pain.

263
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:49.500
Holly Roddenbery: And as far as physically feeling safe. Obviously I'm renting from john and understand that addiction is a disease.

264
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.440
Holly Roddenbery: And he is to people.

265
00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:54.690
Holly Roddenbery: He is mighty

266
00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:08.310
Holly Roddenbery: Not nice and sheds pain to whenever he has been drinking and I have learned how to even in the midst of that, not to

267
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.040
Holly Roddenbery: Allow him.

268
00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:18.930
Holly Roddenbery: To put that his faults on top of me, but to show love to him through that.

269
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:21.300
Holly Roddenbery: And

270
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:31.740
Holly Roddenbery: To not buy into his harsh words whenever he is drinking

271
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.770
Holly Roddenbery: Or that at least that's what I'm learning to do through the situation.

272
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.760
Holly Roddenbery: And then

273
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:52.530
Holly Roddenbery: Obviously when he's not drinking. I've been a friend to I'm going to help. I suppose to

274
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.780
Holly Roddenbery: Help him move through his way.

275
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:00.300
Holly Roddenbery: And

276
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.780
Holly Roddenbery: Then he has he he does have a key to this downstairs, because

277
00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.200
Holly Roddenbery: It's his place.

278
00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:19.290
Holly Roddenbery: So I want to add an extra layer of this

279
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:21.720
Holly Roddenbery: Action.

280
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:30.900
Holly Roddenbery: But I'm not, I don't feel like I'm dead bolting myself from the person I know john being

281
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.520
Holly Roddenbery: Feel like I'm dead bolting myself.

282
00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:42.780
Holly Roddenbery: Is damage that he dies to himself and to others. When you drinks and

283
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.150
Jodi Dumler: So, so you do have a deadbolt.

284
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:47.490
Holly Roddenbery: I haven't gotten one yet.

285
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:58.740
Holly Roddenbery: But I don't want to be callous towards him by putting that up.

286
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.710
Jodi Dumler: Thank you get to decide and you have to decide.

287
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.010
Jodi Dumler: How to

288
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:32.280
Jodi Dumler: Step back and objectively, look at the present and the past and say, What do I actually need and then decide. That's why I asked if you have somewhere else, because you had to go at one point. So it hasn't happened.

289
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.340
Jodi Dumler: And

290
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.800
Jodi Dumler: There's absolutely nothing that you've told me that has made me say it won't happen again at some point.

291
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:51.630
Jodi Dumler: So I want to make sure that you have a plan for safety, not because I think he's a horrible person. But because

292
00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.580
Holly Roddenbery: You don't want me to take some

293
00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:59.040
Jodi Dumler: Point if he drinks too much and

294
00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:12.930
Jodi Dumler: What startle you or you were off and you were in a, you know, and you are and you were struggling as well it could become volatile again. And there's neither of you are stable enough at this point that it makes me say it's not going to happen.

295
00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.130
Yeah.

296
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:24.630
Jodi Dumler: So you'll have to figure out is that that I do have a plan. And I have a safe person and I'll go there. Instead, or is it that

297
00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:34.410
Jodi Dumler: I felt the safest here. And so I want to explain to him that I feel the safest in this apartment and I want to stay but I have to have this so that I don't have to have another plan.

298
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:41.010
Jodi Dumler: Yeah, trust myself and you both that I mean I can't trust. It's not just him. It's that

299
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.390
Jodi Dumler: You're not consistently there yet either.

300
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.990
Jodi Dumler: To be able to catch it quick enough to, you know, to be where you need to be either so

301
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.870
Jodi Dumler: To think about it. Yeah.

302
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:58.650
Holly Roddenbery: I think I would feel safer with some dead bolts.

303
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:12.270
Jodi Dumler: The only time I would really don't explain to him that it's because you do feel safe in that apartment and you want to be able to go see. Yeah. And you don't have to call the cops on each other because that ends badly.

304
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.350
Jodi Dumler: Yeah.

305
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.120
Holly Roddenbery: No, I have to do it.

306
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.910
Holly Roddenbery: I don't have it. Yeah, I don't want that I'm

307
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.750
Holly Roddenbery: In some strange things

308
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:29.010
Holly Roddenbery: Have happened through this and I may be seeing some healing through it.

309
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.420
Holly Roddenbery: So I guess that's also one of the reasons why I had to just

310
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.060
Holly Roddenbery: Well,

311
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.680
Jodi Dumler: I get that.

312
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.830
Jodi Dumler: But that's normal.

313
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.600
Jodi Dumler: It's not all to have

314
00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:55.620
Jodi Dumler: A healing and even, I hope you both any i mean you know this human addiction, it's, it's not that I don't think it's going to improve. I do.

315
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:56.700
Yeah.

316
00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.500
Jodi Dumler: It's that I also know that the reality is relapse is part of recovery.

317
00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.060
Jodi Dumler: Yes, you just don't know what that looks like and you don't know when it will happen. It's

318
00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:13.800
Jodi Dumler: You guys could be together and sharing this both places and living you know and having that all that space and then you might need it sometime in it.

319
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.910
Holly Roddenbery: Or you may in it.

320
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:15.540
Jodi Dumler: Because you

321
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.420
Holly Roddenbery: Know we actually, you know, as I was looking yesterday before

322
00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:23.250
Holly Roddenbery: It.

323
00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:34.500
Holly Roddenbery: had too much to drink, and we went for a walk together and had a conversation about, you know, good things in life and

324
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:41.760
Holly Roddenbery: You know, what are some good good things that if we could have, you know,

325
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:59.010
Holly Roddenbery: If we could have some good things that we want, what would those be and we both agreed on that we're the type of people that sometimes we need solitude and a place of rest from other people.

326
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:22.350
Holly Roddenbery: And it kind of looked like a cabin off of the grid with, you know, just away. And so we're both to people who need that space or desire that space, and we were joking and talking about. It's a bomb shelter, so that we can go off in it.

327
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.100
Holly Roddenbery: Because you know he and I are both sensitive people

328
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:31.050
Holly Roddenbery: And

329
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:36.750
Holly Roddenbery: So I guess three that we we kind of had a conversation that we understand that.

330
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:39.090
Holly Roddenbery: We need space and

331
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.710
Jodi Dumler: That space is different than a lot

332
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.410
Jodi Dumler: Of our conversation to have.

333
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:58.470
Jodi Dumler: Today, I do think you're out enough risk that you need to keep thinking about it. Yeah, neither of you and want something to happen.

334
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:06.780
Holly Roddenbery: Right. We do love each other we care for each other, we see each other's pain, we can always fix that.

335
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.580
Holly Roddenbery: We have to give each other space and trust.

336
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:22.380
Holly Roddenbery: And through all of that I think john is actually understanding some things, and I am too.

337
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:26.430
So,

338
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.710
Jodi Dumler: Part of my love and trust is

339
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:43.050
Jodi Dumler: Protecting the other person from themselves and and that's really the way I look at you, having a location for safety.

340
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:51.780
Jodi Dumler: Is not only protecting yourself you're protecting him from the person he doesn't want to be and him getting himself in trouble. Are you in him.

341
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.750
Jodi Dumler: Doing something goes if you would regret.

342
00:46:56.550 --> 00:47:04.020
Jodi Dumler: It's a protection for both of you. And that's the biggest thing. And so I keep coming and pushing it because I don't want something to happen, but I'm also pushing it because I don't

343
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.670
Jodi Dumler: Know it feels like this horrible thing.

344
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:16.620
Jodi Dumler: And I feel like you feel like it's if you were to say something to him. He would feel like it was this horrible thing and I get that.

345
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:25.650
Jodi Dumler: But if you to want to ride this out. It's a way of protecting yourself through this

346
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:26.700
Yeah.

347
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:31.110
Jodi Dumler: You guys can try and safely do this.

348
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:34.320
Holly Roddenbery: Yeah.

349
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.330
Jodi Dumler: So I think you took pictures of all the safety stuff last week.

350
00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.310
Holly Roddenbery: Do what

351
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.760
Jodi Dumler: Do you think you took pictures of all those safety pages last week.

352
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:51.720
Yes.

353
00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.940
Jodi Dumler: No, I was gonna say, I'm guessing you didn't look through them all. So I was gonna say maybe this week.

354
00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.170
Yeah.

355
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:06.930
Holly Roddenbery: I have it. I've just been doing a lot of journaling and reading and seeking praying and

356
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.050
Holly Roddenbery: Trying to understand

357
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:18.660
Holly Roddenbery: Some places that I hold myself accountable for going on.

358
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:24.390
Holly Roddenbery: An Overview

359
00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:26.970
Holly Roddenbery: Page.

360
00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:31.650

362
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.880

363
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:46.980
Jodi Dumler: As your therapist looking in. I can't in good conscience not consistently tell you you have to have an active state.

364
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.120
Jodi Dumler: That's goal number one.

365
00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.070

368
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:16.080
Holly Roddenbery: With the whole coronavirus thing. I'm not so shorter, but I believe that I would have placed there.

369
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:23.790
Holly Roddenbery: And I do believe that john would understand if I needed dead bolts. If I approached him.

370
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.940
Holly Roddenbery: When he was more of himself.

371

373
00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:47.700
