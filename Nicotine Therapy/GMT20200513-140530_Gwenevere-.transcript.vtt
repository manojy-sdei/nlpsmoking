00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Just send a quick message.

2
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.540
Michelle Lucero: So I don't have the internet. This morning we lost it last night.

3
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm so

4
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing data.

5
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.120
Michelle Lucero: Are you and

6
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.540
Michelle Lucero: I'm sorry, what

7
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're using

8
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It now or are you using Wi Fi.

9
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.930
Michelle Lucero: Yeah data I'm in red right now.

10
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.210
Michelle Lucero: You keep freezing. But I'm hopefully it'll work.

11
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know all about it. But let me ask you something. Here's what I've learned from other clients if there's not enough data, it starts to get

12
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: sketchy. Is there anything you could do to make sure you have enough in order to have sort of a fluid process. Is that something you do where you like okay there's an account of it and maybe you're on a low amount of data left. Does that make sense.

13
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.140
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I checked it before I logged into virtual women.

14
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.910
Michelle Lucero: Okay, please do for 17 so our data is global.

15
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said is that 171 717

16
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.700
Michelle Lucero: Know what

17
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.230
Michelle Lucero: Are

18
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.840
Michelle Lucero: The US

19
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't hear any of that take yourself off for a minute.

20
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see if we can hear a little better. All right. Let's check in here. Let me hear you, tell me again what the data is.

21
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.210
Michelle Lucero: One of the 17 the beach. So

22
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. Um, try this. Michelle, try to stay here and call me or I'm going to call you now stay here. Let me just see what happens if

23
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.280
Michelle Lucero: I call you to not just take it off.

24
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, cuz I'm going to call you right now.

25
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.830
Michelle Lucero: It's

26
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that the 204 4543 number

27
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.070
Michelle Lucero: All

28
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta do a little bit more logistics here.

29
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, no. I think I can do it from here.

30
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I can hear you. Can you hear me. Yes. Okay. So let's just do this here. So you're saying

31
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: With your video there and you can hear me here, so not ideal, but what we can do today is we won't be able to do sort of that inner child stuff we were doing before, or any kind of empty chair.

32
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can do some cognitive behavioral things

33
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

34
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you tell me a little bit about what you were talking about a group like tell me more about oh you and Noel are doing dynamics with you and your brother and your dad and things like that.

35
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean,

36
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Yesterday,

37
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.250
I'm

38
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling me

39
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That she's happy I spoke my mind. He knows that part for me to do.

40
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking to work done really for me before I go trying and I know

41
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been there.

42
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Never been to it.

43
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, I kind of

44
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Want her to

45
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: See

46
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That I was

47
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Sharing with her mother, the advice.

48
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: She didn't take it like that at all and

49
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like, Oh, well, you know, I'm glad you told me, because after I thought I was being pretty harsh.

50
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But

51
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, and then now we can't get over them.

52
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: beating yourself up over there because you look up to him and

53
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Let

54
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's focus on your assertive communication.

55
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That that was one of the things that you notice felt brave about maybe even accomplished.

56
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And it didn't turn out as bad as you thought you thought maybe she was going to get really angry or defensive, but it turns out she she sort of acknowledging that that's a piece of progress in you.

57
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: She

58
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing

59
00:07:59.220 --> 00:07:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: She usually

60
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

61
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And she really didn't she just told me she told me. We'll continue this

62
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: At home and they start talking about

63
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I said I thought about it for like a good women. Yeah. And then I was like, oh, if

64
00:08:51.270 --> 00:09:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt bad for him. And then my founding Paris for him or her what she needs and she was, she was being told her confidence.

65
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Our partners.

66
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So it kind of got just

67
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Like Ottawa.

68
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So stick with stick with the, I don't want to hear this. When should stay there because I think it's useful to stick with what you what you do and don't like

69
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Going into what other people might like or not, like, but rather what you didn't like. What did you not like about what she was saying.

70
00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: She was saying that

71
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: To check in with the family.

72
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And

73
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Friends, like

74
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was the emotion you felt when she perceived you as being with low life friends.

75
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I

76
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: told him how he made me

77
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it made me feel like

78
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt

79
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I had done that.

80
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Before

81
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And you ended up saying what to her. Tell me again.

82
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: In front of me to meet phone comfortable

83
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Uncomfortable.

84
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of shock.

85
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: There with her and she apologized and I'm sorry I don't even make you feel uncomfortable later. And, you know, the way he

86
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Was

87
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing

88
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It. I totally get that but picking up by them do it.

89
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

90
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like confrontation.

91
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Even told me that

92
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: She

93
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Was

94
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: A long time ago and we were at her house and she was putting in right in front of me and I feel like whole demeanor change and it's super embarrassed when she does not. And I remember telling her when he left the room like oh my god than you. Then I'm going to leave prison.

95
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Something with knowledge, a long time ago that

96
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: If they don't include

97
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It just makes me feel so terrible. And I see it has to do with when I was a little girl. My mom and dad.

98
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And I had no choice because

99
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it. Michelle That's it. That's the insight and

100
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, every time it happens like I can't go.

101
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Shut it down.

102
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.160
So,

103
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being able to confront

104
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That that not wanting to because it was a long history.

105
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're a little girl. How has it.

106
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Got in your way, at times, because you dislike confrontations so much. What does it prevented you from doing

107
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

108
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me my homeboy, literally.

109
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like the arguments, you know,

110
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't happen.

111
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, if I stick up for myself or if I stand up for myself. I know.

112
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone's going to get it.

113
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But then I'm thinking I should be the one yelling

114
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you're describing is really the two options, but those two options are old. Those are from your childhood and much of your family continues to operate. We're either sucking it up, pretending like nothing wrong or we're yelling

115
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're not the only one that does that all of you kind of suffer.

116
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's not the whole truth. You know how you said, well, it's either one or the other. I'm either shushing or if I speak. It'll just be it'll be a confrontation, but through therapy through working with me.

117
00:15:49.680 --> 00:16:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What other option is there and do you see the light at the end of the tunnel that there is an third way at least a third way to still speak your truth and it not be a blow out

118
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Face to face.

119
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't this time though. Yeah.

120
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was not just about your cousin. It was not you notice something in yourself.

121
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It reminded you

122
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Of a part of you.

123
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, the addict hard, not the authentic you

124
00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That you don't like. And we covered this, about two sessions ago. Anyway, you had a big sort of awakening around. Wait a minute. I have that pardon me, too. Thats hanging out with people that you wouldn't normally hang out with

125
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that make you think about that is you appreciate the fact that you to

126
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that history.

127
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

128
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I never saw

129
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Myself.

130
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I am. And I need to

131
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to

132
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to make sure that in there.

133
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, remember that you are and give me examples of things that you are doing that makes the difference between I'm a drug addict versus I'm a recovering drug addict. Tell me the behaviors.

134
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That distinguish that separate those two different terms.

135
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Paycheck to

136
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: paycheck to paycheck. I've been saving money.

137
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't feel the calling the calling for country.

138
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And go for it, the one making the phone call.

139
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I also know that that

140
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I

141
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Was thinking in my head that I would be for

142
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: My first

143
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Meal

144
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Shell, I can get up to like

145
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about even small things. I mean, not all things that would have never thought about like

146
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being able to buy groceries, if I spend my money.

147
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Or

148
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: My dog. I don't have any to go

149
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been thinking rationally.

150
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And not just the company, right. So we're going to make me feel the way I'm going to like my dad or my

151
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Head before I thought about that.

152
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I could get high enough, Justin, not being cut off.

153
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you start

154
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To get me.

155
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: To not call

156
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You know anybody

157
00:20:53.730 --> 00:21:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of that person who did that who who can stop caring about the most important people in her life. What do you think of

158
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: That part of you that's part of your history.

159
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: People showing and not only

160
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel

161
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Great.

162
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

163
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And about on the flip side of that, that was beautiful. Michelle, you're, you're really starting to see that there's a distinction between when you're in

164
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: A RECOVERY mindset. You're calling people your distinguishing. I don't want to talk to this person, it's going to be a negative thing or maybe they're going to offer me a pill or something. They're gonna they're just going to be toxic. I'm not going to pick the phone up

165
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're thinking through stresses more cause effect and consequence, thinking about the real fiscal cost the monetary money cost.

166
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The facts of the matter. If you go use

167
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: The price will pay for it, you're thinking more before you're running to the thought of using

168
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I always have hard questions for you. Right.

169
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It won't be a life where it's one or the other.

170
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If you think about that you're in a car like life is like you're on this journey right and you have some sort of map. Maybe the map is religion and it gives you some idea which way to turn teaches you right from wrong and good from bad and things like that.

171
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe just your own family values have taught you, those things. But what it doesn't teach you

172
00:23:53.010 --> 00:24:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is about potholes about what to do. And there's hail. It doesn't teach you about this hill that's there.

173
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: doesn't teach you the terrain. That's what's the stuff right in front of you a map only gives you basic information you are left to having to navigate to find your way.

174
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: With just you and your intuition.

175
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You did that with Noel

176
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You followed your intuition.

177
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And you registered some limit that was reached when you felt uncomfortable.

178
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's a place to start a shell, because normally what you do is you base all of your truth on what other people tell you your truth is

179
00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can't take it anymore and you end up using

180
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What therapy with this authentic self is asking of you is that you pay attention to what you want more frequently.

181
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: There's, there's nothing wrong with what your intuition tells you you have just not been listening to it for a very long time.

182
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The price you pay when you do not listen to yourself.

183
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Could mean you don't talk to your son or daughter for weeks you cut your sister off you cut your father off cousins.

184
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That's too extreme, isn't it.

185
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So what this is proposing what recovery minds that is offering you

186
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

187
00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: To do a little

188
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Of all of it, meaning a little bit of paying attention to what is it that no one wants. What is it that my cousin was a little bit, which means empathy, you can still care about the people around you and then you come back to you.

189
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have empathy for you.

190
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The rest of your life. Michelle, it's not going to be one way or the other. It's going to be a little bit of both, on any given minute any given day.

191
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Your fantasy that life will be without conflict is in possible

192
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm sorry.

193
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But I can pretty much guess because I'm human, too. People will not see eye to eye with you. They will want something different than what you want, they will see it from another point of view.

194
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And the freedom can come in. It doesn't have to be an all out rejection yelling name calm fist fighting

195
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: But she will slowly over time have more and more instances where you speak your truth, like you did with Noel and it will have a positive outcome you won't have to compromise yourself.

196
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be able to speak your truth. And yes, you will risk an argument.

197
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But it may become worth it to you.

198
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about

199
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking

200
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: We're making civil after a week, I kind of felt like a protected my phone and

201
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I was really worried about know. Wow, even though

202
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The Goddess in a

203
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Bed something even though I

204
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Just said could you continue this

205
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Year, so

206
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I couldn't sleep for my son, but I'm sure it wasn't uncomfortable as well.

207
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, Wow, I can't believe I did that.

208
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's why we're staying with this so long because it's a real departure. It's a left turn when normally you've been going right. It's a real different way of being.

209
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And

210
00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That takes faith in yourself. Michelle, to have pulled that off.

211
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about. Now another time that you could believe in yourself enough that it's just as good as anybody else's

212
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right to speak, you're, you're just as important, just as valuable your opinion cares as much weight as anybody else's that you could actually speak up. Can you picture running into that maybe in the house. Maybe your dad's house.

213
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an example just kind of how you think it might show up even today.

214
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just use that

215
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

216
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I was saying, let's use that example, are you going to get that laundry finished. Can you hear me.

217
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's use that

218
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to stay with that one. So just stay there with this. And now I want you to think about

219
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How you knew in your body that you were uncomfortable with what

220
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: With what no well was saying.

221
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember where you felt that

222
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Were

223
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: In there it is, that's the one that's when we know something's really off.

224
00:30:46.680 --> 00:31:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So now just picture the tone of voice, the face of movement. Everything that Anthony's going to do. You've seen him do it before and you can hear his voice are you going to get that laundry finished.

225
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you feel that in your body.

226
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's it doing

227
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: making me hot. Yeah.

228
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A little tiny bit of it now.

229
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now, as if it were happening now. What do you believe about yourself right now.

230
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: In the presence of being said that to in the presence of this hot stomach. What do you believe about you.

231
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: To me.

232
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Telling me to finish. There's no way that sound controlling, but I won't need to be reminded.

233
00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Me to do and

234
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: He said, Are you can finish, I want you to do well. Yeah, I don't want it sitting there for the rest of the week. Okay. Stay right there that you're doing.

235
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Your emotion. What's the actual emotion with offset.

236
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Mad angry.

237
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Because people feel good. And then they make me feel like

238
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not

239
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Having the people

240
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That make sense.

241
00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't like imagination how your son sees you. When Anthony reminds you of things you already know and you do not need reminding

242
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Against again spending time coming outside of your own awareness and you dip into how I'm Stefan might see you

243
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So you came out, come back to you.

244
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with notice you got a lot. Yeah, you do. But stay here with Matt instead

245
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with Matt.

246
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I'm Anthony. And you are not doubting the fact that you already know.

247
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want to do. You've already decided

248
00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Frankly, whether your priorities for that day are laundry or maybe you've decided you're going to deliberately leave the laundry alone because we can't

249
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Do everything all at once. No matter what we have to turn our attention to something and maybe it isn't laundry and it's none of his business to know how what your priorities are. You are a grown woman. So let's just say that that were true, that you have nothing to prove to him.

250
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm curious about whether any of what I said is true for you. Do you know you. Oh.

251
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.930
Anthony nothing

252
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: As far as that moment goes you all have no explanation.

253
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

254
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you know that that's what I want. I want to know what you know about yourself. You have the right to not explain why not boundaries not done.

255
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, why, what is it, what is true about you that you don't owe them an explanation.

256
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm always doing something

257
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What about who you are, let's go a little deeper than that.

258
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you know about you.

259
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you valuable because you cook and clean and are pretty and nice.

260
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like for you to believe that

261
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, you do.

262
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You live it every day. If you just if you told me that your value is based on

263
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're pretty that you cook and that you clean. What is that like

264
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: For you.

265
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: real value.

266
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.100
Gwenevere Abriel: These are important things to explore

267
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you value in your son.

268
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you value your son, if he's in a bad mood and doesn't cheer you up.

269
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Nope, I want to know what you value about him. What is it, how do you value him if he's not cheering YOU UP AND HE'S NOT FUNNY. What is it that you value about him.

270
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

271
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You just not have to do anything in order to be loved. Is that right,

272
00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now shift that back over to this image with Anthony and you're looking at Anthony

273
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And I find him. And I say, you're going to get that laundry finished.

274
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: How can you value.

275
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The same way you value in your son.

276
00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Value yourself right then.

277
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: What can you be thinking that could shift your whole orientation.

278
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not true.

279
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: At the end of the day, you're

280
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Gonna get down.

281
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything.

282
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think it's possible that that will be inherited by your son, even though you may want it. Otherwise, what you're showing him is that his value is based on what he does and not who he is.

283
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely

284
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Will you consider reflecting on that a little, a little today, or maybe through some journaling that what's at stake.

285
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your sense of love for yourself and modeling that at least for your son.

286
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you're not motivated yet for you. But oftentimes, you can get motivated for other people. And maybe we got to work with that and let that be the progression.

287
00:40:52.200 --> 00:41:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That what you might motivate is a need to model valuing myself so that my son can love himself.

288
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be an invitation to just, just to consider that just sort of either let it sit in the unconscious in the background on the back burner or maybe put it in the foreground and give it some real intentional reflection through journaling perhaps

289
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Or not.

290
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like to do

291
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Controlling

292
00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Controlling when he walks around it.

293
00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Filled if

294
00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I wanted people to stand up for life and

295
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Creation.

296
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's my guest Michelle that until you love yourself enough value yourself just cuz you exist.

297
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't feel confident and you're going to wait until you have to advocate for someone else.

298
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll never reach the threshold of value.

299
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Until you really sit with what we're talking about today. This is a big one.

300
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The reality is you owe him nothing you owe me nothing you can do nothing and still be lovable.

301
00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you and I can do our therapy and we can do these interventions together and we can work through how the unconscious keeps undermining your ability to kind of know that to be true.

302
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't know anybody who who's assertive, who doesn't believe in themselves. They can't do it.

303
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And we just ran across you don't

304
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: really believe that your value comes just because you were born.

305
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's based on superficial thing like

306
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: cooked meal you're just as lovable. If you laid in bed.

307
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And

308
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Cried

309
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And it didn't cook, and then the next day. Well then you did or then three days later you're like, Whoa, look at this next one I'm si was a real lump yesterday wasn't

310
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not your value you're lovable just

311
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Not because of what you do.

312
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: If I had to believe that Michelle would not have to judge people

313
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they aren't meeting my standards, wouldn't I have to judge myself as a loser. Because I didn't achieve whatever whatever my measures are

314
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: it's me, it's me.

315
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, give those some thoughts. I saw the doctor was trying to get in here. I don't know. Did you guys want to talk. Is there any piece of the medication part that maybe she's trying

316
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I think you're starting work, I think, unless you heard differently are you starting still on May 16 or you're not still not sure

317
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Schedule my work, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and I go back

318
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if they're going to change that I will let you know once I get there Saturday morning.

319
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Your sense of availability for individual therapy.

320
00:45:51.120 --> 00:46:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Send me an update of what you want, as far as individual therapy and if group needs to change. Send me a little message. Maybe on Saturday. Can you set an alarm for that.

321
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. All right, but you sure you looked at some pretty difficult things today. Michelle.

322
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

323
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So just take a few minutes and sit without a little maybe do some journaling or even just a few minutes to just sort of be present with with what you did.

324
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll see you on group, but I'll hear from you on Saturday. Okay, and enjoy your day back. I hope everybody's friendly and cheerful.

325
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Later.

326
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:47.700
Erica Valdez: Hi Miss Graham.

327
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.680
Erica Valdez: Oh my god, I don't think today's gonna be a good day.

328
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And I saw a little something that you have

329
00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.610
Is it nasza

330
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.590
Erica Valdez: Oh, yeah.

331
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Growing up all morning.

332
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:08.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You went you

334
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Went to the ER.

335
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:16.950
Erica Valdez: No, I have to set an appointment and I think I'm allergic to my IUD.

336
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:18.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my

337
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.200
Erica Valdez: Goodness.

338
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:28.080
Erica Valdez: Every time every time I start my period I start to feel like there's like I feel like I'm gonna pass out. And then I just feel so nauseated.

339
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh, yeah, there's definitely

340
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: A Blab you

341
00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:46.800
Erica Valdez: But it happens every month. So, I mean, I can share with you for as long as I mean, but I don't feel good today.

342
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, well, it's gonna be really hard for you to concentrate um

343
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.100
Erica Valdez: Let's see how

344
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's reschedule.

345
00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.740
Erica Valdez: If we can for next week. That'll be good.

346
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This down down may 27

347
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:11.250
At nine

348
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Hooked up but

349
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And

350
00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:23.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And

351
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:23.430
You

352
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Really really firming up plans to have this looked at, there's something wrong.

353
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.560
Erica Valdez: Or why we're supposed to remember I was supposed to have my tubes tied

354
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:41.370
Erica Valdez: Yeah. Yes.

355
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:48.060
Erica Valdez: All the Kobe and started happening. I was supposed to have my tubes tight. That's what I wasn't going to be one of the Presidents.

356
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.780
Erica Valdez: Well, this is why because the birth control gets me

357
00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:55.920
Erica Valdez: Sick and I

358
00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.270
Erica Valdez: Yeah, it's horrible every month. Oh my.

359
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:02.550
Erica Valdez: Gosh, so

360
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: May 2727 and then at the same time at 9am

361
00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:21.570
Erica Valdez: Okay, yeah, I'm sorry, I would stay on with you but like I have to focus on my breathing. Like if you notice my lips, a term super

362
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:30.450
Erica Valdez: Bright, I don't know if you can see like they just turned super pale, I feel like. And I don't know if you can see my hands. They just shake and then I just feel nauseated.

363
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:53.130
Erica Valdez: When it comes. I don't have a full period. It's weird. I just have like this feeling, and then I have brown, black, like it's all super weird. Yeah, it's, I don't know how to tell people, and I always tell my girls super weird. But I don't know why.

364
00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And

365
00:49:56.070 --> 00:50:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe scheduling with your gynecologist explaining this that doctor should really be familiar with those symptoms.

366
00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.190
Erica Valdez: Well, so I

367
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.860
Erica Valdez: That's why I was supposed to get my tubes tied, because I do think that I'm allergic to that.

368
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.220
Erica Valdez: With something in the birth control.

369
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

370
00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you do you already have an appointment or

371
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:34.590
Erica Valdez: Yeah, I haven't. I have an appointment they reschedule me from my last surgery.

372
00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:45.960
Erica Valdez: For June 28 I think it is. But if everything continues to happen. They said that they have to reschedule me so I suffer with birth control every month.

373
00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:55.560
Erica Valdez: Around my period of time. So like every month around this time is my period of time. So like if you catch me up. This time you're going to catch me like this every month.

374
00:50:56.430 --> 00:51:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, how would you feel about calling them this morning, instead of meeting with me. Instead, letting them know that those symptoms continue

375
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:04.980
Erica Valdez: And

376
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.560
Erica Valdez: Go to worse, like I hate it.

377
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can get an earlier appointment.

378
00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.340
Erica Valdez: Okay, well I'm gonna hang up with you now that I'm going to call them.

379
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:16.410
Erica Valdez: Perfect. Awesome.

380
00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:20.730
Okay, okay.
