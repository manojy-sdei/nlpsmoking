LIsa Anderson: How are you

3
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.040
Amber Romero: I'm good. So video chat really draining my battery and I have no battery charger.

4
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.040
LIsa Anderson: No worries. I can hear you. Um, can you see me or we're just on audio.

5
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.930
Amber Romero: Yeah, I can see you.

6
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.640
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right, good. No worries. Okay. Um, no problem. How are you doing today.

7
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.830
Amber Romero: I'm good, how are you

8
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.560
LIsa Anderson: Good, thanks. Um, how, how did it go with getting your prescription this week.

9
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.610
Amber Romero: Um, it was like with it with the doctor, it's over was just hoping

10
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.020
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, both

11
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.190
Amber Romero: Um, it was a surprise. We'll see what the doctor went to tell me

12
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.250
Amber Romero: Like he went over like a recap of my script. And I told them no, that's not

13
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:32.640
Amber Romero: Not what I have. And that's not what I got and stuff. So I told him what happened and you know he he made sure the right script went through this time, but he said that, um, but next time he's gonna do like a bridge or something.

14
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.420
LIsa Anderson: Mm hmm.

15
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.730
Amber Romero: So I have, I should have a prescription like Friday morning.

16
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.860
Amber Romero: Just for like three

17
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.110
Amber Romero: Okay.

18
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.590
Amber Romero: And then a regular prescription after after group.

19
00:01:47.430 --> 00:02:03.360
LIsa Anderson: After group. Okay, let me. I didn't see that in your chart so um yeah I had checked on that last week, so I guess yeah bridge, just to kind of get you through until your next, you know, until group. So, um,

20
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.860
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, you're not on. Yeah. Like I said, I'm, you know, last week, you've been compliant with all of your appointments and so

21
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.280
LIsa Anderson: Hopefully that was just a one time.

22
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.460
LIsa Anderson: One time, you see you have last week.

23
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.770
Amber Romero: Yeah, well, I think, um, I don't know how it's, I don't know how the bridge is going to work.

24
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:48.330
Amber Romero: Yeah, I would think there would be enough for seven days with 21 but maybe what time I don't know cuz I don't want the like the bridge thing that has to be something that we have to do every Friday because I don't really call it kind of hard to, uh,

25
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.340
Amber Romero: Oh, I gotta get my prescription change where else to it's kind of hard to get to the pharmacy when you're going too far away.

26
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.170
LIsa Anderson: Sure it is. I'm going to teach you a lot means it's closer

27
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.160
Amber Romero: Yeah, well, so I guess that I didn't know. But I guess there's two on the street that I hadn't changed to

28
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.300
Amber Romero: Watch. Yeah, there's two

29
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.730
LIsa Anderson: Yeah.

30
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.610
Amber Romero: It is really far from

31
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.370
Amber Romero: Where, where I'm at.

32
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.410
Amber Romero: But there's literally one about three minutes of thrown

33
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.860
Amber Romero: This one was like 30 minutes

34
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.420
LIsa Anderson: Oh, wow.

35
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:40.290
LIsa Anderson: Okay, yeah, yeah, definitely trying to get it to you know to one that's more convenient for you and then sore. How many days. Where are you getting right now.

36
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.930
LIsa Anderson: Seven. Seven days, whereas

37
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.390
LIsa Anderson: You're having to go pick up a new refill every week.

38
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.290
LIsa Anderson: Yeah.

39
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.060
Amber Romero: Okay that is that normal

40
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.280
LIsa Anderson: You know, I don't know, um, I don't want to give you any wrong information.

41
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:10.080
LIsa Anderson: So I know some people are on less than that, um, I know some people are on less than that, if they're not compliant with their appointments, like they might only get

42
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:20.250
LIsa Anderson: Two days worth of three days worth or four days worth. I don't know if people are on more than that. So I can find out, but I don't want to give you any wrong information.

43
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.340
LIsa Anderson: Yeah I know people are on less than that. But still you're having to go to the pharmacy every week.

44
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.120
Yeah.

45
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.850
LIsa Anderson: So that, that is that is tough. Yeah, even even every week, having

46
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.570
LIsa Anderson: To run out.

47
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.670
LIsa Anderson: So, um, let me let me find out for you.

48
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.580
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. So, okay. But you do have that seven day

49
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.860
LIsa Anderson: Supply now.

50
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.500
Amber Romero: Yeah, and then

51
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.800
Amber Romero: Since you're asking, Can we, can you

52
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.530
Amber Romero: Is there a way to check what's what's supposed to be there. Like, I don't know if

53
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.740
Amber Romero: If the seven or if the

54
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.400
Amber Romero: Friday thing is already sent for, like, how that works. I know.

55
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.840
Amber Romero: Early

56
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.490
LIsa Anderson: Friday.

57
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.500
LIsa Anderson: Oh, you mean about getting that additional bridge on Friday.

58
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.820
Yeah.

59
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.670
LIsa Anderson: But let me see. Um,

60
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:35.460
LIsa Anderson: Okay, so I'm seeing on the 24th, they did the Suboxone but that was already

61
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.800
LIsa Anderson: A week ago.

62
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:49.200
LIsa Anderson: Oh no. Okay. So, today's the 30th. So yeah, so last Friday. Okay, so let's just see what he did on last Friday. So, last Friday. He put in

63
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.110
LIsa Anderson: 21 is the quantity with zero refills, um,

64
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.870
LIsa Anderson: And how many do you take a day.

65
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.450
LIsa Anderson: Three, three a day. Okay, so that's seven days worth

66
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.850
LIsa Anderson: Um, okay. So that's what you got last time.

67
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.510
LIsa Anderson: That's the only one. I'm seeing was the 24th. So I imagine

68
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.950
LIsa Anderson: That Dr Omen hoping in, you know, another

69
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.740
LIsa Anderson: At least a seven day I will find out, you know what, what kind of the processes on that.

70
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:37.200
LIsa Anderson: If you can get more than that or or more, you know, quantity in the last few a longer amount of time.

71
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.060
Amber Romero: And then the

72
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:50.160
LIsa Anderson: Other thing. I didn't want to check in on you with AND SEE IF WE WANT TO TALK WITH DR element about this was, um, you know, I know you talk about anxiety. We talked about that a lot last time.

73
00:06:50.670 --> 00:07:01.410
LIsa Anderson: And you have some questions about that just your, your feelings of restless this, I was kind of looking at some of those forms that you filled out again.

74
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.480
LIsa Anderson: This time, how, how would you say your anxieties been

75
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.680
Amber Romero: Saying, which just

76
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.910
Amber Romero: I don't know if I've gotten used to it or

77
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.970
Amber Romero: There, or what does it just

78
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.190
Amber Romero: Maybe I'm just on the goal so much. It just doesn't wake

79
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.210
Amber Romero: Not that it doesn't bother me. It just doesn't

80
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.760
Amber Romero: Explain it like it.

81
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.710
Amber Romero: Like suppresses this off. I guess is the best way to say it until

82
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.520
Amber Romero: Until I stop and then once they stop then

83
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:49.920
Amber Romero: That's when it kind of my kids anymore. I don't know. Maybe it's because actually have a moment to think about it or or what you know.

84
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:58.260
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, yeah, for some reason, I'm still seeing on that the questionnaire you submitted.

85
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.660
LIsa Anderson: Though, is called the gap seven you are at about a 21

86
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:13.860
LIsa Anderson: Which is still, you know, pretty I'm pretty pretty high level on the pH q nine. That's the one that asks you about depression. I'm

87
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.440
LIsa Anderson: That, again, I'm only seeing that from April 4, how would you say your mood has been as far as like feeling sad or down this past week.

88
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.400
Amber Romero: I guess it just depends on on what happens

89
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:42.660
Amber Romero: Or who I interact with and stuff. Yeah. Like I said before, I don't like to think I'm a depressed person. I don't think I'm a depressed person but i mean i i've been called a narcissist.

90
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.120
Amber Romero: Don't really know how, but

91
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.240
Amber Romero: I think it wasn't going so

92
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.770
LIsa Anderson: Far okay but in in okay this past

93
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.230
Amber Romero: Year I felt like you've been okay

94
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.500
Amber Romero: Okay, sometimes a little bit like

95
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:10.020
Amber Romero: Cool. So let me know what happens next, or what I'm going to do, you know,

96
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.120
LIsa Anderson: As far as what as far as what you're going to do.

97
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.680
Amber Romero: Like

98
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.130
Amber Romero: Just in general like what happens next.

99
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.960
LIsa Anderson: What happens next. As far as your

100
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.030
LIsa Anderson: Recovery.

101
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.080
LIsa Anderson: Like what you're gonna

102
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.080
Amber Romero: Just a just in general.

103
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.530
Amber Romero: Worry about stuff like that.

104
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:46.470
LIsa Anderson: And you mentioned the anxiety gets worse. She said, when you're not as active and you sort of feel like when you start to sit and think

105
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.300
LIsa Anderson: Okay, what do your thoughts.

106
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.540
LIsa Anderson: start rolling. What, what kind of things.

107
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.800
Amber Romero: As I heard rolling in mind.

108
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:06.660
LIsa Anderson: And does your mind just sort of start going what what sort of thoughts go through your mind when you're having those anxious thoughts.

109
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:17.070
Amber Romero: Um, what is this person thinking, what is that person thinking and how are you going to do this. Okay, this is what's gonna happen here and I didn't know just

110
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:28.890
Amber Romero: There's just a whole bunch of different stuff not really anything particular just because I have a whole bunch of stuff that goes on in my life at one time to say think about, oh, it

111
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.380
LIsa Anderson: Sure. Well, yeah, you definitely you definitely have quite a lot going on.

112
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:44.370
LIsa Anderson: So, some of it is maybe sort of social around like what's this person thinking about me or are they thinking something bad about me is that

113
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:53.940
Amber Romero: I'm not, I really don't think like along those lines because they don't really care when I really want me I'm

114
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.740
Amber Romero: Just like

115
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.660
Amber Romero: This person so

116
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.480
Amber Romero: I wonder if, like, I hope it goes through. So I hope they do what they say they're going to do rather

117
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:13.920
Amber Romero: Know, because not then this happened or that happened you know if they see this when this happens, you know, just start going off on tangents that

118
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.750
Amber Romero: Don't really matter. You shouldn't even matter.

119
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.970
LIsa Anderson: Right, but it you know it does matter in the sense that it's you know it's bothering you. And that can be a

120
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:37.980
LIsa Anderson: If we can find sort of a starting place to look at, you know, what sort of a reasonable worry because, of course, you have a lot going on. It's totally natural to kind of

121
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:45.390
LIsa Anderson: Have those thoughts about what what's going to happen with this or what am I going to do that. But then if it gets to the point where

122
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:54.090
LIsa Anderson: You're really kind of stewing on it. You're really ruminating on it, you're sort of spinning yourself in circles and not getting anywhere.

123
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.140
LIsa Anderson: That's kind of where the worry is is not productive.

124
00:11:59.220 --> 00:11:59.820
LIsa Anderson: Right.

125
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.630
Amber Romero: Oh,

126
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.160
LIsa Anderson: So some of its around like will a person follow through.

127
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.500
LIsa Anderson: And just worrying about

128
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.830
LIsa Anderson: You know, relying on someone and then doing what they're saying what they're saying they're going to do.

129
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:22.800
Amber Romero: Um, yeah, pretty much. There's, like, for example, my dad. He said he was going to give me a car. Um, so

130
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.680
Amber Romero: He told me that's like months ago.

131
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:36.000
Amber Romero: He said it will not mine. So I was like the quarantine started because you know he gave to me. And then he started, and he said, Okay, well,

132
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:46.530
Amber Romero: You're going to have to buy, you know, basically, wait until this is over and you know maybe along the way. If it doesn't end soon and you can use your

133
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:55.200
Amber Romero: Your stimulus money to pay for the car dealership and the tow truck. And that's something that we've done before. I was like, Okay, cool. That works now.

134
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.930
Amber Romero: Now,

135
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:05.880
Amber Romero: That I got my my students check. You know, I took him calling a told him I was like okay so

136
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:20.370
Amber Romero: What do we do once I get my check to get the car over here, you know, because he's in California and I'm in New Mexico, and he's like, Oh, well, you know, I still have to do this and they still have to do this.

137
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.200
Amber Romero: You know, we'll cross that bridge when we get there. I mean,

138
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.220
Amber Romero: That's really about the worrying about what people see

139
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.680
Amber Romero: Versus what they do because I will, you're really counting on it. And now that I got my paper.

140
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:36.810
Amber Romero: And

141
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.950
Amber Romero: Just somewhere.

142
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:49.830
LIsa Anderson: Right, yeah. I mean, understandably, that's, that's really frustrating. That's very provoking that you sort of

143
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:59.790
LIsa Anderson: You know, maybe he told you one thing. Okay, now you have the money. And now you're sort of spinning your wheels, a little bit in the sense that

144
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.370
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, you're

145
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.460
LIsa Anderson: You know, he's not maybe giving you the answer for you the answer. The timeframe, you want it.

146
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.900
Amber Romero: Well, yeah. So just know the story about that.

147
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:25.860
Amber Romero: And they start thinking about that. Well, today, get do something else and around our, I don't know, just like you said you start thinking about things that haven't even happened and worrying about it.

148
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:41.610
LIsa Anderson: Right, right. So yeah, naturally you kind of start to think of maybe other solutions which I think is, is really good, problem solving, you know, just kind of using those thought processes to say, Well, okay. Should I go do something on my own.

149
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:51.870
LIsa Anderson: So sure that I think that those are definitely you know worries and there's a lot that you can't control right now.

150
00:14:53.730 --> 00:15:00.120
LIsa Anderson: You know, you know, the world, you know, and none of us can kind of control everything that sort of happened right now.

151
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:10.470
LIsa Anderson: And even those things that you're trying to take care of yourself. So maybe maybe those are the things that you can kind of focus on are the things that you can control.

152
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.800
LIsa Anderson: You know, keep that money safe keeping it you know it's for a car.

153
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:27.900
LIsa Anderson: You know, even though you might not get the car and the time frame you thought or have him deliver it, you know, kind of keeping that tucked away for whenever you you are able to buy a car.

154
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:36.390
LIsa Anderson: That sounds like that would be a good is that kind of maybe one of the things you're thinking will help you get more setup as far as work and

155
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.780
Amber Romero: What do you, what do you mean

156
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.820
LIsa Anderson: Well, because I know it might be tough.

157
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:48.330
LIsa Anderson: As far as getting to work, you know, getting your prescriptions, you know, without your own vehicle.

158
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.990
Amber Romero: Yeah, really. It really does.

159
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:52.470
Help

160
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.230
Amber Romero: We're really could help brother.

161
00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:00.930
LIsa Anderson: Definitely. Have you heard back from any of those applications to the banks.

162
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.620
No.

163
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.830
Amber Romero: No.

164
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.890
Amber Romero: I don't know if maybe I'm

165
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.830
Amber Romero: Because the way I'm playing for them it's through like

166
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:16.800
Amber Romero: Like

167
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.360
Amber Romero: Like job Finder or ZIP RECRUITER or something like that.

168
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:30.690
Amber Romero: And then maybe because I'm going through those websites that could be why because now I just get a whole bunch of like

169
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.500
Amber Romero: spam mail Minister about jobs.

170
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.180
LIsa Anderson: Right.

171
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:41.430
Amber Romero: The things actually getting. That's what I'm thinking is you go to that.

172
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.440
Amber Romero: Website directly when they do search look for work.

173
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:56.790
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, um, you know, some of my yeah experience with that is maybe if you go directly to whatever that banks.

174
00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.580
LIsa Anderson: Application is

175
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.170
LIsa Anderson: Or maybe right like just go directly through them.

176
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.860
LIsa Anderson: That, you know, and then you might, you know, they might get your application more directly the bay, you know, to that bank itself.

177
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:29.460
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, I wanted to ask you, Amber. So what about um we talked about last week, you know, I know you mentioned you were using that Walgreens app. And that kind of helped you just to kind of get Mark some things off as far as like eating well, and

LIsa Anderson: How are your walks this past week. Were you able to get out and about a little bit

179
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.050
Amber Romero: Oh no, I have it actually completely forgot about it. So you mentioned it.

180
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.130
Okay.

181
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:50.160
LIsa Anderson: Hey no problem. Um, alright. So is that something you feel like you maybe want to revisit just trying to

182
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.510
LIsa Anderson: You know some of that restless energy, you've talked about. Is that something you want to try for this week. Coming up to

Amber Romero: Not sleep.

239
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:14.790
LIsa Anderson: Well, exactly. So we talked about that last time about how your body is just kind of readjusting to not having the heroin.

240
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:22.470
LIsa Anderson: And it is it is really common to have been asleep disruptions even, you know,

241
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:28.050
LIsa Anderson: The fact that so heroin. It affects the way that your brain and kind of

242
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.090
LIsa Anderson: goes to sleep.

243
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.040
LIsa Anderson: And so it can take four weeks or more

244
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.180
LIsa Anderson: You know, from the time that your last that you asked you.

245
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.860
LIsa Anderson: For this to kind of have bad insomnia.

246
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.710
LIsa Anderson: So, you know, you're still, you're still kind of early window.

247
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.190
LIsa Anderson: Of just like body, your brain kind of clearing all stuff out.

252
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:26.850
LIsa Anderson: Just I don't use the word detox, but it's just a little bit of a an adjustment period.

253
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.830
LIsa Anderson: You know, heroin can also kind of increase

254
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.450
LIsa Anderson: You know that that sense of restlessness that you've talked about

255
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.730
LIsa Anderson: You know, just all of that stuff in your brain chemistry.

256
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.800
LIsa Anderson: Is going to be drowsy, even if you have slept.

257
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.620
LIsa Anderson: It can cause like really strange dreams or like night terrors. Have you had anything like that.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:16.260
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. So kind of a little bit different, um, you know, from like a nightmare. But definitely, like those night terrors can be really scary really hard to go back to sleep after that.

261
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.690

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:18.810
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

332
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:38.490
LIsa Anderson: Um, yeah, you know, it's like you're doing some of those things already amor, you know, just kind of creating an environment to sleep, um, you know, maybe trying to get like in a little bit of a pre sleep routine like whatever that you know kind of bed. As for you.

333
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.790
LIsa Anderson: But you know that maybe you do get out of bed. If I can't sleep.

334
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.170
LIsa Anderson: And I would just really try to encourage you to try to

335
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.940
LIsa Anderson: Keep a regular sleeping week schedule.

336
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.640
LIsa Anderson: You know as much as you can.

337
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.550
LIsa Anderson: That

338
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:01.800
LIsa Anderson: You know,

339
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.340
LIsa Anderson: Kind of kind of the drugs are still

340
00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.210
LIsa Anderson: Out of your system. I can send you some some information.

341
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.180
LIsa Anderson: You know, just about.

342
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:22.410
LIsa Anderson: You know disruptions that I mean the biggest thing I can tell you this is just that it is really common.

343
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:25.200
LIsa Anderson: And it just takes

344
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:27.780
Amber Romero: Yeah.

345
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.650
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, you know, possibly during the time that you were using

346
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:47.490
LIsa Anderson: Also, possibly sleep deprived because even though you know at at higher doses heroin can, you know, kind of, you know, make people sleepy and make people to, you know, so

347
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.280
LIsa Anderson: To the point where they're not breathing, but

348
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.910
LIsa Anderson: I mean, during the time that you were using to causes huge huge sleep disruptions.

349
00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.430
Amber Romero: Yeah.

350
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:00.660
Oh,

351
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:10.770
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, I know it's tough, you know, I think just kind of trying as much as you can to like stick to a normal

352
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:21.870
LIsa Anderson: Routine, you know, try to go to bed at least try to go to bed at the same time every night and then you at least try to sleep. And then if you can't sleep.

353
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.720
LIsa Anderson: You know, then maybe getting up into a client activity.

354
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.460
Amber Romero: Because sometimes

355
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:54.000
Amber Romero: They even get to the point where it's like okay so closely and I'll wake up and I'll feel like a stuck for hours and it's only been like an hour, so not go to sleep and wake up, then it's just like a long night, I guess, is how people

356
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:01.860
Amber Romero: Are actually

357
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.860
Amber Romero: slept for like 12 hours.

358
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.090
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, it was really so

359
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:13.590
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, and that's common to it kind of disrupts your sense of time.

360
00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.430
LIsa Anderson: And your sense of, of how long you've been asleep.

361
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.230
LIsa Anderson: Yeah yeah all all really common.

362
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.860
LIsa Anderson: Do you have. And then, how's your pain level pin does that keep you up at night.

363
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.960
Amber Romero: I don't know if that's the reason I stay up at night. Like I said it.

364
00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.330
Amber Romero: Or my hands.

365
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.050
LIsa Anderson: And

366
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.760
Amber Romero: My right 114 we

367
00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.020
Amber Romero: Like it feels like pulling

368
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.420
Amber Romero: Pulling nerve like

369
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:16.170
Amber Romero: Yes, maybe like overstretch feeling like I guess the best way to put it.

370
00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:19.800
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

371
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.750
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, so maybe even just like your hand goes to sleep, or maybe some neuropathy, or something like that.

372
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.980
Amber Romero: Oh, swelling,

373
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:47.790
LIsa Anderson: Swelling in your hands.

374
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.370
Amber Romero: Swallowing just in general.

375
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.530
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

376
00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.400
LIsa Anderson: Okay, I'm like just feeling like swallen are kind of bloated or

377
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:17.700
Amber Romero: So, I mean, yeah, even when you're going to start your period and stuff like that. Well, it's fine. But like I'm going bald eagles, or like my fingers.

378
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:28.770
LIsa Anderson: Okay, um, how would you say you're saying you feel pretty hydrated drink water includes throughout the day.

379
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:39.150
Amber Romero: You know, that's the thing. So as far as drinks. You know, I'm Zune. If you're right for me if I if I get to choose you hydrated.

380
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.160
Amber Romero: They get a UTI, and those for free not to

381
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.430
Amber Romero: Get that deodorant or

382
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:55.380
Amber Romero: Bigger UTA so yes really see a thing goes be pretty good. Yeah.

383
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.160
Definitely

384
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:07.080
LIsa Anderson: Yeah. Cuz that that could cause some swelling. Like, especially in your fingers. I'm also the you know the warmer weather could cause like your fingers to swell.

385
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:19.290
LIsa Anderson: You know, but definitely staying hydrated, especially how hot it has been, but have you seen a doctor and for like a like a physical doctor did you see one of the doctors in the program like no

386
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.100
No.

387
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.310
Amber Romero: No, I don't see Dr. They

388
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.040
Amber Romero: Never. Last time I really

389
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.630
Amber Romero: Like see a doctor. Seeing the doctor was

390
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.110
Amber Romero: It was see when I have my last kid.

391
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:43.830
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, yeah, you know, if it's something that you're starting to, um, you know, maybe you could even call like the nurse line.

392
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:54.570
LIsa Anderson: You know through your insurance program or you know there's there's a couple of those nurse advice lines and they can kind of ask you more about your symptoms over the phone.

393
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.030
LIsa Anderson: And kind of let you know.

394
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:05.280
LIsa Anderson: You know what, that that would be my first thought just as a person. I'm not a doctor. But, you know, just possibly dehydration.

395
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.260
LIsa Anderson: Especially with how hot, it's been, but definitely if it's something that

396
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.170
LIsa Anderson: That gets worse or that's bothering you. I definitely maybe maybe check in with a nurse live

397
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:29.400
LIsa Anderson: And, you know, with the combination of like you're not sleeping well you're you're worrying about things and that kind of can really

398
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:36.300
LIsa Anderson: Get you down a little bit too, just as far as like you're not sleeping well. And so then all of these worries come up

399
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:48.300
LIsa Anderson: You know, what about this. What's going to happen with this. So I think, you know, having that sleep deprived that that sleep deprivation, especially over a long period of time which you have

400
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:53.910
LIsa Anderson: That makes it just harder to kind of think rationally and

401
00:37:55.230 --> 00:38:01.290
LIsa Anderson: You know, think as calmly, or as as logically about things as. What if we were fully rested.

402
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:03.660
LIsa Anderson: That make sense.

403
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.040
Amber Romero: Yeah.

404
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.580
LIsa Anderson: You know, even just the day to day stress, you know,

405
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.260
LIsa Anderson: You know, of course, you're just, you're not going to cope

406
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.580
LIsa Anderson: As well as you would if you had been fully rested.

407
00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.140
LIsa Anderson: Um,

408
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:28.980
LIsa Anderson: So, so, you know, in regard to that in regard to sleep, do you just want to kind of keep

409
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.580
Amber Romero: It.

410
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.330
LIsa Anderson: You know, anything we can help with as far as sleep. You want to just kind of

411
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.300
LIsa Anderson: See how the

412
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:40.800

Know,

414
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.470
Amber Romero: But good could be. What could you raise

415
00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:48.600
Amber Romero: Up with

00:38:49.800 --> 00:39:04.050
LIsa Anderson: Well, um, I, I will, I will send out a message today just to kind of see if I can get the answer to your question about how much Suboxone a person can get and that's I'm also just kind of cute.

430
00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:03.240
LIsa Anderson: So you try and then you, you just get to that point that you're so exhausted.

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:05.130
Amber Romero: It's been happening a lot lately. And at the time, like what do you notice it's like 20 minutes

443
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:21.360
LIsa Anderson: Okay Um hmm. That yeah I mean I can hear that you're exhausted. So, that makes sense. But then that's also, um, you know, I think just probably an effect.

444
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:28.350
LIsa Anderson: You know, other here. When you say almost like you're sleeping like you're just falling asleep in the middle of doing something

445
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:34.560
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, that's definitely like not normal within the realm of

446
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.070
LIsa Anderson: You know someone who you know who hasn't

447
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:46.350
LIsa Anderson: used drugs, but when he said, I think that's somewhat just the late in effects on like on your brain and I'm a little those

448
00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:54.810
LIsa Anderson: And I think as long as you're not you're not driving or something where you're at risk of

449
00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.350
LIsa Anderson: At the wheel or something.

450
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.100
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

451
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.860
LIsa Anderson: What about during the day. Do you feel like, and now you talked about, you know, it's hard for you to sit still, or

452
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:13.860
LIsa Anderson: Do you feel like you're you're somewhat active during the day are you

453
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.630
LIsa Anderson: I think every kind of get you to where you're feeling, you know better physically

454
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.600
LIsa Anderson: You feel like you're doing well.

455
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.070
LIsa Anderson: That could really help the whole picture.

456
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.040
LIsa Anderson: Here in the middle of doing something in, and you just fall asleep.

457
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.850
LIsa Anderson: That's going to make it hard for you to, you know, work and just do those day to

458
00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:51.030
Day.

459
00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.600
LIsa Anderson: You feel like your phone keeps you awake at night on your phone.

460
00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:04.740
LIsa Anderson: getting distracted. When you're trying to sleep.

461
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.660
Amber Romero: No cuz I don't even. I don't even hear it.

462
00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:14.400
LIsa Anderson: Okay, good. I know I have to say like

463
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:19.170
Amber Romero: That

464
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.670
LIsa Anderson: That can be distracting.

465
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.840
Amber Romero: To fuck. Sorry I stepped on something.

466
00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:30.870
Amber Romero: Yeah, I know. I sleep I sleep right through. I sleep right through anything when

467
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.090
Amber Romero: I've always been

468
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.600
LIsa Anderson: A little bit of trouble hearing you.

469
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.170
LIsa Anderson: Okay, um,

470
00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.730
LIsa Anderson: I think I lost your audio.

471
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:08.850
LIsa Anderson: Amber. Can you hear me.

472
00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.180
Amber Romero: Yeah, I can hear you.

473
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:21.690
LIsa Anderson: Oh, you're back. Okay. Um, I think you're on a second. I'm okay so yeah let's you know let's kind of keep going about

474
00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:27.330
LIsa Anderson: You know, just sleep hygiene, just trying to get yourself and maybe a routine.

475
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.400
LIsa Anderson: So that you know you can kind of get onto a normal schedule.

476
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:35.880
LIsa Anderson: And and i think

477
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.530
LIsa Anderson: You know what helps them and you're having all these worries some thoughts and

478
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.100
LIsa Anderson: You know, like you said here, kind of get with your dad.

479
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.500
LIsa Anderson: What's been helpful for you.

480
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:03.600
Amber Romero: Smoking

481
00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:05.940
Amber Romero: Smoking

482
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:07.170
LIsa Anderson: Yeah.

483
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:07.980
Amber Romero: So, okay.

484
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.450
Amber Romero: I thought you said something. Oh.

485
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.460
Amber Romero: No. Yes. Just smoking or

486
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:18.960
Amber Romero: No howling somebody's attention anyway.

487
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.380
LIsa Anderson: Calling somebody

488
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:32.820
LIsa Anderson: Okay, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think, you know, as, as far as the worries. I mean, it's definitely natural to have worries and concerns just

489
00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.210
LIsa Anderson: Know it is. Yeah.

490
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.110
LIsa Anderson: Mean those thoughts and those words are going to come up

491
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.460
LIsa Anderson: But, you know, if you feel like

492
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.760
LIsa Anderson: They're spiraling out of control or or there's filing to a point where you can't stop.

493
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.670
LIsa Anderson: It starts to feel excessive.

494
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.170
LIsa Anderson: And I think that's a try to interrupt.

495
00:45:59.460 --> 00:45:59.910
LIsa Anderson: And think

496
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.350
LIsa Anderson: Is this helpful to me right now. Is this realistic.

497
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.250
LIsa Anderson: Is there another way you can go as far as problems.

498
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:15.960
LIsa Anderson: Out of your head.

499
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:37.680
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Um, well. Anything else you think you really wanted to

500
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.050
LIsa Anderson: Talk about

501
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:43.950
Amber Romero: What was that last part after anything else.

502
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:49.320
LIsa Anderson: It like anything else that we haven't covered today that that's on your mind.

503
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:52.410
Amber Romero: No.

504
00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:55.740
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

505
00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:14.610
LIsa Anderson: All right well i i do want to get those questions answered for you about, um, you know, just about sleep. I can send you some information about sleep and sleep hygiene and then, you know, just about how long of a prescription. You can get

506
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:22.080
LIsa Anderson: And, and I think the biggest thing is just to kind of give yourself some patients just give yourself some time to

507
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:25.650
LIsa Anderson: Like your body just

508
00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.180
LIsa Anderson: How

509
00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:32.280
LIsa Anderson: How are things

510
00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.160
LIsa Anderson: With Daniel this week.

511
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.150
Amber Romero: We talk sometimes

512
00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:41.040
We're

513
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:42.510
Amber Romero: Talking

514
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:45.570
LIsa Anderson: You're not really talking right now.

515
00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:46.620
Amber Romero: Oh, no.

516
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.180
Amber Romero: Once every couple days for just a

517
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.190
Amber Romero: Couple minutes

518
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:54.270
Okay.

519
00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.420
LIsa Anderson: Things are going okay now.

520
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.850
Amber Romero: Welcome. Some animosity toward each other.

521
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.070
Amber Romero: So that history. It's

522
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.560
Amber Romero: Understandable.

523
00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:17.730
Right.

524
00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:25.740
Amber Romero: We don't want to don't want to deal with it and he he wants.

525
00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.140
Amber Romero: He wants to let it out your stuff. But as we get over it off, it's just whatever, but I don't hear

526
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:35.940
You know, so

527
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:41.340
Amber Romero: This is really good, you know,

528
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.820
Amber Romero: It's hard to deal with things like that. Yeah.

529
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:55.830
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, so he kind of wants to rehash everything and talk it out and you're feeling like you're just not in a place where that's helpful.

530
00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.230
Amber Romero: To me, I'll just do it alone.

531
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:04.260
Amber Romero: But it just so happens that it's the past like yesterday.

532
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.420
You know,

533
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.130
LIsa Anderson: Yeah.

534
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:19.830
LIsa Anderson: I'm trying to address it in the sense of like making apologies like for that that fight that he kind of

535
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:22.950
LIsa Anderson: Picked while you guys were on the phone with your daughter.

536
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:30.930
Amber Romero: Things like Natalie photos leaders like to bring it up and then

537
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.910
Amber Romero: I officiated and then he attrition and

538
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.720
Amber Romero: Then also alien also really you

539
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:45.540
Amber Romero: Know we can work on communication, but

540
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:49.110
Amber Romero: You know,

541
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.970
Amber Romero: I think we need to work more on comprehension.

542
00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.190
Amber Romero: Communication.

543
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.440
Amber Romero: Communicating you know understand

544
00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:09.630
LIsa Anderson: Right, so he's just not you're feeling like he's not understanding where you're coming from, or

545
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.500
Amber Romero: Yeah. And then He probably thinks the same way you know I

546
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:20.490
Amber Romero: Mean it's not like I don't understand. It's like, I get it, but I can't do anything what it is you're going to do.

547
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.930
LIsa Anderson: Right.

548
00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.040
So,

549
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:25.770
So I know

550
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:27.270
You guys are

551
00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.710
LIsa Anderson: Chatting on the phone here and there, but not a whole lot of

552
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:33.900
Amber Romero: Contact. Yeah, just

553
00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:44.100
Amber Romero: Like my girls have been there with him this week. And so, like when we call each other.

554
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.490
Amber Romero: For a minute or two with us all.

555
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.100
LIsa Anderson: Right.

556
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:04.080
LIsa Anderson: Talk to the kids and yeah that's that's good that they know that you know you're you're calling for that.

557
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:21.510
LIsa Anderson: I didn't want to ask you, Amber for our appointment for next week. Would you be able to PM instead of 1pm

558
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:27.240
Amber Romero: Um, I mean I guess I could if I had to, but

559
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.690
Amber Romero: We really read regularly doing this for me is

560
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:40.200
Amber Romero: It's kind of like a root cause earlier was freaking out because I thought it was a 12

561
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.450
Amber Romero: But it was at one and

562
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.100
Amber Romero: You know cuz I have it written down for 1230 and

563
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.170
Amber Romero: I don't know. So it's

564
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:55.320
LIsa Anderson: No problem. Okay. No problem. No, no problem at all. I just thought I would ask, but

565
00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:01.260
LIsa Anderson: No, I, I think that if if we can kind of give you as much of like consistency as you can.

566
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:13.620
LIsa Anderson: You know, like you said you're taking your medication at about the same, same time every day. So if this is good to give you that consistency, then no problem yet. I know it does take a little while to check in.

567
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:30.960
LIsa Anderson: You know, prior to the appointment time so um okay alright so we're going to be coming up into may already. Um, so next Thursday will be May seven, so we'll just stick with that one o'clock time

568
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:32.550
LIsa Anderson: Okay.

569
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.140
LIsa Anderson: Okay. Alright, sounds good. Amber. Well, I'm gonna

570
00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:44.250
LIsa Anderson: Follow up on on these items which are for all women, um, how did you get my email.

571
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.870
Amber Romero: I

572
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:52.770
Amber Romero: Saw it but like every day okay like open it or anything. Um,

573
00:52:53.370 --> 00:53:00.060
LIsa Anderson: No worries. Um, yeah. That way, I just, I just had kind of wanted to check in with you midweek to see how things are going. So

574
00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:00.780
You can definitely

575
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:07.890
LIsa Anderson: You have my email address now. So if you, you know, did have a question or something that came up during the week.

576
00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:14.190
LIsa Anderson: You know you can reach me on that email. So I kind of wanted to send you that, too. So that way you have my email address.

577
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.740
Amber Romero: Okay. Yeah, I saw that

578
00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:21.600
LIsa Anderson: Okay. All right. Well, sounds good. Everyone I will see you next week.

579
00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:23.670
Amber Romero: Already sounds good. Okay.

580
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.110
LIsa Anderson: You to take care

581
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.640
Amber Romero: We took away.

582
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:39.750
LIsa Anderson: That was Mr. Romero, we did not have

583
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:53.310
LIsa Anderson: Video today. So I'm going to go ahead and pull up her chart, real quick because I had wanted to kind of review with her just some of our treatment plans and some of our

584
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.420
LIsa Anderson: treatment goals but today's session.

585
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.980
LIsa Anderson: Was a little more challenging.

586
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:11.820
LIsa Anderson: I've felt the past couple sessions amber haven't been as as engaged.

587
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:15.870
LIsa Anderson: And today, she she seemed

588
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:23.160
LIsa Anderson: A little bit less engaged, you know, just kind of not being on on the video.

589
00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:32.850
LIsa Anderson: But, you know, today we did really focus on sleep, sleep hygiene, the impact of substance use.

590
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:39.540
LIsa Anderson: You know, also I think I really identifying how she continues to

591
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:43.680
LIsa Anderson: use drugs to mask or negative emotions.

592
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:52.560
LIsa Anderson: You know, really inviting her to look at those healthy coping skills, but at times. She's really not forthcoming with

593
00:54:53.820 --> 00:55:00.960
LIsa Anderson: Her thoughts with her feelings. She has a hard time really identifying any specific thoughts or feelings that we could kind of start to

594
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:14.520
LIsa Anderson: Use the cognitive behavioral framework to identify those thoughts and feelings and so that's been a little bit of a challenge. And at this point, and really trying to build a rapport with her.

595
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.060
LIsa Anderson: Really trying to just kind of build that

596
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:26.070
LIsa Anderson: That that therapeutic alliance, so that we can move forward with some of her treatment goals.

597
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:33.960
LIsa Anderson: You know, so really looking at the severe opioid use disorder as as her primary diagnosis as her primary

598
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.860
LIsa Anderson: You know, primary problem, you know, today we talked a lot about sleep hygiene.

599
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.690
LIsa Anderson: And and sleep disturbance in relation to opioid use

600
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:50.010
LIsa Anderson: And, you know, just talk really a lot of education.

601
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.140

602
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:58.800
LIsa Anderson: About how opioid use impacts, her, her sleep and her overall functioning.

603
00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:18.840
LIsa Anderson: She's still kind of struggling. I think around the personal relapse prevention plan. We're still sort of looking at at those. I think definitely relationship triggers. I think her relationship with Daniel and her children's father. I think could definitely be a relationship trigger

604
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:25.590
LIsa Anderson: You know she did identify talking with her dad who lives in California as being a supportive

605
00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:32.970
LIsa Anderson: Person as far as listing any negative beliefs, you know, any negative thought triggers.

606
00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.940
LIsa Anderson: We're still not not quite there. I think a relationship trigger would be Daniel

607
00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:43.980
LIsa Anderson: environmental triggers seems to be boredom.

608
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.410
LIsa Anderson: And then negative

609
00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:58.980
LIsa Anderson: You know, negative beliefs is I think where she's any sort of negative emotion missing her kids or or any negative emotions, anger, fear.

610
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:05.160
LIsa Anderson: She's sort of fusing wants to use substances to mask those

611
00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:09.870
LIsa Anderson: She's had a hard time identifying any healthy

612
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.040
LIsa Anderson: Support Systems, but we will continue to

613
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:30.990
LIsa Anderson: Identify a relapse prevention plan. We're going to continue to explore social support systems. And I think definitely kind of strengthening the treatment team alliance really increasing that therapeutic alliance.

614
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:39.540
LIsa Anderson: To kind of work towards her long term goals of abstinence from all substances participating in a recovery program.

615
00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:46.710

616
00:57:47.850 --> 00:58:00.930
LIsa Anderson: We reviewed contact information for bright heart health, we reviewed prescription protocol as far as length of time and she will be using different pharmacy that's maybe closer to her home.

617
00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:07.860

618
00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:18.270
LIsa Anderson: May 7 at 1pm mountain time. And that was another strength. I think that one of the few things that she did identify

619
00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:28.650
LIsa Anderson: That she felt like she's able to take her medication at the same time every day and that she sort of have this appointment as her set

620
00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:45.150
