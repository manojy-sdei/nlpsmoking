00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.820
tracy jackson: That sort of make you you

16
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:38.700
iPhone: Oh gosh, a couple of things. Probably my family, my first off my family, my son, we lost my dad, two years ago. So that was that makes you appreciate your family, all the much more

17
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:50.670
iPhone: Yeah. And what else my law degree I guess kind of makes me a little bit of who I am and what I've done to my background so family is, you know, at school, and education. I think

18
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.560
tracy jackson: All right and and what would you say are your greatest strength.

19
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.890
iPhone: My greatest perseverance.

20
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.720
iPhone: Getting up every time you're knocked to the ground, over and over again.

21
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.620
iPhone: Yeah, play tenacity. Little bit.

22
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.830
iPhone: As the. Those are few

23
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:21.690
tracy jackson: All right. And before we get going. I just wouldn't curious as to what you hope to get out of this out of this interaction today. What do you want to make sure that we talked about.

24
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.970
iPhone: I want to make sure that, um, I guess I have a different experience that I've had with some other doctors and

25
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.720
iPhone: I just want to kind of be in like a judgment free zone where I can be very honest and like just say it like it is. Because I think that's the best way it's going to help me and

26
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.370
iPhone: As a result, helped my family and, you know, so I would look to be getting out of this, you know, will we take the next step forward in the best path to kind of help.

27
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.520
tracy jackson: Them.

28
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:57.330
iPhone: Get to where I need to go and just kind of going from there. I'm not, you know, I don't have too many expectations, just because the brand new system to me doing it this way. But that would be one of them.

29
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.370
tracy jackson: And when you mentioned get where you want to get where you're wanting to get. Tell me about that.

30
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.030
iPhone: Um, where I'd like to be is completely off of everything.

31
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.170
iPhone: That's that's important to me that it's been a long time and

32
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.000
iPhone: I've tried to do it on my own. So many times and I haven't been able to, and I don't know if I'm just a worse when it comes to pain or

33
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:35.130
iPhone: do certain things. But it's important to me that I do get off safely off of everything down the road. So I can move forward with my life. And, you know, not have this being the controlling dominant feature that seems to, you know, kind of control everything so

34
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:47.970
tracy jackson: So the pain is what's driving the use for the opioids and the having to the need for the few words and the withdrawal. If you don't have them is really limiting your ability to live the way that you want to live.

35
00:03:48.570 --> 00:04:00.030
iPhone: Yes, and I think, you know, I mean it took me a while to figure it out. But I don't think that they oh boy isn't necessarily helping with the pain. I think they're just masking it. The pain is going to be there, either way.

36
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:17.490
iPhone: So I don't know. Good. They're really done. But yeah, I just the other people I've met with other doctors. I've talked to, they all said, Oh, no, we won't do Suboxone. No, no, no. You can go cold turkey or you can wean down and I'm thinking in my head like I've done that so many times.

37
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:32.610
iPhone: Tried that so many times. And it's not working. It just hasn't worked for me. I've done it. I've done it all. It's just nothing has worked so it's time for a new solution to put myself kind of first and just make sure it you know

38
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.400
iPhone: It's the right next step, I guess.

39
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.680
tracy jackson: And what do you believe are all the components that are contributing to your pain.

40
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.530
iPhone: Um, I think, Well, I think the stress from the pain itself and just the stigma around it and

41
00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:06.180
iPhone: I feel like you get, you know, and which is funny because I used to be a criminal defense attorney, so right. A lot of my clients were addicts and, you know, and there's a stigma around people who take drugs and I feel that stigma.

42
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.580
iPhone: And I don't like it at all. It doesn't feel like who I am.

43
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:23.850
iPhone: There's a lot of different things of stress from being in pain from not being able to go out and necessarily do what I want to do when I want to do it, but I don't think the pain is necessarily the biggest problem I think it's the

44
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:34.140
iPhone: It's the opiates themselves and not being able to control the usage of them and the stoppage of them, and then I feel like they just wore my whole life basically

45
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:44.610
tracy jackson: To me, so there's a lot, I guess, when was the last time.

46
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.080
tracy jackson: You remember having

47
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.840
iPhone: Never having pain anywhere.

48
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.300
iPhone: Oh, gosh. Probably college

49
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:05.130
iPhone: Yeah I it was shortly after college. I had a couple injuries and then those kind of lead up and then, you know, in between there was nothing, and then

50
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.770
iPhone: Law School, and thereafter. It was always something always something was going on.

51
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.520
Okay.

52
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.050
tracy jackson: And to during this time when you were

53
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.560
tracy jackson: A kid, for instance, like in middle school or high school did you ever

54
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.800
tracy jackson: Because of headaches or belly affiliate

55
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:23.520
iPhone: Or no

56
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.230
tracy jackson: Yes, or any of that. So this was all

57
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.810
tracy jackson: cruising along and the

58
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.040
tracy jackson: Couple of injuries.

59
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.530
tracy jackson: And yeah, and were you were you given opioids right from the start with those injuries and

60
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.800
tracy jackson: Yeah.

61
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:43.410
iPhone: I mean, immediately, and I and I was back then. It wasn't even a thing. This is back in the you know college, I was in the early 2000s.

62
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:52.440
iPhone: I don't think it was even a, like a known issue with it back then they just kind of wrote your prescription for them and nobody ever told I never knew anything

63
00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:03.270
iPhone: You know, and shame on me for not doing my research before the internet live, um, you know, I didn't know. I didn't I, if I would have known then what I know now kind of a thing, you know.

64
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:12.540
iPhone: But I did. I had some surgeries on my shoulders rotator cuffs advice. It was just kind of slowly along the way that it built up

65
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.950
tracy jackson: Okay, and what is have you been on a few words continuously since since you were in college.

66
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:31.590
iPhone: No, not continuously. I would say continuously over the last five, most of the last five years continuously but off and on, since college, not, not all the way through.

67
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:33.600
iPhone: Yeah.

68
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.600
tracy jackson: And what's your current use like what, what exactly you're using what doses, all that kind of stuff.

69
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.290
iPhone: Yeah so. Well, that's part of the problem of my tolerance has gotten

70
00:07:44.820 --> 00:08:00.450
iPhone: I don't know if it's my tolerance or I don't know what it is exactly, but where I used to be able to take one. You know, one, three times a day. Now I can take six at a time. You know, every day, you know, it's changed completely. So I can take six

71
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.130
iPhone: Six tablets of the 10 milligram like Norco

72
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.090
tracy jackson: Mm hmm.

73
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.400
iPhone: And that will barely take the edge off.

74
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:09.990
tracy jackson: So,

75
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.060
iPhone: I don't think it's oh sorry, go ahead.

76
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.190
tracy jackson: And is that your is that the drug of choice right now as hydrocodone yeah

77
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.390
iPhone: That's what I take, yeah.

78
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.630
tracy jackson: And what is the maximum amount that you take in a day.

79
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.890
iPhone: And how many pills total a day. You mean yeah

80
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.150
tracy jackson: Or milligrams, if they're

81
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.900
iPhone: Um, I'd say between 10 and 20 pills a day.

82
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.780
tracy jackson: So up to the end of the 10 milligrams

83
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.620
Yes.

84
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.570
tracy jackson: Is that as high as you've ever gone or have you tolerated more in the past.

85
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.060
iPhone: I think that's the highest they've ever gone. I don't, I don't think I've ever tried to do more than that.

86
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.940
tracy jackson: Okay, and to 10 or 20 pills in a day for about how long has that been your daily regimen.

87
00:08:52.020 --> 00:09:00.840
iPhone: Um, that that excessive not not that long. Um, maybe about the last two, three months. Okay.

88
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.640
tracy jackson: And are you getting that from

89
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.260
tracy jackson: Like pharmacies or from the street or a combination

90
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.010
Oh,

91
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.230
iPhone: From my

92
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.080
iPhone: From my doctor there the prescribed was I just don't take it one pill three times a day, I'll take

93
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:26.370
iPhone: Much, much more when I need to. And I try and go off of them and say, Okay, that's it. I'm done. I'm not taking any more of these, you know, and then

94
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:41.760
iPhone: 24 hours later, you know, and I'm sweating and, you know, ready to throw up and I'm like, Okay, I can't do it anymore, you know, have to take a few more so than it's just kind of a maintenance. So it's not like every day. It's 10 or 20 it's just in bunches of that makes sense.

95
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.610
tracy jackson: I think you're

96
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.290
tracy jackson: Kind of bingeing a little bit and then withdrawing and then

97
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:58.620
iPhone: And then kind of slowly crawling back up and then and then it'll be a binge and and then I never actually never really thought it is finished. But yeah, I guess kind of a binge to

98
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:04.260
iPhone: Then just say, Screw it. You know, I've got to take care of this right now and then take a lot of them.

99
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.950
iPhone: And then I'm not gonna do this anymore. And then back down it goes and then it closed back up and then it's a big amount again so

100
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:21.270

tracy jackson: still able to work for the most part.

141
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.230
iPhone: Yes. Yeah, I still work.

142
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:24.480
tracy jackson: Yeah, and then how about other substance other substances and this is like

143
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.790
tracy jackson: Throughout your nicotine.

144
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.470
iPhone: Okay, yeah. So I spoke. Yeah.

145
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.870
tracy jackson: And how much do you smoke and for how long.

146
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:45.330
iPhone: Um, it depends on which I smoke like between 10 and 20 a day, just depending on the for me. It's based on I base it on my anxiety level. You know how stressed, I am about whatever's going on that's kind of how much I smoke.

147
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:51.000
iPhone: The higher the stress more I'm smoking that's been going on since I was about age 25

148
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:52.350
iPhone: Okay.

149
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.180
tracy jackson: And any marijuana

150
00:13:55.530 --> 00:14:06.090
iPhone: I tried it once and it wasn't really my thing. So I have tried the CBD oil on my back, you know, just to when it's flaring up to kind of see if that helps. But other than that, no. Okay.

151
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.910
tracy jackson: Um, any uppers Meth, Cocaine any Adderall.

152
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.470
tracy jackson: Any, any other substances of

153
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.360
tracy jackson: Alcohol.

154
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.060
iPhone: I'm not a drink. Now, I'm not a drinker, either. No.

155
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:27.900
tracy jackson: Okay. All right. And then in terms of your attempt, she mentioned that you've you've stopped cold turkey multiple times on your

156
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.250
tracy jackson: And any outpatient attempts at detox or inpatient

157
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.480
iPhone: And outpatient inpatient about it for years ago.

158
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.700
tracy jackson: And what happened there.

159
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:46.050
iPhone: And that was when well that kind of got sidelined. My, my husband and I ended up getting a divorce.

160
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:56.340
iPhone: And he was trying to get custody and so yeah so anyway I went through a 30 day you know residential program and

161
00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:05.820
iPhone: They kind of did the cold turkey method, a little bit more there and a lot of field group therapy and everything. I really liked the therapy part but the cold turkey part was a

162
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.190
iPhone: It was difficult. So

163
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:18.840
tracy jackson: And then, what, what were the, what was the situation, how I guess how long were you clean and then what was the situation that led to the relapse, how long, how much later.

164
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:25.710
iPhone: Um, I think it was probably, probably six or eight months. That was totally didn't take anything after that and then

165
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.910
iPhone: Then that's when our divorce. Actually, he actually filed papers and

166
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:43.260
iPhone: Then the stress and you know i i had the baby. The full time, then you know I was kind of single mom at that point and full time with the baby and I was just not able to balance it all. And so I was emotionally in a lot of pain and physically

167
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:57.060
iPhone: And a lot of pain. Same with the same back injury, but then having to lift a baby all by yourself 24 seven. It made it a lot worse. So it's kind of a combination, but I know I'm pretty sure at that point even there's some emotional, you know,

168
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:04.620
iPhone: Pain going on that I was probably using to cover up with the with the pills. Yeah, I mean,

169
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.260
tracy jackson: I guess I never told you anything about myself. I'm sorry.

170
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:24.630
tracy jackson: I'm actually an anesthesiologist trained was an interventional pain physician trained at Stanford back in around the time that you were starting to take pills, where we thought you could give 800 milligrams of oxycodone to everybody, you know, all that kind of thing.

171
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:40.470
tracy jackson: And then I was at Vanderbilt for 12 years running their pain program there and I gradually started to realize that our system really hurts people particularly pain and stigmatizes very traumatizing doesn't make any sense. So I became a yoga instructor and acupuncture is to help

172
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.010
iPhone: Oh,

173
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.970
tracy jackson: I've done retreats to get people off paying became an addiction knowledge just

174
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.100
tracy jackson: So I can help with this. And so my role at bright heart really is.

175
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.100
tracy jackson: And to your point earlier is not to stigmatize. This is just harm reduction, you're trying to get better.

176
00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.560
tracy jackson: Yeah, we're not trying to kick you out of the

177
00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.280
tracy jackson: Pain Clinic.

178
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.570
tracy jackson: If you have an abnormal drug test we're trying to just see you more frequently.

179
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:19.560
tracy jackson: Closer not kick you out, you know, that kind of thing. We recognize that when people have been receiving opioids externally for a long time, your body quits making the natural endorphins and it takes a while for them to rebuild again.

180
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:27.240
tracy jackson: And also you know when when we separate physical and emotional pain in Western medicine.

181
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.200
iPhone: Yeah, the

182
00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:36.840
tracy jackson: reasons for that. I mean, it's understandable why we do that, particularly as a woman because you get told you know that it's it's hysterical woman disease. It's all in your head, you know,

183
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.140
Right.

184
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.550
iPhone: Oh, yeah.

185
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:48.390
tracy jackson: In reality, I describe this with pain. It's like you're going camping with, you know, with your friends and you're in two separate tense.

186
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:57.630
tracy jackson: And a bear comes in and bites off your left foot and bites off your friends left foot. So you both have amputations, but the bear is only in one of the tense.

187
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:14.760
tracy jackson: So the pain response is very different, even in with very real physical injury or, or, you know, nerve pain or whatever you have genetically from trauma from injuries from accidents, the bear in the room will affect

188
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.990
iPhone: You know, yes.

189
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.360
tracy jackson: The threat level and the amount of

190
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:30.420
tracy jackson: A reaction that your body will mount and so it's all kind of together. So everything at bright heart I do do intakes like this, particularly on patients who have primary pain driven

191
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:39.630
tracy jackson: And substance use and have been sort of screwed by the system, so to speak, you know, it's like trying to figure out their hundred ways to cook rice, you know, but

192
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:47.610
tracy jackson: Everything's taken from our environment. What we see what we put in our bodies to eat what we hear how we move, how we communicate

193
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:59.850
tracy jackson: How our body deals with the pain signal that's kind of constituency coming in all that matters. And there's no, like, quick magic fix because, you know, right, it works, you would have found it by now.

194
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.270
iPhone: Yeah.

195
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:09.450
tracy jackson: But the issue is that over time. There is a lot of Neuro plasticity and everything we do to create a sense of safety, you know, the bear to get out of the tent.

196
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:22.230
tracy jackson: Right everything new not sticking our head in the sand not denying it. But figuring out all that wow what all those components may be specifically for you moving towards the things that bring you joy.

197
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:27.450
tracy jackson: Like your values, your strengths and a from things that shame me, you know, right.

198
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:38.190
tracy jackson: Right words. Good thing and providing a little Suboxone to keep that cyclical craving while your body is making remaking some endorphins.

199
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:43.470
tracy jackson: You know that, you know, to keep you just without craving.

200
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.850
buprenorphine.

201
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:51.150
tracy jackson: Has a little bit of an anti depressant effect as well and but it's

202
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:56.880
tracy jackson: Certainly it's certainly safe, like it's really, really hard to overdose on buprenorphine.

203
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:05.970
tracy jackson: As always when you mix, mix Suboxone or buprenorphine is the name of the drug with something like Xanax, it's still much more risky. So

204
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.930
A lot of times

205
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:14.460
tracy jackson: We try, you know, we'll try to get you in the program. I can start the medication.

206
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:21.600
tracy jackson: Will go through. I'll explain this to you at the end. I'd still want to get a little better but just so you kind of know what to expect the ideas we give

207
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:30.030
tracy jackson: The lowest dose of the Suboxone that you need to get you out of withdrawal and allow you to go to work and parent and do the things you need to do.

208
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:30.780
iPhone: Okay.

209
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:41.820
tracy jackson: We'll see you frequently. So you'll see me probably with me. What we'll do is you'll see me twice in a group that's about prescriptions. How you doing with your medicines have any side effects bubble, blah.

210
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:42.630
tracy jackson: And then the

211
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:51.630
tracy jackson: Month. So I'm the alternating weeks twice a month we did paying groups and in those I get the science behind different things that might work.

212
00:20:52.290 --> 00:21:04.140
tracy jackson: We do often a little diabetic not didactic, but a little experiential thing. So for talking about yoga will do some chair yoga for talking about that. It's Jim will do some meditation. If we talk about, then we'll

213
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:11.400
tracy jackson: Give ideas. But all this, the idea is it's free and it's accessible from right where you are so

214
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:12.510
iPhone: Yeah.

215
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:19.440
tracy jackson: The answer questions about acupuncture and things like that. But that's not accessible or affordable to a lot of people. So if we talk about that we

216
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.360
tracy jackson: Do you know that kind of

217
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:30.780
tracy jackson: So, so it's kind of like will see you every week starting just early upfront every week, but it will always be like this telemedicine.

218
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.460
tracy jackson: And then after that.

219
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:38.250
tracy jackson: In the next week we'll also get you set up to see one of our counselors or therapist and they'll just do what we call a

220
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:55.980
tracy jackson: Bio psychosocial assessment. So just kind of talking to you about what your needs. Maybe what you'd like. And some people. That's it. And some people, they say, well, maybe, you know, seeing me once a month, and we're kind of helpful, but that's kind of the team approach that we take and

221
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.640
tracy jackson: We need thing. It's never meant to be punitive honesty is never punished up right heart. Okay.

222
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.030
iPhone: Oh, that's

223
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.100
tracy jackson: The thing that we do is

224
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:13.740
tracy jackson: If it seems like you're struggling skipping meetings, not having drug tests we just sort of shorten the duration of your prescriptions.

225
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.580
tracy jackson: Said it should

226
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.020
tracy jackson: Be closer because, clearly there's something we're not doing well.

227
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.570
iPhone: A nice. Okay, no, that makes

228
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.030
iPhone: And it just just sorry. Quick question up front.

229
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.070
iPhone: First of all, do you mind if I smoke over on the phone.

230
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.240
iPhone: And second of all,

231
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:37.200
iPhone: My more important question is I'm always trying to balance out financially taking care of my son and taking care of myself and usually comes before me.

232
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:49.200
iPhone: Every single time for some of these meetings, I know you said, I know that this isn't about my insurance deductible. But isn't on a sliding scale or monthly meeting or is our weekly meeting or is it just how

233
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.550
tracy jackson: Normally the weekly meetings are covered. Do you have Medicare. Do you have

234
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.410
tracy jackson: commercial insurance of some sort.

235
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:55.830
iPhone: I do

236
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.880
iPhone: Yeah, I do.

237
00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:12.630
tracy jackson: Normally the meetings are covered after this meeting. I'm going to transfer you back to the virtual clinic, which is the 408 number or you'll call them back. They'll make sure that they go over all the information with you the surveys and things. We need you to fill out. Did I just freeze.

238
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:15.180
tracy jackson: Okay.

239
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.680
tracy jackson: Yeah, the surveys and things

240
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.120
tracy jackson: And they'll go over all the finances and stuff with you because we

241
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.600
tracy jackson: Understand, everybody has issues. It's normally

242
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.400
tracy jackson: Up front but if you're able to, you know, you obviously have a lot of good

243
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.280
tracy jackson: prognostic indicators for success. You've got a stable job you've got, you know, a home you have

244
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.110
tracy jackson: You know you have a lot of stability and

245
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:49.590
tracy jackson: We're in your life and and oftentimes in that scenario we can end up you know if you're showing up for all the meetings and you're doing really well and you're feeling safe, then we see you once a month, something like

246
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:50.790
iPhone: You know,

247
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:55.410
tracy jackson: It can, it can extend out over time.

248
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.010
iPhone: It just

249
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.650
tracy jackson: A little bit more intense up front so

250
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.150
iPhone: No. That makes perfect sense.

251
00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:09.150
iPhone: Yeah, no. That makes total sense. And how long does one usually on. I'm sorry. And it was it Suboxone or sub you Tex is there.

252
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.220
tracy jackson: Is there different Suboxone so

253
00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.080
tracy jackson: The one they use

254
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.710
tracy jackson: Intra Muscular early in the inpatient do

255
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.800
tracy jackson: But it's all buprenorphine that

256
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.450
tracy jackson: Yeah, so it will be a will be a film.

257
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.560
tracy jackson: That you'll

258
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:34.650
tracy jackson: Between your cheek and your tea and dissolve. So you can if you just do it up and swallowed it doesn't work. So you just kind of had to have to let it dissolve it does not taste great.

259
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:36.780
iPhone: Okay.

260
00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:40.140
tracy jackson: But there will be a protocol that they'll go through in the virtual

261
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.340
tracy jackson: clinic where people will start on the lowest dose you'll wait an hour and all that.

262
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.470
tracy jackson: kicker with

263
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.050
tracy jackson: Some things me

264
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.210
tracy jackson: It's some

265
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.430
tracy jackson: Okay. Oh.

266
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:00.870
iPhone: And kind of hear you.

267
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.710
iPhone: I can see you.

268
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.600
iPhone: There we go. Okay.

269
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.930
iPhone: Oh, you're cutting in and out again, sorry.

270
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:20.730
iPhone: I'm wait

271
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.220
tracy jackson: So with this Suboxone

272
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:29.940
Okay.

273
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.980
tracy jackson: Can you hear me. Yep.

274
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.700
tracy jackson: Yeah, I just

275
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:52.470
tracy jackson: With this Suboxone it's the most powerful opioid out there are full than heroin fentanyl all these medicines. Okay, so when you take Suboxone okay it will bump everything in your system off of the receptor.

276
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.880
iPhone: Okay, okay.

277
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:54.960
tracy jackson: If you

278
00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.210
tracy jackson: Were you were taking it's a waste of your money.

279
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:02.040
If you fail.

280
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.140
iPhone: It. I missed that last bit.

281
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.640
tracy jackson: If you take hydrocodone while you're on Suboxone yeah

282
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:09.360
iPhone: It would kick it off.

283
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.190
tracy jackson: That's nothing will have

284
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:18.060
tracy jackson: Rich sitting there on the receptor. So if you do feel something, it's plus eat.

285
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.600
tracy jackson: When you're hungry and you're you eat. Yeah.

286
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:28.500
tracy jackson: You feel

287
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.890
tracy jackson: So much better even before the food goes through your system.

288
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:32.940
iPhone: Right placebo.

289
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:41.070
tracy jackson: Same thing. So the Suboxone keeps you from feeling the effects of the hydrocodone

290
00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:41.880
Okay.

291
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.280
tracy jackson: And if you are not in complete withdrawal.

292
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.830
tracy jackson: About significant miserable goose.

293
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.930
tracy jackson: Area.

294
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:12.210
tracy jackson: will precipitate draw you ever had. There's no way to get out of it. So the key with the first dose of Suboxone

295
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.530
tracy jackson: Yeah, that you have to

296
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.240
tracy jackson: Play until you are

297
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.150
iPhone: Miserable. Yeah.

298
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.310
iPhone: I think you froze up a little bit.

299
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.310
iPhone: Oh, darn it, we have the worst.

300
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.100
iPhone: I'm so sorry. We keep losing each other.

301
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.450
iPhone: So it will throw you into immediate withdrawals.

302
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.850
tracy jackson: Yeah, but if you're already in with

303
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.640
tracy jackson: The first. Oh, you take out of withdrawal, but that's

304
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.650
tracy jackson: Okay thing and they'll go over this and

305
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.550
tracy jackson: They'll go

306
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:59.490
tracy jackson: They'll give you for how you roll.

307
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.030
iPhone: Oh, sorry. They

308
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.220
tracy jackson: Will they will watch you know

309
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.080
iPhone: Oh darn okay see you moving. Now that's a good sign.

310
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.410
iPhone: Do. Is there a way you want to do, we call on the phone to hear each other or is it

311
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:28.020
tracy jackson: Why don't we, why don't you see your video and see if that helps stop the video so hit the screen.

312
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:28.770
Okay.

313
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:30.510
iPhone: If your

314
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.680
tracy jackson: Video screen and

315
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.030
iPhone: Hit the yeah so

316
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.370
tracy jackson: Can you hear me better now.

317
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.240
iPhone: I can't. Yeah, I still cutting in and out a little bit, but I can hear you. Okay, let's try that.

318
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:52.320
tracy jackson: Okay, so once again with the Suboxone if you it's the most powerful opioid out there, it binds to the receptor stronger than anything else. Okay.

319
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:58.080
tracy jackson: Okay, if you have hydrocodone still on your receptors.

320
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:07.590
tracy jackson: And you take Suboxone it will pitch you into significant withdrawal that will be possible for you to get out of

321
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:15.480
tracy jackson: First does. You have to wait until you are in the worst withdrawal that you can stand and

322
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.730
tracy jackson: Then you will take the first Suboxone pill and then it will take you out of the withdrawal immediately.

323
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.020
tracy jackson: Okay, so

324
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:41.100
tracy jackson: All of this will be described to you in detail in the virtual clinic, but I say this, just to describe that the way Suboxone works is it works slightly differently works more on the spinal cord pain receptors and then the brain one, so it's less likely for you to overdose, which is safe.

325
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.830
tracy jackson: It's very long acting

326
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.570
tracy jackson: So typically you only have to take it once a day, although some people do take it twice a day.

327
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:49.920
tracy jackson: Okay, like

328
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:51.810
iPhone: What no morning was at night.

329
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.580
iPhone: Or just it just depends on when you first.

330
00:29:54.090 --> 00:30:06.480
tracy jackson: First, yeah. Yeah, it kind of just depends. Most people do like a 12 hours and eight in the morning eight at night or they'll just take one does in the morning and it will depend on what your responses.

331
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.460
tracy jackson: So there's a little bit flexibility that the virtual clinic will go through and how you

332
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:19.920
tracy jackson: Dose this first week to get to the dose that's right for you. The virtual clinic is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

333
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:28.530
tracy jackson: So okay questions you have, you can call them and somebody will be able to help you. So that's just a sort of nuts and bolts about that.

334
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:37.680
tracy jackson: Okay, great. If you're not taking any benzodiazepines. I saw you maybe have one prescription for Xanax earlier in March. Is that right, yes.

335
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:46.560
iPhone: That's what I was they had originally scheduled me to have my back down. When I was saying, the only prescribed for my back injections. Yeah, because I get to 24 and because they weren't working

336
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.520
iPhone: Okay.

337
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.900
iPhone: All right, yeah.

338
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.620
tracy jackson: But

339
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.490
iPhone: They've done like two pills at a time for when I need you know the

340
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.020
iPhone: Any kind of injections.

341
00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:01.950
tracy jackson: Alright, so we don't need to. So there is a reversal agent called narc, can you may have heard about Narcan what

342
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.490
iPhone: I have

343
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:13.740
tracy jackson: But, you know, normally in some states. I don't think California does been some sites they require you to write a prescription for Narcan at the same time as you write Suboxone and just in case to have around.

344
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:22.740
tracy jackson: Open if you and if you feel comfortable that you're never had an overdose. In the past, you're not going to take benzodiazepines or drink on top of it, then

345
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:34.680
tracy jackson: It's probably fine. Not to have it. Of course there in all the ambulances and all that kind of things, but it's just one of those things. We always say is an extra added safety measure that the location.

346
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.610
tracy jackson: Is is very safe. The biggest side effects are just like all opioids, they may make you a little dizzy.

347
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:52.470
tracy jackson: They may give you a little energy actually at first. So some people report that their sleep isn't as great. To start, but that's kind of that activating anti depressant effect to the buprenorphine a little bit

348
00:31:54.210 --> 00:32:02.280
tracy jackson: But the G. It doesn't tend to be is nausea, nausea, vomiting and constipation is other opioid so it's generally pretty well tolerated.

349
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:13.620
tracy jackson: And okay, great. The other thing is if you ever need surgery elective surgery, you have to make sure that you tell your doctors ahead of time.

350
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:24.120
tracy jackson: And tell us ahead of time so that we can figure out what to do with the Suboxone because let's say you need surgery and then they want to give you additional pain medicine after the surgery.

351
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.260
tracy jackson: It won't work.

352
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:36.150
tracy jackson: It doesn't work while you're on the Suboxone so depending you either will increase the Suboxone after the surgery for pain relief because it isn't a few we type medication, just as just a different one.

353
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:50.850
tracy jackson: But, or they if it's a big surgery they might want you to come off the Suboxone for a period of time, then take whatever they want to give you for paying control and then go back on this box on afterwards. So it's just always like to let people know about that they can

354
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.380
iPhone: Listen. Oh, yeah.

355
00:32:52.710 --> 00:33:06.180
tracy jackson: If you're in a car accident, whatever they can handle it. They will figure it out. Right. But it's much smoother, if you know you're having elective surgery to work around it. And those are really the biggest issues with Suboxone that are different from other other IV fluids.

356
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:11.220
iPhone: And how long are people normally on the origin, which is very person to person.

357
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:17.370
tracy jackson: It's very person to person Suboxone it's been around quite a while. So we do know that it's safe in terms of like

358
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:29.430
tracy jackson: You know, we don't see liver, heart, lung kidney toxicity from long term Suboxone use. And in fact, for people who are really, really struggling with addiction and heroin for many, many years. A lot of them.

359
00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.470
iPhone: On Suboxone forever, right.

360
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:45.420
tracy jackson: I mean, they're just on Suboxone for the foreseeable future, in my experience with people like you who have who have pain and have been on short acting opioids and you're actually on a relatively mild to moderate dose, I would say.

361
00:33:45.990 --> 00:34:02.520
tracy jackson: Right, that many times it's just a matter of getting you stabilized out you know for let's say six months a year during that time you're continuing to see us in the pain group work on other way to manage your pain. A lot of times the

362
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.520
tracy jackson: Procedures that you will have had done in the past that maybe worked initially they start to work better.

363
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:17.520
tracy jackson: As you have a little less what we call hyper out GG hydrocodone and those medicines can actually cause you to be able to feel more pain right

364
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:24.420
tracy jackson: Is that gets a little you know as you come off of that the procedures may work a little better still choose to have them you're

365
00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:40.170
tracy jackson: Certainly, Your coping skills and the different tools in your toolbox should improve your neuroplasticity will change. And so after that time, we can just start I say if you're really motivated. We can try three months, but

366
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.640
tracy jackson: You want to try a little longer, we certainly can start type trading down

367
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.580
iPhone: I was it

368
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:52.500
iPhone: Is it the milligrams, do the strips come in different milligrams, or is it just all one

369
00:34:52.830 --> 00:35:00.120
tracy jackson: They come in different milligrams and people will cut the strips in half and quarters and all that kind of stuff that they really need to

370
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.620
iPhone: Okay.

371
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:09.570
iPhone: Yeah. Yeah, I feel, I feel like, Oh, I just personally. Like right now I have a pretty good talent, just for how many years I've been on everything and

372
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.480
iPhone: That I can take so many at one time, but I don't know if that actually

373
00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:16.410
iPhone: Is different. When it comes to this prescription, just because I've never been on it so

374
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:30.240
tracy jackson: Yeah, I mean, we will see that is the whole purpose of the index should pray to call you know with you anyway. He started with the low dose, we allow you to almost triple that dose in the first 24 hours if you need to.

375
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.170
tracy jackson: I would just encourage you to the bottom line is quite a bit more powerful than the

376
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.820
tracy jackson: Other medicines that you've been taking so take what you need.

377
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:53.070
tracy jackson: Me. Right. Do not do not have withdraw. Okay, find that, you know, however, your symptoms are controlled in your you don't feel withdrawal, you're not having cravings. There's no need to bump up to a higher dose to try to necessarily

378
00:35:53.640 --> 00:36:04.680
tracy jackson: Control all of your pain right because you still have some downs of pain. So this about son is not meant to take your pain all the way away. I don't think that you expect that having happy.

379
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.730
iPhone: Valley downtime.

380
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:14.940
tracy jackson: But certainly Suboxone is not quite the same as, you know, you take double the hydrocodone you get double the pain relief, it doesn't really tend to work that way with Suboxone so

381
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.380
iPhone: You will experience.

382
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:26.550
tracy jackson: That you will experience pain control for sure. But the major thing is we just want to make sure we keep you out of withdrawal. And out of that feeling of just up down seesaw.

383
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:35.280
tracy jackson: seesaw agitation pains were sort of thing. So the goal is to kind of level the boat a little bit. That makes sense.

384
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:41.550
iPhone: Yeah, that's what would be so wonderful is not having that up and down, up and down, you know, that just such a miserable way to live. You know,

385
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:43.620
tracy jackson: Tell me.

386
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:58.110
tracy jackson: Tell me, Natasha, what do you do, you know, and all the years you've been managing your pain there will have been a lot of stuff that's just kind of here there what what things have been either really effective or really not effective. Don't want to try that again sort of thing.

387
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:05.430
iPhone: For me, physical therapy has been just an absolute no go. For me it just has not worked for me ever

388
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.980
iPhone: I've, I've done chiropractic I've done massage

389
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:21.180
iPhone: Really what my pain. First it was right after the birth of my son who was a heavy. I'm a diabetic. He was a heavy baby, and it's just a bad combination, but I think I have tried a lot of things. Sometimes I just ice will help

390
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.160
iPhone: Laying down some ice.

391
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:38.700
iPhone: You know, laying in a certain position will help you know standing all day or, you know, doing stuff really physical things will hurt it. So I just kind of, you know, it really depends on if I'm feeling that much pain or not that day. You know what I mean. As to what will work.

392
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:44.430
iPhone: Right, for I even bought the little biofeedback machine, you know, and slap those on there and try that, you know,

393
00:37:45.990 --> 00:38:01.740
tracy jackson: Okay. And in terms of what you do on a regular basis for sort of maintenance, whether that's movement stretching breathing prayer, meditation, talk to me about kind of what what you do to try to keep it in check.

394
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:12.810
iPhone: And I will, I will. Before this whole coven thing I would you know go walking or go to the gym, you know, do what I could do that with my with my son outside, you know, kick a soccer ball or a football around with him.

395
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:23.880
iPhone: We sit down with my partner, my boyfriend and you know we have a nice talk or, you know, we bounce ideas off of each other. And that's just, you know, kind of one of my ways of keeping things in check and

396
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.720
iPhone: You know, listening to music, you know, whatever the case may be.

397
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:35.460
tracy jackson: Okay. Um, and how, how would you describe your mood in the current moment.

398
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.100
iPhone: Maybe a little bit anxious just because I know I'm starting to feel the

399
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:43.710
iPhone: Kind of the hot and cold.

400
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:56.100
iPhone: You know a little bit anxious for that to go away because I know I have a whole work day ahead of me, but I think pretty good overall I feel really excited that I even found you guys. And so I'm really like hopeful and excited. Okay.

401
00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.180
tracy jackson: Have you ever suffered from panic to see any panic attacks or anything.

402
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:05.250
iPhone: I did when I was in law school, I would get quite a few panic attacks, but I haven't had that

403
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:13.140
iPhone: May well my dad died. But other than that, not just in general, it's usually something has happened to precipitate that

404
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.310
iPhone: Right. But, um,

405
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.210
tracy jackson: Would you have you ever been suicidal.

406
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:19.650
iPhone: No, never.

407
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:27.930
tracy jackson: Ever experienced anything and you do not have to give details, but any every experience. Same thing you would consider to be traumatic in your life.

408
00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.890
iPhone: Um no I wouldn't say dramatic no

409
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.080
tracy jackson: No nightmares, flashbacks.

410
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:34.890
iPhone: Come to

411
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.060
tracy jackson: Me that thing. Okay.

412
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:43.410
tracy jackson: And then in terms of your past medical history. Any other medical problems that you know

413
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.260
iPhone: I'm just the diabetes. I have a pump for it.

414
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.020
iPhone: Like as I had my rotator cuffs.

415
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.190
Fixed

416
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.230
iPhone: That's really about it.

417
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.340
tracy jackson: And other than your insulin pump. Any other medications that you take every day.

418
00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.110
iPhone: Just the gabapentin

419
00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.090
tracy jackson: Okay, and how much gabapentin

420
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:06.630
iPhone: Well, I think I have. I think they changed the prescription, but I think it was it 600 milligrams six times a day.

421
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.730
tracy jackson: 606 something. Okay. And who's reading that medicine.

422
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:20.640
iPhone: And what my primary was writing it. And then when I went to the pain management plays. You think they switched it they took over writing it, I think.

423
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.830
tracy jackson: And. Are you still seeing that pain group.

424
00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:31.530
iPhone: Well, I was seeing numb. And then when I saw them last about us about two weeks ago they refuse to put me in refuse to let me get off so

425
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:42.030
iPhone: I had to stay on them. And so I just kind of left everything the way it was. I went for a second opinion and I decided just to do my own research and that's when I found you guys this weekend.

426
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:48.240
tracy jackson: So I'm happy to write the gabapentin for you. Do you feel that it's being that it's helpful for you.

427
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:52.740
iPhone: You know I do. I feel like because I have a little bit of neuropathy from the diabetes.

428
00:40:52.950 --> 00:41:00.570
iPhone: Just in my feet. I feel like it does help with that. I don't feel like I have to take it all the time. So sometimes it's like there's days where I don't have to take it.

429
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:07.260
iPhone: To kind of as needed. I don't really know if government is supposed to be an as me to drug, but

430
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:13.830
tracy jackson: It works a little better. If it's in your system, all the time, but I do have people that find it really

431
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:29.100
tracy jackson: makes them feel a little stupid, particularly if you're in your a job that requires a lot of cognitive capacity, like your legal work. So I just do have people that sometimes we'll do 300 and then they wake up 300 at lunch and then take 1200 or 1800 at night to help them.

432
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.810
iPhone: Slow. Okay.

433
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.120
tracy jackson: Or, you know, so they kind of will stagger there. Does that base six times a day, seems like kind of

434
00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:38.220
iPhone: Yeah, so

435
00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:51.510
tracy jackson: Normally I normally do 1200 three at the maximum dose is what your own so you can if you want to stick with the maximum dose, you know, 1200 three times a day, but like you say, if you're finding that kind of

436
00:41:52.770 --> 00:42:03.150
tracy jackson: keeping you from functioning. You can do 600 600 and then LIKE MAYBE LATER AT NIGHT AFTER Luca goes to bed. You could take a bigger dose. So it's, there's a lot of flexibility and how you take that

437
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.020
Okay.

438
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.360
iPhone: Perfect.

439
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.760
tracy jackson: Any other medications.

440
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:22.350
iPhone: You know, I know that they prescribed me sleep medications before, but I don't actually use them, but I didn't like I always felt super hung over the next morning, so I just started. Oh, and flexor all and sorry they have mental muscle relaxer flexible.

441
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.910
tracy jackson: And how much that's true.

442
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:27.690
iPhone: I think 10 milligrams twice a day. Okay.

443
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:38.520
tracy jackson: And are you interested in having any medicines like for nausea, diarrhea, kind of opportunities to build a feeling during your withdrawal period.

444
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:47.520
iPhone: Yeah, definitely. Maybe the nausea about a lot of stomach medication here so that should be okay. But, um, yeah, definitely the nausea, that would help.

445
00:42:48.630 --> 00:43:01.620
tracy jackson: So I'll call you in just a couple of prescriptions to help with the just in the short term with the week before you start on the Suboxone and then the Gabba penta maybe you can try that. If you're having trouble with sleep, just a bigger dice at night and smaller district, the day

446
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:12.480
iPhone: Open trouble you. Can I would it be all right if I switched pharmacies. My son was actually a little last night. So I found a CVS. That was open 24 hours right down the street from me.

447
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:16.050
iPhone: Instead of the pharmacy. I told them, which is way across town so

448
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:17.910
iPhone: I don't know if that's possible, but it'll be much

449
00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.700
tracy jackson: more convenient which road and city is it in

450
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.960
iPhone: And it's going to be

451
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.360
iPhone: It CDs and it's on. I was in Washington Street and Bermuda dunes.

452
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:30.600
tracy jackson: Is the name of the town for me to do.

453
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.770
iPhone: Yes, for me to do.

454
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:40.590
tracy jackson: All right. Um so flux real 10 milligrams twice a day Gabba Penton 600 milligrams six times a day, and then

455
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:49.950
tracy jackson: Knowledge, the medicine and and the Suboxone or the only way rather than your insulin pump.

456
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.600
iPhone: Yes, that's correct.

457
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:58.080
tracy jackson: And you currently live with Luca, and the two cats. Anybody else he relationships.

458
00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:04.170
iPhone: So it's just my boyfriend and I both live here. I have my son, and the two dogs. Yep, that's

459
00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:07.200
tracy jackson: It. Okay. Do you feel safe in the home.

460
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:12.630
tracy jackson: I do. Okay. Any insecurity around food, shelter, safety.

461
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:19.530
tracy jackson: No. Okay. Um, and then, have you ever done any a in a sort of thing.

462
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:31.080
iPhone: I have yeah I have done well I think from early when I was going. It was a group that met more often. So I went to those meetings as I didn't go to the NA meetings as much but. Either one is fine with me.

463
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:45.690
tracy jackson: And then, yeah, I kind of leave it up to people if you know the program works for a lot of people. Some people are really against it, for whatever reason, but I do let you know that the vast majority of the a and na meetings in the past six weeks have gone online.

464
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.740
iPhone: Yes, they have.

465
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:47.700
iPhone: Thought that

466
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:55.710
tracy jackson: Was just something that, at least in the short term. If you feel like you need some extra support and that's something you can look into as well.

467
00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:07.440
tracy jackson: Okay, generally pretty, pretty easy to track down what they are in the area or call the call the numbers of what the in person meetings would be in Nigeria, we can tell you what so

468
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:24.840
iPhone: Perfect. Just one other question with the Suboxone. Is there a specific our number of hours are just as based on symptoms. So it's not like 12 to 24 to 48 hours after you last take the other medication or is it just when you feel like the symptoms you

469
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.310
tracy jackson: Know, go over and don't worry, they'll go over this with you all over again. Don't worry about

470
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:38.940
tracy jackson: Um, but, generally you start with a with a dose of a certain milligrams and and then after your withdrawal. So you will actually call

471
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:46.530
tracy jackson: Your first dose in front of them and you know they'll kind of walk you through what you should what you should feel

472
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:57.630
tracy jackson: And then they'll have a little sheet written out for you. Like if you feel that you're still having withdrawal after two hours. Take this much and then wait this long. And so in the first

473
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:06.660
tracy jackson: Day, you'll sort of tight right what you need to feel well. And then on the second day, you would take that does all in one time, you know, you'd

474
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:15.390
tracy jackson: Like if you took four four and for you within the next day you would take 12 right all the time and see what happens. That kind of thing.

475
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:19.230
tracy jackson: And some people feel like that's too much. So it's a little bit of an up and down.

476
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:29.370
tracy jackson: Knots, you know, so it will depend. And you can start whenever you want to write, you know, if it's easier for you to start. I don't know what your work schedule is. But if you want to give yourself, you know,

477
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:37.350
tracy jackson: Just two or three days to kind of deal with the withdrawal and the first couple of days not to schedule anything like super important.

478
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:50.310
tracy jackson: Right, that's what I generally recommend to kind of give yourself four days, I guess, three or three days at least to sort of like get through the withdrawal and then get the dose to where you can feel comfortable

479
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.680
iPhone: Okay, perfect. Yeah.

480
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:57.030
tracy jackson: And then other than your shoulder surgery was it left or right shoulder.

481
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.200
iPhone: both shoulders.

482
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.940
tracy jackson: My shoulders and and just one time I

483
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.410

484
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.800
tracy jackson: Shoulder. Okay, any other surgeries.

485
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:11.760
iPhone: I had a foot surgery pie 20 years ago.

486
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:22.350
iPhone: I don't even remember what that was for. I think they face awesome nodules, and then they determined it was nothing. I had my tonsils out and that I think that, oh, and a C section with my son, and that was

487
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.470
tracy jackson: And and just the one son.
