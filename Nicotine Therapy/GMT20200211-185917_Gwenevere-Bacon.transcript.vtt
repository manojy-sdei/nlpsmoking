Gwenevere Abriel: Good afternoon.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.780
Nicole Bacon: Yes, yes it is noon.

4
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.030
Nicole Bacon: Just a little after yeah yeah

5
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.100
Let me get a note open for us.

6
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And are you in your apartment.

7
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.360
Nicole Bacon: Now I'm at my parents house in Santa Fe.

8
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And how is your mood been the last day.

9
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.470
Nicole Bacon: Good really good

10
00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Did you notice that it started to be something else and it shifted kind of walk me through how you make sure you're taking care of yourself.

11
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.870
Nicole Bacon: Yes. Can I

12
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:17.580
Nicole Bacon: So I invited like 10 women over for like a full moon gathering, kind of like last minute and nobody. Nobody came, but I felt okay about it because

13
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.410
Nicole Bacon: I

14
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.880
Nicole Bacon: I'm kind of letting go of this feeling of of needing to have outside validation

15
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:37.440
Nicole Bacon: Okay, yeah. And just knowing that it all comes from within myself have been okay with myself and loving myself and

16
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.810
Nicole Bacon: Then I the whole plan with the Hawaii thing with Barbie.

17
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:55.500
Nicole Bacon: I got a message back from my parole officer. And he said, yeah, you have to get permission to travel and I don't think it's a good idea. And so

18
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.440
Nicole Bacon: And they had already bought me a flight.

19
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.810
Nicole Bacon: And so I had to kind of burst the bubble there.

20
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me more about that experience. So, so who bought you the flight. And what was that conversation like what what came up for you around that.

21
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.100
Nicole Bacon: So, um, it was Barbies.

22
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.050
Nicole Bacon: stepmother.

23
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.320
Nicole Bacon: That is backing the company and she bought it and

24
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.120
Nicole Bacon: I looked in the guidebooks that I got from the parole officer and all that and

25
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.150
Nicole Bacon: There's not much information. All it says is, you have to get permission if you leave the country.

26
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:50.610
Nicole Bacon: And it was really vague and so i didn't i new to this whole program. So I didn't think it was going to be a big deal, but obviously it is

27
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.480
Nicole Bacon: So I

28
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:16.290
Nicole Bacon: At first I texted by because I was right in the middle of a couple doing a couple hair clients and I said I wanted to let her know right away. And I'll colors and as possible. And she's like, Oh, well, like it's it's not it's not my fault. We kind of all like got ahead of ourselves and

29
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.500
Nicole Bacon: And I still haven't talked on the phone because she got really depressed. I think she was kind of

30
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.610
Nicole Bacon: Using me getting out there and the whole thing as like part of her grieving process and really holding tight to that.

31
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she grieving. What's fun about

32
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.060
Nicole Bacon: She lost her baby of two months.

33
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Good grief.

34
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.660
Nicole Bacon: From kids from

35
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.700
Nicole Bacon: Austin. So, yeah. Oh.

36
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: My goodness that is hard, hard, hard

37
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.280
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah. So, um, but I kind of was relieved, in a way, because I started seeing a couple red flags.

38
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about what you see

39
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:22.020
Nicole Bacon: Just kind of not necessarily lies, but making things to seem better than what they were like she mentioned something like oh Nordstrom is is wanting to carry my jewelry line. And when I

40
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:45.090
Nicole Bacon: Tried to talk to her more about that she kind of like change the subject. And I'm like, huh, okay and then she's sending me Craigslist ads of furniture for when I moved there and I'm like I don't even know if I want to move there like I haven't even visited. I don't even know if we

41
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:54.420
Nicole Bacon: You know, can be around each other now living situation and we're still learning how to communicate with each other. And also, yeah.

42
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Really smart sheet pan close attention to the red flags.

43
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.240
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

44
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.820
Nicole Bacon: It feels good to to be aware of those quicker because it used to take like yours.

45
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.090
Nicole Bacon: See the red flags. Right. Yeah. So kind of a sense of relief.

46
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.880
Nicole Bacon: It was feeling like

47
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.840
Nicole Bacon: A LITTLE OVERWHELMING and she had a lot of expectations already and

48
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So now that she's withdrawing

49
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of dipping into this idea of boundaries and allowing other people to work through their emotional experiences, not your responsibility to take care of them.

50
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But indeed, we have to learn how to take care of herself looking care about them, we can offer support, but ultimately a Barbie you we all have to ultimately take care of ourselves, in a sense.

51
00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So where are you at with kind of really being able to read Where Is that depression become yours or you really see it like where is that line for you with what she saw intro

52
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:13.950
Nicole Bacon: Um, it's really all hers. I don't know the press at all. Okay. Yeah. And the whole experience kind of

53
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.250
Nicole Bacon: Made me

54
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:35.580
Nicole Bacon: Remember about all the things that I'm excited about doing in my life and all the goals that I have been, you know, I was starting to be like, Oh, like I'm gonna be a part of her story. You know, instead of doing my own thing.

55
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

56
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so this notion will probably because you're intelligent, because you have natural talents in a lot of areas.

57
00:06:46.920 --> 00:07:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be very distracting because you're good at something doesn't mean that's your destiny right and this and this and this and this. It's like, well, wait a minute. Is that where my passion is. So you're you came up a little bit. Sounds like

58
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yes. Okay. Well, cool.

59
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And what has sleep been like, what is eating been like, what has interactions with people been like face to face.

60
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.390
Nicole Bacon: Asleep has been a better. I'm trying to

61
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:37.860
Nicole Bacon: Except that it takes me a couple hours to wind down and then a couple hours even like three hours to get out of the house. So, to be aware of that and

62
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:51.510
Nicole Bacon: I'm trying to, you know, be in bed by midnight to two at the latest latest but I want to get that down to midnight and

63
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.310
Nicole Bacon: Interrupt

64
00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:04.890
Nicole Bacon: Food, I got my food stamps today. So I'm going to go shopping and get some healthy simple things. I think I want to just

65
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:18.630
Nicole Bacon: Do what I used to do is kind of eating the same Mills every day with a little bit of variance, because it would overwhelm me and then I would just wait too long and then eat a bunch of sugary stuff.

66
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.210
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, so, and then interactions with people.

67
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.000
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, that's just been kind of

68
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.400
Nicole Bacon: Now that I've grown a lot. I've just noticed

69
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:46.620
Nicole Bacon: Um interactions with certain friends they i i don't know i don't think a couple of my friendships are going to go forward because, for example, I

70
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:56.670
Nicole Bacon: I reached out to one of my oldest friends since second grade, my friend, Shannon. I hadn't talked to her in a really long time and

71
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:07.830
Nicole Bacon: I feel like she needs me to stay in this like I am an addict and I'm lower than her and

72
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:20.940
Nicole Bacon: wants me to do this like self like beating up of myself to talk to her because like I was talking to her, and I'm like owning up to my things am I good I did it all to myself.

73
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:32.760
Nicole Bacon: And then she kind of reiterate, oh well, have you taken inventory and, like, kind of, you know, it doesn't feel too good. She wants me to stay in this

74
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:48.840
Nicole Bacon: It kind of bummed me out because you know I'm coming truthful about my addiction, a lot, lot of change with how I treated with my friends, they look at me like,

75
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:58.170
Nicole Bacon: Oh, you're this addict and your lower than me and trying to put me into this box and well I don't want it. I don't fit into a box.

76
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.590
No.

77
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.930
Nicole Bacon: So,

78
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, convenient. It's convenient for people

79
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To have other people in a predictable label. So just no notice how you're saying that they're seeing in this way, but that's convenient for them.

80
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So as you change they continue to want to have you in that same label. Now this next step. First of all, it's amazing that you can see it. Much like these other boundaries, like, oh, wait a minute. There's some rigidity over here with this person, the next step. If you decide to take it.

81
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:45.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not to take on that hypnosis right to not say that that's the only truth happening here.

82
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, what would it be like to see that this friend that maybe you saw as a helper a healer or rescue or someone that was really there for you is fixed and stuck.

83
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And instead care still about her is different. It means we say, Hmm, I bet that's uncomfortable right imagine that's uncomfortable to see me getting

84
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Better

85
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I wonder how our friendship will change.

86
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's different to say that that's the definitive that will then we cut the whole person off. Well, you don't know. Maybe there's more to it than that.

87
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe in your strength, your ability to say things like, what's it going to be like to hang out with me if we're not talking about

88
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: My vulnerabilities. But instead, talking about all these cool things. I'm excited about, you know, because that's a unique kind of question. Hey friends, you know what, what would it be like if we but not defensive right in a loving spirit.

89
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Just inquiring into it not seeing her as a threat like how could you see me less than well you don't know. It might be her just trying to have some predictability. Most of us like you're starting this box in this label than that's what you're going to be it's convenient for us.

90
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.150
Nicole Bacon: Right.

91
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But that doesn't mean that's all I'm capable of. Oh, today, well, wait a minute. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. I can adjust maybe she's capable of more police, you're not stuck with

92
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Have being offended. You know what I mean, like, you still get to be excited and and share and do that new skill which is

93
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Not be afraid to connect with people and talk about the new truth and still find out in real time what her limitation is. And it might be that she is limited, but we don't know for sure.

94
00:12:47.310 --> 00:13:00.300
Nicole Bacon: Yeah. Yeah. And I wasn't like angry about it but i i was more like okay I I know she's always taking this role with me of like a grounding role.

95
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:15.030
Nicole Bacon: Kind of mama bear role with me protective role because she really does care about me. And so I don't think you know we haven't shared enough communication.

96
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:30.270
Nicole Bacon: For to see if if she can roll with me, you know, farther. Um, but then I also had this other experience with them this other friend that

97
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.680
Nicole Bacon: Okay, basically.

98
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:44.970
Nicole Bacon: Last minute she's like Oh, I'm coming through Albuquerque. Can you pick me up or go. I'm like, I'm sorry, I can't. This is a way to last minute, I have a hair client.

99
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:54.420
Nicole Bacon: And then on the way back. She's like, Oh, well, maybe you could pick me up at like, midnight. And I said, I'm sorry, I'm in Santa Fe. And she's like, Oh, okay.

100
00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:02.280
Nicole Bacon: I'm thinking that, and I just left at that because I realized, oh she thinks I'm lying because

101
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:10.950
Nicole Bacon: This situation happened where she was wanting to whole space for me when I was struggling to to help me get clean

102
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:24.270
Nicole Bacon: And I kind of wriggled around with that and was making excuses. And I think from that she thinks I'm just consistently lying now. And so before

103
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:32.820
Nicole Bacon: I would just kind of be like, oh, he, he, whatever passive aggressive whatever and writer back and just kind of ignore it and let her

104
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:44.070
Nicole Bacon: brushed off my shoulder, but I'm actually going to write her back and be like hey of, um, you know, I feel some passive aggressiveness and I'm not lying to you.

105
00:14:44.700 --> 00:15:03.330
Nicole Bacon: Yes, I was. Was wriggling about and and making excuses for that one situation, but I've been I'm telling you, straight up. No, I had a hair client and no I'm out of town and kind of like

106
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:13.260
Nicole Bacon: I don't like that energy of, oh, she's mad and making me feel bad because I'm not doing what she wants me to do, like so, Nicole.

107
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see that very much like what was happening on the prior session when we met your you're still doing this interpretation. Yeah. You see it. She's being half, you know, there's she thinks online, it's still all this analysis out here what you could choose to do is wait a minute.

108
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What's that thing going. I said, What do I like

109
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:45.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How you decide what you like, right, then it's really a different focus of attention.

110
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I am making up a story she thinks I'm lying, like what

111
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all in your head now.

112
00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me then you're picking up on her tone and she does think your line.

113
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:10.380
Nicole Bacon: Picking up on the energetic sometimes with the text message. I'll feel something in my stomach. When I read it.

114
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:31.170
Nicole Bacon: Yeah. And so I'm picking up on that but i'm i'm not kind of inquiring yet, you know, and I'm but i i am kind of taking a step back, of like, Wait, why is this making me feel weird, you know and and taking a moment before I respond because

115
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:56.490
Nicole Bacon: I want to be treated with respect and I want to treat others with respect and if I'm feeling that in my stomach. That means something she's it's some lower emotion. But you're right. I am super analyzing it, but at least I'm seeing these things that are kind of red flags for

116
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.900
Nicole Bacon: Myself. So that's the

117
00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.400
Nicole Bacon: Score. Yeah.

118
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And so I I don't mind going over the same thing, which has to do with. I'm not going to analyze. I'm not going to read into something going to take people at face value. What would life be like if I just assumed people's intentions are pretty decent. She wants a ride.

119
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:27.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Clearly, she called you twice for it, it's inconvenient. You're not available for her. Those are facts.

120
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if he just left it flat like that, hey, now watch. Watch what happens. What opens up in the communication, doesn't it, open up to how long are you gonna be in town or what do you have to, what do you do in here. But when you're in that

121
00:17:46.410 --> 00:18:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: self preservation mode, right, there's no now the friendship might be ending and she's, she's doing this cost of your now I gotta call her out on on her behavior and now it's a confrontation and she can always say, All I did was asked you for right i don't know shocking.

122
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.550
Nicole Bacon: Right, the specific thing.

123
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:12.750
Nicole Bacon: Was um okay this is it specifically. So this is why I it felt that way. Basically, she's like

124
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:33.060
Nicole Bacon: Okay, okay. She needs arise back i said i'm i'm in Santa Fe right now and if when you come back to Santa Fe, we can catch up, if you'd like. And he says, oh, OK, dot, dot, dot. And usually, every time I've seen oh ok means like

125
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:52.170
Nicole Bacon: That specifically not like oh okay like a, oh, you know, I mean, every time I've seen that usually has been. Oh, okay. And I guess just from her personality. I kind of know that she's, she's been like that, but I don't know.

126
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how much work you're doing for words.

127
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So much work so much self preservation

128
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.200
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

129
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And you will only really get this until you run into when you actually challenge that those assumptions.

130
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: When you actually go back in and you dip your toe back in again and right again. Hey, just falling up again. I'm around between this and this time. Are you free.

131
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you no longer make a decision on that made up story that you had in your head. Okay, like you're thinking like, okay, what a bitch. Is that what you're thinking. She's thinking

132
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.450
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah like I think she's thinking that I'm lying to her.

133
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.400
Nicole Bacon: Oh, yeah.

134
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's, that's

135
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the stuff, giving yourself permission to just focus on what do you want. What do you want, do you want to spend time with her. It's on her to be more clear.

136
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.830
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I don't think they want to. OK. I

137
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.490
Nicole Bacon: Can hear you. Yeah, yeah, work, you're

138
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing within okay that you have to do all these acrobatics. My guess is you're longing for you like contacts, it's clear and direct and don't don't barrage you with a bunch of contact just

139
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you needed in a slower pace and and that might be what you're drawn to for a while that might change it.

140
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:28.440
Nicole Bacon: Is

141
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine. But all this interpretation analysis, you've been doing those friendships may go by the way for a little while until they do some growing up and they're more clear or if it's really important one. You may say

142
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you disappointed are you offended you may end up asking a direct question to check out your assumption, but at this point I hear you registering Hey at least I'm paying attention to this stuff. And that's, that's a great first part.

143
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.670
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah. Um,

144
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So would you put me up higher. So I'm not

145
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:16.260
Nicole Bacon: Checking out your nostrils. Oh, sorry. Maybe put me someplace, a little bit more down. Okay, more direct. Okay.

146
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:17.520
Nicole Bacon: Now,

147
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that bring up anxiousness to have a more direct contact, does that make you feel anxious

148
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.870
Nicole Bacon: I'm just a little bit because I haven't showered and gotten ready for the day.

149
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you don't smell bad.

150
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.790
Nicole Bacon: So we could smell through the phone. Oh.

151
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: There's somebody told me there was some kind of apps that they, I don't see how that's possible thing, how you can have an app with a smell on a phone.

152
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.240
Nicole Bacon: I don't think so.

153
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.610
Nicole Bacon: Stickers.

154
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:56.280
Nicole Bacon: I don't know, somebody said something I think they were pulling my leg. Yeah, yeah.

155
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Aroma say either be pretty cool though Roma therapy. You know, you could do this whole like behavioral health peace and have this particular smell that brought them to their peaceful place.

156
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.380
Nicole Bacon: Coming out of the phone like oil diffuser to be so cool.

157
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so. Joe

158
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.260
Sounds

159
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Very much to send it has this whole other special place in our brain, it's very

160
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.380
Nicole Bacon: I love, I love essential oils. I actually

161
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:34.560
Nicole Bacon: Got into detail essential oils right when they came out and I was in this group of women I we would meet every Wednesday and talk about oils and all the healing properties and

162
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:49.020
Nicole Bacon: I forgot about those for a long time. I have a whole grip of them. And I've been using them. The last couple weeks. And I'm like, Oh my gosh, why don't I use these every day. Forgot about them. They have so much to do.

163
00:22:50.730 --> 00:23:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And and that could be a clue. When something feels like there's a intense activation coming out of nowhere, you might have just gotten a whiff of something

164
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:02.700
Nicole Bacon: You know,

165
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's like, I don't know where this is coming from.

166
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.960
Nicole Bacon: We go. I have like a really cool story. One day about

167
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.030
Nicole Bacon: Yeah. You know those people. They're called noses.

168
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.940
Nicole Bacon: That can smell that can smell a

169
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:27.540
Nicole Bacon: Perfume and know the percentages and exactly what's in a smell. I have a whole cool story about snow in general. Yeah.

170
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's some if you're open to it.

171
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Do a little bit of some therapeutic intervention, you can always check in check in and say, you know, let's go. Nice and light. Let's not go too deep. And always, always, always, that is the case, it's you're in charge of where we go. Okay. Okay.

172
00:23:51.120 --> 00:24:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have done some preparation work with me. We have a protective figure nurturing for your wives figure. We've cultivated a container. We've got a distancing metaphor.

173
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to put off. You went to to a place that I think you miss heard an invitation, when we were doing an anchor room. So I'm going to, I'm going to put a pin in that for a little bit, because maybe you thought I was directing you

174
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: To go to a history of violation and abuse and I was not. And so I want to kind of put a little bit of distance with that for a while and then we will assess together whether our communication is getting really more and more clear.

175
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I watched you do that, man. You know, I got nervous. I'm like wonder why she's decided to go there.

176
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.550
Nicole Bacon: It's interesting. I don't know.

177
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It's pretty typical typically I'm educating along the way. Like, what the purpose of something is. And if you ever want sort of the science behind it. If I know what it is. And I'll certainly explain it.

178
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: But

179
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But 100% activation and the dissociation, or in the wanting to run away, is I'm never going to want that I'm never going to

180
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Be inviting that that be the space that we're in. I don't think people can learn when we're in that much distress the

181
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Hippocampus it just gets all cut off too much cortisol and then we don't register memory properly. So I don't want it that high, and I don't want it too low. It's not productive.

182
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.750
Nicole Bacon: Right, right, right.

183
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.700
Nicole Bacon: Cool, cool, cool.

184
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe let's just do this and you'll get a visual so you can see what I'm looking at. Okay.

185
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.460
Nicole Bacon: Okay, so

186
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in here. See how this is this is the subjective unit of distress and there's really nothing in there, this blue stuff. It just has some numbers.

187
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:48.750
Nicole Bacon: Yes.

188
00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to add some some stories in there.

189
00:25:52.830 --> 00:26:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and I'm going to put some some negative numbers to meaning below the threshold of relaxation and this is getting this is down into dissociation stuff so we won't be anywhere near here.

190
00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but I'm going to put the numbers just to acknowledge the fact that this for people that have a history of this

191
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:12.720
Nicole Bacon: This is real.

192
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Not everybody has this part, they're just like, I don't know. We're talking about only

193
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I only get angry and I don't want about

194
00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But in case this is a part of your story and then let's have a space for that.

195
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I want to look at is the 50 books right there. It's not relaxation were like, for example, how would you rate. How much distress, you're in now compared to, you know, really tranquil meditative state.

196
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Which might be around zero. How might you rain, how you're feeling in a subjective unit of distress right now.

197
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.310
Nicole Bacon: Right go from like zero to 10 or like

198
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: All the way down to 100 this

199
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:02.430
Nicole Bacon: Oh, okay.

200
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, these guys in here and zero would be like, you're, you're really in a relaxed body, but you're still able to think you can you know you're not in distress.

201
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.440
Nicole Bacon: I would say like 22

202
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.870
Nicole Bacon: Finger at a 22 yeah

203
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.610
All right.

204
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And before you logged on with me. What were you at

205
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:28.980
Nicole Bacon: I'm

206
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.670
Nicole Bacon: 35 because I went to go get cigarettes real quick. I didn't have been

207
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So you had to go out, people might see you might interact with people.

208
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a rush.

209
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.490
Nicole Bacon: Is that the rush. Yeah, okay.

210
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what do you think it would take for you to come down a little bit, maybe a 10, what would you need to do to do that.

211
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.870
Nicole Bacon: Um, I'm eat some food.

212
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Cuz you're hungry.

213
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.380
Yeah.

214
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you have in your house. That could be a nice breakfast for you.

215
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.300
Nicole Bacon: Eggs and

216
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:17.310
Nicole Bacon: Usually the fridge is packed here at my parents house so I can make anything french toast, maybe

217
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.350
Nicole Bacon: Okay, that's my

218
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:24.960
Nicole Bacon: And some tea.

219
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So just being at your parents house. Does it bring up any distress at all.

220
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.050
Nicole Bacon: No, I feel like

221
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:47.220
Nicole Bacon: cleared a lot of stuff I feel really chill and

222
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:49.680
Nicole Bacon: Like

223
00:28:50.910 --> 00:29:02.490
Nicole Bacon: The energy of the house says chilled out as well. Even the animals have been more cuddly and lovely. And my mom's demeanor has

224
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.620
Nicole Bacon: Been way more relaxed. The last month, though. Yeah.

225
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What is that, where did that come from. What do you attribute that to

226
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:24.240
Nicole Bacon: Um, they see that I'm actually i has to do with me. I think actually trying and putting work in and

227
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.050
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, seeing, seeing

228
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.560
Nicole Bacon: Seeing that in me, I think, put some

229
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.080
Nicole Bacon: Stress away.

230
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:40.170
Nicole Bacon: And it shows in the winter months. It just node last night.

231
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And you think that brings out a more tranquil demeanor and in in your okay

232
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.730
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah, definitely.

233
00:29:52.710 --> 00:30:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just do a little bit of breath, work together, let's let's do some of that diet dramatic breathing. Let's see if we can just feel a little better.

234
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to your stuffed animal maybe paying attention to how it feels.

235
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Still the fuzziness

236
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: pushing us

237
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And just move that awareness from the hands to the rest

238
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: forearms, the elbows.

239
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.340
My biceps.

240
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.380
Shoulders.

241
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And just see what happens if you pay attention to your in and out breath just nice and easy.

242
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not up to any big exercises. Today, we're just lightly paying attention to comfort with looking inward.

243
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what what's happening.

244
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.170
Nicole Bacon: Um,

245
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.740
Nicole Bacon: Let me some mix.

246
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It's already

247
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.930
Nicole Bacon: Coming. Yes.

248
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.480
Nicole Bacon: Either myself before coming on here.

249
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to go grab a piece of bread or something just

250
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.010
Nicole Bacon: Get every day.

251
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:18.750
Nicole Bacon: Okay, yeah.

252
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Go for it.

253
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I got some water while you run over there.

254
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:13.560
Got an empty.

255
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: How's your comfort level in will just follow your channel stay superficial here. How's your comfort level in being around people in group. How's that, kind of, what are you noticing.

256
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.330
Nicole Bacon: In group. No, yeah, totally fine.

257
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:53.130
Nicole Bacon: Um, you know, seeing familiar faces so feeling more comfortable. Okay.

258
00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:57.960
Nicole Bacon: I like

259
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.910
Nicole Bacon: I felt comfortable on group. I don't get. I like that.

260
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:11.490
Nicole Bacon: We actually do something that I'm learning about like the last exercise about the guilt.

261
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.680
Nicole Bacon: shame and

262
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:21.570
Nicole Bacon: I wrote it all down. And I do want to look back at it and a couple months because really made me think about

263
00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:27.390
Nicole Bacon: I like that we're doing something because when I was in a

264
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.560
Nicole Bacon: intensive outpatient program before here in Santa Fe.

265
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:48.510
Nicole Bacon: I hated going to group because it was just like, going around the circle and being like, How Was Your Week, and it would just be like, I went to see my mom and my life sucks. And then I my boyfriend to me again and I was

266
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.430
Nicole Bacon: Those know

267
00:33:50.580 --> 00:34:00.060
Nicole Bacon: Of trying to work on stuff, you know, and I got really triggered. I hated going, Yeah, okay. No, I appreciate it. Yeah.

268
00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's some impatience for

269
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe not seeing how you can be benefiting from the experience from that other program. So when that comes up just pay close attention to it and

270
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And just a different skill might be needed during that

271
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's how can I find this person. Interesting. How can I not be bored because boredom.

272
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't want to be bored. You know, I mean, it's our life, we don't want to be wasting our time. So, how to turn curiosity on how can we get interested. How can this become something of interest, where once a second ago that was

273
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:45.210
You know,

274
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It may come up again. But anyway, I'm glad it's convenient that it's more interesting for you. You don't have to work twice as hard

275
00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:10.680
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, and I think it goes back to the the analytical mind again like like just kind of dissecting what they're saying, or even kind of been feeling triggered to the point of

276
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:17.490
Nicole Bacon: Wanting to leave my body a little bit. And that's, that's not healthy either so

277
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, there's probably some more going on now and just monotonous storytelling from people. There's something

278
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.010
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, no, it's the and then they talked about drugs and data and

279
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:47.100
Nicole Bacon: But not in like oh action plan, what we, what can we do, it's just more of like, oh, and then that happened again or my boyfriend got arrested again and just kind of, I don't know.

280
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:56.820
Nicole Bacon: I guess what works for me a lot is kind of See No Evil speak no evil. Hear No Evil just kind of like, not really.

281
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:04.440
Nicole Bacon: Just abstinence. In general, unless it's like in a safe space like we're talking about

282
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:21.090
Nicole Bacon: Here in group, but, um, that's one thing that I had a hard time with like na is like a lot of the worst stories, and then I'd want to go us after it because we're talking about it so much, you know, kind of, yeah.

283
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:21.750
Yep.

284
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:31.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's good to know. Good to know. So you'll have to really work hard. When people do need that space to discharge.

285
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Their sort of event that happened. You'll have to really turn on. Okay, that's going to bring up this this negative network. And I'm going to turn our attention to. And there's lots of little tricks that you can use.

286
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Just focus on the rhythm of his voice. Isn't that interesting. Oh, it goes up and down. I'll look at, it's kind of kind of stand there, you can turn your attention to something else.

287
00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And it doesn't have to be. Oh, me too. I have, you know, oh, I have lots of stories just like that and that'll feel good, you know. So anyway, okay, you had a little nibble, let's come over here and see if we can find a

288
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: A 50 50% of distress. It's not to the point that you can't think straight. In fact, you can still use your executive functioning, so plan.

289
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Still use rational thought can remember something you have access to all of your brain all the parts of the brain are still communicating, it's still important. And notice right there's a little bit of that that limbic system that's activated.

290
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: But you can still concentrate

291
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's have an event. And we're going to start to populate that chart with some stories in it. What is it about a 51st story that comes to mind.

292
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It kind of was uncomfortable or stressful or

293
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.470
Nicole Bacon: I'm

294
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.990
Nicole Bacon: Kind of what comes to mind, I guess, is

295
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.060
Nicole Bacon: When I'm

296
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.780
Nicole Bacon: Having a consultation with the new client.

297
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, tell me.

298
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:15.360
Yeah.

299
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:35.370
Nicole Bacon: So there's a little bit of like anxiousness and nervousness like am I gonna get along with my client, am I going to get the same picture in my head of what they want me to do today hair. I'm just meeting a new person in general them in my hands of

300
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:42.960
Nicole Bacon: You know, feeling like I want to do a good job that kind of comes to mind, I guess.

301
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So you had a is this referencing history when you were starting to take that that gig on at the salon. Is that what's coming up that stuff.

302
00:38:53.100 --> 00:39:00.930
Nicole Bacon: Mm hmm. Okay. Yeah, no, I guess it just in general. Yeah, with any client when I was working at this one.

303
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and you would like to maybe have a different experience of that.

304
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.750
Nicole Bacon: Um, no, not necessarily. I just I maybe I'm not understanding the

305
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, you're doing great.

306
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:14.520
Nicole Bacon: No.

307
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: No, it was a beautiful story.

308
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:17.310
Okay.

309
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The other one was just a different question.

310
00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. So we'll go back to this this image, you have. So there's meeting a new person. It was a consultation and my picturing what they want. Will I be able to give it to them what they want and then there was also the I will also be touching their body right

311
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:41.160
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

312
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's in motion that goes with what you just told me

313
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.170
Nicole Bacon: The emotion, um,

314
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:54.780
Nicole Bacon: You a little bit of anxiousness

315
00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:02.310
Nicole Bacon: I'm excitement. If it's something cool. They want me to do their hair.

316
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:07.050
Nicole Bacon: Or a little bit of fear a little bit of fear.

317
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.960
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

318
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.340
Nicole Bacon: Me. Yeah, sometimes I get real sweaty.

319
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:40.380
Nicole Bacon: Like under my armpits. When I'm doing color and I'm sometimes you don't know what its gonna look like all the way until it's all the way dry so I get a little like it will be fine. A lot of self talk like it's gonna be great. And usually does turn out great. I just, I get scared.

320
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Has it ever been where it has not turned out well.

321
00:40:48.660 --> 00:41:08.790
Nicole Bacon: Oh yeah, a couple times the the bottles of the containers of hair color, have been Miss marked and that was horrible because a light purple versus a dark purple I'm blonde hair that's like a huge difference. And it can ruin somebody's hair.

322
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.520
Nicole Bacon: Okay, so, yeah.

323
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:22.530
Nicole Bacon: And the chemistry isn't. It's not all the way a plus b equals people's hair can do whatever and

324
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:24.150
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

325
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So hold that image in your mind. And so it's anxious and it's also exciting a little fearful and the body sweats and sort of wondering, Well, it turned out just the way you anticipated in the client anticipated.

326
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And see this one's a little harder to get to

327
00:41:47.550 --> 00:42:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be present with that imagery and that sensation. See if you can identify what belief you have about yourself all that's going on. And you might recognize it through the statement I am

328
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:19.320
Nicole Bacon: Like

329
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:26.160
Nicole Bacon: I get the I Am statements. I really like that stuff. But I guess what I'm

330
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:32.880
Nicole Bacon: Like, I want to be good enough. I want to please. This person that's kind of where I'm going.

331
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I see you want to please them that kind of matches with the excitement. Right. They've said what they want, you've matched your skill. Maybe you'll be able to do it right and

332
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I want

333
00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:48.270
A some

334
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What's what meaning do you take out of yourself that you want to please them.

335
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.470
Nicole Bacon: What mean

336
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: These are harder to get to know

337
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:05.820
Nicole Bacon: That McCall

338
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a belief about the cell

339
00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:09.210
Yeah.

340
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What do you believe about you that you want to please people

341
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.100
Nicole Bacon: That I'm not good enough.

342
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Check your body. Make sure that that's true.

343
00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it activated in any way messaging. Yes, that's, that's it, you found something there that what it's telling him.

344
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:49.410
Nicole Bacon: I know I look confused because like a lot of perspective changes have been happening for me recently, so like what was true before isn't true for metering

345
00:43:49.890 --> 00:44:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. So let's do the positive cognition. So you pull that image up you're excited. A little frayed you have that memory of a little bit of sweatiness will it turn out the way we've always kind of envisioned it

346
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To be our visions are the same. What's, what's the positive belief you have about yourself.

347
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.600
Nicole Bacon: Because I believe that I

348
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:23.460
Nicole Bacon: Will have a good session with the client and they will be happy with the service.

349
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And what does that say about you.

350
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.410
Nicole Bacon: Now that I did my job right.

351
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you're doing great.

352
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing just fine. I told you these are hard.

353
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.210
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

354
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I did my job right.

355
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So the president without I did my job right.

356
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And

357
00:44:52.620 --> 00:45:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I will have a good session, they will be happy. And that's sort of a thought a projection into the future. The fact that you're the ability to think positively into the future. I will have a good session, they will be happy with my the service that I gave them.

358
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you need to believe about yourself at that moment.

359
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.800
Nicole Bacon: That I know what I'm doing.

360
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

361
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Now from one to seven seven being absolutely true. I know what I'm doing. And one is dude I have

362
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.550
Gwenevere Abriel: How true is that right now for you. I know what I'm doing.

363
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:48.840
Nicole Bacon: Wait, in relation to the sorry I'm telling you right now in general like

364
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:49.950
Nicole Bacon: Well, no.

365
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay, even that amount of time that just passed meeting that clarification, it may have shifted so that's

366
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: This let's lift it and kind of just let let it blow away a little bit

367
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to just go back to that imagery of your, your meeting for a new consultation. It's a new client.

368
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And you want to get it right and am I even hearing it the same way. Hopefully they're envisioning it and it's kind of exciting. It was kind of interesting, maybe it'd be a little challenge to, you know, I have to kind of stretch yourself a little bit

369
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But then there's that uncertainty of chemistry that comes in with you know coloring

370
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And so how true is it that

371
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what I'm doing in that imagery right there. How true is that from one to seven seven being the highest. Yes, that's absolutely true. I know what I'm doing.

372
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:49.290
Nicole Bacon: 50%

373
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can't, I don't know how to do 50 if it's

374
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.870
127 3.5

375
00:46:59.250 --> 00:46:59.880
Got it.

376
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

377
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:04.860
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

378
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see where we are. Okay, don't have quite enough time. We've got a good story here though. I like it.

379
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We were able to plug one in, put a little story in there.

380
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.880
Nicole Bacon: And I can get a sense of

381
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.990
What

382
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What 50% looks like on you and let me check in. Now even bringing this up just anything get activated.

383
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:35.970
Nicole Bacon: Yeah, I'm a little anxious, like, as you can see on my grandma was man.

384
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you care.

385
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're thinking about it maybe contributes to anxious

386
00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:45.300
Nicole Bacon: No.

387
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:59.520
Nicole Bacon: I, I get a in the past I've, I've taken my work home have gone to attach put my emotions to too.

388
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.120
Nicole Bacon: Much in the womb of my client.

389
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:09.000
Nicole Bacon: Sometimes, and that that's scary. So I am a lot inches.

390
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So did you say there was a really fragmented sentence.

391
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.160
Nicole Bacon: Okay.

392
00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You bet you bring somehow the emotional impact of the work home with you.

393
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:26.670
Nicole Bacon: Yes. Yeah, it really affects me. Oh, and yeah, okay.

394
00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.680
Nicole Bacon: Yeah.

395
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take that one. And that'll be our last piece. So hold that in your awareness for a second.

396
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: See what your belief about yourself is around that image ready

397
00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.770
Nicole Bacon: I'm overwhelmed.

398
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's an emotion. Emotion overwhelmed. I brought it home with me. See what try the I Am.

399
00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Felt sense

400
00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And then maybe you need to go to the body to find out what the aim is with that belief about yourself. You can name it. It's overwhelming emotionally

401
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:34.050
Nicole Bacon: Am I am scared. I'm

402
00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about yourself.

403
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: When you bring that stuff home.

404
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.880
Nicole Bacon: Kind of like defeated feel defeated.

405
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:52.650
Nicole Bacon: Little bit.

406
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.360
Nicole Bacon: Like I can't

407
00:49:58.650 --> 00:49:59.430
Nicole Bacon: Affiliate can

408
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:05.280
Nicole Bacon: Separate it goes back to boundaries. I think I

409
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.250
Nicole Bacon: Have a hard time separating that

410
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:20.040
Nicole Bacon: person's perspective of, do I like my hair, not in in relation to do they like me or not as a person.

411
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

412
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense. And so last piece. What would you like to be thinking at the end of the day about yourself.

413
00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:42.810
Nicole Bacon: I did the best I can do. And people

414
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:54.120
Nicole Bacon: Think Kelly think in love themselves as much as they're going to love themselves and I that's not my deal. I did the best I can do. And I'm proud of that and

415
00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:57.780
Nicole Bacon: I can do.

416
00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I did my guest and I'm proud of myself.

417
00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:02.580
Mm hmm.

418
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the I heart, I believe, right, I believe I did the best I could do proud of what it is that would be the preferred thought coming home.

419
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And then maybe that separation might be easier.

420
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To leave whatever happened there.

421
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Then access and energy to other things. Hobbies interests, whatever flow, maybe more readily

422
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.610
Nicole Bacon: Yes, definitely. Definitely make sense.

423
00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well you did some good work here. I've got some decent notes. I feel like it's we're continuing to prepare for what I think will end up being some some em Dr work down the line.

424
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:47.430
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah yeah

425
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But I really want to make sure I know where that that threshold is with you, you know, and you can

426
00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Register to so we can kind of toggle back and forth and be like, yeah, yeah. This is the 50. No, I don't even like 50 even be there. I'm rather hang out at

427
00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:12.780
Nicole Bacon: Yeah yeah

428
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.580
