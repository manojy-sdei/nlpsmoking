55
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just really important to me that when you know the the hurt.

56
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:10.920

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Just give yourself permission to deal with it. All right.

Johnny Roberts: Like I said, I talked to her.

59
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.440
