Nicole Roybal: Honestly, just really, really, really stressed out about this coronavirus oh

15
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's talk about it for a little bit. Okay. What, what do you, what are your fears.

16
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.720
Nicole Roybal: Was especially because I can go to my grandparents every day and I'm out in the world. I go to the store and stuff. And then I go there and I washed my hands immediately and I clean all the door knobs and everything.

17
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:39.210
Nicole Roybal: And make sure I'm very like aware of it and be careful. But I'm still scared because they're very old and vulnerable to the to the disease. I can't talk to

18
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Now they're fragile.

19
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.580
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, exactly. So I've just been really, really scared about that and I can't stop thinking about it because it's all everywhere.

20
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.420
Nicole Roybal: The world can stop talking about it, I get it. I'm just

21
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we're going to put a time limit on how long we do it. Okay. But first, I want it, since it's on your mind. I want to make sure that we get it out there. So do you include when you're talking with your grandparents their opinion about your coming over.

22
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.970
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

23
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:21.330
Nicole Roybal: I'm like we thought we tell them. And like we tell them that we're careful we wash our hands million times for it and give them a hug and wash my hands, but um

24
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.730
Nicole Roybal: I guess I haven't really ever told me their opinion. I know they're like scared about it but they haven't told me their opinion about us going over there.

25
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.160
Nicole Roybal: I was my grandpa says I feel safe, so you

26
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.600
Nicole Roybal: Mean, my mom because I'm obviously with me this week.

27
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.030
Nicole Roybal: Since she's all for

28
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me rephrase the question.

29
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: What does your grandmother say to you about what she wants regarding you're coming into her home.

30
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:27.450
Nicole Roybal: Well, she she she doesn't want nothing that she just like really wants to company, but I know that she likes it when I make them food and stuff, because every time I make them food, just like my goal. So

31
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.910
Nicole Roybal: But I have a question. I think she

32
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.860
Nicole Roybal: Does a lot of ways to answer it, but I don't know which one is right well

33
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's, here's what might be happening has the direct question then need to her. Maybe that's why it's hard to answer because maybe nobody's asked her.

34
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.890
Nicole Roybal: This have asked her what she wants, like material like

35
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.970
Nicole Roybal: Like stuff like food wise and like materialistic wise and stuff. I haven't asked her what she personally

36
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.700
Nicole Roybal: Wants herself, I guess.

37
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, flip it. Look how scared you are

38
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if

39
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a preference, you have like RATIONAL FEAR irrational, wherever that line is, I don't know, but we all do. We're all the whole planet does

40
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm. So you have a choice. You can actually asked the person how they feel about your you're out in the world. You go to the store you you're walking. You're touching everything from seats handles products that have been touched by 10 different people.

41
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Grandma.

42
00:04:49.830 --> 00:05:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It is spread through contact spread through this way and that way. And you're part of the vulnerable population. So we're a little babies and people that have compromised immune systems.

43
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a risk, Grandma, how do you feel about my coming here and helping you.

44
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: These are the things I'm doing to be careful. But I want to know how you feel about it.

45
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.900
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I'll be sure to ask her that because that is a major question I would like answered, or to your answer to

46
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And look, look for a moment and kind of question wonder why it hasn't already been asked.

47
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:43.380
Nicole Roybal: Like we talked about it, man. My mom like we've told her like we're scared because we go to the store and we're out in the world and we come back here. She doesn't really say nothing. She's kind of like shakes her head, like

48
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.430
Nicole Roybal: Like she's scared of just what's happening with the world. I don't know. I can't say that I don't know what she's thinking

49
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you don't know that's great that you caught that.

50
00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we told her we the second time you said it. We've told her.

51
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.280
Yeah.

52
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But guess what you're talking about here this morning. I'm worried about my grandma. I'm worried about my grandpa.

53
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.440
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

54
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if they're worried about themselves. I wonder

55
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If you need not worry, you might be able to be done with worrying and probably not all of it because we got to be a little cautious, but

56
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm talking about the big worry the one that is taking up hours of your day.

57
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: If your grandma says out loud.

58
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm worried too.

59
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But I know you. I know you're going to be as careful as you can. And maybe you could also leave, leave your shoes outside. And also could you put some jammies on put your clothes in a little bag, maybe it even seemed ridiculous but that's what gramma wanted, you might say.

60
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.500
Nicole Roybal: I didn't know

61
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.060
Gwenevere Abriel: She might she might say,

62
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Something like that, or she might say, oh, no worries. I'm so glad to help. Help. Help. I love you guys so much. The world's gone crazy. I don't know what she's gonna say

63
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but you don't have to use your imagination about it anymore. You, you don't have to go to. I would feel so guilty and mortified if I'm the one that caused her to get sick.

64
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: She's a part of this include her include him. I'm used to starting with your grandma.

65
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.650
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, which is random.

66
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to talk about grandma know

67
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.070
Nicole Roybal: Putting it towards both of them, so it's fine.

68
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.290
Nicole Roybal: But, um,

69
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.210
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I think I should. I know that she likes this going over there and we told her that we're not going to be able to go there again.

70
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.110
Nicole Roybal: Because we have to go to work after go help my parents at work. We have to sanitize the whole school say work at so

71
00:07:52.860 --> 00:08:00.060
Nicole Roybal: Um, yeah, we're gonna be working all weekend so we told them. We're not gonna be able to go and I could tell by gramma was like really upset about that we're not going to be able to go over there.

72
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But no, I no one asked her, because you guys. You guys don't have direct communication.

73
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.970
Nicole Roybal: She doesn't answer because she doesn't. Um,

74
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.780
Nicole Roybal: I say this, she won't answer you with the truth. Shoulders answer with what she thinks you want

75
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:31.290
Nicole Roybal: It does that make sense. Like what what she thinks you want to hear she won't ever tell us the truth. I swear. She drives me nuts. That's probably why we don't ever asked her because she's never direct speak, almost. Okay. Yeah. But really, she feels upset.

76
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.100
Nicole Roybal: So it's very frustrating.

77
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we might we might pick that up a little bit later, but

78
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: you getting my point that this could give you some weeks if you could get her to say out loud.

79
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought about it too, sweetie right honey whatever little pet name is for you. And I thought about that and

80
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I love you guys around I I feel lonely when you're not here. I love it that you're here. I'm so grateful to your help.

81
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I know as you guys will be careful. Maybe she'll actually have something to say.

82
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.270
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

83
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And I get it, I get. I get the type of personality that you're describing that she'll just she's she'll just say no. Nothing's wrong. She'll go with nothing's wrong even if she's bleeding out or eye socket.

84
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.270
Nicole Roybal: Exactly, exactly.

85
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I know the type

86
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.800
Nicole Roybal: I get

87
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, but you hear that there might be a question in there. And if nothing else, Nicole. It might be good for

88
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:41.760
You

89
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Because

90
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.840
Nicole Roybal: We just know that to ask

91
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's right. You know, you ask a direct question. It's good for you. It's a good habit that direct style communication. So, I have been thinking about you and it was around a different topic.

92
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It was around school deferment

93
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wondered if you had been thinking about that to

94
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.440
Nicole Roybal: School deferment yeah deferment

95
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: had wondered if you had been thinking about it.

96
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:14.880
Nicole Roybal: Hmm.

97
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember us talking about it.

98
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.920
Nicole Roybal: I'm trying to think about my school the loan how I prefer or

99
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.430
Nicole Roybal: That's one thing I could pretend it towards for some reason. I don't know why.

100
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That is the only reason we wouldn't be talking about my loan deferment right

101
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.380
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, exactly. Okay.

102
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course, it would be yours. Is it possible that you haven't thought about it since we talked about it.

103
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.170
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, okay.

104
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.090
Nicole Roybal: Because I don't

105
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.220
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, I guess I'm just focused on so many different things right now. Okay.

106
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So how many minutes of the day are you focused on

107
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Fear.

108
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.560
Nicole Roybal: All day

109
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.770
Nicole Roybal: Oh my mind.

110
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.720
Nicole Roybal: About getting sick.

111
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:20.820
Nicole Roybal: And my little brother. He has a cold right now. Um, and he got let it get really bad. He wasn't using victory nothing he let it get really bad. So now,

112
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.960
Nicole Roybal: He's like super sick. And I'm like, super, super scared of getting sick because I'm so I mean system is very deep.

113
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.430
Okay.

114
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is only a symptom relief.

115
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.490
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, the cure, but I know my mom is crazy about it.

116
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.610
Nicole Roybal: I know it's Western medicine. I know.

117
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's just a symptom relief, the same way as Sudafed but it can prevent a lot of runny nose so defense. Great for sort of drying it up, but it doesn't get rid of the cold. We don't actually have a cure for the cold.

118
00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I do.

119
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I don't have a cure for the whole but what I've watched is when

120
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I my whole family has bought into this and there's a few people I've run into to do the same thing. It has to do with using as think

121
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Either they used to make and they might still haven't seen it, and I use a tincture, but. And there used to be zinc lozenges it cut a cold that normally would take like seven days get all the way through it would cut it in half.

122
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.510
Nicole Roybal: Oh my gosh.

123
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And I was like, How can this be true that I know because I'm very cynical person when it comes to this.

124
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of stuff there. I'll still do it. I'll kick and scream the whole time. Like, this is not going to work. This is not

125
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.740
Nicole Roybal: Gonna work like OSHA

126
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and it works. And so now I'm like oh

127
00:12:52.380 --> 00:13:03.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I do it now. If there's going to be. There's a cold. That's kind of running through the house or there's something happening. I take think and my coast con like really fast.

128
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:11.070
Nicole Roybal: Next time we want to get some of those, you know, she makes this medicine tea as well like herbs and stuff. And that helps a lot.

129
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

130
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just see what's happening here. Let me see how when you say it's all day long. So all day long.

131
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to what's the worst thought you're getting. What's the worst your all day long. It's going worst worst worst thought

132
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:46.830
Nicole Roybal: What if anyone in my family gets it. What if I get it. What if, like, you know what I mean. And then you could have it in either. No, that's right, yeah. And so it's just it's scary. I'm literally washing my hands constantly, but I don't know if everyone else's, you know,

133
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.090
Okay.

134
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So have you been doing some reading on ways that you yourself if you're around people that are using as much precaution as you are, what else you can do to safeguard

135
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting this this infection.

136
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Obviously washing hands that that is literally one of the best things you can do, but

137
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.190
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

138
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're on that. If you're around people that are not taking as much precaution.

139
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.010
Nicole Roybal: What, what can you do

140
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:35.760
Nicole Roybal: I know they've been saying like wearing a mask and gloves and stuff like that. But like we're all in the same house and going to touch something that they touched, no matter what.

141
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:42.450
Nicole Roybal: So it's like it's impossible. I just literally I've been watching bands like crazy man or so dry so much in Washington.

142
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people are like that. So there's handwashing and then, you know, there's also maybe having a tissue where you open the fridge door with

143
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.940
Nicole Roybal: Doing that all night last night.

144
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

145
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.990
Nicole Roybal: That's like the couch I sit on the same couch. Okay.

146
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you sit on your butt, because in your body, but goes on the bed, but your butts down where you but is on the bed, you know,

147
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:16.560
Nicole Roybal: rubbing the arms of the chair. It's like a one person little chair. My mom's room so like arms right next to you.

148
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So you bring paper towels you bought them down. That's where you rest your hands.

149
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you don't worry about it and you can watch them.

150
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:44.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I haven't done looking at it to see if if this particular germ likes to sit on a dry surface. There are certain things where a bug can land on a surface like Murcia, Oh man, that one does not die, Murcia, it'll sit right there will sit there for like a month.

151
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.680
Nicole Roybal: Oh my gosh, really.

152
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why in jails and in hospitals, Murcia, get you actually contract it more often like in jail in control sort of settings in jails and it just the budget, since there.

153
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Is very treatment resistant to

154
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're here, you're all together here.

155
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

156
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So last time you were in this sort of space. I'm scared. It is such a pandemic.

157
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: They closed down the schools and all sports. It is that

158
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.040
Nicole Roybal: I've been though we have to go clean the school this weekend.

159
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:39.060
Nicole Roybal: And be around it. We don't know there's anything in the school. But what if there isn't, like we're going to take precaution, of course, but I'm just

160
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.740
Okay.

161
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's time I do a little reading. I'm wondering how

162
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: How

163
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: How much contact. So let's just see

164
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.300
How to get

165
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.530
Nicole Roybal: It on a surface for 12 days and now they're saying, three days. And I'm like, wow.

166
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I know right.

167
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.490
Nicole Roybal: I think it's 12 and they're just lying to us, it's me.

168
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that. See those differences, a surface versus

169
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: In the body. I think in the body can probably stay there dormant and no symptoms will show possibly for maybe what that might be what the differences is to the 12 days might be inside your body, you can live in there, happily,

170
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't have any symptoms, but on a surface. Maybe it sits there and dies after a few days. So I don't know. Let me just see.

171
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.860
Nicole Roybal: Wow, can you see. And I'm like, I'm like a like a like a pillow saying

172
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right, right. Alright, so

173
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.760
Nicole Roybal: It's not like a hard surface. So let's look at this together.

174
00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to look at this together. And if there's any list that needs to be made when you write them down, you write the list and then you're going to go do your day.

175
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Only so much we can do

176
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.450
Nicole Roybal: Both

177
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is from the Center for Disease Control, this would be your, this would be the place to go for that.

178
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You hear you checking out your hair.

179
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.550
Nicole Roybal: No, I'm here. I turned off my video so I can look into.

180
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.800
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I don't want my face to cause

181
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Disease can make any one sec, regardless of their race. Okay, so it's not contingent on anything like that for most people, immediate risk of becoming seriously ill from the blah blah blah is thought to be low.

182
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So the, the, the immediate risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus is thought to be low.

183
00:18:51.150 --> 00:19:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Older adults and people of any age with underlying health conditions such as diabetes lung disease or heart disease or at greater risk. Okay.

184
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Number four, there are simple things that you can do to help yourself and others, wash your hands, often with soap and water, so keep it under 1234 all the way to 20 it's actually the the the scrubbing them the friction that you create in here like this.

185
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That gets it off.

186
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the scrubbing around it, does it to the whole 20 seconds just be scrub, scrub, scrub in it.

187
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it says, look at that. So it says, wash your hands, often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after low and your nose.

188
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: coughing or sneezing, go to the bathroom and before eating or preparing preparing food. Avoid touching your eyes.

189
00:19:43.920 --> 00:20:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Void touching your nose and mouth with unwashed hands stay home when you're sick copper your cough or sneeze with a tissue. So here's what it doesn't say it doesn't say that what this germ is that it's sitting on your couch and it jumps up into your nose.

190
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.620
Nicole Roybal: It does do is it

191
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Is, let's say, so just now I'm conscious that I have these inches on my cheek and my nose. So I'm conscious of it. I happen to have literally just wash them.

192
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: But I also kind of do a little bit more more nail than I would something else. I'm not great at it. I should probably have a tissue over here and be using that more but my consciousness is there and it has to do with

193
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting my finger in my eyes, nose, or in my mouth. I'm going to be more conscious of that but that bug sitting on the armrest isn't gonna, it's not going to jump over on me. Okay.

194
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be Monaghan that as soon as I get up.

195
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I may want to wash my hands.

196
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.940
Nicole Roybal: Um, yeah.

197
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that seems cookie bird. But if you have people that aren't paying attention to it.

198
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to consider something like that. And then when you go visit your grandparents, you may decide the very last thing I'm going to do.

199
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Is I'm going to put fresh clothes on.

200
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may even decide to keep keep close there. Those are the clothes you wear when you're with them. The you leave them there by the side of the door. That's what you put on. That's what you were when you're there.

201
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you're not bringing anything new in with you that could land somewhere. And that might seem like overkill, or maybe you'll like it. Maybe you'll say, well, I feel more confident when I do that.

202
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: This makes me sort of feel like I'm doing everything I can. I leave my shoes there. I already have clothes. I have this certain little sweat pants and shirt that I leave there and I were that when I'm over there.

203
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.120
Nicole Roybal: That's very, very smart home, Ohio.

204
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like right anything you're bringing from the insight and the as soon as you walk in, right. You've changed your clothes, you've washed your hands and now you're ready to sort of hang out with them.

205
00:21:50.460 --> 00:22:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so let's just see, I'm in fact number five, it says you can help stop the virus by knowing the signs fever, cough, and they were saying it's a dry cough. Not that congested one where we actually have flam okay that's

206
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: A cough. Now really, that was funny.

207
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.970
Nicole Roybal: I know I just SMOKERS CALL.

208
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because that's a different cost. So you got off and then shortness of breath, then you would seek medical advice. Okay.

209
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:21.090
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

210
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see. You didn't have to do to fill up some tips and have been in close contact with the person known to have it or live in or have recently traveled from an area was ongoing spread call ahead before you go to a doctor's office or

211
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: She I would not want to go to an emergency, I would not right now.

212
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.740
Nicole Roybal: Right, so I wouldn't know.

213
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Wouldn't wouldn't tell them about your present traveler centers. Okay, someone goes to quarantine for updates.

214
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it doesn't say that. How long this virus sits on a surface doesn't let me just see.

215
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.180
How to prepare

216
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Know the signs limit visitors limit movement in the community. STAY HOME WHEN YOU CAN when you're sick take steps for those at high risk. Alright, so that's that's what you're talking about.

217
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. She's steps to prevent getting sick.

218
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Heart disease, diabetes, lung disease. Alright, people who may be at high risk.

219
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What to do if you are sick how get your household ready. Let me just see.

220
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Your if you are a higher risk for this because of your age extra important so stock up on supplies take everyday precautions to keep your

221
00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Space between years. Oh, so you don't want it. You want to say, Grandma, I love you, but I want to be sure. And normally I give you a kiss on the cheek. I'm going to not

222
00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.780
Nicole Roybal: Always give me a kiss on the cheek.

223
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: But that that's here that's really close. So then all I do is I do this and it goes to my lips. That's really close.

224
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:12.420
Nicole Roybal: To the mountain.

225
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. That's close

226
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.830
Nicole Roybal: That's exactly where it gets them.

227
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you may want to tell them, hey, I want to give you kisses. I missed you guys so much. Um, but I'm concerned, I need to protect you a little bit more because I never know because you might be, you might have that and not know it because if the symptoms won't show and a healthy person.

228
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.550
Nicole Roybal: Exactly.

229
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you can maybe change that that might feel like you're in a little bit more control, you could say, Okay, I gotta cut back on the affection and I know it sucks.

230
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, okay. So when you go in public. Keep away from others who are sick limit limit your clothes contacts, you're already doing the handwashing avoid crowds really don't want to be in a group of people

231
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.650
Nicole Roybal: Don't want to cruise

232
00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay home. Okay, so have supplies on hand, contact your health care provider about 20 extra dough. So that's something good. Make sure that grandparents have all their medication.

233
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.020
Nicole Roybal: Hmm.

234
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Doctors are probably going to be more open to giving you know TWO MONTHS SUPPLY. That makes sense.

235
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.030
Nicole Roybal: Right, okay.

236
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:28.920
Gwenevere Abriel: They're going to be more open to it. Everybody understands that. I mean, I was able to cancel flights hotel reservations, a whole training everybody's like, that's fine. That's fine. I'm not charging me for anything because

237
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Everybody. Yeah, we're all going through this

238
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.400
Yeah.

239
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.020
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

240
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have have enough how so household supplies groceries. What does it say clean your hands. Wash your hands of water where you got that one.

241
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Oh, here we go. And we're getting somewhere. To see if let's see about this, to the extent possible, avoid touching high touch surfaces in public places like buttons on an elevator. Right.

242
00:25:54.210 --> 00:26:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm door handles. That's when you want to have a little, a little, maybe a bag in a Ziploc bag of tissues with you that you can touch handles with or use like your I I'm kind of a knuckle to kind of go drink when I'm out. I already do these habits, though so already.

243
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.110
Nicole Roybal: I am. I've been trying to work gloves, and I actually like go to like the storing thing.

244
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.550
Nicole Roybal: So what's

245
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What's interesting about gloves. Is this if you use the same as a hand if you touch something with the glove and the glove makes its way home.

246
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Then they

247
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.760
Nicole Roybal: Are, knocking them off as soon as I get back in the car.

248
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:33.780
Nicole Roybal: For

249
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.540
Nicole Roybal: Once I open the door handle I take them off.

250
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Careful. Um, let's see. Avoid eyes, nose there we've got

251
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.330
Nicole Roybal: To try as hard to do. I always touch my face, you know, as I sit here like this with my hat on. I know.

252
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't see you, because I'm on your picture right now.

253
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.990
Nicole Roybal: I know. Sorry, I forgot because I like this and I'm looking at the phone. I don't want to be close to

254
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You why

255
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking at the list.

256
00:26:59.400 --> 00:26:59.820
Yeah.

257
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: clean and disinfect your home to remove your access. We're going to do with the school.

258
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.400
Nicole Roybal: My

259
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Routine cleaning of frequently touch services tables door knobs light switches handles desk toilets faucet sinks cell phone so yeah about every day I run my my am the people that will let me do it.

Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so

264
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Especially in poorly mentally places.

265
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Within settings.

266
00:27:50.820 --> 00:28:00.570
Nicole Roybal: And then I have that appointment on Tuesday. And I'm kind of scared to go to any doctors office, you know. Yeah. So I'm not sure I should do about that either.

267
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:08.730
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, we can we can talk about that a little bit. I wish it would tell me how long it sits on a surface.

268
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe they don't know

269
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: See how long does co because everybody will benefit from this once I get it, I can share it.

270
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Nude is stable for hours on surfaces NIH. Let me see what they say. That's a reputable

271
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Source National Institute of Health, the virus that causes that is stable for several hours to days in aerosols and on services aerosols is in the air.

272
00:28:50.460 --> 00:29:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Quote into a new study from principally boo boo do have found that several acute sin de de de was detectable in Canada for up to three hours for up to four hours on copper

273
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to 24 hours on cardboard up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Okay. So sounds like on the toaster.

274
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: toaster and your stainless steel stuff. It might sit there happily for a whole day. No, wait for three days on plastic and stainless steel.

275
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:22.080
Okay.

276
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

277
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's still not, that's not like Murcia that's days are once

278
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This is at least it's just a few days.

279
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.230
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

280
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but if you're running through and wiping things down or boiling them getting really hot. I would think that would clean. I gotta find out about that boiling

281
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:54.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see, suggest that people may acquire baba baba through the air and after touching contaminated objects and studying for was widely shared. Yeah, but do from the blah blah blah compared hound, see what else it says

282
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I wanted, I wanted to know how long it stayed on surfaces. So the

283
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Most like three days.

284
00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: How long has it been since they were kids in the school.

285
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.550
Nicole Roybal: Um, when did they shut down the schools last week.

286
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.470
Nicole Roybal: Thursday.

287
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopefully that

288
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: That that should help you feel a little better.

289
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:27.420
Nicole Roybal: Oh yeah, right. But then they've had the admin has still been going in and they take their little kids there with them are like are you stupid. We haven't cleaned was clear. Why are you gonna bring kids with you. I know.

290
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not thinking

291
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you know what, it's hard to call. We don't have money for babysitters we don't have this is a very complex event that's happening.

292
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:47.400
Nicole Roybal: I know that's what I was seeing like they probably don't have a babysitter. So they have to take them. But it's like okay hold on let them use the kids bathrooms. We already sanitized those I don't use the adult restaurant. I know.

293
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.110
Nicole Roybal: Sorry.

294
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.240
Nicole Roybal: My parents

295
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I know we're just doing the best we can, um,

296
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: people infected with ideas without recognizer prior to blah, blah, blah. I

297
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.350
Nicole Roybal: Need to get it through the air.

298
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:08.850
Nicole Roybal: And all that

299
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the air that's this. That's, um, if I sneeze. It goes like this.

300
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what they mean.

301
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.690
Okay.

302
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It means when when we speak, where there's a little bit of moisture. It is sits in there. That's all they're saying

303
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.920
Nicole Roybal: So if you were someone had it and they like just on you, you get it.

304
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.460
I'm not gonna say you'd get it.

305
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: We rather do this I would rather say there's moisture in your breath, and it may sit on that moisture may sit in there. So when you're that's aerosol that's through the air.

306
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's my interpretation. I'm not an expert. I'm reading this the same way you are.

307
00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:13.170
Gwenevere Abriel: No, yeah, using and coughing that's aerosol is through the air. So I would say that's where it's going to be transported. So that's why, right, there's a little bit of moisture on a kiss. When you kiss grandparents your, you may be putting it on their cheek out that you have it up but

308
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're minimizing the risk

309
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: By pulling back on. We're going to stay back five feet. We're going to stay back a little bit.

310
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: But I would tell them you're doing that because I mean I know if I was a Nana, I'd be like, why is it my granddaughter kissing me

311
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.050
Right.

312
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Color

313
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.720
Gwenevere Abriel: It's to protect her.

314
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.430
Nicole Roybal: Right, yeah.

315
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.320
Nicole Roybal: Cuz you know serious this is.

316
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Honestly, with your family. I would say things out loud.

317
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:43.890
Nicole Roybal: I know

318
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so yeah. What else anything else interesting here touching eyes. Keep those hands off your eyes.

319
00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Cover your sneezes religious you're in the trash.

320
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

321
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.630
Nicole Roybal: Now mammals like once or do it again. Okay.

322
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you, it's going to be the it's going to be touching the face all the time because that that that is something so

323
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But then you you adjust to say, well, I tend to touch my face when my hairstyles down because I'm taking the whisper and and moving it know with this hairstyling out today. And this one.

324
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing this.

325
00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: All the time.

326
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:26.400
Nicole Roybal: Yep, constant

327
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But if I think the one where I have it in a button on my head, I'm not doing it.

328
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So see how your hairs down today, you may say, you know what I'm going to minimize all the stuff and I'm going to have it. I'm going to do the button we do the pigtail ponytail. Do it up cute. Oh, you can do with your little your little

329
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Adorable.

330
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:54.750
Nicole Roybal: The thing is my things are always download, so no matter what I'm going like that to them. Yeah, I always have them down.

331
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now, think about how you were feeling when we first started, and now how you're feeling since we got a few other facts.

332
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.690
Nicole Roybal: I feel a little bit more like

333
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.510
Nicole Roybal: What is that word like more

334
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:15.900
Nicole Roybal: Not really more like I guess it's secure. So I was being insecure about it. So now I like a more

335
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:28.710
Nicole Roybal: Aware and what to do. And yeah, I haven't seen it on the news all the time, but I guess it scares me. So I kind of like don't listen, even though I'm listening goes in one ear and out the other because I'm scared. I don't want to hear.

336
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:33.750
Nicole Roybal: But, um, but, yeah, I'm definitely right after we're done. I'm gonna go clean all the handles.

337
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.050
Nicole Roybal: freakin toaster oven.

338
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.540
Nicole Roybal: metal and plastic that's crazy.

339
00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.410
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, to your question, I feel more secure. Okay, good.

340
00:34:49.680 --> 00:35:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And all I did was getting informed sometimes that's the skill is, well, I don't know what I don't know. Let me just see if I'm making this up. And that's the same exact thing I did with your grandma and grandpa to you were making up a story and I know you're probably right.

341
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, it does something else to have said it out loud because you know you did everything you could to get that information from them, Grandma, I'm putting you at risk coming here because I'm bringing out contagion from the outside world and bringing it here.

342
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I would be mortified. If I were the one. Now there's there's actually no way for you to know. There's no way for you to know that you were the one that brought it in, even though

343
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no way for you to know.

344
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:35.790
Nicole Roybal: That I blame me.

345
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the part that I worry about is that one.

346
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.460
Mm hmm.

347
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.720
Nicole Roybal: Wasn't very little officially

348
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:49.920
Nicole Roybal: Just glad that I'm at their house every day because that's what keeps me away from

349
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.280
Nicole Roybal: Drinking and all that. Like it's it's been hard.

350
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:55.920
Nicole Roybal: Stressing

351
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's complicated. It's not just one thing is it

352
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: For all but you're not going through this alone. We're all we all are. It doesn't discriminate on wealth. It doesn't discriminate socio economic status doesn't. It's basically the only thing it discriminates on is right, your age.

353
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You're

354
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: At

355
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Or your or your kind of, you know, a little learn how a compromised immune system.

356
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:41.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But you and I may get it and we won't even know we're going to get it. And our immune system will handle it and we'll move on. But we can still carry it and be bringing it in so continue to be careful and then that's it you're thinking about it.

357
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have magic.

358
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.980
Nicole Roybal: Just like your body capacity and how come so much. People are dying.

359
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no, I'll take me if my body.

360
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: can treat it on its own. The same way it does a cold, same way it does. I'm constantly meeting infection all day long. We're constantly fighting off infection.

361
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: White blood cells right we're fighting infection, all the time. And by the way, we create cancer all the time to just, you know, that

362
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.170
Nicole Roybal: Would have been created.

363
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't come from a star.

364
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.040
Nicole Roybal: Burger body on its own.

365
00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it doesn't metastasize into anything. It's already happening. Our body handles things beautifully. It handles it just fine. It knows just what to do but watch just because I get I handle and resolve my cold on my own, or the virus. Right.

366
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm I still have it in my bloodstream. I still have it here, my immune system handled it. But I can still sneeze and pass it to someone else and they their immune system isn't isn't really that good right now. Maybe they have heart disease.

367
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And their immune system doesn't handle it. I don't pass along my good immune system to them. I'm only passing the germ.

368
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.830
Nicole Roybal: That's true. Okay, I get it. Okay, there we go.

369
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're still a carrier, even though you're healthy

370
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: They say, oh, I'm not coughing, I'm fine. That's why children are not supposed to be going out into the community because they're fine. But they're passing it around.

371
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:38.670
Nicole Roybal: Oh, crap. I know. And everyone's just from taking their kids to the park and everything and then play on the playground at the apartments. I'm just like, why do you have them out.

372
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, they're bored out of their minds. That's why.

373
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:45.150
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I get it, I get it. I really do. But

374
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:50.040
Nicole Roybal: Do some activities at home that doesn't like some

375
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:52.380
Nicole Roybal: Something I don't know.

376
00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.420
Nicole Roybal: Coloring Books actually books. I don't play some games with them.

377
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The same could be said about

378
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Your boredom and your temptation for wanting to drink wine or to get a coloring book, why don't you do an activity inside. It's hard.

379
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.510
Nicole Roybal: That's what, that's how you

380
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to move around. We want to something novel. We want something interesting.

381
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We like that our brain likes that.

382
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.050
Nicole Roybal: Yeah yeah and

383
00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Protecting your recovery likes that to it wants to stay distracted.

384
00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.190
So,

385
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.010
Let's talk about that a little bit.

386
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.740
Nicole Roybal: That's very true. Yeah, that's all I do all day is trying to distract myself so

387
00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me in a little bit about what the statuses with Daniel right

389
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:30.330
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, we were moving all last weekend and I know moving stuff it's it's frustrating, it's a frustrating process.

390
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:38.850
Nicole Roybal: You just mean like the whole time. Like, I would just be talking to him normal any it's like every time you talk to me about anything. He was just take the attitude.

391
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:46.470
Nicole Roybal: And just do me and I was like, What the hell's wrong with you. Why are you being so mean to me. I'm literally like not doing that I'm helping you.

392
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.650
Nicole Roybal: And like we go to the apartment and I'm packing up the kitchen. He's like, what's your area. So you just sitting there doing nothing.

393
00:40:53.610 --> 00:41:01.980
Nicole Roybal: As I'm packing up the kitchen. I'm like, Well, I don't know. Newspapers split between these and like he was just, I don't know. He's been awful thing so many teeth for no reason.

394
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:14.670
Nicole Roybal: And then finally, the last time I was there. We're getting along all day we're doing great finally went to bed. Happy getting along. And then I was snoring and he got pissed off at, me so sorry, anyway.

395
00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:26.250
Nicole Roybal: And he was mad at me all day about it so snoring. That's good. That's something I can't control. I'll try to attend like maybe my head hires THING, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M SORRY IT freakin smart.

396
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:32.430
Nicole Roybal: And so yeah, he's just, I'm so tired of him getting mad for nothing.

397
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:37.710
Nicole Roybal: So I finally like bark back. I am really Dave, I told him I

398
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:49.350
Nicole Roybal: Like, you don't need to talk to me like this. I'm not getting nothing wrong to you. I've been being nice. I'm not drinking. I'm not doing anything wrong with the fuck is wrong with you and I think I parked back. He's like, Don't talk to me like that without

399
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:58.530
Nicole Roybal: Like I'm so tired of not being able to stand up for myself, because you're going to get mad because I yelled, or that's bullshit already going to send up for myself and just

400
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:11.850
Nicole Roybal: Honestly, listened and that's when he started being nice to me. We're getting along, but he was just like oh shit she finally opened up her voice. Yeah. And the shut up something

401
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, well, right, that doesn't quite match the sort of ideal way of communicating, but there was this sense of speaking up for yourself what you do then when you what you call stood up for yourself.

402
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.990
Nicole Roybal: Yeah I know best I could do

403
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:33.870
Nicole Roybal: She

404
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:45.300
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, honestly, I said all that, and I walked outside to smoke cigarettes and then when I came back in. He was just quiet watching TV and say nothing. And then we just

405
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.830
Nicole Roybal: Started talking about something, some other conversation. I don't know if

406
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You remember your part, but you don't remember whether it worked.

407
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.130
Yeah.

408
00:42:58.530 --> 00:42:59.010
Nicole Roybal: Cuz I

409
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:06.210
Nicole Roybal: Deep down, I probably know it didn't work. It only worked for the moment, but

410
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:16.740
Nicole Roybal: In the front of my mind, I'm thinking like, oh, it worked. I hope so. Like I wanted it to work. I finally did something, but deep down I don't think

411
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:23.160
Nicole Roybal: So I guess that's where I'm having a hard time looking inward on that.

412
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you stay overnight again.

413
00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:36.240
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, knows the night that was sorry I was last night I stayed there.

414
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we don't know. Now, in and of itself, is it okay if he hadn't complained about the snoring if he got up and slept on the couch and then you had breakfast and the day went on without have been okay

415
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.660
Nicole Roybal: Well, you had work the next day. No.

416
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.790
Nicole Roybal: Listen. Oh, sorry. Okay.

417
00:43:53.910 --> 00:44:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: He had gotten up in the morning went about his day, but in the middle of the night when you heard your story and you went out on the couch, and he slept. The next day you get up.

418
00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You did not complain. Would that be okay with you.

419
00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:14.310
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, because you didn't friggin yell at me and you know pissed off over nothing or something I hadn't control.

420
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. They ain't nothing eight so he needs to sleep. So do you

421
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's the complaining. That's what I'm trying to get out. Is it okay did he take care of himself and get some sleep.

422
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's the complaining

423
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.600
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, especially if

424
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You live with someone who needed to get up and sleep in the other room but didn't make you feel like crap about it.

425
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.690
Nicole Roybal: For me,

426
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

427
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wanted to check because like

428
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you can't sleep, you can't sleep. We have to sleep.

429
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:00.420
Yeah.

430
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.680
Nicole Roybal: Especially when you have to get up at four in the morning.

431
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

432
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you want to do with your doctor's appointment. When is it

433
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.160
Nicole Roybal: On Tuesday at 2pm

434
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:27.060
Nicole Roybal: Not sure. I don't know what they are. So that's been on my mind a lot. See, I'm not sure I should do it that I don't know if I should go. I feel like

435
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.750
Nicole Roybal: I should go to the women's wellness.

436
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.240
Nicole Roybal: Exam or whatever it's called.

437
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.450
Nicole Roybal: But I don't need to go to the physical

438
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Why women's wellness. Now they're on thinking to do a vaginal exam.

439
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's

440
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.990
Nicole Roybal: even scarier. I haven't had a pap smear, and like five years.

441
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:55.440
Nicole Roybal: And now I finally actually scheduled an appointment and when those ones. Next time I'll find out again.

442
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.130
Nicole Roybal: What is

443
00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What is well okay so let's face it on your belief. So what is this. This is the same thing and it's you getting information. What if you

444
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: call and say, I'd like to talk to a nurse practitioner on about my risk. I haven't seen someone in five years and had a pap smear I both want to take care of myself and I want to be cautious.

445
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I speak with a nurse practitioner who can tell me about what my risk is of contracting it through a gynecological exam.

446
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Just get information first

447
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:28.350
Nicole Roybal: Okay.

448
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Same with your doctor's office because they may be doing some things extra precaution to so that because they want to stay in business as well.

449
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.160
Nicole Roybal: Sure. I know, right. So,

450
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And and and the truth of the matter is, uncle, I don't have the answer. So a part of me is like,

451
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to get these exams. I have no idea if you're putting yourself at risk. I couldn't tell you what to do. You're going to have to make that decision. So maybe getting

452
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:10.200
Nicole Roybal: I wanted to know if you're okay with that focus. You're the one that wanted me to get a physical so you can get that information.

453
00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You need about what your, your physical health is things like that.

454
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:24.030
Nicole Roybal: So I don't want to. That's another thing that's why I'm like kind of

455
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.470
Nicole Roybal: I don't want to cancel it. I don't want you to get upset with me.

456
00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I wouldn't be this is these are really. First of all, it was you making the call scheduling the appointment, those were really important tasks and you did it.

457
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.170
Nicole Roybal: Mm hmm.

458
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not about disappointment in you. It's about this is a tough decision. It's far more complicated than that.

459
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Under if your excuse was I slept in.

460
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.000
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

461
00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's irresponsibility. That's not going to support accountability in recovery for you if you you're doing the parts that are necessary for self care. This is about

462
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I putting myself at risk. This is different.

463
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.150
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, okay. Yeah.

464
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to be disappointed in you. No, thank you.

465
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.270
Nicole Roybal: I appreciate that. I know it sounds like I don't want it set one

466
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:38.700
Nicole Roybal: He doesn't go

467
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Off and say, hey,

468
00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to reschedule them for a month or two months for whatever works for you. And then guess what you can reassess then

469
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's common people reschedule it push things forward. Are they maybe they're on an early waitlist like, hey, I want to see right away, put me on a waitlist

470
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So nothing wrong with that. Just get some information.

471
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're still I'm hearing you say.

472
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're experiencing thoughts of wanting to drink. How, how many times a day.

473
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.680
Nicole Roybal: Not much, just because it's probably

474
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:22.410
Nicole Roybal: It's probably cuz I've been at my mom's

475
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:24.540
Nicole Roybal: Last couple days.

476
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Number may have a number

477
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:30.000
Nicole Roybal: Um, did maybe just like twice.

478
00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:36.570
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, and I just make myself and think of something else I may do something else. I'll start cleaning just oh

479
00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:58.200
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, it's not, of course, it's hard but I've been doing it for months now. So I feel like it's just like my brain is getting into like the habit of okay well I don't do that. Don't do that. Over here, over here, so I not easy, but it's I'm getting used to it. I guess what I

480
00:49:59.310 --> 00:49:59.760
Nicole Roybal: Mean

481
00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:02.520
Nicole Roybal: By

482
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: The milligrams of

483
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.700

491
00:50:52.290 --> 00:51:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that you're only off by looks like to 200 milligrams and but that's because we are going off on by 200

492
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.290
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I'm plus I was an idiot. And I didn't know how to count.

493
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's what I'm trying to say is

494
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Our initial number was off. That's why this whole chart that I have. I typed up over here is off by 200 so you're really on time. Okay.

495
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.960
