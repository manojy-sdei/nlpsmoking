Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what was it couldn't take anymore. What was it

39
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.560
Jay: Well I, I was expecting that she was cheating on me with her ex, the one that I got in a fight with

40
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.640
Jay: Yeah. And after that fight that really threw everything into perspective for me so I kind of said, well, she fell for it.

41
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.410
Jay: That's history.

42
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.790
Looks

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

44
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.360
Jay: This whole time she's been trying, she was really accountable with Facebook trying to contact me and I wasn't you.

45
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I know.

46
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying she's still trying to get back with you.

47
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.660
Jay: Know, before that she was trying to set me up.

48
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.060
Jay: Make sure we could create different profiles with different girls.

49
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, she that's getting complicated

50

Jay: She has crazy

51
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Complicated that's very complicated. Yeah, I can't track all that

52
00:04:49.320 --> 00:05:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me think about how I mean when we're in a relationship, it's hard enough to navigate what I'm supposed to do feel saying communicate and then I got it. Like, I can't even trust that they're not trying to get me less too much.

53
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't track on that.

54
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.660
Jay: As well. I walked away. I'm like, I'm cool. Okay.

55
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what's interesting, though, even though you walked away.

56
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: It can still hurt.

57
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.140
Jay: Yeah hurts my feelings.

58
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why that is. You are the breaker over but you're hurting. Do you know why.

59
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.010
Jay: Because of the situation, the way she went down.

60
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The cheating. The How dare she do it kind of thing.

61
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.120
Jay: Yeah. Like, come on.

Gwenevere Abriel: So if you're eating. Can I eat too.

63
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

64
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You can always tell me know if you find it inappropriate but I am so hungry. I just

65
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.480
Jay: Whenever it comes if I don't eat.

66
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.960
Jay: Dinner, it'll go away and I won't be able to eat because I keep going.

67
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. You gotta go with it. Do it. When the hungers present. Well, it's 316 for me over here and I haven't had a bite. So I'm really hurting

68
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.220
Jay: Or yeah, go ahead. You go

69
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll have a little meal, what you mean.

70
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.150
When

71
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I got to look up and see if a pickle.

72
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a fruit. If it has the the good fermented effect. I gotta look that up because I love pickles and this is same as eating that nasty cabbage relish Kabuki crap. I mean,

73
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I love pickles.

74
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Pickles. Pickles, are they

75
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Considered

76
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.770
Jay: My mom hates them.

77
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.770
Jay: My mom and my dad.

78
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: More for you. That's great.

79
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.210
Jay: Well for me, let me show you the George

80
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice, nice. Costco size.

81
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.850
Jay: Them off.

82
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:30.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there's growing interest in the documented health. Listen to this. So there's a growing interest in documented health benefits of fermented food that's why I'm bringing this topic up because you got all kinds of gastrointestinal stuff with you. Right.

83
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:31.740
Jay: Mm hmm.

84
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm talking about it and it's like a really trendy cool thing to to be mindful of what we're our gut brain access our gut biome microbiome, we're learning more and more about it. So there's growing interest in the documented.

85
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, health benefits are fermented foods like sauerkraut kimchi yogurt and can boot up some fermented foods are pickled and some pickles are fermented

86
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know.

87
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, wait a minute. Well, which pickles on what

88
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.680
Jay: We're all fermented

89
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know where this made it sound like they all are all the same. All pickles are not the same.

90
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.700
Jay: Okay.

91
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: A pickle is simply a food that's been preserved in a brine a salt or salty water or an acid like vinegar or lemon juice.

92
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the difference between fermenting and pickling

93
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.180
Jay: Vinegar.

94
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay well

95
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.590
Jay: With water. I think

96
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So a fermented food has been preserved and transformed by benign bacteria. That's what we want. We want the good bugs in our guts. Okay.

97
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what we want. So when you're looking at that, that bottle you just had. I want to look in there. So usually, this means that the sugars and carbohydrates.

98
00:08:50.970 --> 00:09:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Present in the food have been eaten by the good bacteria often lack this lactic acid bacteria. The bacteria then convert the sugar.

99
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Into other substances like acids carbon dioxide and alcohol for the last one of those substances in term preserve the food and add to its flavor. So when we eat say kimchi it you consume the flourishing colony of good bacteria that has preserved the cabbage for you circle of life.

100
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

101
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.140
That's great.

102
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So how do you know we just said that a pickle is just a food that's been preserved with Brian Well, many fermented foods. Start with exactly that Brian

103
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So they're also pickled fermented pickles sauerkraut, for instance, is made by packing cabbage was salt and letting it ferment traditional dill pickles are made by fermenting cucumbers in salty water.

104
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So I wonder

105
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if that one's really fermented

106
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.250
Jay: When did it.

107
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.370
Jay: When did it become vinegar.

108
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.250
Jay: Because my grandma used to pick up everything and

109
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you have a choice. So it says traditional there might be pickling pickled pillows. I don't know, I just, I don't know, traditional

110
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:29.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't pick dill pickles are made by fermenting cucumbers and salty water Kim, she can be made with a bunch of delicious things like cabbage radish garlic anchovy and chili but salt is the essential

111
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do traditional dill pickles and sauerkraut tastes so tart. If they're not made with vinegar. One of the substances bacteria produced during fermentation is acid. That means that many fermented food end up tasting very acidic, AND WE WANT THAT WANT IT WANT IT WANT IT

112
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:56.130
Jay: They said with this movie ID 19 that the acidic foods and helps to fight it.

113
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:07.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but do you see that it's not directly the acidic food. It's probably the gut. Watch this happy. It's got the budget lights.

114
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's got this fabulous bacteria. And it's like, oh sorry, and it's creepy best and we're continuing to feed that bacteria with

115
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: raw cabbage and Brussels sprouts and all of the things that it needs to live on. And then we have a happy guy. We have a happy gut our immune system works better. And guess what, asked, we get to kick corona.

116
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I see it all all circle of life right there.

117
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.350
Jay: Yeah.

118
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: All starts with a good book. So I'm check that pickle jar and see if it's got i don't know i'm still don't get the Pickles. Pickles, a pickle, but

119
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.480
Jay: Ingredients cucumber water.

120
00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.780
Jay: Alone.

121
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.160
Jay: Natural flavoring.

122
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.220
Jay: benzo

123
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.430
Jay: sorbet.

124
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.130
Jay: Yeah, preservatives.

125
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.340
Jay: 360 milligrams

126
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

127
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Not all pickles are fermented exclamation mark.

128
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:38.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You can also make pickles by pouring pot vinegar over vegetables those quick pickles, which include many commercial varieties are usually not fermented

129
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: For instance, you would never think of sauerkraut sourdough bread or beer or yogurt as a pickle. Not all from in foods or you know what you lose me I'm getting lost here with this.

130
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.240
Was this one.

131
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Best Made sour pickles.

132
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.170
Jay: bowl of cereal real quick.

133
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

134
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Way the best pickles. Let me see something these fermented pickles are just sour enough to taste like a pickle.

135
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I looked up yours. I couldn't find out if it was fermented or not.

136
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

137
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.950
No, I couldn't tell.

138
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so

Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, there's a lot of variety out there.

141
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing a lot of talking

142
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Not a lot of eating.

143
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.470
Jay: This thing has a little QR reader.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

145
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.530
Jay: Yeah, I don't know if it does you any good.

146
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, oh, oh, you mean I'm

147
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, Oh, that's funny that does me no good. Yeah, I'm not a target scanner.

148
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:51.870
Yeah.

149
00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I looked, I looked up your brand and just didn't talk within information. But the bottom line is, yes, fermented foods, who want to keep our eye out for that. And we want to be eating the raw vegetables, not in and of itself, but they feed the healthy bacteria.

150
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We got a little Zoo going on in there.

151
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.030
Jay: That's good.

152
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel bad for the transcription is right now she's gonna be like a

153
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Pig.

154
00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they

155
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And then they talked about me.

156
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.700
Jay: One of those demons.

157
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.430
Jay: It's not Monday. Is it

158
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: My weeks go by so fast. If you said listen

159
00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's Monday, I'd be like, all right, I'll see you on Tuesday. That's fine. So yeah, I'll see you on Tuesday. Because it goes by, like this, you'll

160
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.660
Jay: Lose your days.

161
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.090
Jay: I thought we were still in the intimate merchants to be

162
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I believe you. I

163
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.200
Jay: Somebody asked what day or

164
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:29.850
Jay: Would you grab my phone. I was like, I think it's like the 28th. And they looked at me, how stupid I was like

165
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.750
Jay: Was a Family Dollar. He was funny.

166
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.410
Jay: There was like 12 people in line. So they all laughed at me.

167
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't get

168
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Money.

169
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Get more, you know, professional for a second.

170
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of my teeth and be professional now.

171
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What are we meeting or meeting. What time is it over there.

172
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys are one ish

173
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Ish.

174
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

175
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the things that people do. And I know. And I just want to play around with this idea with you, um,

176
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What if

177
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't start a romantic relationship for a year.

178
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you said, what if there are things about myself that I don't know what if there's healing that needs to be done in order for me to attract another healthy person.

179
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What if a recognize my boundaries, my limitations easier if I do the work for them randomly saying a year it's random somewhat

180
00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: But I could do this work and then I'll go visit this idea, then I'll have done the work I'll have this other thing to share to another human being and it might turn out better

181
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:13.380
Jay: Hey,

182
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.870
Jay: I might be going back to prison.

183
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me that. Tell me about your concern there. What makes you think that

184
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:30.150
Jay: I'm a three time offender. Now, this is my third time in so they're going to try to max me out. They maxed out last time. My second and so

185
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.900
Jay: They offered me nine and a half years, the other day.

186
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.020
Jay: And it's just for that check with my sister.

187
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.750
Jay: But they're trying. They're trying to screw me

188
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.610
Jay: It's because of my past because I have a record.

189
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:56.220
Jay: So, I mean, that's what I'm facing if I lose. I mean, I'm facing 18 and a half years. But there's been on a journey and the Mexico. That's going to give me 18 and a half years for checks, but

190
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:05.280
Jay: The nine and a half years. They're crazy, even if I lose. I think they'll give me four years, and I'll have to do to. That's what I think.

191
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you say nine and a half years. As if. Hey, can I go get some Syria, would you mind.

192
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's not the same. I feel like sick.

193
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm been listening to you, you are sick, like you're physically sick.

194
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I mean,

195
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, I hope that doesn't happen.

196
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Some assets. Some evidence some positives.

197
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That could be present in that courtroom.

198
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:11.670
Jay: My sister is going to go until she's gonna take the stand and you know if my attorney. Ask the right questions. That's what we're worried about is, is he can ask the right questions.

199
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.410
Jay: If he asked the right questions to my sister and her husband.

200
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.590
Jay: Then they'll dismiss the charges. I guarantee it.

201
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Who's an attorney worse or the opposing counsel.

202
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.380
Jay: Know mine.

203
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.070
How does

204
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your attorney not ask the right questions. What kind of dodo bird doesn't ask what you want them to

205
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.660
Jay: Win. I've been doing this for a lot of lot of years and I've seen a lot of crazy stuff.

206
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:45.900
Jay: Really Yeah, they'll trade me off for the next case just because I'm a three time offender. They'll trade me off in and let me be guilty.

207
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.070
Jay: Just so that they can

208
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:48.990
Jay: Get a win on the next one.

209
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Out. Oh my gosh, that's so ugly.

210
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.780
Jay: I've seen it. I've been

211
00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:00.570
Jay: To happen last time I should have only got four years. Last time, and they gave me 16

212
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:06.870
Jay: And that's because I signed a plea and the DA talk to judge into giving me

213
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.020
Jay: 16 easy

214
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:11.790
So,

215
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's my first thought when I heard that and you take it where you want

216
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: How easy is it to do that to a person to a man

217
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: When there's few eyes on the case, how much easier is it to for you to be a number for this fellow, or this gals caseload to look like this, or they get well I'll this guy is a loser. Anyway, screw them.

218
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You get them out to me. But this one's a first time offender. Now this one, please just get probation. So if the eyes were on your case my eyes.

219
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people's eyes.

220
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How likely is it that this attorney would misrepresent you

221
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about it more eyes on their more pressured to do the right thing. You see that. Do you agree.

222
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I do so I'm fed right now. That's what I'm thinking about. I'm just like, this is like some sun Sentinel shit like I'd be like, I want to call the paper. You know what I mean, like, that's where my mind's going

223
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I think about I think about how when kids are pulled into

224
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The social system, you know, the like department children and families. You guys see why FD you pull them in one of the things they kind of look at is they go

225
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Are they out in the community. Are they in sports to other people see these children, and do they see how that child is doing their eyes they check. They do collateral information.

226
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: As part of what they do for their investigation and all of a sudden I started to think about you, right, then I was like, maybe this guy might do the right thing. If he knew they were eyes on the case.

227
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:57.300
Jay: Hey,

228
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know who those eyes are but just let that sit in that big brain years just be thinking

229
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You want it out, this wouldn't be the time for shame for investment up

230
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We want pressure on do the right thing.

231
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not a lost cause I'm a man. I'm a human.

232
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.990
Jay: rights attorney seems like he's willing to

233
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.030
Jay: To fight for me.

234
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.910
Jay: But

235
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.580
Jay: I don't know, I've been fooled before

236
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what is your sister getting on the stand.

237
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

238
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: So how is it that if your sister knew

239
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: How to redirect the conversation she couldn't squeeze in the information she needed said out loud.

240
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.080
Jay: Oh, she's gonna try

241
00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:02.640
Jay: We we've talked about it with my lawyer, we've we've tried to, you know, get a game plan going because

242
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:12.000
Jay: You know, my sister went to the PD and asked to drop the charges after she found out that it was me a folder that it would have to go to court.

243
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:20.820
Jay: And they would be able to just dismiss it at my first quarter. Well, we went. They didn't dismiss it. The bounded over the district, you know, facing all this time.

244
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:30.000
Jay: So if my attorney asked him, you know if if you guys were home and he asked to borrow the money would you lend it to her. She's going to tell them. Yeah.

245
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:38.820
Jay: You know I'm saying, and then he's gonna ask him, did he pay you back and my sister is going to say yes he paid me back. You know what I mean.

246
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:39.930
Jay: So, it

247
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.090
Jay: It was $120

248
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:53.460
Jay: But it was yeah I bought a floor jack for my trunk. I was working on my truck. They were in Florida, and I couldn't reach them. So they have let me use their checks before

249
00:24:54.150 --> 00:25:03.270
Jay: So I went and I got a check and I went by the floor jack. Well, the ticket. I took was from an account. That was my brother in law that they were no longer using

250
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:17.130
Jay: They didn't know that those checks were in the same cabinet. So I just grabbed the checkbook. You know what I mean, I didn't look at them. I didn't. And it was a new one. So I got the first. Rock top and I put it back and

251
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.790
Jay: Here I am, a year and a half later facing challenges.

252
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Do over what would you do

253
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Have to do over what would you do differently.

254
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.780
Jay: Wait until they go when I got a hold of.

255
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you might lose your truck might lose a job.

256
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.490
Jay: Well,

257
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: We think about it. Would you the job.

258
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.340
Jay: I'm facing lose a lot of years of my life over this.

259
00:25:54.390 --> 00:26:00.690
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I put it like I did because you right back then you have that choice. You made a decision would you make the same decision you know any

260
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Job. Do you still have that job still have that, like, well, then

261
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You can't get years back we can't get those back, we can get another job.

262
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:18.540
Jay: Right.

263
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a reasonable question that someone might ask how to do it differently. Tell me the logic. How would you what belief system. What moral sort of space, would you be referencing what what belief. Are you are you referencing now now instead of back then.

264
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I think knowing that might be important case you're asked

265
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:51.180
Jay: Well, I mean, I've never, I don't know how to explain it with my family. I've never been afraid to to not steal from them.

266
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.120
Jay: I don't know how I don't know how to see it.

267
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.010
Jay: Like I'll take the initiative, you know anything

268
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so like

269
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:14.850
Jay: If something needed to get done. My mom used to leave $50 on the on the counter and I was in charge of going in, you know, my whole life. That's how it was. So if I needed to do something. I don't got the money. Okay.

270
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:21.390
Jay: You haven't been doing, I'ma go get your checkbook. They own businesses. So it's not unusual for them to give me a credit card.

271
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.110
Jay: Or check

272
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.130
Jay: A check book cash to go and run errands for them, you know, I'm saying

273
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.090
Jay: So whenever I

274
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:40.710
Jay: Whenever I was doing all that it didn't occur to me that. Oh shit, I'm stealing from my sister no barn 120 books because you guys were out of town. I paid you back. It seems PG back and that was my plan. You know what I mean.

275
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I do family, your family system normalized

276
00:27:47.940 --> 00:28:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That you can take money without asking permission and you give it back. And you can use it for things that whatever your family normalized were acceptable. You had a normalization of certain you just explained it to me.

277
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then this was just one along the lines of a lot of them. Yeah, I say it.

278
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.920
Jay: Gives me her credit card. You know what I mean, that's what I'm seeing how is it stealing when you. You know what I mean.

279
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.260
Jay: I didn't steal your

280
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.900
Jay: Idea me the most.

281
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Did brother in law know about the family norm.

282
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it, that's the piece that's missing is the it like I if I entered your family system. I'm like, that's a chart and

283
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: He's, he's working you heat right I wouldn't know I because I don't know the years, or you just did. And I have a piece of that. I know what that is, it's like

284
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you gonna ask me, you know, I keep $50 right there. Just take it. Go, go, go get your little taco whatever I handle it.

285
00:28:51.090 --> 00:29:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And they already know they're going to go, they go to now they're not gonna nobody that house. But, you know, before they would go. Um, but did brother in law know the family norm.

286
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.960
Jay: See, I don't think so. I think that's where everything went south for me. Yeah, I

287
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: didn't even think

288
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Snap, you know, maybe, maybe he you know he's home and it's just not consciousness to think like that.

289
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Possible is just as likely as the impossible. Just keep keep

290
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You have served time for crimes. Just keep that positive manifestation, because the other way. You already know is this miserable life, you might as well live with this.

291
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what it's like. This is how I meet yet again uncertainty discomfort somebody having something over me. This is how I need it.

292
00:29:53.820 --> 00:30:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to have some quality of life. I've got to make meaning out of this, even though even though this isn't really unpleasant environment.

293
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So so interesting.

294
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It is definitely bringing something up for me. I won't share it. But I know what a false accusation is and I know what torment. It can cause

295
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unacceptable, it can get really wiped out.

296
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to things we can focus on. Okay.

297
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter what this moment right here. If we're not thinking about this unknown in the future.

298
00:30:45.030 --> 00:31:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We can get back to this little five second moment this 10 second moment we can be very, very, very, very present with it. So your skill in really staying focused in a communication with someone really appreciating the pickle.

299
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: A sunset.

300
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: A rift of music. Any sense and

301
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Down.

302
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.180
Jay: The mess it up.

303
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's see.

304
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:18.750
That side I'm right.

305
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.060
Jay: So,

306
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The the the practice of really, really immersing yourself in moments right are going to probably be quite important in this journey moving forward.

307
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Not getting lost.

308
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:45.300
Gwenevere Abriel: In this hypothesis about calm and how bad it's going to be an item desert. Soon as you go there.

309
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But if we stay here we say I have got to have minute after minute after minute I'm either learning something new, having meaningful important encounters with people. I need to be completely present

310
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got to because that's how I'm going to hold on to minute and then another minute past and I was like, hey, I'm kind of happy that last minute, I was kind of happy, what do you know, even with all this shit going on.

311
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a life worth living.

312
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because none of us really do know.

313
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: When it's all going to just be a mess. We don't know.

314
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Each of us could be really fixated on that unknown.

315
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to sound like I'm being naive like you don't get it, lady. Like, I can't take it. Like, I don't want to come across naive about it but

316
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you read Victor frankel's book.

317
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know who he is. No. Okay, I'm gonna pull him up here. Okay.

318
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Viktor Frankl

319
00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna show you, he so Victor and meal Frankel F RA n, k, l was an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist, as well as a Holocaust survivor.

320
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's see if I can get some of these

321
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this. Let's just look it will get a little body body splashing it okay so that we get some meaning behind my light and fluffy way of saying it. I mean, it doesn't get much worse than that does it.

322
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean in a concentration camp and how he. So this book is really about how he makes meaning still

323
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: In that miserable environment. So here's just little blips right

324
00:33:49.500 --> 00:34:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I use this one like daily this thing right here. I love this between stimulus and response there is space that space is our power to choose our response in our response was our growth and our freedom.

325
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I can choose

326
00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: To find the irony, I can find the humor. I can find the beauty. Why, because I don't want to waste a minute of my life. That's why, because these are my minutes

327
00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:26.610
Jay: Here.

328
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: No kidding. But this guy like he's not full of it. Okay, he's speaking, having lived through a concentration camp. That's just so powerful.

329
00:34:47.310 --> 00:35:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I really do recommend if you're going to read a book to get you sort of among this sort of empire of powerful minds and strength of people that know firsthand what it's like

330
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: To sort of have to coexist with this abyss of uncertainty that you're having to live with this man might just be the ticket.

331
00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And he's not full of it. He's got street cred, for sure.

332
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:16.680
Jay: Right.

333
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If there is a meaning in life at all.

334
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Then there must be a meaning and suffering.

335
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Suffering is an ear radical part of life, even as fate and death.

336
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: without suffering and death.

337
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Human life cannot be complete.

338
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think about that. What does this make you think about this one. I had a little thought about that one would it make you think about

339
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:54.930
Which one

340
00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: This one, let me see if I can. I'm kind of 123 third one.

341
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.920
Jay: Okay, I was

342
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.990
Jay: I was zoomed in reading them one by one.

343
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:12.600
Jay: There's a meaning in life at all. There must be a meaning and suffering suffering isn't in a radical

344
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:13.800
Jay: Part of life.

345
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.200
Jay: Even as fate and death without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.

346
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:26.190
Jay: Like, basically, that's your purpose you live long enough to complete your group isn't go

347
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But along the way. LOOK AT HE SAYS THERE MUST BE meaning and suffering, Jay. Are you suffering.

348
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yes, you are. You do you make meaning of it as in

349
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What, like what meaning you make out of your suffering. This is the critical pivotal point on whether you're going to have a happy peaceful day or not.

350
00:36:51.990 --> 00:37:07.890
Jay: The only thing that I know that's ever helped me is to find meetings to go to find some volunteer work and find somebody who's gonna listen to your stories and maybe, you know, find somebody who need your help, because it always feels good to help somebody else.

351
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. So

352
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If

353
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You can find in the moment that the very thing I need is peace reassurance and comfort and you can't you can't find it in yourself.

354
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You go give it to another.

355
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's amazing how it comes back the very thing I need, and I can't, I can't seem to even generate for myself and walk outside

356
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I go and I give it, guess what, in order for you to have given it you have had to have had it to begin with. It just comes right back.

357
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:54.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I have meaning I'm getting back to, to look at the reaction. Look how much and now we're lost, we're not thinking about this other stuff. And right here. We're in this moment. I think that's great.

358
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you set up over these coming months, right, you set that up to make sure that's happening or have you been kind of been doing what you usually do, and haven't been volunteering haven't been going to meetings and share your story in connecting with people, what has really been happening.

359
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.130
Jay: I really have

360
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:24.060
Jay: I mean, I hope when I can like with my family and stuff. And with my friends if they call me they need my help. Yeah.

361
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.720
Jay: Yeah I don't go looking for it.

362
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.470
Jay: They don't have meetings here.

363
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

364
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.060
Jay: Whatever else in the world and

365
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I brought up internet, I said you guys don't have excuses anymore. It's online.

366
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You can go a I could type in na

367
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:56.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Online fellowship 12 steps you get, I always did. You weren't in that group that day. I don't think maybe and there okay so

368
00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's horrible. It's horrible.

369
00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.100
Jay: It's nothing.

370
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's too bad.

371
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:16.140
Jay: I enjoy going to meetings. I like to go. I like to get my chips you know your your week tip your month to, you know, to me, I like, stuff like that. I like to go drink the coffee.

372
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.250
Jay: I mean,

373
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:24.540
Jay: You chat before you chat afterwards you get to meet people, you know, it's hard to do that over the Internet, especially when you're 100 miles away.

374
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:33.510
Jay: You know, because only thing on my mind before and after the meeting is either trying to find work or, you know, why else you can talk to make friends.

375
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.320
Yeah.

376
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

377
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.170
Jay: And they don't have that.

378
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.010
Jay: They have, but they have a thing. It's called a

379
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.960
Jay: Oh man, I can't think of it now.

380
00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.680
Jay: And anyway.

381
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.300
Jay: Everybody in town. It's on parole, probation have to go. I don't have to go

382
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.190
Jay: Cuz I'm trying

383
00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.950
Jay: I'm trying to avoid all those people that I was in.

384
00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, yeah.

385
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:14.370
Jay: I got I got Jordan. I got my job wrote two years ago so much. I was just like, as long as you're clean, then I don't care. He's like stay clean. Don't give me no more. Do you do you, as

386
00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You can, you're on, you have

387
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your insurances Medicaid hundred percent right you don't pay no copay coming in these groups.

388
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, so it's no big deal for you. Maybe you attend more by groups, maybe you go to more, maybe you see someone that you relate to and instead of doing it while you're driving you do it like this.

389
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Really lean into it and you put it, you gotta work harder because it's the tele health because we can hardly even look at each other. It does take more effort for sure.

390
00:40:52.770 --> 00:41:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: But good. It's going to take concentration, it'll get out of the words, the mind and maybe you can get back in there, sharing a story.

391
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Boy, it was this for me, boy. It was that for me. And hey, I'm here on purpose. I'm on my third group.

392
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: When you see some kid like right or some adult. This is stupid. Why you guys coming at me with all this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Just give you my pill and just shish right something you say something with your lived experience might touch someone in a way that they

393
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I should take this more seriously, maybe

394
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Did anyone ever do that for you when they said you need to

395
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about what you're doing here, buddy.

396
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.210
Jay: Yeah, I mean,

397
00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We're at sunken

398
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:44.190
Jay: Know, I've always had to go through it figured out a more dated

399
00:41:51.060 --> 00:42:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you heard you're welcome to attend more groups, you can just text me. Do you have another one. You can go. I'm really different meaning. We're all different. So the different therapists are going to have very different styles.

400
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Some of them are more

401
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: didactic they'll just sort of share information, others are doing more meditative things they might start

402
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Dominate does that hers is very mindful, so she might think I haven't been to one of our groups, but I know clients that random they might do my meditation, right. So that might be kind of cool.

403
00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You get to learn about what you like maybe learning closer and closer to

404
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Why like myself this way or what comes up when it in the quiet space. Now I like the Twitter chat or maybe you like it quiet. You know, so you could kind of switch it up and attend different ones.

405
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But I don't want to lose you from my home group. I want to keep you in my home group who want to keep seeing you. It's a good way for me to say, well, how is he, with other people that can kind of watch

406
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, that kind of thing.

407
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.290
Jay: But I just want to make sure you make me

408
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.560
Jay: Good your, you want to make me a schedule real quick.

409
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure. So you have of course Monday at nine and then you have Monday at one

410
00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And then early bird is 7am on Tuesday.

411
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.360
And I

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.340
Jay: Hola Monday and nine. That's the one I go to more money.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.240
And there's also

414
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:23.160

Jay: Let's do Wednesday. Can I do like Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

416
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so the challenge with Wednesdays I don't happen to offer on it and you on Wednesday. But I, I can track down other people have to text you on that one. But there are, there's like a lot on Wednesdays, that you could go to for

417
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.890
Jay: Sign one fruit every other day.

418
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it. That's a great idea.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So for now, just so you know, Tuesday has a 7am Tuesday on for have a brand new what I'd love to have in

Gwenevere Abriel: And then I'll get you the stuff for Wednesday. There's stuff at 130 there's stuff in the evenings, so I can get those for you.

423
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And then Thursday at 11am and then

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Friday at noon.

425
00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to learn today.

426
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:31.080
Jay: Friday at 12pm Tuesday. We're not gonna do it Monday, Wednesday. Okay.

427
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.220
So let me go.

428
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Me go

429
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Into slack here. I wish I had a different name it always sounds so weird. When I say that it's an email program. And I'm going to ask them what all the groups are right now. Okay. So, Angelina, what are the group.

430
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Time you

431
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.850
Take

432
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: On wed Nescafe gaze.

433
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: To conform and client.

434
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This to review this is the big takeaway from this, from this author from this gentleman that live through this

435
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Am

436
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: In screenshot of to if you want to put on your phone.

437
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So everything

438
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be taken from a man, but one thing

439
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this the last of human freedoms and it's to choose. It's actually this is to choose one's own attitude I can choose

440
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, no matter what I take away. You still get to choose how you make meaning out of that moment, I cannot. I can try to persuade you. I can do my best to piss you off. I can try to discuss you make you angry and sad. But guess what, you still have a right

441
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To the meaning you make out of that moment. How do I want to feel right. Now, why do I want to be thinking about

442
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: In any circumstances to choose your own way locked up not locked up plenty of people are not locked up and they act like they are

443
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can be locked up and be the most free man.

444
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:54.900
Jay: That's a good one.

445
00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:55.860
Now,

446
00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard to argue with that truth telling in it.

447
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:04.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it.

448
00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it.

449
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.260
Jay: Yeah, I'm almost done.

450
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:20.910
Jay: I got it.

451
00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:22.800
Jay: Thank you.

452
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk about some skills, what what you're remembering what you're not remembering um

453
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You have some hurt feelings. Right. Some heartache, in a sense, from from this betrayal.

454
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see how you could use this quote

455
00:48:45.990 --> 00:49:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Around this incident. This circumstance. How can you decide how you want to feel what you want to interpret focus in meaning. How do you want to be around this betrayal.

456
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:15.960
Jay: I don't want it to divine light. I don't want to keep me down anymore. I don't want to, because every relationship had me feeling like I was doing something wrong. You know me.

457
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.340
Jay: And I can't fix somebody else that's

458
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you, at times, because I have a little snapshot of some of the interactions with you and your mother. So I always have in my mind. I wonder

459
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If you ended up drawing into your life, someone who does something similar, which is says you know that's not true. What you're saying what. No, that didn't happen.

460
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: They deny your reality. And so I wonder if you keep drawing people in that say, You're crazy. That's not how it is.

461
00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.800
Jay: And it's crazy to say that

462
00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.110
Jay: I wish I could show you all the texts in

463
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

464
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:05.910
Jay: I'm the one

465
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: No you're not.

466
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:10.860
Jay: You. I put

467
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Go ahead.

468
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:18.630
Jay: Go ahead. Go. I put a thing on Facebook. The other day that said a fan. I forgot what we're talking about. Sorry.

469
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You are made to feel crazy because then she does not have to be accountable what she does what she says behind all that chaos and she creates with all that. Oh, you're, you're insane. That's what I said. That's why you thinking about it like that. Let them have

470
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Behind there. She can do whatever. There's

471
00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Zero accountability.

472
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it sounds familiar. It looks the same as a piece of a story you shared with you and your mother.

473
00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you end up being the bad guy, you're the problem.

474
00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: When really all you were doing was trying to help.

475
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So in that relationship. It's the same phenomenon, you are left to either go crazy.

476
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: use drugs.

477
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.890
Jay: Drugs, you

478
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Are nice

479
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Or get to live in an opt out of course that's what I'm selling here today.

480
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And so that's what talking about little pieces about how do I recognize someone who's doing that to me. So I don't have date that person again. That's my mom up in there again.

481
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What date that same woman again because they don't start off saying saying no. You're insane. That's not true. They start off

482
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: They read you very quickly. They know exactly would you

483
00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Like they look so fantastic because they're playing. Yep, they're good, they're better at it than we are. They're good at it.

484
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we ask them questions we listen to their stories. That's something you want to hear a little bit about you telling me.

485
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.960
About

486
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: How she she heard me talking about her.

487
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Believe me, if everybody got a call. Every time I was talking about their mama.

488
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I only read it all the time.

489
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm waiting for my kids to be like bringing me in a therapist office. Well, my mother used to bed that down. Like, okay, just go ahead and bring me in there with you because all my shit. I'm sorry I did you wrong. I'm sorry.

490
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Someday My name is gonna be enough therapists office. I just know what

491
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:05.610
Jay: You think so.

492
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, I'm a pain in the ass.

493
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi, Mom. I know it all. You know, well I know why you're doing it.

494
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want to find a little boundary poster. I think this is going to be candid and it. Where's my boundaries.

495
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Know the other view.

496
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:37.650
Jay: All the cool. I was trying to tell you about is why are all a wire liars, the ones that are always popular in the ones that tell the truth or craziest folk

497
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.990
Jay: Put that on Facebook yesterday.

498
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I like that.

499
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Well tell you something.

500
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I think telling the truth is hard.

501
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not vulnerable when you lie or you really know

502
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.670
Jay: Yeah.

503
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't there's no vulnerability. There's you're not getting to me by front.

504
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you don't like me. I was frightened anyway. Like, that's nothing.

505
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: But when I say

506
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel sad or feel hurt or I'm really angry or disappointed or jealous or I'm scared I'm nervous.

507
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:27.000
Jay: Because me and her got together for like three weeks and then she went to jail for a month and a half.

508
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.970
Jay: She got out she's been out two months.

509
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:35.520
Jay: And the whole time. She was in there upstate with money on books I stayed answering the phone.

510
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

511
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:41.970
Jay: All for nothing.

512
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: No no no no no you learned now you either learn or you're going to get that same teacher, that's up to you.

513
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.010
Jay: I never learned that's my problem. I always try to

514
00:54:53.310 --> 00:55:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you said you learn the hard way. So you just got to get you a really dysfunctional woman really you can do been dabbling and dysfunction. You need to get you one just really borderline personality disorder.

515
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Antisocial Personality Disorder board members. That's a winner right there. That was going to ruin you.

516
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:16.440
Jay: The one I went to prison after it, she's the first one that was in prison.

517
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Fun times right there are some good stories with that one.

518
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:21.540
Jay: Yes.

519
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: One bad enough, you haven't learned your lesson yet. You said I learned it the hard way. So maybe you're gonna wait for something even worse than

520
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:38.640
Jay: This girl wasn't on drugs. That's why I was trying so hard to keep it.

521
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:42.960
Jay: You know, I mean,

522
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I know your bars pretty frickin low if the requirement is I'm a female. And I ain't doing drugs. Once you raise that bar a little bit

523
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.930
Jay: I don't have standards. I see people for who they are.

524
00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You gotta, you gotta, you gotta say, Hey, you know. Wait, I hear you. I don't have standards and I'm sitting here trying to find my fancy little

525
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundary thing and my timings off.

526
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I get that. So, you know, you know, you don't write, you know, you can see what I see past

527
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I see past so much and I can see to people's hurt. I can see the the authentic self behind all the fronting, I can see it. And so it's confusing because you keep hoping that they'll show up the way you see them.

528
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't

529
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:35.280
Jay: Never do

530
00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:36.030
Nope.

531
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no.

532
00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Come on let me. I gotta do a search here. Hold on. Let's put healthy

533
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how I labeled it there. It is just needed to do a search. Okay, um, we've got four minutes here. Time flies when you're eating kale pickles, but

534
00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Let's, um,

535
00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I would say this is definitely something that can take a lifetime. So I'm not trying to say, hey, this is just so easy. This is like you're talking about. I don't have standards. Well, here are a few

536
00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

537
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you. I was throwing out this idea of consider

538
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:38.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe learning your standards, finding out what you'll tolerate where you really won't tolerate what behaviors, what things and then maybe start a romantic relationship if only

539
00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: To protect your recovery for no, nothing else.

540
00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You go to the rooms, you go find out if I'm full of it, but I bet they'll say something like that to you. I bet they'll say, once you get to a cactus or a cat. First, once you take care of a planet.

541
00:57:55.980 --> 00:58:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That goes and then let's get into a romantic relationship. They're very complicated. They will pull out intense emotions like very few others can and it puts you in a vulnerable place if you don't have solid footing in recovery.

542
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This I see a new a lot I we end this takes a whole, you know, we'll go over this again. But I just want to throw it up there in case you wanted to take a picture of it and think about it on your own. But this one right here. You don't tolerate abuse or disrupt your respect.

543
00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you tolerate a lot

544
00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not healthy for you, reinforces to this person and to our community and to a greater whole that the behavior is acceptable. It's not, but instead of a healthy boundary would be can have a

545
00:58:50.670 --> 00:59:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Hopes of the other way around. You don't tolerate abuse and just respect that would be the healthy one. But the way you do it is to have a high tolerance, so you can put up with it again and again and again and again and again and again.

546
00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe you think in your mind. That's what love looks like.

547
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's something that you might run across. Remember how I was saying in my little role play earlier. I was like, you know, have this other person share their stories.

548
00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: What often happens, if we're getting hooked so quickly, like we're falling for someone so fast, it's because they're sharing their

549
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: They're sharing or they're getting you to share their stories too fast. It's not. It's too soon. It's like

550
00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait a minute, how do you, how do you trust Me with all of this intimate information. What makes me seem like a trip. Why are you sharing all this batch father, what he did to me why, tell me this, so fast.

551
00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Have I earned your trust. This can be a con someone sharing all that intimate stuff so so quickly, like, wait a second.

552
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You already know about me. I like to help people. You know, I'm gonna feel sorry if you know I like like that. I want to be needed. And I want to rescue you read me the first time you saw me. Okay. Wait I need to put a pin in this

553
01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This is too soon.

554
01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't shared my stories. I haven't. I don't trust. Why am I hearing all of this into business for therapists to hear this stuff. Why so soon. Where's our first day.

555
01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're in a healthy boundary relationship we share. It's true. We do, we do share some of our stories, but we do it gradually

556
01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes time.

557
01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We volley it back. Well, I did this and then we wait for their response. And then the other shares. It goes nice back and forth. Okay.

558
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: In general, Jay, do you fall into a rescuer hero role.

559
01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.160
Sometimes

560
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And other times what you fall into

561
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That triangle.

562
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:13.290
Jay: challengers

563
01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a healthy one. Yeah.

564
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Do they meet your challenge, and do they change.

565
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: They step up.

566
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.760
Jay: That's what I got to focus on

567
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Then they step up or you just kind of keep going. Come on. You got this, you got everything just go, what's your problem. Why you saying I gotta do they step up and do the work.

568
01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.080
Jay: Firstly, do

569
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Okay, takes time. That's how we develop trust. That's why it's slow. Yes, we want to be needed and loved right away. Yes, of course, that would be great. But the real stuff takes time. We watch we wait

570
01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what this year might do, what will I be like if I am not distracted by the chaos of a romantic relationship, what will happen.

571
01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's served you really well to not have to sit with other really uncomfortable things you didn't do it, you were doing it, probably on up for a reason. I don't think we humans do things for nothing. So I don't want to pull that away.

572
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And say there's this nothing in its place. We're going to do the work, work through some of those trauma pieces. Okay, we'll have some desensitization. We'll do some reprocessing keep talking about it, then I have lunch with you, I promise we'll do it.
