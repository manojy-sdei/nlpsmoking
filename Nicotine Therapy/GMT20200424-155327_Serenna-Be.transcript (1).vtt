89
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.530

90
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:36.030
Serenna Beers: appointment with you now. Or you can call back in Schedule one with me for about the middle of May.

91
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.680
Kyle Camargo: Or the I should call back and schedule because I'm actually looking for work and I'm looking for work still real

92
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.250
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

93
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:44.760

Kyle Camargo: I mean I wouldn't want to schedule put man.

95
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:56.070
Kyle Camargo: Sir daytime or the latest I can you know before work or after work, so

96
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.630
Okay.

97
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.210
Kyle Camargo: Good date.

98
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:13.170
Serenna Beers: Oh, OK. So I'm just going to mark down in my notes that you said that you will call back here and in the next week or two to set up a time to meet with me again.

99
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:25.740
Serenna Beers: Yeah, and in the mean. In the mean time, Mark, try to come up with some stuff that I could go over with you that relates to what it is that you want to learn about. Okay.

100
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.330
Kyle Camargo: Okay.

102
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.250
Kyle Camargo: Thank you.

103
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:36.540
Serenna Beers: Okay. Thank you. Bye.

104
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.960
Serenna Beers: Okay, so this gentleman was struggling, struggling with pain. He seemed really agitated.

105
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:54.990
Serenna Beers: So I, I gave him the option to call back, but I don't know if there's somewhere in the notes that you can put down

106
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:13.260
Serenna Beers: That if he doesn't call back by say may 10 we need to reach out to him because I need to see him at least twice a month, just because he's brand new on the Suboxone and I think it would be very beneficial for him to establish

107
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:28.020
Serenna Beers: Some individual therapy as well as group. So if we could make a note for if we don't hear from him by May 10 I need for the clinic to reach out to him to Schedule A appointment to see me. Thanks.
