Yeah.

66
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.640

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.480
Joan Kandel: Okay. All right. Um,

68
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.200

Mr. Baca: Yes.

70
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.030

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.930
Mr. Baca: Yeah yeah

72
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.430
Mr. Baca: Yeah, she got she got really sick prior and guide and several times over the course of six months.

73
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.470
Mr. Baca: And she kept like her heart wasn't

74
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.000
Mr. Baca: Strong enough to deal with the sickness. So he kept dying, but they kept reviving her

75
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.240
Mr. Baca: Ash and and she tried to prepare me as much as possible because he knew he was not going to make it.

76
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.910
Mr. Baca: Yeah. Um, but it was very difficult to do so.

77
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.420
Joan Kandel: Yeah, it's hard to really prepare for something like that.

78
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.300
Joan Kandel: Right, it's still, it's still a shocking to you.

79
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.010
Mr. Baca: Yeah, very

80
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.580
Joan Kandel: Yeah, I'm so sorry. Sounds like you're still really trying to process that.

81
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.710
Mr. Baca: I am yeah hey

82
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.550
Yeah.

83
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.550
Joan Kandel: D. Does it help to have your brother.

84
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.890
Mr. Baca: It does, and he is

85
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:44.490
Mr. Baca: He's in medical school and but he's also a Seventh Day Adventist preacher and Bible teacher so he's been taking me with him to go like

86
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.050
Mr. Baca: To his friend's house for Bible studies and, you know, so I'm trying to reconnect with my

87
00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:05.340
Mr. Baca: Religion again and and get a good relationship with God and that way you know I can call on God for strength and all that good stuff. So I'm in a really positive place right now.

88
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.480
Joan Kandel: Good has religion been an important part of your life.

89
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.970
Mr. Baca: Not previously, you know,

90
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.070
Joan Kandel: Okay, so this is kind of new for you.

91
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:22.680
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, trying to still wrap your head around it. Does it feel like a good fit, or is it, is it a lot of work.

92
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.420
Mr. Baca: And it's a lot of work, but it still feels like a good fit and

93
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.750
Mr. Baca: Okay. And I was in jail.

94
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:47.580
Mr. Baca: I feel I've been in jail a lot, but mainly for like possession and paraphernalia stuff like that. But this last time it was because of a stolen vehicle that charges ended up getting dropped

95
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:49.770
Mr. Baca: And

96
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.830
Mr. Baca: I was in jail for about 64 days total

97
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:03.000
Mr. Baca: And I would pray a lot because I was in solitary confinement, most of the time.

98
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:11.280
Mr. Baca: And just because Denver doesn't have like a separate gay male unit.

99
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.420
Mr. Baca: Haha, they have everybody together and

100
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.680
Mr. Baca: And and you know I all the horror stories in jail gay men getting killed. I'm like, Nope, not me.

101
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.850
Joan Kandel: So you you opt in for that or did they just say this is the best choice for you.

102
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.460
Mr. Baca: Know I opted I begged them um

103
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.630
Joan Kandel: I see now you just wanted to be safe and not get attack.

104
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.440
Joan Kandel: Right, yeah. So you did okay there.

105
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.840
Joan Kandel: Yeah, in terms of that. I mean,

106
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.010
Yeah.

107
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.440
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah, uh huh. Okay, um,

108
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.060
Joan Kandel: Alright.

109
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.510
Joan Kandel: So, so that's when you started to pray.

110
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:07.500
Mr. Baca: Yeah. And no, it would be like little things by and they were like subtle answers to the prayers that I was praying and which

111
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.390
Mr. Baca: Got kind of got me.

112
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:21.810
Mr. Baca: You know, believing again and then ever since I came here and I'm really like working to reconnect with and because when I was a kid.

113
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:35.250
Mr. Baca: My parents were dealers and alcoholics and then turn to religion. And so we were like for a short time, going to church and you know really involved and stuff so

114
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.590
Joan Kandel: So it's there somewhere.

115
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.420
Mr. Baca: Yeah there somewhere.

116
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:50.310
Joan Kandel: Yeah. So in terms of Seventh Day Adventist I don't know too much about it, but do you have a sense of how they will

117
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.850
Joan Kandel: View you being gay and you being on medication assisted treatment.

118
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.710
Joan Kandel: And he says about

119
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.150
Mr. Baca: Matt Yeah.

120
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:19.590
Mr. Baca: I'm just starting to I mean that few people I have met have been really awesome and like one of my brother friends who was also a student at the Bible college here and it's called souls west. I don't know if you've heard of it.

121
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:26.040
Mr. Baca: Haha. Okay. And it's like a little. It's like a outdoor camp, but it's a Bible college

122
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.870
Mr. Baca: Okay, and

123
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.070
Mr. Baca: He actually I really opened up to him and told him everything

124
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:41.910
Mr. Baca: And he accepted me with open arms. And he actually became a really good friend.

125
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.470
Joan Kandel: Oh, nice.

126
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.100
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

127
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.150
Mr. Baca: That's a good sign.

128
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.800
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so that's a real deal.

129
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.450
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right. Not every but it's not a guarantee that everybody says open

130
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.890
Joan Kandel: Minded is a is

131
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.940
Mr. Baca: Right. And, you know,

132
00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:02.670
Joan Kandel: There's some things about religion that that's just part of the the doctrine, you know that certain things are are bad and evil and wrong.

133
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.080
Joan Kandel: Yeah. So I just want you to be protected against that, because

134
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:23.310
Joan Kandel: There is nothing wrong. Obviously with being gay. And there's nothing wrong with being on medications to treat addiction and those tend to be two things that are really highly stigmatized. And so I just want you to protect yourself and you know don't believe it.

135
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.100
Mr. Baca: If they say if they start to come at you with that.

136
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:32.640
Mr. Baca: Oh yeah, well, and I you know I pulled his name is Moses. I told him, but

137
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:41.670
Mr. Baca: I'm the gay man I don't plan on being a straight man. So if that's going to be a problem. Then I understand.

138
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:55.530
Mr. Baca: Right. He was like, No, why would that be a problem. And I said, because I when I was a teenager and 16 years old, I was told by the elders of our church. We were attending out in California.

139
00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:04.590
Mr. Baca: And that I was going to hell and I was going to burn for eternity, because I was gay. And I'm like, Okay, that's why I kind of away from awaken

140
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:13.170
Joan Kandel: Right. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. So that's the last thing you need right now, when you're trying to get stable and you're trying to

141
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.150
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Well, well, yeah.

142
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:16.830
Joan Kandel: And, you know,

143
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.880
Joan Kandel: Unfortunately, the same sort of

144
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.760
Joan Kandel: Theories

145
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:33.210
Joan Kandel: Are perpetuated around using medications to treat addiction, so you know those you happen to be into really highly stigmatized groups.

146
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.030
Joan Kandel: That's unfortunate.

147
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.400
Joan Kandel: So, you know, people don't

148
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.300
Joan Kandel: People don't necessarily know what they're talking about when they

149
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.950
Joan Kandel: When they spew that stuff. So just, you know, protect yourself against that, that I guess that's my point.

150
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.340
Joan Kandel: Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

151
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.490
Mr. Baca: I've been through a lot of hell in my life.

152
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.300
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

153
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:04.830
Mr. Baca: I mean, I've been jumped all of my teeth were broken out by a gang, I'm happy. They smacked my head into the curb.

154
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.470
Mr. Baca: And. And that was for being a gay male. I've been jumped several times.

155
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:30.120
Mr. Baca: You know i i now because of just being homeless and everything I carry like a pocket knife everywhere because I'm like, if anyone ever even tries anything. My life is more important and I protect myself at all costs, but

156
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.870
Mr. Baca: I'm trying to get out of that you know that crazy mindset.

157
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:39.600
Mr. Baca: Right, that the drugs kind of help you know

158
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:41.790
Mr. Baca: So,

159
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.140
Mr. Baca: Yeah yeah

160
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.910
Mr. Baca: Really been patient

161
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:52.530
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Well, that's good. That's really good. But, you know, because you're close to Phoenix. There may be some

162
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.440
Joan Kandel: Some resources there, you know, some gay recovery groups or something where you can

163
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:06.060
Joan Kandel: You know, not feel WHERE YOU CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE AND AT HOME I mean even online stuff there may be

164
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.080
They have

165
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.060
Joan Kandel: I believe so.

166
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.780
Mr. Baca: Wow, I need to look into that. Thank you.

167
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.440
Joan Kandel: Yeah, well, you should. I mean, you should Google it. If I, if I

168
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:22.350
Joan Kandel: Think of something, then I'll pass it on to you, but I mean, you could probably google it.

169
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:39.030
Joan Kandel: You know, okay, just Google gay recovery and you know there may be something local that when things open back up. You could go actually in person. But in the meantime, you know, even if they're based in, you know, California or Washington or something you can attend online.

170
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.410
Mr. Baca: Yeah right now.

171
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.970
Mr. Baca: Just like the perfect time to

172
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:54.480
Joan Kandel: So you can connect with people who you can really relate to and and share your experiences with and get out of, you know, your church community, what you can get out of that, but also have

173
00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:05.820
Joan Kandel: A different sort of support and you know you being in bright heart is going to be really helpful because you'll be able to get support of other people who are in recovery, whether they're gay or not, you know, and just

174
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:15.960
Joan Kandel: Be able to relate to the to those things. So it's really, if you're well positioned to to be a good source of support.

175
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:17.910
Mr. Baca: Right. Thank you.

176
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.560
Joan Kandel: Yeah, you're welcome. I'm so have you been on Suboxone before

177
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.110
Joan Kandel: I know you ride on and that was helpful.

178
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.300
Mr. Baca: Yes, and I had been both. I hate it. I hate that Suboxone

179
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.320
Mr. Baca: Oh yeah, it makes me throw up some time, but

180
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:41.640
Mr. Baca: It does help a lot at methadone doesn't taste any better, but it the way down.

181
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:43.560
Yeah.

182
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.080
Joan Kandel: True that.

183
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.790
Joan Kandel: It's just quicker.

184
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.500
Joan Kandel: It doesn't take so long to dissolve.

185
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:50.490
Right.

186
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.160
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

187
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.440
Mr. Baca: So, you know, whatever way.

188
00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:01.290
Mr. Baca: You know, whatever direction. I go, I know I'm gonna be able to do it so

189
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:10.170
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Good. Great. So, how confident are you feeling about about things about your recovery, being able to do this.

190
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:24.960
Mr. Baca: With the medication and just because previously in a rehab. They told me, like if you're on Suboxone then if you get high. You're going to get sick.

191
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:36.090
Mr. Baca: If you're on methadone and you get high. You don't get high. You don't feel anything from the drugs because I'm you know on opiates and

192
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:44.610
Mr. Baca: That it's basically a waste of money. So I'm like, Well, what the hell is the point if I'm on medication. I'm not going to use

193
00:16:45.330 --> 00:17:01.200
Mr. Baca: And that's so that's the mindset that I have that I'm either going to get really sick or I'm just blowing my money on nothing. And when I got a clear head. I love to. I'm really like frugal with money.

194
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.340
Mr. Baca: And no, I'm like, you know, there's more important stuff to buy

195
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.870
Joan Kandel: Yeah right, you got you got good things to buy

196
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:20.520
Joan Kandel: Yeah, so if you were to put it on a scale of one to 10 how confident you are that you can do this with the medications confident are you 15

197
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.530
Joan Kandel: Yeah 14 yeah

198
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:26.130
Joan Kandel: Yeah, okay. Okay, why not, why not just a 10

199
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.210
Joan Kandel: By 14

200
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:37.380
Mr. Baca: Because yesterday, the gentleman, he was the guy that was doing my intake. He's like, well, if you were over 10 and I was like, Yeah, it'd be like a 14

201
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.330
Mr. Baca: I'm like 140% confident

202
00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.380
Joan Kandel: So you're feeling super good about this.

203
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.970
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Good. Well, so am I. Yeah, I think it's good.

204
00:17:52.170 --> 00:18:01.140
Joan Kandel: And, you know, there are there are rehabs and other places that are of the theory that

205
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.670
Joan Kandel: That

206
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:20.400
Joan Kandel: People should be on Suboxone for a short period of time and then taper off and then they're good to go. And frankly, that just doesn't work. It's not, it's not a solution. You just fall back into the same brain patterns because your brain is all messed up.

207
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:29.520
Joan Kandel: So it doesn't fix your brain to be on something for a short time and then get off of it. So the relapse rates are so high and the failure rates are so high.

208
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:36.540
Joan Kandel: That really, you know, maintenance therapy indefinite maintenance therapy is the way to go.

209
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.820
Joan Kandel: And if at some point in the future.

210
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:45.780
Joan Kandel: I'm talking at least a year or more certainly many people are on it for longer.

211
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.020
Joan Kandel: If, at some point, you feel like, okay, my life is

212
00:18:49.140 --> 00:19:03.540
Joan Kandel: Awesome, everything's in place. I'm totally stable than to think about a slow taper down and possibly off is a possibility. But you know, that's certainly not. We don't go into this thinking you're going to get off of this stuff.

213
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.050
Joan Kandel: You know, like everybody says when you're going to get off of that stuff.

214
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.800
Joan Kandel: That's not the right way to think if

215
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:21.090
Joan Kandel: Ever medication, you know, I'm a doctor. I'm a family doctor I treat people for lots of things medical conditions and some medical conditions are chronic

216
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:27.300
Joan Kandel: Meaning they're long lasting and they just need to be on medications for the long term sometimes for the rest of their life.

217
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:40.470
Joan Kandel: And you know as doctors were fine with that. And if it's helping and it's doing a good job and there aren't a lot of side effects, then you know it's it's helping and we should keep you keep people on it. So that's my philosophy about Suboxone as well.

218
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.330
Joan Kandel: And methadone as well. But we don't we don't prescribe methadone, because we're not

219
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.740
Mr. Baca: Right, right.

220
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.310
Mr. Baca: So,

221
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.140
Joan Kandel: I just kind of wanted to let you know a little bit about my philosophy so that you don't feel like

222
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.830
Joan Kandel: Your pressure to taper off you know before you're ready.

223
00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.980
Mr. Baca: Yeah, right. Thank you. I really appreciate that.

224
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.180
Okay.

225
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.840
Joan Kandel: Good. Um, okay. So, um,

226
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.340
Joan Kandel: When was the last time you had an opioid and what was it,

227
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.130
Mr. Baca: And it was almost two months ago and it was heroin.

228
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.990
Joan Kandel: You have been two months without any opioids.

229
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:34.050
Mr. Baca: Yeah, because I went to script hospital and they gave me a prescription for Suboxone. It was only supposed to be for a week that I dragged it out for 30 days.

230
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.630
Mr. Baca: When strip a day.

231
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.370
Joan Kandel: Okay.

232
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:59.130
Mr. Baca: So I took it out as long as I could and I i mean it, it wasn't. I was uncomfortable, but I wasn't withdrawing and now two weeks or two and a half weeks out from my last Suboxone strip and now I'm like oh my god the anxiety, the muscle pain. I'm like, I can't do this.

233
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.390
Joan Kandel: Okay. And it's been two and a half weeks since you had your last Suboxone

234
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.570
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Okay, so, um,

235
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.260
Joan Kandel: Uh, how long were you in scripts.

236
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:19.080
Mr. Baca: And I literally with a with my first time going to script hospital and it was in San Diego.

237
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:26.640
Mr. Baca: Yeah, and I was there because I had a rehab that was going to take me but then they close their doors when they

238
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.170
Mr. Baca: Told her a big thing happen.

239
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.900
Mr. Baca: So then I ended up having to come back here.

240
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.240
Joan Kandel: So, um,

241
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:40.080
Joan Kandel: So, how long were you at scripts. Were you there for a long time, or just a couple of days.

242
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:41.610
Joan Kandel: Or the end even go

243
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.200
Mr. Baca: I went one

244
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.450
Joan Kandel: Okay, just for the ER one

245
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:46.890
Mr. Baca: Visit yeah yeah

246
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.940
Joan Kandel: I see, I see. Okay, so that wasn't that wasn't any kind of rehab.

247
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.530
Mr. Baca: And no, no, no.

248
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:53.490
Mr. Baca: I see.

249
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:10.350
Mr. Baca: I was just referred by because my cousin Elisa is also an addict and she was mandated through drug court to go through the Drug Court program to rehab. So he's really good friends.

250
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.450
Mr. Baca: With the lady that runs drug court.

251
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.910
Mr. Baca: And she got me.

252
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:28.080
Mr. Baca: Her name is Roxy. She's the one that sent me the scripts to a counselor there. And her name is Tanya. That's the one I filled out the provider information for

253
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:42.330
Mr. Baca: Because she is. Yeah, she's been following up with me like more. I mean, she has shown me that she cares more about me and my sobriety than anyone I've ever met.

254
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.180
Joan Kandel: Wow, that's amazing. And you just barely met her.

255
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.250
Mr. Baca: I met her for five minutes.

256
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.480
Joan Kandel: That's amazing.

257
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.040
Joan Kandel: So she's from scripts.

258
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.250
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah, she's the one who got you.

259
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.060
Joan Kandel: Connected with a doctor who could prescribe the Suboxone

260
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.790
Mr. Baca: Right, yeah, he, he had one of the ER doctors do it and then

261
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:22.680
Mr. Baca: She's the one that referred me to write her. She sent me all of the like a huge brochure. He sent to my email about different rehabs and stuff that are residential I'm like oh my god i like i said i met her for five minutes and I didn't

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:37.920
Mr. Baca: But she's like, I, I have been in contact with Roxy about you. We've been trying on this and and so I thought I would just call you and give you all this information and see if he could do anything to

271
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.340
Joan Kandel: Just to make sure to tell her.

272
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.240
Mr. Baca: I will

273
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.460
Joan Kandel: Okay cuz that'll make her really happy.

274
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.080
Mr. Baca: Yeah, I very much well

275
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.880
Joan Kandel: Yeah, otherwise show worry about you.

276
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.060
Mr. Baca: Yeah and you know yesterday there was a

277
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:37.500
Mr. Baca: Problem with the admissions paperwork that they send to your email like things weren't downloading. I'm like, oh my god. Another speed bump. I'm done. I give up. I texted her. And I was like, look, thank you for everything, but this is

278
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.150
Joan Kandel: Why. Wow. Wow.

279
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.800
Mr. Baca: I don't know. Please, Mommy, I'm like okay

280
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.050
Joan Kandel: She talked to you down. Huh.

281
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:46.800
Mr. Baca: Yeah.

282
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:54.570
Joan Kandel: So that's good. Thank goodness. Wow. Well, good. So when you went to scripts. How many Suboxone did they give you

283
00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:03.150
Mr. Baca: And it me at three strips a day for a week and then I was

284
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:18.330
Mr. Baca: Supposed to go back. If I was still in San Diego, but I'm because I left so I I drew it out. Like, I mean, I tried to draw it out as long as I could with yeah

285
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.280
Joan Kandel: Right, so it lasted. You like two months or

286
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.930
Mr. Baca: Ask

287
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.950
Mr. Baca: Me a month. Yeah. Um, I would say like a month in a week.

288
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:47.790
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Okay, so, um, so I think that they probably prescribed you three strips a day because they knew that you were going to have to stretch it out because strips today is not usually the dose that's required. Most people kind of do okay on either one or two strips a day or one and a half.

289
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:53.340
Joan Kandel: Um, and that's probably why they prescribed that just because they were kind of looking out for you.

290
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.290
Joan Kandel: I give you a little bit extra

291
00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:04.110
Joan Kandel: So, but when we start you on Suboxone I don't think we're going to have to go that high of a dose, I think.

292
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:13.170
Joan Kandel: What I would suggest is that we start you on one strip a day for until we see you again on

293
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.350
Mr. Baca: A week from today. And they say, how you do this week.

294
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.910
Joan Kandel: Because I know you'll be feeling at least better on one strip a day, then you're feeling right now.

295
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.740
Mr. Baca: Yeah, really. Oh.

296
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:24.870
Joan Kandel: My dog.

297
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.710
Joan Kandel: Her name's Macy Gray.

298
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.290
Mr. Baca: Oh, I love it. Yeah.

299
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.090
Joan Kandel: She just she just left. She's

300
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.670
Joan Kandel: Great she she helps me out.

301
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:36.690
Yeah.

302
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.010
Mr. Baca: Yeah.

303
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:52.740
Joan Kandel: Um, so, uh, so I you know I think that that's a good starting place. If you find that after this week, you're still feeling withdrawals, or just not feeling normal than we can go up maybe to eight milligrams a day, but I think

304
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:59.520
Joan Kandel: I mean, just to 12 milligrams a day. But I think starting you at eight milligrams a day. It may be fine. And then

305
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:06.000
Joan Kandel: Yeah, because we're, we're going to try to figure out what your stable doses and not overshoot it

306
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.920
Joan Kandel: We don't want you to be more than you need.

307
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:15.690
Joan Kandel: But we want you to be feeling stable. We don't want you to feel you know withdrawals every day as it feels like it's wearing off.

308
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.850
Joan Kandel: Because ideally you should be able to take one strip or you take your dose in the morning.

309
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.130
Joan Kandel: And it lasts for a full 24 hours.

310
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.900
Joan Kandel: Before you start to feel sick.

311
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.060
Mr. Baca: Like the method of the Don't panic. Right.

312
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.670
Joan Kandel: Exactly what was your, what was your stable dose of methadone.

313
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.160
Mr. Baca: At 210 milligrams

314
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.230
Joan Kandel: Well, you are on a fairly high dose.

315
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.690
Mr. Baca: Yeah and that and that I would still feel like sweaty and

316
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.190
Mr. Baca: Then shaky, but I didn't want to go any higher because I

317
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.520
Joan Kandel: Yeah.

318
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:58.590
Mr. Baca: I didn't. I was trying not to take the medication to get high. I wasn't, you know, I was trying to get my body slowly used to being yeah me again without medication. So

319
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:09.180
Mr. Baca: Yeah and you know I was on a really high dose, but there were so many people that were up in like a 400. I'm like, No, no, no, no, that's too much for me.

320
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:16.650
Joan Kandel: And did you, how did you, how did you get down from that dose. Did you taper down

321
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.030
Mr. Baca: No, I

322
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.000
Mr. Baca: quit cold turkey.

323
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:22.140
Joan Kandel: Ouch.

324
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.080
Mr. Baca: Right back to the heroin and after I see

325
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:26.850
Joan Kandel: I see.

326
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.120
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. So that just through you.

327
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.330
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Well, that makes sense.

328
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.600
Joan Kandel: Because it's a pretty hard. I mean, you don't want to kick methadone.

329
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.000
Joan Kandel: Yes, painful, painful. Yeah.

330
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.560
Mr. Baca: Yeah, I know, I got a little taste of that I was like oh god no.

331
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.210
Joan Kandel: Right, so you are kind of a setup to to go back to using

332
00:28:51.480 --> 00:29:01.170
Joan Kandel: Yeah, because it's really hard to make it. Yeah. Um, well, we're we're through that phase. So that's good. You're in a much better place now to be starting

333
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.430
Mr. Baca: Yeah, get better.

334
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.430
Joan Kandel: Yeah, when you used to use heroin. How much were you using in a day.

335
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:17.460
Mr. Baca: It would vary because I was homeless and so it'd be like whatever I could panhandle however much I had

336
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:25.200
Mr. Baca: But it was usually in between one to two grams, unless I could get more

337
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:26.220
Okay.

338
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.410
Joan Kandel: And you would shoot that

339
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:29.520
Mr. Baca: Hey, yeah.

340
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:35.340
Joan Kandel: Uh huh. Did you ever have any bad abscesses or skin infections.

341
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:50.490
Mr. Baca: One time when I first started because I used to be a nurse, so I I know how to prep my skin and, you know, make sure that the needles are clean and don't care i i never shared needles.

342
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:56.430
Mr. Baca: Haha, I've been very protective disease and, you know,

343
00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:03.810
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Well, that is, it's impressive that and all that time you shooting you didn't have bad abscesses, so

344
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.200
Mr. Baca: Yeah, I know, I know how to take care of myself.

345
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.100
Mr. Baca: Why, yeah. When I was shooting up stuff so

346
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.580
Joan Kandel: Right.

347
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.920
Mr. Baca: I will prevent that kind of thing.

348
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:18.630
Joan Kandel: Right. And, um, how about HIV and hep C. You've been tested for those

349
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:19.890
Mr. Baca: Yeah, and I'm negative

350
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.460
Joan Kandel: For both good for you. Oh, that's great. Oh, that's good.

351
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:31.680
Joan Kandel: So as as part of this program will have you go do labs and we check that routinely

352
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:32.250
Mr. Baca: Check your

353
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.960
Joan Kandel: Liver and check those things. So did they tell you about going to the lab and getting those

354
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.620
Mr. Baca: Oh, no. No, they didn't. They didn't explain any of that to me.

355
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:50.220
Joan Kandel: Okay. So after we get off the call today. You might call back to the virtual clinic and talk to them about two things. Talk to them about your labs.

356
00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:57.810
Joan Kandel: Where to go to get those because they'll put in the order for the labs and they'll look it up. Look up your address and figure out where the closest places.

357
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:20.280
Joan Kandel: Okay. Um, so find out about labs and then about ACE so ACE is a stands for adverse childhood experiences. So it's a it's a questionnaire that you fill out. It's a very simple questionnaire and we we like to understand a little bit about how someone's childhood was so

358
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:40.380
Joan Kandel: It's called ace. Yeah. Because, because it's it's been powerfully shown that people who go through traumatic experiences as a child have a much higher rate of addiction and heart disease and lots of like physical

359
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:48.000
Joan Kandel: Problems and so it helps us to kind of understand a person when we can understand their childhood and what they've been through.

360
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.310
Mr. Baca: Okay that's good to know.

361
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.880
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. So lab and ace.

362
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.110
Joan Kandel: Two three letter words.

363
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.880
Mr. Baca: Let me say okay

364
00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.520
Joan Kandel: Thanks. So, so call them right after this and and

365
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:13.110
Joan Kandel: And then the other thing that they'll need to do. I guess this is a third thing to ask them about is, ask them to set you up with a with a therapy appointment, because we do individual therapy as well as group therapy.

366
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.130
Joan Kandel: At bright heart.

367
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.620
Joan Kandel: So they'll set you up with an individual therapist who is licensed in Arizona.

368
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:30.570
Joan Kandel: And then you'll be in the group with with me and another therapist, who's licensed in New Mexico because it's a new mexico group.

369
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:36.690
Joan Kandel: So it'll be a little bit disjointed because you're in Arizona. We're in New Mexico, but it won't. It'll be fairly seamless.

370
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:44.400
Joan Kandel: But the therapist that you see for individual therapy will need to be a therapist, who's licensed in Arizona. So they'll get you set up with that.

371
00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:45.780
Joan Kandel: So three things.

372
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.460
Joan Kandel: What are the three things you'll call them for

373
00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.090
Mr. Baca: Bad a and the therapist. Yeah.

374
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:53.520
Joan Kandel: Perfect.

375
00:32:53.610 --> 00:33:03.840
Joan Kandel: Okay. Um, so before I ask you some more medical questions I want to talk to you about the group. So the group is once a week.

376
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:16.110
Joan Kandel: And my group is on. I'm hoping that you can do this time it's on Wednesdays at 4pm New Mexico time which at this time of the year is 3pm your time.

377
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.400
Mr. Baca: Okay, yep.

378
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.150
Joan Kandel: Well that work.

379
00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.590
Joan Kandel: Yep. Okay, good.

380
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:23.580
Joan Kandel: Cuz he's talked about school and work and stuff. So I'm hoping that yeah

381
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:30.330
Mr. Baca: Right now, right now, I literally I if they in the house all day.

382
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.950
Joan Kandel: Perfect. Okay, great.

383
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.560
Mr. Baca: So that'll fit in. I'm, it doesn't. Okay.

384
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.190
Joan Kandel: Good. Okay.

385
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.400
Joan Kandel: So it'll be Wednesdays at 4pm

386
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.200
Joan Kandel: Which is 3pm your time.

387
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.610
Joan Kandel: And that's going to start next week. So, not today.

388
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:56.250
Joan Kandel: But, but next week and it's going to be. I'm the doctor in that group and Jessica is the therapist in that group, you'll like her, she's great. And that's actually a new group that we're starting

389
00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:01.200
Joan Kandel: So everyone who's going to be in that group is going to be just getting to know each other at the same time.

390
00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.180
Joan Kandel: So that'll be kind of nice.

391
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.010
Joan Kandel: Yeah yeah

392
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.300
Mr. Baca: That'd be great. Thank you.

393
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:18.390
Joan Kandel: Yeah, of course. That'll be good. So what you'll do anytime you have any kind of appointment is you go to the virtual clinic about a half an hour beforehand.

394
00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:19.680
Mr. Baca: Yeah, right.

395
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:21.390
Joan Kandel: You already did that.

396
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.200
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Yeah, you did that, today, right. You went to today.

397
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:37.860
Joan Kandel: Yeah. So anytime you have either a therapy appointment or a group appointment or an individual appointment with me and I'm also available for individual appointment so if you

398
00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.290
Joan Kandel: You know what we do in the group's

399
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:48.750
Joan Kandel: Is we do we take a portion of the group for a medical check in. So I asked people how they're doing on their dose if they need a refill.

400
00:34:48.930 --> 00:35:05.460
Joan Kandel: How things are. And it's pretty quick. And it doesn't go very in depth because you're doing it in front of everybody and stuff like that. So, um, so we tend to have that be a pretty quick. Part of the, the group visit and then the rest of it is more therapy stuff that we all do together.

401
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:20.280
Joan Kandel: So if, if ever there's a time that you want to talk to me about something medical and you don't really care to talk about it and in the group, just let me know that and make an appointment with me individual so that we can talk without

402
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.930
Joan Kandel: people paying attention.

403
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:27.930
Mr. Baca: Okay and and which really you know i don't i'm very blind.

404
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.670
Mr. Baca: With what I yeah I don't

405
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.840
Mr. Baca: Yeah, I mean, really, I don't care who

406
00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.080
Mr. Baca: Who has yeah I'm just over

407
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.530
Joan Kandel: Yeah well that's good that's, you know,

408
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.800
Joan Kandel: That's a good quality. The other thing though is if you do have some sort of issue that's going to take a

409
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.160
Mr. Baca: Lot.

410
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.970
Joan Kandel: More time

411
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:53.490
Joan Kandel: Right. We don't want to take the time of everybody in the group. So that would be another reason. Even if you didn't care if anybody paid attention.

412
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:54.090
Mr. Baca: Yeah yeah yeah

413
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.910
Joan Kandel: Just the time factor, there's that.

414
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.050
Joan Kandel: Okay Um okay so

415
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:12.210
Joan Kandel: Anything else I want to tell you about the program so yeah I there's a couple more things to tell you about the program before we

416
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:18.990
Joan Kandel: Before we do some more medical discussion. Um, so

417
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:28.950
Joan Kandel: To go along with the lab thing. So the first set of labs, you're going to have to go in person to the lab. They're going to draw your blood and they're going to collect some p for a drug screen.

418
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:48.000
Joan Kandel: After that we do about monthly we do drug screens, but they're going to be at at home. You don't have to go to a lab to do them so bright heart health will send you in the mail a kind of a bulky envelope that has a cup in it.

419
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.410
Joan Kandel: So when you get that don't open it.

420
00:36:53.580 --> 00:37:01.080
Joan Kandel: will actually give you like they'll, they'll like text you with when it's going to arrive, like a tracking number and stuff so you'll know when it's going to be there. Don't open it.

421
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.330
Joan Kandel: When you get it just call the virtual clinic and say, Hey, I got this envelope. What am I supposed to do.

422
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.910
Joan Kandel: And then they'll, they'll watch you open it.

423
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:13.200
Joan Kandel: They'll talk you through it. They'll have you go to the bathroom, bring it back and then show it on the camera.

424
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.970
Joan Kandel: Okay, we're not going to watch up

425
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:15.690
Okay.

426
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.040

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.200
Joan Kandel: Right, uh,

466
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.070

471
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.240
Joan Kandel: Yeah. So tell me about you and smoking. Let's talk about smoking.

472
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:15.540
Mr. Baca: And I used to be up to about two and a half packs a day until I went to jail.

473
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.560
Joan Kandel: Okay.

474
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:23.970
Mr. Baca: And then, um, now I've been kind of weaning myself into only being like half a pack a day.

475
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.050
Joan Kandel: Okay.

476
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.750
Mr. Baca: So I've gotten it down quite a bit, but

477
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:28.560
Joan Kandel: Yes, I

478
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:37.260
Mr. Baca: Was I was afraid to completely quit smoking right now because of the whole you know trying to stay clean and everything I

479
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:48.270
Mr. Baca: A rehab taught me. You know, they don't believe in stopping everything all at once because it sets you up to fail.

480
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:58.770
Mr. Baca: Uh huh. And I get really I try to control it as much as possible, but without nicotine. I mean, I get really mean.

481
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:00.030
Mr. Baca: Yeah.

482
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.560
Mr. Baca: And I don't like that.

483
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:10.230
Joan Kandel: I don't like. Right, right, right. So, at half a pack a day. Do you feel like that level of nicotine is

484
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.840
Mr. Baca: Can offer you a sometimes is more sometimes

485
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:25.620
Mr. Baca: You know, just depends on how I'm feeling. And if I'm, if I get too much into withdrawal than smoking actually makes me sick.

486
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:31.140
Mr. Baca: It makes me really nauseous and I can't stand the smell a bit so

487
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:36.240
Mr. Baca: Uh huh. And I then I stopped smoking, but then my body like where's

488
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.850
Mr. Baca: My digital yeah yeah yeah

489
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.040
Joan Kandel: It's, it's an addiction. It's a bad addiction and it really is. It's a tough one to quit.

490
00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:48.840
Joan Kandel: So I commend you for getting from two and a half packs a day to half a pack a day. That's great.

491
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:49.680
Mr. Baca: Yeah.

492
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:50.550
Joan Kandel: It really is.

493
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:55.860
Joan Kandel: I would, I would like to revisit this when you're feeling stable.

494
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.840
Joan Kandel: And really help you to

495
00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.280
Joan Kandel: To quit completely

496
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.740
Joan Kandel: That is that, yeah.

497
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.150
Joan Kandel: Is that a goal of yours.

498
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.350
Absolutely.

499
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:06.030
Joan Kandel: Okay.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.560
Joan Kandel: And be okay you know

501
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.450
I mean,

502
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:32.610
Mr. Baca: Most people nowadays, you know, I'm thinking of like off in the future. I mean, I would like to have a husband someday and and I don't want to have that cigarette, you know, addiction smell I you know I try not to. I can't smoke in the house. Here I have to go outside, but

503
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:45.600
Mr. Baca: Like in in Colorado, I would try not to smoke in my house because it always smelled so strong. When I would, you know, walk through the door, and I'm like, oh god, I can't

504
00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.460
Joan Kandel: Yeah yeah

505
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.110
Mr. Baca: Right.

506
00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.450
Joan Kandel: It's a love hate relationship.

507
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.100
Joan Kandel: Yeah, right. Yeah.

508
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:59.700
Joan Kandel: Right. Yeah. Well, let's, uh, you know, not now, but in the in the near future, let's let's tackle that

509
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.440
Joan Kandel: Okay, because

510
00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.340
Joan Kandel: It would be nice to have Mr. Buck of a nonsmoker

511
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.480
Mr. Baca: Yes, it would. And when it my lungs would very much appreciate it.

512
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.470
Joan Kandel: Very much.

513
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.020
Joan Kandel: Very much. And so did your wallet.

514
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.170
Mr. Baca: Yeah, I know. It's getting expensive. It's

515
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:21.690
Joan Kandel: Really, it's really expensive. So yes, that's something that we can work on

516
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.240
Joan Kandel: The other thing that I want to talk to you about that we

517
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.010
Joan Kandel: Can we can work on is, is your chronic pain. So tell me about your chronic pain.

518
00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:33.360
Mr. Baca: And I started okay so

519
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:39.630
Mr. Baca: 1112 years ago I lost my son, he died.

520
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:48.660
Mr. Baca: Oh, he was on who he was. Thank you. And he was only two weeks old, and he died from fiddes

521
00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:59.160
Mr. Baca: This was just a random like a friend of mine knew how much I wanted to be a father and she. I mean, we

522
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.260
Mr. Baca: Got her pregnant and she got pregnant on the first try.

523
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:11.880
Mr. Baca: Wow, I was so excited. And his name was Benton di n to n and

524
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:34.290
Mr. Baca: He was the light of my life, and he died. I was like, I blame. I mean, I blame myself, to this day, I still blame myself because I feel like I did something wrong when I put him to bed and and i know you know I've got the medical knowledge. I know, since it happened.

525
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.240
Mr. Baca: There's really no reason

526
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.700
Mr. Baca: No line with yeah but it's hard not to blame myself.

527
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.590
Mr. Baca: Yeah, and

528
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.560
Mr. Baca: Losing him was really hard.

529
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.620
Joan Kandel: Really hard. Yeah.

530
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:50.190
And

531
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:56.730
Mr. Baca: After I lost him. I started drinking really bad and

532
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:04.050
Mr. Baca: I don't remember. Six months after that and because I was a drunk. So Matt and

533
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:17.280
Mr. Baca: And so I was born with scoliosis of my back. And then when I started drinking really heavily I had three different car accidents and the last one should have killed me.

534
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:27.690
Mr. Baca: I was in a small car and I went under the tires of a diesel truck a diesel truck literally crushed my car into it so they can

535
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:35.910
Mr. Baca: Oh my gosh, yeah. And so the fact that I survived that car accident is amazing.

536
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:36.720
Yeah.

537
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.020
Mr. Baca: But now my back is so

538
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:45.690
Mr. Baca: Screwed up and they want like I've got a bone to marry it's benign, but it

539
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.530
Mr. Baca: Went on

540
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:53.700
Mr. Baca: On one of my vertebrae and they want to remove it and put in mesh and screws and rods, and I'm like, no.

541
00:45:55.050 --> 00:46:01.830
Mr. Baca: My mom had back surgery. My dad has had four back surgeries and they have messed them. I mean, they messed them up.

542
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:08.610
Mr. Baca: Oh, and so I'm like, No, I'm not doing that I'm I will do it when I have to

543
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:15.630
Mr. Baca: Write if it grows and I start, you know, not getting to the point where I can't walk and all that, then fine.

544
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.060
Mr. Baca: Yeah, and killed in know

545
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.170
Yeah.

546
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.320
Joan Kandel: Well, I totally I totally get that. Um, one thing that I want to

547
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:34.500
Joan Kandel: Talk to you about is that we have in bright heart. We have a pain specialist. Her name is Dr. Jackson.

548
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:44.040
Joan Kandel: She's WONDERFUL. AND SHE DOESN'T prescribe meds. She doesn't do surgery but she helps people to cope with their chronic pain and

549
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:45.600
Joan Kandel: Realizing that it's

550
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:56.370
Joan Kandel: That it's there and how to make the best of it and we can't make it go away. But we can treat it in terms of helping you deal with it and minimize the amount of pain that you're having

551
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.830
Joan Kandel: Through a more natural thing.

552
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:04.290
Joan Kandel: Yeah. Yeah, right. So one of the things we can do is get you set up with her.

553
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:16.770
Joan Kandel: For an individual appointment so she can talk to you about the kind of pain that you're having and how you're dealing with it and talk to you about, you know, nutritional things. We also have a nutritionist and to kind of get you to be able to

554
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:22.770
Joan Kandel: To live with that pain for as long as possible without having to have surgery.

555
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.880
Joan Kandel: Right, that's what are your goals and priorities around your chronic pain.

556
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:42.090
Mr. Baca: I'm honestly. Sometimes it's so unbearable. But right now I'm like I've been every time I start to get that pain and the

557
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:57.420
Mr. Baca: Pain that shoots down my legs and I go and I take a hot bath or a hot shower with mentally did bath salts and I read myself down with menthol cream and ointment every day.

558
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:07.140
Mr. Baca: And so I mean I'm managing right now. It's not as bad as it gets.

559
00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:15.720
Mr. Baca: Yeah, but, um, I know I'll never be without pain. I know that is just better management.

560
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:30.450
Mr. Baca: You know, some right now is is going to be like I can do. I mean, I'm not sure. Because right now like Seventh Day Adventist are Vegan Vegetarian so I'm on a really healthy diet.

561
00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.230
Haha

562
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:37.410
Mr. Baca: My brother has had me slowly start to work out and stuff.

563
00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:45.090
Mr. Baca: Uh huh. So, you know, I'm trying to do things to manage by myself, but it would be

564
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:45.510
Joan Kandel: Now,

565
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.870
Mr. Baca: You know, if there were like vitamins. I could add in or

566
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:49.920
Joan Kandel: Somehow

567
00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:55.080
Mr. Baca: To make my body be less aggressive against my, you know, again,

568
00:48:55.170 --> 00:49:04.020
Joan Kandel: Yeah, yeah. So it sounds to me like your goal is to is to kind of maximize the management.

569
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:11.130
Joan Kandel: And trying to cope with it. Well, that sounds, that sounds very doable. Dr. Jackson also has groups of

570
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:25.500
