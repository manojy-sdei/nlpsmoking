Walk away.

163
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

164
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.810
iPhone: Yeah. That totally makes sense. Sorry. Can I get situated.

165
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:07.830
That's okay.

166
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:17.400
iPhone: I don't want to just kind of get away from it all. I really want my like routine. I like that.

167
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

168
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:26.010
iPhone: Though like starting to like, you know, they out when I can go to bed and everything. And right now it's just like

169
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.520
iPhone: All show again. Yeah.

170
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.870
iPhone: Until like 630 and like

171
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.400
iPhone: Just gotta

172
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.410
iPhone: Sleep again, I'm like, you know, three hours.

173
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything gets thrown off with stuff like this.

174
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know everything.

175
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the one thing that we don't like is change.

176
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Misery.

177
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Until identify change.

178
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:10.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the crazy. I think for me the craziest part about that is that life is always changing and evolving. You know what it means all the time.

179
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:16.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And it's a one concept that when we get into recovery we start building a routine.

180
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:24.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We're learning how to live life sober something gets thrown in our path and it can just throw us all over the place, you know,

181
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:35.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The great part about it though, too, is that we have this uncanny ability to be extremely resilient.

182
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.430
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And to really manage within

183
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:52.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: We might not realize that we have that ability or think that we're doing it, but you're actually doing it and don't even know you're doing it. It's kind of crazy. The whole process but

184
00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:05.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because of your past life experiences. You know what I mean it's built up this this ability to don't have to like it, but I'm going to have to walk through it.

185
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:12.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know type of subconscious way of thinking and so

186
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you've got to remember that to your very resilient.

187
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And this is only a moment in time.

188
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:23.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that is vitally important that you stay connected to your friends to

189
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:31.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To me to, you know, people that support and support you where you're at, you know what I mean.

190
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:34.500
Have you

191
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Libya, I think you and I talked about this before but refresh my memory.

192
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you been attending any meetings.

193
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.770
iPhone: I do the online groups.

194
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.240
iPhone: Good.

195
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:49.680
iPhone: Try runs

196
00:15:51.570 --> 00:16:01.560
iPhone: I definitely prefer that. And you know, it's been super accessible over the last two weeks, which you know that's been

197
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:13.380
iPhone: Cool, there's, you know, you just type in like anything at all. You can be in a group and like two seconds at anytime of the day. And that's been nice.

198
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:22.890
iPhone: Like, you know, the whole world is kind of at a standstill right now so I there's people from like all over going through stuff. So it's been interesting to see.

199
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:33.000
iPhone: So I've been staying connected with that at that I haven't really like outside of those two events I talked about going to the beach and getting the chicken sandwich. I have a web my house.

200
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:35.610
iPhone: Well,

201
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:38.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

202
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I hear you meet either

203
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:49.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me either. I'm right with you. I've been outside in the world twice, I think, and one was to run into a store.

204
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:51.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Quickly.

205
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And again, it's about being

206
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:08.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Resilient it's about, you know, working within the scope that you're have been given to work with them and being able to manage anxiety around it.

207
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:20.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, paying attention to where you're getting your information from allowing yourself permission to watch it for a limited amount of time and then put it aside and go about your day, you know,

208
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:34.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because if not, that the news alone can just spiral anxiety and you know out of control, depression, out of control and fear a lot of fear.

209
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.520
iPhone: You know,

210
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And powerlessness.

211
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:40.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

212
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:50.460
iPhone: I was like, you know, having so much and communication in the palm of your hand is like, you know, it's a great thing, but it's also

213
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:57.450
iPhone: Now an intimidating thing and that's kind of like an overwhelming amount of information about everything.

214
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.140
iPhone: You can just, you know, keep clicking

215
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah, you know, and I also noticed that

216
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:14.700
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A lot of the media news, they always talk about. And if this happens and if that happens and it's this

217
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:15.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know happens

218
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So they sit in the what ifs.

219
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:23.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the crazy part about it is that, you know, being an early recovery. That's not a good place to be.

220
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, at all.

221
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that is a fear based place that is a uncomfortable place.

222
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:39.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And with you know people that are trying to get their life together. And the whole world is listening to what ifs. You know what I mean.

223
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:47.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Give me the facts. What's tell me what's happening today so that I can, you know, adjust whatever I need to adjust for it.

224
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But that's as far as what I want

225
00:18:52.350 --> 00:19:00.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want to know about, you know, what is, you know, because what else may never happen. But if we get a lot of them. This is where they stay

226
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

227
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:11.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The crazy part about addiction. Is any of that negativity, it will grab ahold of and try to compound it in any way it possibly

228
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:19.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Can you know and so being being mindful and being aware of your thought process being aware when you're bored.

229
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, paying attention to being hungry angry lonely tired. Right.

230
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those are really important.

231
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:36.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know that you were working, you know, a lot of hours. I know that your schedule was really kind of weird right

232
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:47.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so I know that being on lockdown for 12 days sucks, but if you change it to minded. If you change that thought in your head to

233
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what right now is a good time that I can get the rest

234
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That I need

235
00:19:55.650 --> 00:20:02.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From working crazy hours so revamp refresh. So when work comes back. I'll be ready to roll. You know,

236
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:17.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm really putting putting good things inside your mind, you know, watching funny movies. You know what I mean. Playing fun games with your friends. You know, it means doing things that make you happy.

237
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:24.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is really important in a time you know like this where you know the whole world feels like it's out of control.

238
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:27.570
iPhone: Yeah.

239
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.360

240
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.840
iPhone: But I like, you know, yeah, pretty much like makeup videos.

241
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:41.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Nice.

242
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:50.370
iPhone: Yeah, watch a lot of that and like you know Tech Talk is so nice because literally like, you know, 30 seconds.

243
00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.500
iPhone: That's good, Phil. And I'm just like, trying to take it a moment at a time, you know,

244
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.400
Yeah.

245
00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.640

246
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:10.440
iPhone: Let me take my thoughts and like run with them. Yeah, I can definitely do that.

247
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.130
iPhone: I definitely do that all the time.

248
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:22.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, yeah, we really have to pay attention to, especially you know in high stress times you know where our mind is taking us

249
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because remember your disease lives in your mind.

250
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:39.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, and it's easy for for him to sneak, you know, little negative thoughts in there. And when you can identify that that's what's happening. You know what I mean, you gain control of that.

251
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if you're feeding your mind positive

252
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: positive energy you're feeding your mind positive thoughts, combating the negative. That's what's going to grow.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, whatever you feed grows

254
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So if you're feeding them the negativity and you're feeding you know those

255
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those. What if thoughts, then that's you're going to be filled with fear.

256
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, but

257
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:04.950

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.670
