1
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.449
Gwenevere Abriel: What what hospital.

2
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.690
Lauraluj87: Drain, they just released me know

3
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What was going on a

4
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.540
Lauraluj87: Lot of things can be

5
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.610
Lauraluj87: Pneumonia or

6
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.040
Lauraluj87: Or

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.820
Lauraluj87: The Kobe. They have no idea.

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I did you tested.

9
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.840
Lauraluj87: Tested I don't have the Kobe thank god. Okay.

10
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And what did they think that was going on.

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.630
Lauraluj87: There's an asthma exasperation, or something like that.

12
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So what what what happened did something

13
00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:03.900
Lauraluj87: With something going on. Well, yeah, like my side was hurting really bad. So I went in, or whatever, and they had me on morphine T trying to figure out what the wrong, whatever. And, um,

14
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.610
Lauraluj87: And I told them that you know I was hurting, and I couldn't really have the whole time. And I don't know.

15
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a discharge. I bet you have it right in your man.

16
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.830
Yeah.

17
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.180
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

18
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what does it say as far as they have to come up with some sort of diagnosis or something. They were trying to rule out. Does it say what that was.

19
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.730
Lauraluj87: Your primary diagnosis was not

20
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:55.800
Lauraluj87: Included acute respiratory failure with history of methamphetamine abuse opioid dependence abdominal pain, generalized opioid use disorders here in early remission.

21
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So they knew about the opioid use. I wonder why was there any discussion around

22
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Using additional buprenorphine. Was there any discussion at all, or they just like how was the decision of pain management addressed.

23
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:28.830
Lauraluj87: They told me to talk to my doctor and just talk to you guys like a second week about, um, about whether the, what's it called ships are working or not. And I said, Why don't think that there. I mean, like, basically, they are you having. Are you still having symptoms like you know

24
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:38.640
Lauraluj87: Creamy season as well. Yeah. Obviously. And they said, Okay mommy talking about getting out of stronger strippers. I don't know.

25
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so those are separate, hold on, let's, we can talk about that in a minute. What I'm asking you about is when anybody goes to the dentist or they go to a hospital.

26
00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I can see in their diagnosis that they're aware that you have an opioid and math right chemical dependence, you have a history. I read, I just heard it.

27
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm asking is, before I asked you to read that paper.

28
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You said they put me on morphine and oxy before that. What I'm wondering is if. Was there any conversation with the physician. Wait, this is my drug of choice. I'm in an MIT program. I'm on buprenorphine. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We got to talk about my pain management.

29
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.550
Was any of them.

30
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.950
Lauraluj87: I told them that I was on. I went in. I mean, tea or whatever for

31
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.100
Lauraluj87: Me because I am I don't, I'm not dependent on that. Nevermind.

32
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.870
Lauraluj87: Okay.

33
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on.

34
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got to slow down a little bit buprenorphine.

35
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: What it does is it sits on the opioid receptors, because it is an opiate

36
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It is a long acting opiate

37
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That are you with me.

38
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

39
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So what it did when you were coming off of a no, it's not your drug of choice, but you know your body doesn't distinguish. It's still going to create tolerance for heroin for roxy's it's still going to develop it, whether you like that one or not.

40
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It's still going to develop a tolerance for it. So what that you pornography is doing or was doing before this hospitals day was sitting on those opiate receptors so that you didn't have to have a full cold turkey experience.

41
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you get that part.

42
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Now I want to hear about. I want to hear. Now I want to hear about the mess. Now I want to hear. Tell me more. Because if your assumption, your thought was will all be on this, the pornography and it will address my cravings for math was that the thinking

43
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.410
Lauraluj87: Yeah, okay.

44
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And where did you get that that message from who who informed you that way.

45
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.670
Lauraluj87: Everyone

46
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

47
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.620
Lauraluj87: There's a that you take Suboxone now craving.

48
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: For

49
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Us. Okay. So there's a few things.

50
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What let's just back up a little bit.

51
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you, how do you define a craving let's let's get into terms, a little bit into that and then we'll see if

52
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.040
We're

53
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.390
Lauraluj87: Marking said something during

54
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.470
Okay.

55
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So I was going through this in group, the other day, we had this really long discussion. A lot of fun, actually. And

56
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about it like this. See this green pen.

57
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.050
Yeah.

58
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think about that green pen as

59
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll notice it as a thought.

60
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.830
Lauraluj87: What

61
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: A talk

62
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: But what it may actually have started with this first we're going to call this the craving. It may have been

63
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: From a smell something you saw something you're around, it was similar to a memory. It could have come out of nowhere. But this first one.

64
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes if it happens out of the blue. We didn't do it on purpose. Meaning, oh well at two o'clock every day. I'm going to think about math. You know, like we don't do it on purpose, it just. Am I right, like, don't be sometimes doesn't a craving come out of nowhere.

65
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: The thought to us. Oh, I could use right now. Oh my gosh, this would be really fun. I remember I had a really good time. I could be doing such a better job right now write down the first one.

66
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.140
Lauraluj87: Okay.

67
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it's a question. Has your first craving.

68
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it seem like he comes out of the blue.

69
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's this green pen.

70
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we just defined our terms the craving that first unconscious awareness of I could use

71
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Comes out of nowhere. Now the science behind that we're going to put a pin in that for a second because I want to talk to you about this metaphor. So this is the first thought. You have a choice at that point.

72
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: To either

73
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Have the attic talk about it or Laura talk about it. There are two different voices the attic says, Oh, yeah.

74
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember that. That was great. And you know what we could do it once and no one's gonna know and it's going to be awesome. And we're going to feel better or you get so much done. And then everybody will love us. It's gonna be fantastic. Right.

75
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm glad you're laughing Um

76
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's, it's kind of a turkey because it doesn't actually care about this one, which is

77
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to, I want to go to school. I want a job. I want a family. I want a healthy body. I want to be.

78
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.620
Gwenevere Abriel: A substance free. These two are in opposition.

79
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right total opposition.

80
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And what it comes down to is how much time you spend listening to the addict and it's seductive, like, Come on, baby. He'll be great.

81
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to feel, it'll be awesome. Okay, minerals, good times here. Here's another. Here's another one. Here's another one.

82
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: The tricky bit is

83
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Being able to say, shut the F up

84
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I prefer not to be polite, because I think this this part of us this voice doesn't give them

85
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.740
Lauraluj87: Yeah, you need to move to that part of your

86
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

87
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:09.990
Again,

88
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Cuz all y'all keep that door cracked open and you kind of like, well, I don't want to be too mean to it. What is it completely. Well, I say let's really be nasty with it.

89
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.530
Lauraluj87: Yes, I asked how much you want to continue

90
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

91
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to what the craving is

92
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how craving is that first

93
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Trigger, you got triggered some red flag just happened. Maybe it was prompted by

94
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: fear, uncertainty seeing someone's face hearing someone's voice and intrusive memory trepidation fear about the future, something about the past, maybe right now. I hate this moment, this is awful. I feel pain. I don't know what this was.

95
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But this was unconscious and it came about from nowhere. Our choice comes in on what we do next.

96
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You can either keep feeding it like oh yeah right here sciatic side.

97
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Or we can shut it down. Let's shut the F up and we can talk about. You know what I'm gonna give this therapy, a shot, I'm gonna get up out of this system. I'm going to finish this.

98
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain in the tush probation, parole pre trial nonsense. I'm going to healthy, healthy, healthy, happy relationship. I'm going to move away from dad. That's for sure. And I'm going to raise people if I do decide to have a family. I'll raise them healthy with strong boundaries loving themselves.

99
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Got to be able to stay in that voice. So notice

100
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You thinking maybe buprenorphine will completely get rid of this right

101
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.550
Lauraluj87: Right.

102
00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: It does help.

103
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.690
Lauraluj87: What do you mean

104
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It does help. I think it does. Here's what I've heard, the doctors say it helps with the cravings around buprenorphine. It helps with alcohol. I haven't heard them say that it helps with the

105
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That with the math, but I don't see why it's not exactly the same.

106
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:26.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you've already told me or you told the doctors, it doesn't seem to be helping

107
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.750
Gwenevere Abriel: We told them in the hospital. I'm still having these right

108
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:45.060
Lauraluj87: They kind of told me that actually can be honest with you I wasn't like saving. I wasn't like crazy and they told me I was, and then it was like, oh, okay, well, yeah, I mean,

109
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.590
Lauraluj87: Because it was kind of like

110
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.490
Lauraluj87: Like I wasn't there because of my mess withdrawn or whatever it was just, I was there because I was having

111
00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.730
Lauraluj87: And then they told me. Okay. Well, I used to use matter whatever did you shoot heroin and as well. Yeah.

112
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:13.650
Lauraluj87: But I've been talking since February 20 like I haven't used since then. And then after but it was like after that word was pro. I thought I focused on was. Oh, hey. She was a user

113
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.610
Lauraluj87: Oh yeah, you're probably having cravings. Well, here's what a healthy

114
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see. Okay, so they put it in your head so

115
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It was they treated you.

116
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a drug addict. Right.

117
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm sorry that happened.

118
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.010
Lauraluj87: I mean, they found out that I was having asthma aspiration.

119
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.210
Lauraluj87: Good.

120
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: They better because that's why you went to the hospital. I'm assuming that you weren't going there drug seeking

121
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.850
Lauraluj87: So know something

122
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.980
Lauraluj87: But they treated like that sooner than that. And it was like, no. Cool. Great.

123
00:12:50.610 --> 00:13:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. And so the sooner you can really articulate clearly hey listen doc and nurse I'm receiving buprenorphine so that I don't crave opiates.

124
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm already in a treatment program. I'm like, Hey, guys. No, no. Don't get distracted by that I need to talk about. I can't breathe. I can't. I've got this pain with someone just called you.

125
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.550
Lauraluj87: And

126
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So you'll get more and more rehearsed it when knowing what to do when people get distracted by that part of that history.

127
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be able to get through it quickly and just say, yeah, that's I already own that part, I'm already in treatment for it, but I'm presenting here my chief complaint is rest. I can't breathe. I got this pain that

128
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:45.690
Gwenevere Abriel: If y'all want to talk to my doctor bright heart health. You can you can talk about buprenorphine with them. Here's a release of information.

129
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:57.090
Lauraluj87: Yeah okay so they couldn't find that was the problem. They couldn't find it. I was getting the my strips that usually because they couldn't find anywhere in the system. I guess they tried to pull the P AMP T or whatever.

130
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes no sense it of course it's there. So your doctor is Dr. Aubrey out right

131
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:10.860
Lauraluj87: Right. Yeah. I think that the reason why they can't pull it because they're not giving me more than like $70 right

132
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I will have her look at it. I will

133
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.120
Lauraluj87: Know, weird but

134
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:24.540
Lauraluj87: They got treated me like I was getting it illegally. I'm like, I swear to God, I have a script at home. I give you my bottle.

135
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.550
Lauraluj87: Right here legally. And they're like, No, no, it's okay if you are. I'm like, oh,

136
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What a mess. Let me just, can I messaged her and have her pull your p&p

137
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.460
Lauraluj87: I was because I don't know. I don't know why that

138
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:55.260
Lauraluj87: They tried they tried to pull him here, whatever, and they couldn't pull it up. But there's nothing that said anything about the strips on it and I was like, I swear to God I'm not taking a single and then they kept saying it's okay. You are. And I'm like, I'm not

139
00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.250
Lauraluj87: I'm like, God damn it.

140
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm so I just wrote her and I said, Can you pull her p&p. Um, and then she'll ask me why. And I'll just tell her. Why, okay.

141
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.010
Lauraluj87: I mean, I mean, that doesn't matter because you know I'm out of the hospital or

142
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.180
What

143
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, but it's good for us to know because maybe there's something going on. And this might lead to understanding. Let's, let's do it because I should be doing it anyway. With every client. So she may already have one. Let's just see. Alright, so let's get to

144
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You went into the hospital because you missed Tuesday group.

145
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: When did you go

146
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.400
Lauraluj87: Last Tuesday at 1pm

147
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.840
Oh,

148
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.160
Lauraluj87: Good. Oh, I miss I miss my I O P to

149
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

150
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So I want to talk a little bit for a second about the texting. I don't want to

151
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: My okay let me let me rephrase, let me try this again.

152
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: The message that I received

153
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: This one.

154
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is you

155
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.270
Lauraluj87: That's not me.

156
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm showing it to you.

157
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I received a message.

158
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Plan.

159
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:41.880
Lauraluj87: Okay.

160
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on, let me try again. I think

161
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, hold on, hold on, I made a mistake. Hold on, I want to show you something else.

162
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is it.

163
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.330
Lauraluj87: Can't find it. Yeah.

164
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Just a second is really important that I know who I'm communicating on text. It's like, Give me just a second to work this out or you

165
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Just working

166
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is just let's forget that one. I'm actually here.

167
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

168
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Oh.

169
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So bizarre.

170
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Be in here.

171
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, was not until 23 No no no no no no now now.

172
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And who is that

173
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

174
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

175
00:18:49.440 --> 00:19:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Just give me another second. If I can't find it. I'll have to. I'll just do my best to describe it to you and then we'll have to take it from there. I'm trying. Because this makes no sense that it wouldn't be sitting in my texts from last night. Let me just try it on my message on my computer.

176
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

177
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm just gonna have to describe it to you and just the way life is. As soon as we hang up today I'll be able to find it. The bottom line, I received a message that sounded something like this.

178
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: She doesn't have a phone. It doesn't work like not at all.

179
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.090
Lauraluj87: Okay.

180
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that you

181
00:19:53.400 --> 00:20:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Know. Okay, so I received a message from a number, and I don't understand where it is right now. I'm kind of like weirded out by that but someone communicated that you that your phone was not working, like, not at all.

182
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And

183
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I say

184
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh. Yeah, I know, that's why I'm talking about it because I was very confused because then

185
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I got a message from you, kind of like not acknowledging that there's something going on.

186
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to determine

187
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know.

188
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.640
Lauraluj87: Anything I should make my my messages to you more direct instead of more general instead of general

189
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So Laura, I'm going to tell you a hypothesis. But you guess that I'm, I'm, I'm guessing something. Can I share something with you. Yeah.

190
00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So Laura I'm concerned. Someone just texted me last night that was not you

191
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: On your phone was anyone in the hospital room over the last three days.

192
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:11.250
Now,

193
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh, I don't understand how this happened then.

194
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because she this person said, oh,

195
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on.

196
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I know what happened.

197
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I confuse two people, I think, last night I was thinking this message was coming.

198
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: From you.

199
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I

200
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.060
Lauraluj87: Told you I was hospitalized.

201
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, now I think this was my error.

202
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it's me. So let's drop that let's let's say

203
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:56.790
Lauraluj87: Okay.

204
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel so much better.

205
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel better. And I'm sorry to put that alert in your head.

206
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Because sometimes people grab someone else's phone and if something looks weird. I stopped texting. If I ever thinks it's not you.

207
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, I will just

208
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop and does that make sense.

209
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.050
Yeah.

210
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway, okay, sorry, I didn't mean to divert all that time into that, but now I feel better. Like, nobody's in your room.

211
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Making

212
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Making a crap about you. Okay. Um, so once you tell me a little bit about what is about to happen in the next weekend. What's coming up for you any changes.

213
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.890
Lauraluj87: No, not really.

214
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.620
Lauraluj87: Um, my boyfriend and I are going to be at home with the cat.

215
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.900
Lauraluj87: My cat is about it.

216
00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.430
Lauraluj87: Okay.

217
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.140
Lauraluj87: Tell me two days.

218
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to know how frequently those you know how we just did this thing, this is going to be our craving. Um, how, how often do they come at you. How many times a day, or how many times a minute, like how how frequent

219
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:17.970
Lauraluj87: Maybe like once a day.

220
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Or once a day, and how do you counter it. How do you get rid of that. Nice.

221
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.500
Lauraluj87: I just

222
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: hope someone just called

223
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:38.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm really, I'm working hard here to not feel nauseous myself his screen is living so much you moving around so much

224
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

225
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.450
Lauraluj87: Sorry, my boyfriend miscarried me

226
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go over to this idea of

227
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming once a day and then tell me again what you do to counter it to kind of get it out of your head.

228
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're muted. So I can't hear you.

229
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: you're muted.

230
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And hit the mute button.

231
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.160
Lauraluj87: Get it.

232
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, got it.

233
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what are you doing to counteract that initial trigger. What do you put in your head. What distraction techniques are you doing, what are you doing right away.

234
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.140
Lauraluj87: I'm ignoring it.

235
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.440
Lauraluj87: Just, I just think about my life with the IT WAS HORRIBLE, MY

236
00:24:58.890 --> 00:24:59.970
Lauraluj87: Bad like really bad.

237
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that that negative consequences. So that, that's a good one for a lot of people

238
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.110
Lauraluj87: I mean, was I almost died on it. I mean, that alone is enough reason to stay over

239
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, it is that, but that I

240
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:20.400
Lauraluj87: Almost like straight up like I got I'm already got. I was 85 pounds. I mean, that's ridiculous.

241
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

242
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And has it cost you other health conditions that substance use history.

243
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.350
Lauraluj87: Not that I know of.

244
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.880
Lauraluj87: But like I said, just the fact that I almost died that reason alone with Jesus.

245
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:40.290
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

246
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a good one. So notice how if we, if we look at these two voices. If we say, what was the romantic thought the one that kind of seem like it came from the addict voice. What was the the invitation to come. Use in your head. If it sounded like something. What does it sound like

247
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.350
Lauraluj87: I'M HI, I'M

248
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.690
Lauraluj87: I'll make everything numb.

249
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one. I'll make everything now. And guess what you the authentic self came in and said,

250
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Right. How about my problems are still going to be here, dumb ass. And you know what, you almost fucking killed me.

251
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.350
Lauraluj87: Yeah, straight

252
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's how harsh. We've got to be to that we've got it.

253
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to be that firm because it doesn't care about you and only once the next high

254
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: We've got to be that firm. So I think you've already got it in you, you went, what more evidence. Do I need You almost killed me.

255
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't care about

256
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:56.190
Lauraluj87: That, that alone is enough reason to stay sober and that's why whenever I was in the hospital or whatever they have asked me, have you used recently. I'm like, No, I'm like what

257
00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.670
Lauraluj87: Like really, like, No, I have not.

258
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: All they would have to do is

259
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't all you could have said, Well, give me a drug test, you'll see if you do the metabolite for the buprenorphine. You'll see that that's in my system go drug test me, feel free to take a urine.

260
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.630
Lauraluj87: And I guess they did. And then, and then there were, there was abusing the bluefin over there.

261
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.850
Lauraluj87: Right right right was like, Oh, great.

262
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.100
Lauraluj87: Oh my god. There you go.

263
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:24.630
You know why.

264
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:31.050
Lauraluj87: Because like I said whenever they tried to pull that thing they couldn't find it. And they're like, Okay, well, it's OK. You are. I'm like,

265
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so listen

266
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really proud of you because you've got you could have gotten really mad at them but you kind of went you know what something went sideways. Maybe it's the recording of the medication or you don't, you and I don't know.

267
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But you didn't like turn it into an excuse to rage and be indignant, you did something kind of cool, we kind of went like whatever nothing but a thing, right.

268
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a process.

269
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:02.730
Lauraluj87: And

270
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.440
Lauraluj87: I guess obviously something went wrong and then like, it's not my fault.

271
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That's right.

272
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.670

317
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But they gave you one you

318
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Have an eight milligram tablet. I'm guessing.

319
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And when did you last take that eight milligram tablet.

320

321
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what are you are you tell me how you're presenting now any symptoms of any kind, right now.

322
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.090

Lauraluj87: I'm good after. Oh my god.

326
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.110
So,

327
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.790
Lauraluj87: Isn't it wasn't pointless to give me the morphine. Like, there we go.

328
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:13.950
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

329
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That was the way it was a waste of resources and I, ya know,

330
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.200
Lauraluj87: My thought

331
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.390
Lauraluj87: On top of this box and

332
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: All they needed to do was coordinate with you Dr. But very few hospitals will take the time to do that.

333
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're going to, you're going to learn. You're going to talk with the doctor more if this ever happens again, you're going to know more about what to do. Okay, it's going to get easier, you're going to be more sort of empowered with knowledge of what to do. Um,

334
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's get you

335
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.640
Lauraluj87: morphing then right they wasted it. Right.

336
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.330
Yeah.

337
00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

338
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you know I want a chance to hear a little bit about how long you've known your boyfriend. Tell me a little bit about that relationship.

339
00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.290
Lauraluj87: I've known him for like five years.

340
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:07.980
Lauraluj87: We've been together on and off for like a year and a half, but we got serious probably about nine months ago.

341
00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.240
Lauraluj87: Okay, let me rephrase that I am curious like nine months ago.

342
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Long before that.

343
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:24.510
Lauraluj87: Okay. He's been with me for probably three years, but I haven't been that, sir. Okay, so on so

344
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the turning point for you what happened that you're like, You know what,

345
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:39.630
Lauraluj87: I realized that he actually cares like whenever I ended up here for like a date right and it scared the crap. I mean, whatever.

346
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:52.890
Lauraluj87: Um, and during that danger or whatever, I realized that, oh my god, I know. No one's here, you know, everything's gotten my money's gone the Octagon people that are around, they're gone known Harrison, let me know.

347
00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.620
Lauraluj87: And I thought in my head, I'm like who actually cares

348
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:05.700
Lauraluj87: He does like even though I pushed him away. Even though I, you know, hold them accountable show, whatever. I know that about a column right now and say, hey, I need you he'd be right there.

349
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:12.660
Lauraluj87: So that was enough to call him and time. Hi. Oh, hi, how are you

350
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.580
Lauraluj87: So I got back with him.

351
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So you like his loyalty

352
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.940
Lauraluj87: Yeah, plus, plus the fact that, like I said, with him.

353
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:32.100
Lauraluj87: He cares. Like I said, I keep not just gonna put it this way. I know I was in Europe for a month and I saw some on Joe

354
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:39.540
Lauraluj87: And I wasn't ever worried when cheating on I know for a fact that he's not gonna he's not gonna that's not him.

355
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:49.050
Lauraluj87: And everyone was like oh my god man's gonna you know my man's gonna do this, I'm doing this, you know, my man talking to this chicken. Like I know he's at home playing video games like, you know what I mean like you

Lauraluj87: I mean, if anything, I was the one that was out there, you know, doing all the stuff for us. And, you know, he would just he wouldn't do anything. And granted, I mean I got my daily dose T, you know, at the end of the day, I ended up screen.

358
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.890
Lauraluj87: I stuff over kind of by doing what I was doing. But it's okay because I learned from it.

383
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:14.190
Okay.

384
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So the thing that I had asked, Was that the email being there. It was really important to me and it didn't get in

385
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Say,

386
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:35.310
Lauraluj87: Hmm.

387
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish it was in there. I'm not gonna lie I do kind of wish it was there. That's what we're talking about here. So Anthony Carter, one of the reasons why is because I'm

388
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to, I want to email him. I want to email the letter. Have you ever asked for a letter it because I don't really do faxing don't have, you know,

389
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.510
Like a

390
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:56.940
Lauraluj87: Picture of it. I don't know.

391
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.060
Lauraluj87: Um,

392
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that. Listen, Laura.

393
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.200
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

394
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I have the email. This is about seeing the email in the consent form I had wanted it in here.

395
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know that sounds really picky, but

396
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.010
Lauraluj87: Well, how do I, how do I do that though. I don't know what I'm

397
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm, I'm, are you open to filling it out again and then look right here. Do you see right here.

398
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.330
Lauraluj87: Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I have to ask

399
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Right there. What I would do is I would right after the 87102 I would just put a space and then I would type in Anthony underscore Carter at an mp.us courts.gov

400
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:45.960
Lauraluj87: Okay.

401
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but, but you do see that we have the document. It worked. Whatever it we you know I'm saying, like the system worked

402
00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: As you can see it sitting in the record. See, here's your lips. No, no. You're looking at me.

403
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But anyway, it's there.

404
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, I think what I'll do is, I'm going to have Angelina send you another one.

405
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And all you need to do is drop that email in there. And then we're good now when he says, hey, I want to know how Laura's doing. Can you just send me a quick participation letter. It's it'll be really easy. I'll just email it to them.

406
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So in general, how are you doing on this pretrial release is it overwhelming.

407
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:34.800
Is it something. Yeah.

408
00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:36.540
Lauraluj87: I like

409
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:37.530
Okay.

410
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:46.590
Lauraluj87: I'm in. I'm in more of an understanding of it. You know what I mean, I get it. Like, I'm not, I'm not looking for joy. Right. I'm not looking at this point I'm just looking to not get thrown back

411
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.830
Lauraluj87: Like I'm not, you know, I'm not looking for jury right I'm not looking for anything other than to help enter it just

412
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:54.570
Like

413
00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.920
Lauraluj87: You because if I don't have that. And then dead so

414
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you really

415
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: how important this is.

416
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:12.090
Lauraluj87: Yeah, like I said, I'm not looking. Like I said, I'm not looking for Android, right. I'm not looking for Get Out of Jail Free card or whatever I'm literally looking to just get me back on track.

417
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.990
Lauraluj87: Find them in your cool whatever that's that's what life has in store for me and then

418
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:26.460
Lauraluj87: Well, I'm not gonna put myself in danger of being enjoying like, you know what I mean, I'm not gonna put myself in danger of those drugs anymore. I mean, your other people or whatever. It's not worth. It's not worth

419
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:34.140
Lauraluj87: Especially, especially because I know you spent two days, thinking that I can have the coven so that was pretty bad.

420
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:46.170
Lauraluj87: You know what I mean, because I got swag for that and they told me that they immediately took me, you know, under their wing and put me in a frickin hospital thing and I couldn't leave everything's moving into my own doing. Like, you know, plastics are like oh my

421
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:53.850
Lauraluj87: God. So I saw like you know last year's people treating me like I was, you know, there are like, you know, like

422
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:54.930
Lauraluj87: Maybe I'll try.

423
00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And like, like you got the cooties.

424
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So I just, I saw Dr Robey back. She didn't give me the answer I wanted. So I wrote her again. I said, Does it show your buprenorphine prescription. She's talking about that she picked up.

425
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: On April 1 so that is

426
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: On Wednesday, April 1 so I I would wonder about that. That's something of concern.

427
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that sounds like you were still picking stuff up.

428
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.540
Lauraluj87: Yeah.

429
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:39.330
Lauraluj87: I need to go get my one on April 10 I need to go last prescription. I didn't go get out on the

430
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:41.850
Lauraluj87: Road away.

431
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It says, April. Sorry, let me rephrase

432
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:55.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What we can talk about it later. But, um, it says done and in documents. Oh, it's in there for me. Let me go sitting there like a look at it.

433
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: As a p&p. She said, I was just sitting there. I don't think it uploaded. But let me try refresh.

434
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: We can look at it together. Let's see.

435
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Me.

436
00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so sure. So this is what the doctors are looking at

437
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is what I was confused about either you or someone picked up some hydrolysis recent is April 1

438
00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.400
Lauraluj87: Yeah, with me. I was me.

439
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, was this you just kind of, you

440
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.600
Lauraluj87: Know for my tooth number

441
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.200
Lauraluj87: Oh my abscess tooth.

442
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So the new thing that needs to maybe change. And I don't know if you did this is you want to talk with your doctor before you take any

443
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: opiate

444
00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:57.330
Lauraluj87: Well, yeah. Because I talked to her and she said that it didn't even work. SHE SAID SHE SAID SHE SAID THAT I basically got script for nothing English woman.

445
00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, okay, cool. Now look right here.

446
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:05.430
Lauraluj87: You know how we already talked to her about it, she because she told me she's not saying you shouldn't even gotten that because she

447
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.980
Lauraluj87: She recommended just take the booking this trip and

448
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.660
Lauraluj87: Some time and on. It's called event.

449
00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at the screen.

450
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You see right here.

451
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah zishan said dA is Dawn ABR is real, this doctor prescribed March nine, so they how how they don't see that. I don't understand. And look, here it is again you've got the 13th.

452
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:32.310
Lauraluj87: You wouldn't know.

453
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:33.330
That

454
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

455
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.400
Lauraluj87: I don't understand what I'm looking at.

456
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep.

457
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think they may have maybe they were kind of testing you are something to see if you would say something else. I mean, I don't get it.

458
00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.090
Lauraluj87: I get it legally like I'm not getting any going

459
00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:58.830
Lauraluj87: To say, I'm like,

460
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:05.910
Lauraluj87: I'm like, I promise you I'm not getting it LEGALLY, LEGALLY I wouldn't mentioning it

461
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just wanted to show you that she did do it. I was very cool, she was doing to do it so fast.

462
00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, hopefully you feel a little vindicated.

463
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:25.140
Lauraluj87: Yeah, I mean, the thing. Yeah, I mean over here. I mean, we have

464
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's schedule. I want to review. I'm going to see what you already have in your, your, sort of mindset and planning for next week when is your next bright heart health group.

465
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.720
Lauraluj87: Thursday, right. Oh, I know. Tuesday I keep forgetting that

466
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I was closing. Yes.

467
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.000
Lauraluj87: I am right.

468
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

469
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not up an hour late, so we want to take time and plug it in the phone now before it disappears.

470
00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.280
Lauraluj87: Lesson.

471
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's start from scratch. It is not at eight o'clock. It is at 7am on a Tuesday. So I don't know if you want to put that in your phone so that you have time to check in. So you have so it doesn't get forgotten. Do you want to put it in there, you

472
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.350
Lauraluj87: Have it on my calendar.

473
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.720
Lauraluj87: Let me know if

474
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You use it as an alarm.

475
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.490
Lauraluj87: I'm writing it running

476
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:38.640
Lauraluj87: OK.

477
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: And then so it's April 14 at 7am I highly encourage you when you hang up with me to plug an alarm on your phone for like 645 something like that so that you can splash some cold water starts your coffee and check in.

478
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.070
Lauraluj87: Okay, let me do that. We're now going to run out.

479
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:01.860
Lauraluj87: Yeah. Well, we already know.

480
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just do it. Let's just get it done.

481
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.630
Lauraluj87: Already normally not okay. I like

482
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.300
Lauraluj87: Monday, Tuesday, right.

483
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, ma'am. April 14 Tuesday, and you may want to set it for recurring alarm every Tuesday, maybe 645 something like that and label it 7am group.

484
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:28.500
Lauraluj87: If it were 645

485
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:29.910
Nice.

486
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then once you get that one done let me know and we can schedule in the phone also

487
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:46.140
Lauraluj87: I noticed that we already have all that written down. I think I have it on my calendar. But anyways, continue what you're doing.

488
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes a difference if we use our phone for alarms. It's good to get

489
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.980
Lauraluj87: I mean, I mean with ours.

490
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.780
Lauraluj87: With Year nine scheduling.

491
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Go, go check check your phone and see if 9am on April 17 is in there.

492
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, you may want to set your alarm for like

493
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.130
Lauraluj87: We're thinking I forget you.

494
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It isn't, it isn't forget it's I let's say you have a bad night's sleep. And it's because watch. It's not forget, life gets in the way.

495
00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm you had to go to the hospital and we didn't know. So we were looking for you at 7am group wondering where is she, where is she

496
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that you forget us. It's just that attention goes in a more urgent place you needed to attend to your physical pain and so you you were taking care of something else.

497
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's not so much I it's a forgot it's, you know, it can get pretty busy life can get. There's a lot going on. So I would highly encourage 845 on April 17 setting a little alarm in there and that'll be our time to meet on Friday.

498
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so I'm, I'm really glad we got to touch base. I know this was a little, little choppy with being outside, but hopefully next time we'll be able to meet and it'll be enough. Kind of a chill setting.

499
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.280
Yeah.

500
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:45.720
All right.

501
00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Did I message your physician that you do need a prescription

502
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: We

503
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

504
00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Need a correction.

505
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Good to have you. I'll see you on Tuesday.

506
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.120
