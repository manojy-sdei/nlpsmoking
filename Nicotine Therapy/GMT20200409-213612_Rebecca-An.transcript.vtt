Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's just another therapist that they do that group and then him and

146
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:09.990
I

147
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do the other group.

148
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.520
Michelle Espinoza: Okay, that's what we should

149
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:31.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, but I'll tell you what you'll you'll love one of their, you know, for the for this group. And just remember that it's a one time thing. You know what I mean. But she's, she's pretty awesome too. Okay.

150
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:40.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Um, and definitely at least so you can do your medical check in. You know what I mean, at least.

151
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And get get that piece handled before you

152
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:53.760
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Go go off. All right, and so I put the information to the doctor, so that he knows what's going on, knows why.

153
00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:05.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you don't you if you don't feel like even saying what's going on tomorrow. You don't have to because him and the office are aware

154
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.170
Michelle Espinoza: Okay, I probably hope because

155
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.590
Michelle Espinoza: Not there a new you already know everything that's going on with me.

156
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

157
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.030
Michelle Espinoza: I don't want anybody to do that.

158
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah. Because that's just going to open it up and

159
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:28.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, you're getting ready to do his family thing and oh my gosh, Michelle, if there's any way that I can support you, please don't hesitate to call in. All right.

160
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:40.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm here. Just got to know that I'm not going anywhere. And if you need to talk to me to cry. I wish I could. I wish I was right there. This is what this is a time when I wish we were

161
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sitting next to each other because I would just, I would just hug you. I'm so sorry you're going through all this stuff.

162
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, it's an awful lot.

163
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:55.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know they they always say that things come in threes and this is the this is your three right

164
00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:01.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now, this is your Korean and let's hope to God that you know this is it. And that you get

165
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, some time to rest and get your body together let your body

166
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.460
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Heal a little bit

167
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

168
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.770
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, I'm not a medical doctor but I was definitely assume that that's what's happening, you know,

169
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:26.190
Michelle Espinoza: I think so, too, because I was doing good. And then all of a sudden I just started throwing up and I couldn't hold anything down and

170
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.180
Michelle Espinoza: It's just why this is going on, you know,

171
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:37.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, that would be my assumption again.

172
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:47.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm not a medical doctor, it's only an assumption. But, I mean, it's a lot of traumatic stuff, bam, bam, bam, bam. You know what I mean right off in one little tiny times, you know,

173
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it would make sense that your

174
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Body would respond that way.

175
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.540
Michelle Espinoza: You know, go for I slept actually pretty good today.

176
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:05.490
Michelle Espinoza: Good during the day and stuff because I night I woke up and I can't go back to bed. Once I wake up, they go back to bed.

177
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.840
Michelle Espinoza: So I'm sitting around looking outside in the dark.

178
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:11.040
You know,

179
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Are you praying, or are you, what do you

180
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.710
Michelle Espinoza: Play say my prayers and stuff. So that's what

181
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:30.240
Michelle Espinoza: I wanted to say that's why my mom wanted to. So we can go pear rosary for probably my mom and my brother in law, my cousin. Yeah, no.

182
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:31.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

183
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:42.810
Michelle Espinoza: And then there's that really that many of us because my brothers and sisters, some of them live out of town so that we probably just like me and we'll of course my sister and

184
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.560
Michelle Espinoza: Will probably be like six or seven of us there.

185
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.680
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah, that's my mom and my sister, you know,

186
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.120
Michelle Espinoza: But

187
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.420
Michelle Espinoza: Just

188
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Being able to be together right now is going to be really important you know

189
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:06.750
Michelle Espinoza: I'll just do and my mom like it says she's a very, very good. You know God and she prays a lot of stuff. So she wanted to pray a rosary, you know,

190
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.830
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah, so that was a good idea.

191
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:21.960
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah, oh that's we're going to meet slow at one, so that would have been the most groups I that's what I wanted to change till till 12 this read this, I could get my meds.

192
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

193
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:40.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I'm gonna throw an email out to him. He's not online right now, but I'm going to throw an email out to him, letting him know that I saw you today. And, you know, would he be willing to give you a refill let you do your medical check in and then go so that you don't have to

194
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.280
Oh,

195
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right. Does that work.

196
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:50.070
Michelle Espinoza: Yeah, cuz I really wouldn't want to because I'm not because I'm not used to that group. I'm used to ours.

197
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.260
Michelle Espinoza: And I'd rather just, you know, be if it'd be you. You know, I don't want to

198
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.290
Michelle Espinoza: It's just too much for me to talk to everybody about this. No.

199
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

200
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.800
Michelle Espinoza: And then I've ever been to that group before

201
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:12.780
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I totally understand that it's going to be something weird already you know

202
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.010
Well,

203
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.110
Michelle Espinoza: Thank you.

204
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.140
Michelle Espinoza: Do you think, let me just check in and leave. Yeah.

205
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.730
Michelle Espinoza: I do

206
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:35.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, he's got to be hard and you know definitely with everything he already knows that you're you. You know, he knows about your cousin. He knows about the anniversary. He knows that you just had been starting trauma therapy. So, you know,

207
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't see why he wouldn't. I mean, he's a good doctor, you know,

208
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.430
Michelle Espinoza: Was

209
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:54.210
Michelle Espinoza: Giving me prescriptions like for two weeks or for that one week you know cuz he has some for two weeks. Yeah, which was better for me because it's hard for me to get a ride.

210
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.700
Michelle Espinoza: She was a sponsor for now they have

211
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.090
Michelle Espinoza: They have people. We have to be waiting outside to get my prescription and stuff.

212
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.010
Michelle Espinoza: So he gave me a prescription for two weeks last time.

213
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.900
Okay, so

214
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.000
Michelle Espinoza: It will be good if you can give me the prescription for the next two weeks again.

215
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

216
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:34.830

Michelle Espinoza: Yeah.

225
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.600
Michelle Espinoza: I don't know if it's because I'm taking the medicine and then I'm not eating numbers.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With him.

234
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:35.820

What

273
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:05.130
Casey Lane: Hello.

274
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.860
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well hello there, Mr. CASEY How are you today.

275
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.820
Casey Lane: Doing good.

276
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Good, good, good. Listen, this won't take us very long, it's just

277
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:12.780
Casey Lane: You're

278
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Building your chart.

279
00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:22.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, anyways. Um, alright, so the first question on the bio psychosocial is what brings you to bright heart and why now.

280
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:30.120
Casey Lane: Brian or was forced upon me in a way we knew it was coming. I guess it was a

281
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:44.310
Casey Lane: What was it kind of a plan B to where the clinic that I went to. And I guess our doctor was leaving, and they wanted to find a different way of doing things. And so

282
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:54.630
Casey Lane: You guys work closely together and then they recommended us going there. And so when I was kind of like against it. At first when I knew it was coming. I was like, Oh, man.

283
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:05.130
Casey Lane: But then after when when I joined and stuff and started kind of taking part. It was my my mind totally changed everything. So

284
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:12.090
Casey Lane: And so now I actually did it earlier came earlier on that I was supposed to

285
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:22.770
Casey Lane: They I didn't have to switch over. When I did, I could have waited until quite, quite a while, but I chose to just to get it done and just get on the road and

286
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And everything is worked out, huh.

287
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.580
Casey Lane: Yes, yes.

288
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Alright, so the next question is, can you give me your substance abuse history like AG first use, what was the substance that you first use and how did it progress until you got sober, because I know you have multiple years sober.

289
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.120
Casey Lane: Yeah, yeah, it's almost seven now.

290
00:25:46.770 --> 00:26:06.000
Casey Lane: So, okay, yeah. When I first. I think I first used when I was 1414 or 15 years old, one of the two and I had a, like a bunch of growths of like small warts all over my hands and so

291
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:19.200
Casey Lane: When I went to the doctor, they burnt them all off. And I was in a bunch of pain and I think they gave me something for pain then only like a little bit and then after that was over. I was still in pain.

292
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:28.320
Casey Lane: So my mother gave me some of of her pills and so I was taking those like very, very small amounts of that.

293
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.370
Casey Lane: It was Marco is what I was taking

294
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Into that

295
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:33.930
And then

296
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:42.180
Casey Lane: After a while because the friends I hung out with, you know, I wasn't very like impressionable or anything peer pressure but

297
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:50.460
Casey Lane: A few friends that I was hanging out with. It was like, oh, you know, you can take those and so those and all this stuff. So, after a while, I kind of just went with it and then

298
00:26:53.040 --> 00:27:03.720
Casey Lane: My one of my best friends. I grew up with his, his mom was kind of, I don't want to say like terminal, but she was really, really bad sick lot of problems, you know,

299
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:20.490
Casey Lane: And so she was prescribed oxycontin, which was 80 milligrams, which is like the highest milligram, you can get at that time and the highest dose, you can get at that time, too. But she wasn't really taking them. She never really took them so

300
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:40.620
Casey Lane: After getting getting high on the pills at my mom was given me. I was like well well at and this and that. I was trying to do the math, and I took two to 80 oxy cotton is my first time ever at that age, and I was in bed sick for like two or three days, pretty much overdosed. You know, and

301
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.890
Casey Lane: My mom was like, What's wrong, what's wrong. And I was just like, I'm just sick, you know, I was trying to play it off but

302
00:27:47.880 --> 00:28:00.660
Casey Lane: But he would have thought it was stopped there, but I just, I was like, Well, I like the way it made me feel for the first you know hour before I got sick. So I was like, let's try one did the same thing. So I just kept trying to lesser less it less it

303
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.790
Casey Lane: In so my my big thing was taken oxy cotton for a lot of years.

304
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.890
In so

305
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:15.480
Casey Lane: I had a I had back problems and leg problems myself that I had developed and

306
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.190
Casey Lane: And so

307
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.520
Casey Lane: I was talking to a doctor and getting you know just establishing care and all that stuff and then

308
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:31.290
Casey Lane: At some point in time when I was almost like 15 and a half, maybe around that age. I was prescribed

309
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:41.730
Casey Lane: Methadone and so I was taking, I think it was two or three a day 10s and at that age and so

310
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:49.680
Casey Lane: That's pretty much where I stopped using, you know, the docs econ and just only took those

311
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:55.500
Casey Lane: Pretty much until I was 30 years old so about 15 years or so.

312
00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:57.540
Casey Lane: So,

313
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:06.930
Casey Lane: I did have like a stint in my life where I think it was maybe almost a year, maybe a little less than a year.

314
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.820
Casey Lane: Where I did use intravenous drugs and

315
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:25.230
Casey Lane: So, and I was shooting up you know oxy cotton. But that was a time where they were trying to make them or wasn't were abused proof. And so it was like a little bit before then. And so

316
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.140
Casey Lane: I wasn't able to do that for a while and then

317
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:29.760
Casey Lane: I quit.

318
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:38.010
Casey Lane: Quit shooting up, which I'm I just can't because a lot of the friends I was doing what they, some of them are, you know, still doing it. Some of them.

319
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:52.230
Casey Lane: Were they weren't able to quit, but I was able to stop using the needle. After about a year and I just quit it after that I was it, you know, but I still used drugs after right

320
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.000
Casey Lane: And

321
00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:10.890
Casey Lane: So yeah, I was, I was just prescribed it got more and more because it was it just wasn't enough. Right. You know, two or three turns to the however many just growing up and getting used to it and I had found

322
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:18.870
Casey Lane: Well, me and my mom are going to the same doctor and Eureka. I had a doctor in Eureka would drive every month to and

323
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:31.410
Casey Lane: She, I think, at the height of it before I got clean. I think I was getting like what 15 or 20 pills prescribed a day of those things and

324
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.740
Casey Lane: Wow, so it was, it was really, really bad.

325
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.860
Casey Lane: And especially at a young age, you know,

326
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.270
Casey Lane: Yeah, so

327
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And now you have seven years sober.

328
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.820
Casey Lane: Yeah, I know. I can't block.

329
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It rocks.

330
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

331
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.450
Casey Lane: It's, it's definitely a lot different. A lot different.

332
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do you still struggle with pain.

333
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.630
Casey Lane: Oh yeah, definitely. Yep.

334
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what in that what was was the cause of the pain.

335
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:14.010
Casey Lane: Um, so I never really figured out what started it when I was growing up, a lot of the doctors really it first tried to figure it out and tried not to go the pill route, you know, and

336
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:21.630
Casey Lane: They just a lot of them were saying it was either a hereditary or or what I just, I never figured out what happened.

337
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:39.510
Casey Lane: But I started developing spinal stenosis. Bulging discs and things of that nature. And so I went to see a surge. And actually, I think it was not that long ago, actually maybe maybe a couple years maybe

338
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:50.550
Casey Lane: And it was supposed to be like one of the best ones you know in in the country or whatever. And so what they were saying was pretty much

339
00:31:51.480 --> 00:32:07.470
Casey Lane: I would have to go to some kind of university to get a surgery because it's not, you know, shave a little bone here and there, it's, you know, pretty much my life would change after that I'd have to do everything different pretty much not saying that I'll be worse after but it's just like

340
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:15.090
Casey Lane: I don't know, it's a major surgery. So like rebuilding you know certain things or whatever.

341
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.590
Casey Lane: It's it was hard to hear. Because yeah, you know,

342
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.060
Casey Lane: But yeah, I struggle with it all the time. All the time.

343
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, the Suboxone and it helps with

344
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.900
Casey Lane: I think, I think so. I think not, like, you know,

345
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.940
Casey Lane: Not a lot, but I definitely think so.

346
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:42.090
Casey Lane: Because truthfully, I'm, I'm in a lot less pain than, than I was when I was using

347
00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:53.310
Casey Lane: Yeah, because I was using it for a crutch. Big time. You know, I wasn't paying, but it was like it was more in pain, but it was using it as a crutch to so

348
00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:01.230
Casey Lane: Now that when I got clean, you know, ibuprofen and what I take now is pretty much, you know,

349
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:03.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What you do

350
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:04.560
Yeah.

351
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you ever been to treatment in the past.

352
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:16.350
Casey Lane: Like for drugs or anything like that. No, actually. No, I never

353
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:34.200
Casey Lane: I lived in a family that was pretty much it wasn't like looked down upon to use my mom. She was an ex user. My sister used drugs, you know, she we all had prescriptions right you know and and we all borrowed from each other. Did this does that

354
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.690
Casey Lane: And so it wasn't really looked down upon for me being, being a user

355
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.720
Casey Lane: My family just was like that. It wasn't

356
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

357
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:51.900
Casey Lane: You know, you, you're struggling, you need to get your life you know together. It wasn't like that at all. It's like we were all struggling and we all dependent on each other so

358
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.830
Casey Lane: I never felt guilty for things like that I

359
00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:11.010
Casey Lane: But I was never liked the thief. I never sold things I never did like crazy outlandish things to get drugs. If I didn't have it. It fucking sucks. And I just write it out. I would sell my my TVs are my stuff my own stuff.

360
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:19.530
Casey Lane: But I never crossed that line. I was always usually kept that that that line and crossed and

361
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:36.000
Casey Lane: And I'm usually that person is a if I'm going to do something I do it like I quit. You know, quit using the needle and that should sucked. Big time. And the first time, pretty much. I was like, well, I'm gonna quit drugs. I'm going to go to a program and

362
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:42.750
Casey Lane: I just, you know, hit the ground running. So yep yep and the program that

363
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:48.810
Casey Lane: That I switched to from here is the only program that I've ever tried to go to, or thought about going to

364
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that was with Dr groves and Tony at the moment. Great.

365
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.320
Casey Lane: Yes, yeah.

366
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, no mental health diagnosis.

367
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.910
Casey Lane: I've never had never went to mental health type stuff.

368
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.520
Casey Lane: I have been asked, you know,

369
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.900
Casey Lane: To see if I wanted to go with certain things and things like that.

370
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:25.800
Casey Lane: But for me it's it's always like I do struggle with things but it's it's not so much to where I feel that I need the actual, you know, real mental health, like there are some people that really need mental health out there.

371
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.060
Casey Lane: Yeah, and

372
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.700
Casey Lane: I'm just not that spot, I guess.

373
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:35.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, any past suicide attempts, know

374
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:40.170

Casey Lane: Yeah, no, no. Okay.

379
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:57.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, any thoughts about suicide. Have you ever struggled with a period of time where you were, where you had thoughts of suicide.

380
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:12.630
Casey Lane: No, no, not really. Suicide has never been a thing in my mind I I love life so much and even in my using and hating life. I still, you know, I like to be alive.

381
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, good.

382
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's weird, but I do that we are. No, it's okay. I'm kind of scared scared of it so

383
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah yeah

384
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any past self harm that's just cutting a burning or anything like that. No.

385
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:43.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so can you can you elaborate a little bit on your family unit growing up where your parents together your whole life. Did they divorce. How old were you if they did divorce when that happened. How many siblings do you have, you know,

386
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What was your family like growing up.

387
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.560
Casey Lane: That kind of stuff. Sure, sure.

388
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.860
Casey Lane: When I grew up, it was

389
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.470
Casey Lane: So my, my mom.

390
00:36:54.330 --> 00:37:04.320
Casey Lane: My real father and my mom, you know, had you know relations and then I was conceived and then they broke up and then

391
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:23.400
Casey Lane: Another man came into my life and that's who I call dad. And so he came into my life when I was six months old. And then, but my mom was, you know, seeing both of them. And so when I when I came out. My mom was telling both of them. Hey, he's yours.

392
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:33.990
Casey Lane: And so when she left my dad, my, my biological father and my mom got with Mark, which is my, my dad who I call dad.

393
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:45.300
Casey Lane: He didn't know that my mom was doing that. And so my mom knew who I really belong to. And so she would sneak him over there and, you know, say this is your kid.

394
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.940
Casey Lane: But he never believed, my mom because he was clinically pronounced sterile. So he

395
00:37:51.990 --> 00:38:10.320
Casey Lane: He was like, There's no fucking way. So, but after a while I'll skip forward a little bit and then go back at around 11 or a 10 or something like that. Maybe nine or 10 they did a paternity and down. I was, you know, later on in life. I was

396
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:10.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know,

397
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:25.860
Casey Lane: So my, my dad, you know, found out that she had been sneaking over to come and see me and stuff. And then my dad back then. He was a hard ass and you know he knew how to fight and all that stuff and was super tough.

398
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.830
Casey Lane: Though scared him away and

399
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:39.810
Casey Lane: I didn't talk to my real dad until I was 10 or so. And so when I I grew up with my mom and my dad. They both

400
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.480
Casey Lane: Were big cocaine users.

401
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.980
Casey Lane: And they sold a lot of cocaine and we had

402
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.340
Casey Lane: You know, moved around a lot.

403
00:38:51.690 --> 00:39:00.240
Casey Lane: One maybe in one time, four or five times in a year. And that's just, you know, not the first time. That's just, you know, a lot of in one year.

404
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:03.450
Casey Lane: And we

405
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:13.770
Casey Lane: Would set our life a little bit different, was we were living in a trailer park and we had the, you know, usually trailer parks have like the office building type of thing. And so

406
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:28.170
Casey Lane: It was set up on a hill, and then the trailer park was like down the hill and so I guess my mom and my dad were selling a lot of cocaine at that time. And so they there were federal agents that were

407
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:37.440
Casey Lane: That were in the places that were kind of next to them. And so my, my dad was telling my mom, you know, because he was

408
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:48.630
Casey Lane: A fucking weirdo at that time to, you know, and so he was like, there's people over there. I can see him through the window and all this other shit and like tell them I'm all this stuff, you know, and she's like Mark, you're fucking crazy.

409
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.550
Casey Lane: No, there's nobody over there, this and this, I can see through the window. There's like nobody lives there.

410
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.460
Casey Lane: Come to find out, you know, they

411
00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:02.220
Casey Lane: My mom, my mom and my dad because my mom Bart ended at the time.

412
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.050
Casey Lane: Being my dad. My dad was a

413
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:11.340
Casey Lane: Well, I don't want to say lumberjack is kind of an old word, but, you know, chop trees down and

414
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.740
Casey Lane: You know, all those things worked with wood and

415
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:27.930
Casey Lane: So my mom was bartending. And then they they met somebody at the bar, who they were selling drugs to and then he wanted you know needed a place to stay. So he was living at the house for a while.

416
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:44.760
Casey Lane: I think it was like six months or so well come to find out he was an undercover agent. Right. And so he was living in our house for a while and then, but he was actually using drugs with my mom and stuff and shooting up and whatever. And so at the time.

417
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.200
Casey Lane: They didn't ask no questions about that. So they got caught up.

418
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.510
Casey Lane: My dad.

419
00:40:53.100 --> 00:41:04.410
Casey Lane: I think he he was able to you know get a lot of that stuff like out of the house before they came so it wasn't as big as what it could have been and

420
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:21.390
Casey Lane: I think, yeah, my mom went to jail. And then I went with my grandmother and grandparents and my mom didn't get a big jail sentence or anything. It was kind of like her first offense. And then my grandparents helped with money and stuff to get her out.

421
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:29.100
Casey Lane: And then it was kind of pretty much after that it was not as crazy but

422
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:43.260
Casey Lane: They, they like to fight my mom and my dad. They like to, you know, abuse, each other and my mom didn't just sit back and get beat you fight him, they would drink because she was a bartender. They beat each other up. I'd hear it all night long.

423
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:44.040
Mm hmm.

424
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:55.260
Casey Lane: And my dad. I guess I don't remember this, but my mom said that my dad used to like to torture me and stuff and do certain little weird things

425
00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:03.150
Casey Lane: You know, just be like, super mean, you know, like, oh, do you want ice cream. Oh, and like, take it away. You know those kinds of

426
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.220
Casey Lane: Yeah, little things and

427
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:14.370
Casey Lane: So he made gave me a mohawk. When I was really young and just all kinds of stupid shit, you know,

428
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.080
Casey Lane: And so

429
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:26.550
Casey Lane: It was abusive as well with me, but it was, you know, I got my ass whooped and spanked. But I also did things to get in trouble.

430
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:38.520
Casey Lane: And my mom had a balance of, you know, loving me and you know spanking me when I need it. Sometimes she would go overboard. Yes, but

431
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:51.630
Casey Lane: You know she loved me where it really counted and things like that. So I was able to after she what my ass. I can go and hug on her and stuff. If I wanted so she wasn't super mean you know

432
00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:02.700
Casey Lane: And so I guess it was a little bit after after that period. They had broke up because my mom's got tired of getting beat up and

433
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:08.940
Casey Lane: So she had kicked him out and then developed another relationship.

434
00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:10.800
Casey Lane: With somebody

435
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:22.260
Casey Lane: During that time. And so my dad would try to come over and when she was in a relationship and start fights and argue and whatever.

436
00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:28.590
Casey Lane: And so that kind of calmed down, he kind of stayed away for a while and then she brought a new guy in

437
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:39.480
Casey Lane: And this is kind of like the shitty or shitty or time in my life than than that because I was kind of a young some of that. I don't remember some of it. I was just told

438
00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.730
Casey Lane: No, I do. I do remember

439
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:49.860
Casey Lane: But this stuff is where I really, really remember when I was, you know, 10 910 you know that can age.

440
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:50.580
Yeah.

441
00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:57.870
Casey Lane: So I think it was maybe for the first you know year or so.

442
00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:05.340
Casey Lane: And we lived here in Crescent City where I live now Crystal City, California, pretty much never have gotten away from this place so

443
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.840
Casey Lane: But, um,

444
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:28.590
Casey Lane: So they got together and then I guess they we. I don't know why we moved or whatever I he was a carpenter and so he got jobs. A lot of places. And he was gone for months at a time. Sometimes what two months, a month. And so I guess there was some big job. And it was near Eugene, Oregon.

445
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:45.540
Casey Lane: at a place called Young color and there's, it's kind of like there's a smaller part of that town called drain. So it's like drain young color. And I think Eugene is short. Shortly after

446
00:44:45.900 --> 00:45:05.310
Casey Lane: Then so so we lived in a move to like 68 acre ranch with like with a house there. And so the ranch. You know, we can free roam do whatever we didn't actually ranch. But the owner. We rented from them. And so when we we stayed there.

447
00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:21.780
Casey Lane: That's when she got real weird I have and I do have a sister. I have a biological sister and she she was there after all this as well. I didn't want to leave, leave her out, you know, and she she was there with me as well, she's she was four years older than I was.

448
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.920
Casey Lane: And I'm trying to get that from so you can see a little better.

449
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.330
Casey Lane: And she was four years older than I was. And so

450
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:40.590
Casey Lane: We when we moved to I think it was a double wide. It was like a six or seven bedroom double wide and

451
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:47.340
Casey Lane: I don't know how how it started. But I know kind of the day I started

452
00:45:49.050 --> 00:46:00.720
Casey Lane: I was laying in in my bedroom. It was nighttime. My mom was bartending. It was you know she didn't come home, you know, until like early, early in the morning, three o'clock in the morning and

453
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:06.030
Casey Lane: I was sexually molested by him for a lot of years.

454
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:16.410
Casey Lane: Yeah, I was laying in bed and I can he came into my room and he was just like

455
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:24.060
Casey Lane: My big thing was like karate movies and explosions and things like that. So I loved you know old Chuck Norris movies, you name it.

456
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:31.410
Casey Lane: Yeah, so he's like, Hey, do you want to go and watch a movie and all this stuff. And I was like, shit. I just stay up and do whatever. Okay. And so

457
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:42.870
Casey Lane: You know, I went into the bedroom, but his thing at the time now that I think back, so he always like to have have like all of us like my mom, my sister me

458
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:51.240
Casey Lane: Like hat like tickle his legs and his like feet or his back or whatever, you know, people like to have you scratch your back for a

459
00:46:51.240 --> 00:47:06.570
Casey Lane: While or do whatever. Well, his thing. He had to like, you know, lightly rub your hand up and down. You know, I had to sit there for fucking hours doing that shit. And I hated it. And so I guess that

460
00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:17.760
Casey Lane: He was I was laying I was just laying there and I was watching the show. And then I think he like grabbed me put his arm around me and then I was like,

461
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:27.510
Casey Lane: In my mind, I'm like, What's going on, you know, because he was he was a an asshole. He wasn't nice. You know, so total beta male asshole and

462
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.430
Casey Lane: So,

463
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:36.480
Casey Lane: I think that was pretty much it. That's like the first time he was like, kind of, you know,

464
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:44.880
Casey Lane: When the grab and when they grab any can't get away and you're just like, Okay, just stay here fucking forever, I guess, you know, so it's kind of like that and I

465
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:58.950
Casey Lane: I told my mom at the time a little after that that had happened, and she was like, oh, he just he gets drunk and maybe he thought you were me and all this stuff, you know, as a kid. I'm like, oh, okay, I guess so.

466
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.240
Casey Lane: And it just kind of got progressively worse from there, you know,

467
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.370
Casey Lane: You'd go into my manager go my bedroom.

468
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:10.620
Casey Lane: And then pretty much lay lay next to me like that. And then, you know, he would

469
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:15.090
Casey Lane: You know, use his hand to grab my my shit.

470
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.500
Casey Lane: You know, and

471
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:30.810
Casey Lane: It was, it was like that for a long time and he actually got so brazen that we were in the front, front room and his twin brother was on the couch and then I think

472
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:43.200
Casey Lane: Somebody was on the other couch on the other side of the room and I was laying there under a blanket or whatever. We were just laying there watching TV, and he was even doing that shit. Then like

473
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:51.870
Casey Lane: messing with me then, like in front of nobody was paying attention. You know, I didn't say anything because I was scared. You know, yeah.

474
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:53.760
And so

475
00:48:54.930 --> 00:49:11.670
Casey Lane: It's just it was it was torture, he was pretty much it was, you know, got a little more heated than that. There's, there was a, you know, no penetration or nothing, and nothing might, you know, crazy like that, but he would make me grab him and, you know, or vice versa, and that

476
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:22.560
Casey Lane: It freezes you up. You know, I don't. I didn't know what to do. I was literally paralyzed with fear. I never wanted to move. I didn't want to breathe. I you know I just wasn't sure.

477
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.810
Casey Lane: Yeah, so

478
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:32.220
Casey Lane: After I think it was like for four or five years of that shit. And I remember

479
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:52.950
Casey Lane: My mom actually was worried about some shit happening to my sister, because my sister was coming of age, she was getting boobs and, you know, my sister, even when she got older, she was overtly sexual and really, really, you know, ninefold type stuff to you know

480
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.490
Casey Lane: That I turned out the complete opposite.

481
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:57.180
Just

482
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:02.820
Casey Lane: Don't like I can care less about sex. I don't care about none of that shit, it just

483
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.030
Casey Lane: doesn't ever enter, enter my mind.

484
00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:12.990
Casey Lane: I don't know. I guess it's either one extreme to the next, you know, one way or the other.

485
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:20.940
Casey Lane: And so a lot of that she was going on. I told I ended up telling my mom like

486
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.720
Casey Lane: You know that pretty much the details what happened and then

487
00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:42.270
Casey Lane: Man, this shit sucks. So see, she came home and then after it was like a few days. I was wondering what she was doing or thinking because I was like, what is going to happen now.

488
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:54.600
Casey Lane: So she she comes into it you know outside. I was playing and she's like, Well, I had a talk with him and he says that he didn't do anything to you.

489
00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:02.820
Casey Lane: And you know you need to stop lying and I'm just like, Mom, I'm not lying. I'm telling I'm telling you the truth, you know,

490
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:18.780
Casey Lane: And he was in. She was like, I don't know if I believe you. I, I talked to him. And I think that your lines. So you need to go in there, you need to say you're sorry for lying to him, and you need to shake his hand and you need to say sorry

491
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:24.390
Casey Lane: So what do you think I did swallowed my pride in their said sorry for lion.

492
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:38.460
Casey Lane: shook his hand then that shit. Oh my God got so much worse because while she was gone. He was super mad at me though that so then he started you know hitting me and all kinds of stuff.

493
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:47.730
Casey Lane: When she wasn't looking or, you know, just being super mean shoving me down or just stupid tripping me when I'm walking by, or stupid shit.

494
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:53.070
Casey Lane: And breaking my things and so

495
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.610
Casey Lane: I actually, the good thing that I did.

496
00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:05.100
Casey Lane: I have the one person that I feel this that saved me from from there is my aunt, Cindy.

497
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:07.470
Casey Lane: And my aunt, Cindy.

498
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:20.040
Casey Lane: She was at the time, like a social worker. She worked in Brookings Oregon and she did. It was called Community action is what the place was called and so it helped people

499
00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:29.490
Casey Lane: From all like what people homeless people and to get funding and all these types of things. So she kind of had connections with certain things and in so

500
00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:46.500
Casey Lane: During that time, after I told her she believed me right away. I mean right away and and so she told me she said you know it's it's going to take time, but she says you don't say anything to your mom or nothing. It'll take time.

501
00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:53.850
Casey Lane: Please just hold out a little bit longer. And, you know, I'll see what I can do. And so

502
00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:56.820
Casey Lane: I, you know, waited and waited.

503
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:05.580
Casey Lane: And then finally, well, he was gone on a you know trip because he, like I said he'd go for a month. Sometimes, or whenever he was gone.

504
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:12.960
Casey Lane: My mom was working. So it was just me and my sister. And so we always spent a lot of time alone. Her watching me.

505
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:19.650
Casey Lane: She beat me up to you. Normal sister shit so until I got old enough, right. So,

506
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.120
Casey Lane: My, my aunt, Cindy drove all the way from Brookings

507
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.790
Casey Lane: To there. It's like a six.

508
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:34.500
Casey Lane: six hour trip or whatever, and she called me ahead of time, and was like Pack your things, pack your stuff.

509
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.640
Casey Lane: I'm leaving a little bit of part out. So be before then before like an another week went by are so

510
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:50.190
Casey Lane: My mom. She was like, well, I bet you know she sleep in my room. So she I slept in her room with her. I had a bed on the floor.

511
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:55.710
Casey Lane: And my mom was like a heavy sleeper snore heavy sleeper.

512
00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:04.560
Casey Lane: And so what he would do is he would try to talk to me underneath the door and he would

513
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:09.000
Casey Lane: Whisper things and he would like rub his fingers under the door.

514
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And he would, you know,

515
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.010
Casey Lane: Call my name.

516
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:19.860
Casey Lane: And of course, I just be like frozen just sit there and not want to say nothing. That'd be like, Mom, Mom. I'm trying to like wake her up because her bed was a pyre. And I was on the floor.

517
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:33.330
Casey Lane: Right, so I was trying to get her attention. I can never fucking get her to see like literally right when he'd be done. She'd wake up like, what, you know, I, she just I can never at that time prove to her that that was going on.

518
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:42.780
Casey Lane: But later on when we were, you know, when I was a little bit more of an adult and she was, you know, of course, we talked more about it and

519
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:52.320
Casey Lane: You know she knew some things were going on, but she was just stuck you know in a in her own world as well.

520
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:59.580
Casey Lane: So my name is Cindy came she sold us pretty much sold us away.

521
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:09.930
Casey Lane: And when my mom got back, she was, you know, freaking out. She didn't, didn't know what's going on. Some is and he called her and told her you know your kids have been telling you this

522
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:23.340
Casey Lane: You know, for however long and you did fucking nothing about it. So, so she came and took us and then we got taken away from her, and

523
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:25.200
Casey Lane: Man, it was like

524
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:30.660
Casey Lane: Six months or eight months we lived with my grandpa again.

525
00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.190
Casey Lane: And

526
00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:39.570
Casey Lane: Yeah, he was he was an asshole as well. If you can imagine. So he

527
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:59.580
Casey Lane: I struggled with him because he was, you know, I don't want to say like military but he he was in the army. He spent time in the Army when his younger and got out so wakes up for am has everything set out that that kind of thing regain alright so

528
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:14.490
Casey Lane: Wash your hands and comb your hair before you go to dinner, and I didn't. I was struggling with wearing underwear as a kid for something. I just wasn't wasn't it's kind of normal kids struggle with weird things all the time so I

529
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:19.440
Casey Lane: Like to wear underwear. Sometimes, or whatever. And so if I didn't

530
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.600
Casey Lane: I would wear them go to school, take them off and try to put them on before I came home.

531
00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:40.320
Casey Lane: And then he catch me doing that and I broke my sister's glasses. He'd beat the shit out of me for that. I didn't know which way was up or down. I literally couldn't see nothing. I was like getting flung all the way. Or I could. Everything was a blur. So it was pretty crazy there too.

532
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:51.420
Casey Lane: But he provided for me, you know, of course, food, whatever he he had a lot of money. So he was able to do those things, you know, buy Christmas gifts school clothes.

533
00:56:53.640 --> 00:57:04.800
Casey Lane: But it took a long time for my mom to get me back, and I was really fucking upset at her, you know, she's given me a load of garbage, but at the time I was a kid. So I thought, like a kid. I didn't

534
00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:16.770
Casey Lane: Think like that you know now that I'm an adult, I look back on that stuff and it just really sucks you know she she had back problems on her own, because she she did later get surgery.

535
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.430
Casey Lane: And I had to take care of her.

536
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:29.490
Casey Lane: She couldn't move for months, me and my sister took care of her. So at the time this was kind of before we got

537
00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:31.710
Casey Lane: Got back with her. She

538
00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:44.220
Casey Lane: Well, she gave me excuses, you know, will my back went out and I was trying to save money and I was in bed. I laid up in bed, I can like all these lame ass excuses like taking time

539
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:53.250
Casey Lane: Because she was still living there with him for a while before she left. And so she was only well the the cops got involved, like I said,

540
00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.490
Casey Lane: I had, I was questioned a lot

541
00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.080
Casey Lane: My sister was question she was never touched

542
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:08.130
Casey Lane: Things happened to her later on in life through someone else she was raped it 15

543
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.750
Casey Lane: By

544
00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:13.590
Casey Lane: A Mexican immigrant who didn't speak English or anything so

545
00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: She

546
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:19.200
Casey Lane: So she struggled with her own things later in life. But at that time it was that wasn't going on.

547
00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:26.100
Casey Lane: I talked to, you know, social workers, you name it, and

548
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:33.840
Casey Lane: They definitely twisted some of my words around or asked me certain questions to get certain answers that I didn't

549
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:42.960
Casey Lane: Like to me getting a spanking at my when I was young, you know, my mom said, well, if you don't get out of there. I'm going to beat your ass with me. That's a spanking.

550
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:56.190
Casey Lane: Beat your end to somebody else is beating you. So you know so certain words that I thought that were normal turned out to, you know, it really kind of screwed us too. So I felt guilty that I'm the one that

551
00:58:56.670 --> 00:59:05.580
Casey Lane: Said, all these things to get taken away. And, you know, my mom didn't help any either. She wasn't, you know, parents of the year about it and she was like

552
00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:13.200
Casey Lane: She's that person. You don't say, you know, don't say anything. Don't talk to cops about nothing. Don't say this

553
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is

554
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.770
Casey Lane: In everything's fine type of person so

555
00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.860
Casey Lane: I didn't really know what to say to them, and

556
00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:27.210
Casey Lane: I said, I guess what I wanted to and what really happened. And she suffered the consequences for it.

557
00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:35.340
Casey Lane: Nothing ever happened to that full either nothing happened to that guy ever. Nothing. Nothing ever came in of him getting in trouble.

558
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that guessing.

559
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:47.340
Casey Lane: It fucking is insanely crazy good like living my life. The whole all the time. I'm like, Mom, like

560
00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:55.590
Casey Lane: How come you know this and how come that like can I can I press charges. Can I do all this stuff and it just nothing ever

561
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:57.060
Casey Lane: You know,

562
00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.760
Casey Lane: That shit. Yeah.

563
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.590
Casey Lane: It still bothers me. To this day, but it's something that I kind of

564
01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:06.960
Casey Lane: Put aside, you know,

565
01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:10.980
Casey Lane: Yeah, and so anyway I was mad at my mom because

566
01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:24.060
Casey Lane: She, she was allowed to see me, you know, you're only mandated to see them every so often like the court says well you can see them this this many times of this long or something.

567
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.340
Casey Lane: A month or twice a month or three times a month.

568
01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:52.050
Casey Lane: I think she was allowed to see us for four times a month and I maybe only seen her once if that a month, but, you know, as, as an adult, I understand it's you know it's not as easy. Is that for one you know she didn't really have a car she lived really far away, and it was hard for her to

569
01:00:52.830 --> 01:01:03.180
Casey Lane: To do the back and forth, you know, and at the kid. I don't. As a kid, I understand that. I'm just like, why don't you fucking take me out of here and

570
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:06.030
Casey Lane: On my, on my birthday.

571
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:14.040
Casey Lane: My, my grandma had a mentally challenged grandchild and

572
01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:23.190
Casey Lane: It was my birthday cake was lit it was time to blow out the candles. Right. And then she's like, well, we'll hold off. CASEY Why, why don't we have selling so blow them out.

573
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:40.470
Casey Lane: So I was like, okay, so I just sit there. Right. And then when he blows out the candles, you fucking spits everywhere gets it all over the cake, so I'm upset because I grew up with nothing, not even really birthdays have a birthday cake and a birthday was fucking insane for me.

574
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:50.220
Casey Lane: Is over him to spit everywhere. I was super upset and so I got up and I ran into my room. I was crying you know

575
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:59.940
Casey Lane: And my mom came in and I was laying on the bed. She came, came in late on the bed with me, put her arm around me and just pretty much sat there for a while and didn't say didn't say anything.

576
01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.130
Casey Lane: And then I'm just like,

577
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:11.760
Casey Lane: You know, and I was like trying to be quiet. So it's like, Why can't, why can't I just go in your car, I can get in your trunk and then you can just drive and we can just

578
01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:13.830
Casey Lane: You know, little kid stuff, you know, I don't

579
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:16.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know, I want to go with you. Yeah.

580
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:23.400
Casey Lane: Yeah, I'm like why why can't you just, you know, go in your trunk don't never know. And then we can do, you know, just go home and

581
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:29.310
Casey Lane: And man, is that it was really, really hard to deal with. Yeah.

582
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:35.610
Casey Lane: I was just like, pretty much just upset or because I couldn't couldn't get out of there and

583
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.880
Casey Lane: So he time passes, and

584
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:53.970
Casey Lane: I think I was helping my grandpa mow the lawn or something. He had a riding lawn mower, and I would sit on the top, you know, so we're driving around, doing whatever and then my grandma comes out and then she's like, Hey, you know, can, can you give us a minute. And I said, yeah, so I

585
01:02:54.990 --> 01:03:02.970
Casey Lane: You know, walked away and I can see them talking and me and my sisters Stan Stan in there. And she was like, cool. What do you think they're talking about

586
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:15.210
Casey Lane: I don't know, and, and they didn't look happy, you know, at all. And they look like they're, you know, arguing a little bit or whatever because they didn't want me to go back to my mom, obviously.

587
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.740
Casey Lane: And

588
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.210
Casey Lane: So my grandma She came, came up to me and she's

589
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:33.270
Casey Lane: Like well better Stargate your stuff together. I guess your mom's coming here in the next couple days going to come get you. And so, of course, me and my sister were super happy. Right. Well, yeah. Yeah, and

590
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:39.480
Casey Lane: I think. Yeah. And then I went with my mom. My mom had a

591
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:44.310
Casey Lane: She had to have certain guidelines for us to come back, obviously.

592
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:50.160
Casey Lane: You know, had to have a place stable place and a job, I think.

593
01:03:51.240 --> 01:04:04.350
Casey Lane: And so she went to Brookings where she grew up and as there's some friends there and she got a house was renting a house. It's actually not there anymore. I went there, not that long ago and

594
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:18.030
Casey Lane: It was on a road. I remember every bit of it and I was driving there with my girlfriend. Weird. And I was like, they actually put a store there where it where it is now where the house was. And so I was like, oh, it's not there anymore and

595
01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:28.920
Casey Lane: So the house was a one bedroom. It wasn't a studio, but it was a one bedroom and then kitchen, living room and

596
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.050
Casey Lane: Maybe the the living room was maybe

597
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:49.620
Casey Lane: What 15 feet by like 10 feet. It was super small and the kitchen was pretty much you know where you can cook and then like maybe a small table with two chairs and then you just walk right out the door. It was very, very small and

598
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:51.930
Casey Lane: The bedroom.

599
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:57.780
Casey Lane: Pretty much like my closet is almost bigger than that bedroom, and so the

600
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:09.960
Casey Lane: The bedroom had a closet in it as well. And so my mom. She slipped out in the living room on the on a couch. My sister had the bedroom.

601
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:25.020
Casey Lane: You know, and then I put a we had like a little mattress that fit like perfectly inside the closet. So I had a bed in that little closet thing. And so that's how it was for a while for a while there.

602
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:26.610
Casey Lane: And then

603
01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:28.650
Casey Lane: I think

604
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.290
Casey Lane: We moved back to Crescent City at some point in time.

605
01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:36.690
Casey Lane: And

606
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:45.510
Casey Lane: You know, everything was, you know, she promised me that she was never going to be with anybody again after what happened.

607
01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.370
Casey Lane: You know, and the guy who did that to me. His name is Jerry

608
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:55.440
Casey Lane: Jerry Mathis. Is his name and

609
01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.000
Casey Lane: So,

610
01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:15.060
Casey Lane: She was liking on never be with anybody. Again, you know, this, this and this and I pretty much lived with my mom until I was 2425, you know, I was a mama's boy I stayed stayed with her forever, and I took care of her because she was always sick. She was always

611
01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:30.480
Casey Lane: You know, you know, back problems, whatever. And then she got it, she got in a car accident and made it way worse. He had broke both of her legs and then after that she can never regained her balance. You could just barely walk and

612
01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:38.310
Casey Lane: So I pretty much use it as an excuse to not get out and do my own life and just pretty much stayed with her and take care of her.

613
01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:40.860
Casey Lane: And

614
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:43.800
Casey Lane: You know, pretty much grown up.

615
01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.430
Casey Lane: I would steal her pills, you know,

616
01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:54.900
Casey Lane: She got pills and stuff. So I would steal her pills a lot from her. And that's pretty much the only person that hurt like that.

617
01:06:55.410 --> 01:07:02.820
Casey Lane: What's her, and that's what I regret the most even even go into like counseling with Tony and like being in groups.

618
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:18.510
Casey Lane: That's the thing that I'm mostly Phil super upset about is that I, you know, stole pills from her and things like that. Even I didn't, didn't really do it. I didn't do it to anybody else. But her feel super bad this because he's passed away. Now I think because why I feel really bad.

619
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:26.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So did do this whole through everything. Did you manage to graduate high school

620
01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:40.440
Casey Lane: No, I was shitty in school. I was okay. I did go to school until I hit. I think sophomore sophomore year in school and high school, the freshman was me kind of okay

621
01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:52.650
Casey Lane: I wasn't picked on and bullied or nothing. I had a lot of friends everywhere. I mean, I knew everybody but I just didn't apply myself.

622
01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:03.810
Casey Lane: You know, super smart whatever was everybody says, I just didn't apply myself and really screwed that up and I I got into a continuation school and

623
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:18.390
Casey Lane: I met somebody there that mentored me for a long time and he kept me around as long as he could, he pulled all all of his favors you know for 30 years is his favorite he pulled for me so

624
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:34.200
Casey Lane: I think I went to the continuation school for shit. I was like, almost a fifth year senior because my when when I met my I met my dad when I was 10 right

625
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:49.680
Casey Lane: And so he he was a truck driver and I got to meet with him, too. And I went on the road with him for a few months, and I gained like 60 pounds and then I just like never kind of lost it, and was always kind of

626
01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:50.820
Casey Lane: Big grown up.

627
01:08:52.290 --> 01:09:08.100
Casey Lane: And so when when he passed away. I was 14 he passed away and then my mom got I got death benefits like you know that he paid into social security or something. And so

628
01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:15.750
Casey Lane: Yeah, we got a lot of money for me. Each month but as, as long as I was in school, so

629
01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:26.850
Casey Lane: You know me and my mom had this kind of plan. You know that I would try to stay in school, kind of, as long as I could. So I was in sunset since high school for

630
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:29.100
Casey Lane: God knows how long. I was

631
01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.670
Casey Lane: Like I said, almost a fifth year senior. That's a long, long, long time.

632
01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:33.780
Casey Lane: You know,

633
01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:42.600
Casey Lane: I was almost 20 it's something that was like crazy. So she was able to get get money for a long time and and stuff so

634
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.080
Casey Lane: But I never, never graduated, I just

635
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.190
Casey Lane: Know, not even high school right

636
01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:58.530
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, um, any, do you have a history of any kind of legal issues.

637
01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:01.800
Casey Lane: Past. No, no, actually that's

638
01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:09.270
Casey Lane: That's one thing that my mom was always proud about she always boasted that, you know, I never got in trouble to please. I never

639
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:21.330
Casey Lane: I never got caught up, that's for sure. I have been in a lot of sticky situations. I have a lot of friends. You know that were in the drug world that guy was did a lot of shady shit.

640
01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:28.710
Casey Lane: I just was very fortunate and lucky I'm not saying I was smooth, because I was not but

641
01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:33.570
Casey Lane: I was fortunate to not getting trouble or caught up or with drugs on me or

642
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:36.300
Casey Lane: Or anything so

643
01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:39.630
Casey Lane: Yeah, no, I'm very lucky.

644
01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any no no military background.

645
01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:44.370
Casey Lane: No, no.

646
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:49.080
Casey Lane: Need to go there, but my bed.

647
01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:52.290
Casey Lane: Yeah, he was super mad, and I didn't. Yeah.

648
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Um, any, anything that I didn't touch on

649
01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:00.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That you think is important for us to know about you.

650
01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:01.680
Hmm.

651
01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:05.040
Casey Lane: Well, I pretty much

652
01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:14.790
Casey Lane: Pretty much. Besides that, the only thing that that I struggle with even now is that I had a

653
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:27.840
Casey Lane: All my family. Pretty much passed away almost all at the same time. And so that is pretty much, maybe the only thing I haven't told you I struggle with that and stuff and

654
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:44.970
Casey Lane: I talked about that, you know, I will try to talk about as much as I can. But I try to talk to Tony and Dr groves nose so my grandfather, pretty much. Well, actually, no, my, my niece, she was, she was born and then

655
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:48.210
Casey Lane: She was around

656
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:50.340
Casey Lane: 10 or 11

657
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:59.790
Casey Lane: And this was in the where I was getting a bunch of drugs and doing a bunch of drugs. Well, our whole family never hid the fact that we took pills or whatever. So

658
01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:10.380
Casey Lane: My niece knew what pills were in, you know, at a very, very young age, and she knew she shouldn't have, I mean a lot of things she should know

659
01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.030
Casey Lane: And

660
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:24.990
Casey Lane: She ended up you know kind of being a problem child. She had, she wasn't mentally retarded or nothing but she had some delays and some learning, you know, she had

661
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.320
Casey Lane: I don't, I don't want to say like a slight schizophrenia type stuff. But she took

662
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.520
Casey Lane: You know, some crazy pills when she was young.

663
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:48.660
Casey Lane: Abilify she was taken adult doses of Abilify. Do you know what that that pill is okay. So as a child, so you can understand her emotions are going crazy.

664
01:12:48.900 --> 01:13:03.300
Casey Lane: You didn't know what was going on and she got suicidal at a young age, and just thought that she was being bullied at school, a little bit too. And my sister was

665
01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:12.420
Casey Lane: She was my sister would kick my niece out of the house because my mom and my sister had had

666
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:21.810
Casey Lane: You know their own trailers in a trailer park and Klamath and they lived right next to each other, pretty much, so

667
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:31.710
Casey Lane: My sister, be like, get the fuck out of here. And, like, shut the door and lock her out. And so my niece would go to my mom, you know, and my mom would take care of her for days and days and

668
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:39.570
Casey Lane: And then she tried to send her back home and she wouldn't you know just shit like that. My sister had she had mental issues.

669
01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:42.180
Casey Lane: She had schizophrenia.

670
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.530
Casey Lane: It didn't come out until a little bit later in her 20s. She had that. So she took a lot of psych meds.

671
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.030
Casey Lane: Abuse bar.

672
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.240
Casey Lane: You name it, right, you name it. She had those those meds.

673
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:03.000
Casey Lane: So she didn't know how to raise a child, and we all

674
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.020
Casey Lane: Thought we tried, but she

675
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.510
Casey Lane: She kept getting into things and and doing doing shit and she

676
01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:21.930
Casey Lane: At first the first sign was when my mom went to go take a shower. She kept it because when I would steal from her all the time she kept trying to

677
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:32.280
Casey Lane: Hide things and you know try to keep her things on her and on her bra under her boob, you know, and so when she went to go take a shower. My niece.

678
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.410
Casey Lane: went in there to use the bathroom and then seeing my mom's pills in her in her clothes.

679
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:47.520
Casey Lane: And then she took one of her pills and then have it in their mouth. It was sucking on it. And so my mom got out of the shower and seeing like like

680
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:59.460
Casey Lane: Pill like residue on her mouth and stuff. And so she was like, What are you doing, and like reaching in grabbed it out. And so, thank God. It didn't go in there, you know, and so that was when she was really trying to get attention.

681
01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:03.060
Casey Lane: And so she had done stuff like that.

682
01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:15.150
Casey Lane: I mean, almost every week it was something you know she's trying to kill herself. She's trying to do this you're trying to do that she's having trouble at school and then I got a call.

683
01:15:16.410 --> 01:15:20.310
Casey Lane: Kind of kind of early in the morning, he's like, well, ran is in an ambulance.

684
01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:27.060
Casey Lane: She took a bunch of pills and Baba, blah. And so I'm just like, at the time I was just sensitized because I'm just like,

685
01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:35.070
Casey Lane: I was like, again, she's at the hospital again because they pumped her stomach before and all this other stuff. And I'm just like, well,

686
01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:51.570
Casey Lane: You know, whatever. I don't think any of that because she lied one time said she did when she really didn't. And then she you know did a little bit. Then they pumped her stomach for no reason. So she was all attention right so people were paying attention to her.

687
01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:53.280
Casey Lane: And

688
01:15:54.330 --> 01:16:02.700
Casey Lane: But this. This time it was for real. She went in the middle of the night, got into my sister's Lockbox and the lock was broken and my

689
01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:10.200
Casey Lane: My brother in law got caught her in the middle of the night. It was like, get back to bed. You know, this, this and this and then

690
01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:23.460
Casey Lane: She got in there and took a bunch of my sister's paying bills and other things and then odd at night while everybody was sleeping and my sister found her dead in the morning.

691
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Wow.

692
01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:32.160
Casey Lane: I know. Right, right. It's right before school it was, you know, we're, we're all going to go school clothes shopping

693
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:40.260
Casey Lane: And I went down to the hospital. And I was sitting there and there was a detective sitting there, which I didn't know he was a detective.

694
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:47.730
Casey Lane: But he was asking me questions. I thought he was part of the hospital staff, I guess he's just trying to get information. You know, I didn't really know anything at the time, but

695
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:59.460
Casey Lane: The, the doctor came in and told us you know they worked on her for a good 15 minutes and they couldn't get her going and my mom did CPR.

696
01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:12.930
Casey Lane: At the house and and there was a post the the people that the people that came that worked on her was like well you know you got her a post going. So let's just get her and go and

697
01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:20.280
Casey Lane: And my mom did CPR honor and guard going and then they couldn't keep it. After that, I guess, and she ended up

698
01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.760
Casey Lane: overdosing around 1112 years old.

699
01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:35.130
Casey Lane: Wow. So that was kind of my, my first, you know, eye opener brush with that kind of stuff. It fucking tore our family apart.

700
01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:47.970
Casey Lane: Yeah, my sister blame my mom. My mom blame my sister. I was stuck in the middle, trying to get them to it's it's a tragedy. I know we all fucked up. We all did it to her.

701
01:17:48.930 --> 01:18:01.770
Casey Lane: There's not one of us, that is not as guilty as the other it, it's my sister was trying to lie to the police and say that ran a wood. That's her name ran went down to my mom's house.

702
01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:04.680
Casey Lane: And got into her pills.

703
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:13.440
Casey Lane: held on to them or whatever went back to my sister's house and then took them after dinner and died THAT way.

704
01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:22.980
Casey Lane: But we all knew that's not what happened. But she was trying to put my mom in jail. My mom was on trial, actually, because, excuse me, because

705
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:25.350
Casey Lane: Of what was going on.

706
01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:30.660
Casey Lane: You know she be, she beat the stick. Because obviously there's nothing to really

707
01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:40.890
Casey Lane: It was my. It was my sister. It was my sister's fault, you know, for not having a lock box. It was our fault because we raised her that way.

708
01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:51.390
Casey Lane: And it was just a shitty situation, my mom and my sister and didn't talk for a lot of years and my sister had it.

709
01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.480
Casey Lane: She was a habitual liar.

710
01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:03.570
Casey Lane: She could make up anything and believe it, it did not matter what it was. She could just literally just hook line and sinker believe it herself and

711
01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.740
Casey Lane: It was part of her mental she had and

712
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:09.840
Casey Lane: Over the years,

713
01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.720
Casey Lane: On the phone, she'd call me and

714
01:19:13.890 --> 01:19:30.000
Casey Lane: That's all she ever wanted to talk about what for years and years and my mom to that's all my mom cried every day for years. I don't know why she's doing this to me. CASEY I don't know why I'm just like, Mom, like, Oh, I got so fucking sick of it, you know.

715
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:36.960
Casey Lane: Yeah, I didn't know what to explain. I didn't know what to say. I'm just like, I'm fucking I've said it all to you. I don't

716
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:39.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And a lot

717
01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:47.670
Casey Lane: He had it's it's it's a huge burden, especially to, you know, a rock in between both of them trying to, you know, you know,

718
01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.560
Casey Lane: I want. I love you and I love you and it's hard to

719
01:19:53.190 --> 01:20:08.250
Casey Lane: Yeah, when they both hate each other and they're my mom wasn't lying, but my sister was lying. It's my mom and so stuff came out in the paper here and send a bunch of lies. And so, and even, you know, suck. Even worse, and

720
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:24.870
Casey Lane: One, you know, my sister called me just out of the blue, like she always did. I was on the phone with her and we kind of got the conversation like we always did about it and I just said, you know, what are her name is Christina. Anyway, so I called her Chrissy.

721
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:26.610
Casey Lane: So,

722
01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:38.880
Casey Lane: I said, You know what, Chrissy I'm fucking I am really fucking tired of indulging in your lie. I really am. I have never said it to you over the years because I love you and I don't want to hurt you.

723
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:51.480
Casey Lane: But that's not the fucking truth. You know what happened. I know what happened. Chrissy. I was there the day she died. I know what happened. We all went and got her fucking our medications that day.

724
01:20:53.220 --> 01:21:02.370
Casey Lane: Mom took a bunch of her soma's and a bunch of her pills got all fucked up. She was passed out and a plate of food. I went and seen her. And you were there and

725
01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:11.880
Casey Lane: So she was locked up right after that. So, Rana was in your care at that time. Rana did not go up there and get those pills.

726
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:25.650
Casey Lane: Even your own husband said that she got up in the middle of the night and was fucking around with that shit. And they told her to go to bed. So, you know, I just, I had a real hard realization with her and I just

727
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:34.050
Casey Lane: I don't know what helped me if God helped me or what because he gave me literally all the words that I wanted to say to her for years. It just flowed out perfectly.

728
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:43.050
Casey Lane: And then all the, all the things that she tried to come back at me with i'm just i'm just like No, that's not fucking true because of this and this and this.

729
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:57.690
Casey Lane: And then after a while, you know, she she broke down and was pretty much, you know, she said, You're, you're right, you know, and I said, I just didn't want my other son to get taken away, and this and this and this and

730
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:08.370
Casey Lane: So over the years I have been trying to get them to talk to each other and trying to get them to bury that that evil hatchet and finally over.

731
01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:18.540
Casey Lane: Years and years and years of grief. I finally got her, you know, I said you need to call Mom, you need to talk to her.

732
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:28.890
Casey Lane: And you need to deal with whatever she says to you, because of the shit, you know, you need to apologize to her and whenever she says, you just need to listen and

733
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:38.100
Casey Lane: So she goes, Okay well call her and let her know I'm calling. I called my mom and I said well, Mom. Chris is going to call you and she's like, What

734
01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:44.910
Casey Lane: She's gonna call you when she's going to talk to you. And she says, I don't want to fucking talk to her, and I said, you're going to talk to her.

735
01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:55.200
Casey Lane: Because I just spent two hours on the phone with her trying to get you guys back together and you've been wanting to do this for a long time. So, just please please do it.

736
01:22:56.190 --> 01:23:08.430
Casey Lane: And so they've you know talked over the phone. No, it wasn't as easy as that at first, but then over time and over months they spoke, and then

737
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:20.280
Casey Lane: After all these years. I was like my I fucking finally got my family back together. I've been trying so hard. I mean, so hard.

738
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:23.100
Casey Lane: And then I got a call.

739
01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:29.040
Casey Lane: I got a call from my brother in law and he says, your sisters in the hospital.

740
01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:35.040
Casey Lane: We were going to go look at buying a car, they live in.

741
01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:36.870
Casey Lane: The desert. Oh.

742
01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:46.980
Casey Lane: And she's in the hospital. We were gonna go buy a car. And so she started speaking gibberish and stuff. And so I thought she was. It was like a heat stroke.

743
01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:54.480
Casey Lane: And so we went to like a subway. I got her water and tried to eat food, but she was like hallucinating and saying all kinds of weird stuff.

744
01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:03.000
Casey Lane: So I called the ambulance. And so I was like oh my god you know I talked to him. He's like, I don't know what else is going on. I'll call you when I know

745
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:18.570
Casey Lane: And I was like, please. I didn't think it was you know that that crazy and he called me at two in the morning and he was like, She's dead. I said, What is yet your, your sister passed away. And I said, for what

746
01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:27.990
Casey Lane: I guess she had an infection or something in the sack around your heart and it did something with her brain overheated.

747
01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:34.650
Casey Lane: They couldn't get the temperature down. They did it first. They put her on ice. They got the temperature down and

748
01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:43.890
Casey Lane: But then they, you know, tried to not, you know, have put the ice on or whatever and take it off and then after that, she just

749
01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:58.470
Casey Lane: It was just like from from that to that and then get my family back together. Literally after fucking so many years, and then a few months after that. And then she dies and so

750
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.880
Casey Lane: My mom, you know, just getting to talk to her again. So now my mom is grieving again over the death of my sister.

751
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:08.910
Casey Lane: Her her firstborn.

752
01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:13.590
Casey Lane: And then a couple months after that.

753
01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:32.850
Casey Lane: My grandpa. He goes, goes in for just a regular old surgery. Nothing. Nothing crazy it was just a, you know, go in and go out, it was for some super small. I think they're just going up putting like like a colonoscopy or something.

754
01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:49.440
Casey Lane: And I guess they ended up trying to feed him too early, when he, when he was on meds and he was all you know out of him and he was choking on his food, and he aspirated was ended up

755
01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:54.060
Casey Lane: Dying, but he had a no resuscitate order.

756
01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

757
01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.600
Casey Lane: He exactly

758
01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:58.050
Casey Lane: Right.

759
01:25:58.470 --> 01:26:09.150
Casey Lane: I know my mom. My mom. She's right there. She's like, looking he's dying. She's joking. And then my, my aunt was like Terry, he hasn't know resuscitate or a weekend we can't do nothing, you know, and

760
01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:20.520
Casey Lane: And over something so stupid. And he he ended up dying over that. And so it was just like bam, bam, bam, and then

761
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:35.850
Casey Lane: I think it was not even months later, after that, after I buried my grandfather I carried his casket and everything. I then my mom ended up dying out of nowhere like my cousin called me. It was like Casey need to get over here.

762
01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:46.950
Casey Lane: Your mom is dead and i and i of course I was flipping out. I didn't know because you know she's my everything I love her. She's still is. Right, so I

763
01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:52.980
Casey Lane: I go over to her house there's, you know, police and there's an ambulance.

764
01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:55.110
Casey Lane: And they're

765
01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:09.180
Casey Lane: They're willing her out of there with a you know draped with the blanket. I could see her hand sticking out of the blanket and I can see her rings on her finger. And her bracelet. And I'm just like, oh my god, that is her book.

766
01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:15.450
Casey Lane: And it was hard because they want to ask me a bunch of stupid fucking questions. I just don't care to answer.

767
01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

768
01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:19.170
Casey Lane: You know, I'm trying to sneak a peek at hurt so I can you know

769
01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.890
Casey Lane: Because it's last time I'm ever going to get to see her.

770
01:27:24.210 --> 01:27:24.780
Casey Lane: And

771
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:32.130
Casey Lane: So it's, it's just, boom, one after another, one after another, one after another and so that that's just been bothering me.

772
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:34.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long ago was that

773
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:42.780
Casey Lane: I think. Let's see. I think it's been a few years now. I think it's been a, I think a few years.

774
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:48.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't feel like it doesn't feel like that. Yeah. For me, it doesn't feel like that it

775
01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:51.870
Casey Lane: It literally feels like maybe a month or so. Yeah.

776
01:27:51.900 --> 01:28:05.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yeah. Because it was one right after another after another, it's compact drama compacted grief and loss. You know what I mean. And it's just going to take a while, a long while, you know,

777
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Definitely

778
01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.470
Casey Lane: Um, I think what

779
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:19.320
Casey Lane: The thing was my mom was always really honest with me. She I always knew what she wanted. If something were to happen to her. She was always, you know,

780
01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.770
Casey Lane: Like that she was like, if something happens to me do this, this and this and

781
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:32.550
Casey Lane: Yeah, I was just, yeah. I guess it was supposedly because she had COPD.

782
01:28:33.330 --> 01:28:43.620
Casey Lane: From from smoking all these years. And so they said it was a mix with the COPD, mixed with she would take pain pills at night.

783
01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:54.870
Casey Lane: And she she took them how they're prescribed and everything she was. She didn't she never really abused the medications, she got from the doctor too much, you know, she's always kind of

784
01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:01.530
Casey Lane: Took them, you know, even though she took them. She was always able to take them how they prescribed right so

785
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:17.880
Casey Lane: I guess it was a mixed with that and everything that her breathing was compressed. So it was respiratory depression and like with a flashlight comorbidity so it's like a few things to kind of lead into one.

786
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:18.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah.

787
01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.210
Casey Lane: It was kind of a perfect storm, I guess.

788
01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:31.380
Casey Lane: So, but the good thing though the silver lining of all of that is that my mom got to see me clean

789
01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:38.250
Casey Lane: Because I started getting clean. When I was 30 and she died when I was 34

790
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.350
Casey Lane: So I got to spend four years with her clean

791
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:51.210
Casey Lane: And so she got to see me really do everything that I wanted to, I got to

792
01:29:52.560 --> 01:30:00.540
Casey Lane: Get a bank account again because I ruined I ruined my life I, you know, took money out when I wasn't supposed to. I had

793
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:06.480
Casey Lane: Oh, what do we call it cash advance over here. So,

794
01:30:06.570 --> 01:30:07.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I had a

795
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:13.350
Casey Lane: Bunch of cash advances out at one time. And I just never paid it back so I I thought all that shit was just gone.

796
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:29.370
Casey Lane: I went into the, the bank and I told the lady, you know, shorter story than this, of course, but I told her my that I was, you know, clean, I was getting clean. I wanted to get a bank account. I want to change my life and she

797
01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:42.720
Casey Lane: It was up to her and she said, Okay, I'll wipe all that stuff office. She's like, Don't fucking make it look like that, you know, know how this comes back to bite me because I'm believing you so I will let I'll say sign off on it, but

798
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:51.690
Casey Lane: She was like, then I get to watch you throughout the years, and I'll. So I said, Okay, and so she did. She gave me bank account. So she got to watch. We get that

799
01:30:53.130 --> 01:31:02.040
Casey Lane: She got to watch me pay off my fines and get my license because I never I didn't drive for 12 years, all kinds of stuff. So these little things are huge things

800
01:31:02.970 --> 01:31:04.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah. Very good.

801
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:11.430
Casey Lane: Yeah, I got to take care of her, and actually take care of her instead of trying to get pills out of her it was

802
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.520
Casey Lane: Totally different relationship me and her had

803
01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:16.560
Casey Lane: He actually

804
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:24.240
Casey Lane: When I first got on she actually I told her about, you know,

805
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:33.060
Casey Lane: Suboxone and what what it did for me. And when I first started, I think I gave her some and then she was able to

806
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:44.700
Casey Lane: Get off of drugs and stuff as well as like the pain pills and everything. And so she she didn't get off them completely, but she got

807
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:52.800
Casey Lane: From what she was taking until what she took at the end were drastically drastically different

808
01:31:53.520 --> 01:32:07.860
Casey Lane: And she would only take like one small you know piece of a pain pill instead of, you know, two or three or something. And so it was it was good to see her like that to her attitude change both of our added it was just like

809
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:12.780
Casey Lane: Man, they got along great. So I cherish those

810
01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:15.690
Casey Lane: Four years that we really got to know each other.

811
01:32:15.810 --> 01:32:20.610
Casey Lane: In and out personally all over again. And yeah.

812
01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:28.950
Casey Lane: It wasn't forgave her for a lot of stuff, talk to her, you know about what I'm talking to you now. Talk to me about my life and

813
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:31.230
Casey Lane: Just all kinds of stuff.

814
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:32.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's good stuff.

815
01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:42.180
Casey Lane: You got to let it you gotta let let that stuff go you know it's it's hard, but I don't think I would have been able to get where I am with without

816
01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:53.910
Casey Lane: Really telling those stories and releasing it and that's that's why I'm able to tell it to you now is back then it would be so hard. I'd be choking up big time. It'd be

817
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:55.740
Casey Lane: Super hard but

818
01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, it's really cool.

819
01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:59.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to see you.

820
01:32:59.190 --> 01:33:05.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think you have to, you know, and you'll grieve probably for a very very long time.

821
01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you know,

822
01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You just gotta take it as it comes. Yeah.

823
01:33:09.690 --> 01:33:11.970
Casey Lane: Okay, still hard for me. So, yeah.

824
01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:12.690
Casey Lane: It is

825
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:15.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's gonna be for a while, you know, for a long while.

826
01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:26.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know. Yeah, definitely. Um, you just got to take it as it comes a little piece little pieces, you know, at a time, be able to walk through it. It's a lot of loss. A lot of family loss.

827
01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:33.510
Casey Lane: And I wanted to, I have all their ashes and I wanted

828
01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:45.930
Casey Lane: My mom wanted to be laid to rest at a, at a family in Brookings where she knew like a friend, where they they have a farm with like

829
01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:56.760
Casey Lane: Like a river and everything that runs through Brookings and so they she's always wanted to be laid there is called Gardner ranch and so

830
01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:04.620
Casey Lane: I was going to do it. I think this year. But since what's going on right now in the world. They

831
01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:12.720
Casey Lane: They were doing a class reunion. And so my aunt was like, hey, I'll talk to everybody. We can lay them to rest during the

832
01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:24.930
Casey Lane: You know, so all her friends can be there and all this stuff. And so I was like, wow. That's like, that's a good idea. And I got, I got a call, not that long ago saying I guess they, you know, said his name on it.

833
01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:29.730
Casey Lane: For now, yeah. So it might be another couple years or so before I get to do that but

834
01:34:30.690 --> 01:34:31.350
Casey Lane: That's right.

835
01:34:31.710 --> 01:34:34.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you don't happen when it's supposed to happen, you know,

836
01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:38.850
Casey Lane: True that. But I think that's just pretty much the last kind of key. I need to do. I think

837
01:34:39.450 --> 01:34:46.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah. Yeah. Very much so. All right. CASEY I'm gonna let you go. I already have somebody in the waiting room. Thank you so much.

01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:28.350
Jennífer castro: You know,

897
01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:31.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So she's trying to protect mom right

898
01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:40.290
Jennífer castro: Yes, yes. And she's been a little overbearing doing it. But hey, we love her for that you know she wasn't doing it. Obviously, we're not doing enough, you know, she doesn't think

899
01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:43.590
Jennífer castro: He's got a Mom's Mom.

900
01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:45.960

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Any triggers or cravings, or any issues that have come up in the last little bit

903
01:38:56.970 --> 01:39:03.000
Jennífer castro: Um, well, my triggers. I'm not. I just like doing it, to be honest, it's just them.

904
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:15.990
Jennífer castro: Everything goes away, like I get lost in my mind a lot and lost my thought. And I beat myself up and I am don't give myself credit for not much of anything. I think that I

905
01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:20.730
Jennífer castro: If I did do it or they can be. It could have been done better. You know,

906
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.490
Jennífer castro: Yeah, so

907
01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:25.650
