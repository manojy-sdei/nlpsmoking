14
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.150
Lauren Kelly: I have to kind of start to move on with my life, you know, without all because I I can't keep just hoping it's all going to work out.

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.050
Lauren Kelly: And I'm going to be moving back there. When like you know that might not be the case and everything. So, and, you know, we hadn't talked for a few days.

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.190
Lauren Kelly: Or Tuesday night he had called me a few times and I didn't answer and then he talks to me like, hey, it's really important. Can you, you know, call me that. So,

17
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.380
Lauren Kelly: Back in a stepped outside because you know I'm at my friend's house and it sounds I signed consent in the urban some cigarette and call him back.

18
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.960
Lauren Kelly: And he was like, Hey, do you have a minute. And I'm like, Yeah, what's up, he was like, Well, why don't you step outside and I'm like, I am outside and then I was like oh and I hear like a door closed and it's he's he's

19
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.210
Lauren Kelly: Like at the house, you know, he's he's there. So, um, he's like, you know, I just want to talk to you.

20
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.340
Lauren Kelly: And basically, he said, you know, I've been thinking about it and thinking about it. And he said, You know, I want you to come back. I

21
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.530
Lauren Kelly: I just realized like, we just need to forget about everything in the past. If you're doing such an amazing job you've done so much to like re earned my trust and

22
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.450
Lauren Kelly: Every day, I'm just building more and more trust for you. And I just think like we're

23
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.920
Lauren Kelly: We know that we both wanted to be together this whole time. We've known that that was the goal. And I just finally realized I was holding on to like

24
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:14.730
Lauren Kelly: hurt and pain and being stubborn when I just don't want to spend one more day of my life without you. And I want you, you know, I want you to be my girlfriend. I want you to move back then I want

25
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.550
Lauren Kelly: You know I want I want us to just not waste another day. I don't want spend one more day without you everything which again.

26
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.250
Lauren Kelly: Is everything I wanted to hear for two months, you know, like everything here, but of course I have this little bit of apprehension, because

27
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.100
Lauren Kelly: I had been building up a wall, especially the last like week or two of, like, okay, now I have to face like without him kind of thing.

28
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:46.680
Lauren Kelly: So in that moment, like he was like, why don't you describe the dogs, you know, get some stuffing come back right now you know and and i said i. So I was really kind of cold with him at first, and I was just like, you know, I don't think we're there yet. I'm not ready to come back at

29
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.480
Lauren Kelly: You know, yeah, I wanted to hear all these things, but I don't just want to like jump. The second you say, you know what I mean, kind of thing. But of course, like

30
00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.120
Lauren Kelly: That's like my head speaking, if we're going with my heart. I wanted to just go there right that you know so

31
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:10.950
Lauren Kelly: I ended. I didn't go back, but we talked for like three hours, and it was a good conversation. Obviously, I mean, he seemed just really open and ready to put everything in the past and and

32
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.050
Lauren Kelly: We were talking about. And I said, I really like for this us to be successful.

33
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:26.070
Lauren Kelly: I need you to focus on the person I am today my behaviors, my actions today and I'm not saying let's forget about everything from the past, but I can't have you bringing it up all the time. I can't have you

34
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:36.570
Lauren Kelly: You know making me relive my passing mentally going back to those dark places like I need you to, to, you know, judge me on my behaviors today and my actions today.

35
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.970
Lauren Kelly: You know, in any I 100% I'm willing to do that. I just want to start fresh and everything. So the next day was Wednesday, which was the my dad's birthday.

36
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:55.590
Lauren Kelly: You know, why don't you come over you know obviously like you know I'm in this 30 garage. Here there. It's this really nice apartment, you know, he said, Why don't you just come over and relax and like you know

37
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.890
Lauren Kelly: We'll spend that day together. We'll do some things to honor your dad and

38
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.640
Lauren Kelly: You know, and obviously, I'd rather you know that day I really didn't want to be alone. You know, and I thought, and so then I called you because I wanted to talk to you have like

39
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.040
Lauren Kelly: Am I, am I, I wasn't sure what your advice would be, like, am I running to back too soon. Like what am I, you know i don't know i just i wanted i

40
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.370
Lauren Kelly: Because again, my heart is like, go, go. Now that my head is like, I don't know. You know, so, um,

41
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:33.000
Lauren Kelly: I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if that's just that wall. I'd built up a thinking I'm it's me against the world again and now it's it's kind of hard for me to like let him back in because I spent so much time like building that wall up of, like, Okay, I have to focus on being alone.

42
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:41.280
Lauren Kelly: Um, but, so I did go there. On Wednesday, and I ended up so I always pack really heavy. I'm just one of those people like if I go somewhere for a day, I'll bring stuff.

43
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:51.780
Lauren Kelly: So I had brought up in just over there. So I actually the only reason I'm here. Like my friends garage right now is because I had a 9am dentist appointment and conquered and

44
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.460
Lauren Kelly: So the apartments in San Ramon, it's like 45 minutes away from Concord and the next time over from conquered is Pittsburgh, which is where my friends graduate. So I figured

45
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:10.890
Lauren Kelly: This would be if I was incorporated this morning, it'd be a good time for me to come back to the Pittsburgh house and there were some things like I needed. Um, and then I just figured I do the call here because there wasn't enough time to get all the way back to San Ramon and still make

46
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:22.230
Lauren Kelly: So, um, so yeah, so I'm kind of in this weird so so then. So now it's been so since Wednesday. I'm just so it's been like, what, five days or something that

47
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.170
Lauren Kelly: I work and it's been amazing. Like, literally hasn't brought up a single thing about my past like we've just been

48
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:38.310
Lauren Kelly: super happy and it's been like the way it was before. Like there's just, you know, we've just been rebuilding a lot of trust like one thing I've done every night as I just leave my phone in

49
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:46.470
Lauren Kelly: The kitchen and I told him a few days in. I said, Do you know why I do that and he said no. And I said, I do that because I just I just have full

50
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:55.980
Lauren Kelly: Transparency, I'm not hiding it in my purse anymore. I'm not, you know, like I just leave it out there and he was like, Oh, you don't need to do that. I don't, I don't want to look at it they don't you know that's not where we're at, you know, and, and

51
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.050
Lauren Kelly: It's just been it's been really great. Like, I wasn't sure my apprehensive was

52
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.160
Lauren Kelly: He could be saying he's ready to put stuff in the past but is he really ready to do that, you know, like what am i vector. And it's just that all over again.

53
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:17.790
Lauren Kelly: But we're like five days in and it's literally been not one mention of the past like everything has been about like, like I ended up getting that and a workbook that we talked about and group.

54
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.300
Lauren Kelly: Yeah. And I love that thing that's like the best thing I found since I've been in recovery about like it just really makes you go in depth on

55
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Every is

56
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:33.300
Lauren Kelly: Just kind of okay let's make a fearless moral inventory of ourselves. It's like, well, how do you do that like these are the questions that help you really get into that and and I

57
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.090
Lauren Kelly: Firmly believe like getting the drugs out of my system was

58
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.640
Lauren Kelly: My problems. The bigger things like changing the behaviors and the thought processes that I had built up for so many years.

59
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:49.590
Lauren Kelly: So this is that work with is is amazing. I'm getting me to really like delve into that stuff. So like, you know, he spent like hours of me just, we will go through the things and

60
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.880
Lauren Kelly: Talk about each question and discuss them together and whatever, you know, like you keep it really is prioritizing like my recovery and everything he's going to go to

61
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.180
Lauren Kelly: A meeting with me tomorrow because we found smart recovery which is like kind of less God is kind of more up my alley.

62
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:13.980
Lauren Kelly: So we wanted to try that. And I was going to go, but he's like, No, I want to go with you. It's really interesting to me. So this is like the all I know and love from my early January when like you know you had first got back together.

63
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.210
Lauren Kelly: Before I screwed it up. I like lying about the frame thing and then the hotel thing and all that.

64
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:27.030
Lauren Kelly: And and he's been telling me like I'm like I'm the Lauren, he knows and loves from early January row was so raw and vulnerable and just so open and honest about everything.

65
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:37.320
Lauren Kelly: And he has this way of just this uncanny way of knowing, like when I'm being honest and he's right. Like, you know, like that era thing he knew that one day, everything else is truthful, he was able to hone in on the one thing and like

66
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.420
Lauren Kelly: I haven't lied about anything I've been 100% honest about everything, and he knows that, because he's so good at, like,

67
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.060
Lauren Kelly: Telling that. So we're just in a really good place. However, I was kind of nervous for this call with us today because I'm like

68
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:57.660
Lauren Kelly: What up, Rebecca is like, whoa, whoa. Like, you need to take a step back, you're jumping way too soon, maybe like you should stay at DNS for a few more weeks and see, you know, from a step back, if this is working, but

69
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:07.530
Lauren Kelly: Obviously, like in my head. I would love nothing more than to go back there. But still, like, I haven't moved everything I have a few bags of stuff there. I still have a lot here at and so I'm, I'm still kind of

70
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.020
Lauren Kelly: Again, like my plan was today to get some stuff from Dan's and bring it back there, but I

71
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.700
Lauren Kelly: It's not like I'm asking you to make decisions for me or anything but a lot of it.

72
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:24.270
Lauren Kelly: You know, I just, I was really interested in what your thoughts are on all of this because like I wasn't expecting him to come back and say all those things, but it was

73
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:30.030
Lauren Kelly: It was everything I've been wanting for these last two months and then to see the five last five days of him.

74
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:40.170
Lauren Kelly: 100% like you know like walking the walk, you know, and actually being able to really put that stuff in the past and really just focus on like the

75
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:47.550
Lauren Kelly: Really the much better person that I am today and letting that stuff go and he's really really been like doing that so I'm

76
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.430
Lauren Kelly: I'm just interested of what your thoughts are on all this and like did I make the wrong decision by just going back there.

77
00:08:53.790 --> 00:09:03.630
Lauren Kelly: And you know, I didn't do I didn't go the first day. But I went the second and then I didn't plan on staying so long, but it was just like so amazing that we did, he ended up taking yesterday after work just like hanging out with me all day like

78
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:18.210
Lauren Kelly: It was, it's just been really healthy really amazing like nothing but supportive and loving and happy and you know just the way that we, that we are at our best. You know what I mean. And

79
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.760
Lauren Kelly: I mean they're, they're just hasn't been when

80
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.870
Lauren Kelly: There's like one thing that we there was like a little

81
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:34.350
Lauren Kelly: Argument kind of thing like misunderstanding. We had one more in. And within like five minutes. We had talked it on the whole thing was over, you know, and so he he was saying like, look at how quick, we just get through things like we're just able to

82
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:41.970
Lauren Kelly: Just talk about him see eye to eye and we move on to the next thing. And and our communications like better than it's ever been or trust is better than it's ever been.

83
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:49.410
Lauren Kelly: And so yeah, I don't know, it's so I'm not sure did. I jumped too soon. Should I stay back here a few more days to kind of

84
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:58.500
Lauren Kelly: Have some separate or or do you think it's it's safe and good to, like, say, Okay, let's do this and move back in like like he wants me to like my heart wants me to

85
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:04.530
Lauren Kelly: But that part of my head that scared of getting her is kind of like, oh my god, what if something changes or whatever but

86
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:13.140
Lauren Kelly: He always said like, and all the letters you write and everything. He would always say when our lives like intertwined. Again, it's going to be it for us. Like, I firmly believe that and i i i believe that, too. So

87
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:19.560
Lauren Kelly: That's like what, and he was saying that today when he came back, he was like, babe, this is this is such a huge day for us because this is the first time.

88
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:28.770
Lauren Kelly: We can move forward in a relationship completely unencumbered, you know, like we're everything's out there and we know, we know it. We put him in each other for it and we can just move on, you know, and

89
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:37.530
Lauren Kelly: Again, I wasn't sure if he could do that. But he's really been doing it. And again, it's only five days, you know, so it's not like it's a significant amount of time, but

90
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:53.490
Lauren Kelly: He's 100% fulfilled, like what he said. And obviously, I'm way happier when I'm with him and a map house and everything. So yeah, I want to just problem myself right now and just be like, Okay, I'm moving back and not under percent but um I just was really interested in

91
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.320
Lauren Kelly: What do you think

92
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I think that the minute that you are willing to

93
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Realize that you need to be in recovery for you.

94
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:12.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And let go of the expectations of the outcome. Yes, when things started falling in put into place.

95
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It doesn't mean that in in another week that things might pop up. But what's most important is that you're able to

96
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:39.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Talk them over talk them out to the resolution and not in a healthy way. That's right, not yelling, screaming, not hands on not being defensive not running out the door, but being able to say, okay, these are one of the tough conversations that we need to have

97
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:46.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we're going to have it. Yeah. And being able to walk it all the way through to the end.

98
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In the very beginning, Lauren. When you and I first started meeting, everything was all about Paul

99
00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:01.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you transform that to everything all about Lauren and that's where you need to stay your recovery needs to come first.

100
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:12.030
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Everything else needs to come after that. So as long as you're engaging and you're doing this for the right reasons. And you're working on yourself. You know what I mean. I say, you know, that

101
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Do it, it's a safe place for you and it provides

102
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.800
Lauren Kelly: Hold at all. He's not like there's, it's like 45 minutes away from all my drug dealers where where I am.

103
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.530
Lauren Kelly: Right now I'm like three blocks call my drug dealers, you know, and

104
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:34.080
Lauren Kelly: And I mean access isn't enough for me. I'm not. I'm way stronger my recovery. It's not like oh my gosh my drug dealers three blocks away.

105
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:44.610
Lauren Kelly: I'm going to go get some I'm you know I had Narcos in my hand not that long ago, and it wasn't an issue for me. So that's not the issue. But it does every time I drive past that street or whatever it is kind of like

106
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.480
Lauren Kelly: Well, it's right there.

107
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:52.230
Lauren Kelly: San Ramon, it's like far away from me. He has never experimented like the worst thing he's ever done smoke weed and like college and stuff. So like

108
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.270
Lauren Kelly: It that he doesn't even smoke weed. Now, you know, it's like he doesn't even drink you know it's it's it's

109
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:08.160
Lauren Kelly: It couldn't be less of an issue there and I feel really lucky because I feel like a lot of people in recovery like their, their spouse or something probably still does drugs and it would be near impossible to get clean but it really is.

110
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:15.570
Lauren Kelly: Like I lucked out that I'm able to get almost an hour away from where all those bad behaviors and everything were happening.

111
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:25.800
Lauren Kelly: And I can be in the situation with someone who wants nothing to do with drugs and wants nothing more than a clean Lauren and and that thinks I'm at my very best when I'm clean and and

112
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.040
Lauren Kelly: And when I'm putting my recovery like even before him, you know, and that's always searching. We had a conversation last night.

113
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:41.100
Lauren Kelly: Here I would phone them like even if we had broken up and never got back together. I know for a fact, I would still be clean right now. And he was like, I know that to you know i know that too and that it wasn't

114
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:47.790
Lauren Kelly: Just based on him in the beginning it was but it's, it hasn't been for a long time, you know, and, um,

115
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:55.740
Lauren Kelly: So yeah, it's I feel really lucky that that's just not a part of his life for his world at all. So when I'm there. It's there, aren't those

116
00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:01.110
Lauren Kelly: Like it's the people, places and things. I don't have those temptations. They don't have those thoughts. I'm just like,

117
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:06.360
Lauren Kelly: Again, I feel like I'm dealing with natural built. I mean, from like being around the person I love so much that it's like I don't even want

118
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:16.500
Lauren Kelly: To even think about using and all I think about like getting into another meeting and working in my workbook showing up for group and therapy and doing all the things that are going to make me like the best version of me and

119
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.640
Lauren Kelly: That's all. Ever since the day I met him. He's always made me want to be a better person and

120
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.850
Lauren Kelly: And that's like right back where we are. So I don't have to focus on. Oh my god, these horrible mistakes. I mean, in the past, I can really focus on like every day how I'm going to progress and move forward and

121
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:37.080
Lauren Kelly: That's what I've wanted this whole time, you know, ever since I finally like owned up to these big secrets of me being a drug addict and all those things.

122
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:46.020
Lauren Kelly: My biggest dream would be like if I could put those things in the past and not forget about them but but be able to be judged on my behaviors in my actions today and not

123
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:56.250
Lauren Kelly: Eight months ago, lauren and and it feels like really are there and just like only fear was did I jumped the gun or not. But, you know, you think it's it's a good thing and

124
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:05.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I think that it was inevitable. You know, I'm here to walk with you in your decisions right

125
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:13.710
Lauren Kelly: No, I'm not asking you, like, make it for me but but your opinion really matters to me because, you know, the whole thing. You've seen me cry, my eyes out for hours over this, you know, you've seen

126
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:24.540
Lauren Kelly: You know me up my lowest lows and everything. So it's a, you know, and you know that this is what I always wanted. This is what I talked about is like just wanting him to be able to see me for me today and

127
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:33.030
Lauren Kelly: And who I'm going to be you know tomorrow and the next day, as I stay on this path and and to love me for that person you know and and to

128
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:39.630
Lauren Kelly: Be willing to have like a clean, fresh start. And I, you know, there were times I didn't know if we could do that. And it felt like I was losing

129
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:50.910
Lauren Kelly: Like the love of my life and to know that he's ready to do that. I've been so ready to do that. So it feels like we 100% are on the same page like probably for the first time ever, you know, and

130
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.340
Lauren Kelly: It just feels really good and really healthy and really right. You know, you know,

131
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:56.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I

132
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:02.160
Lauren Kelly: was hoping you would think that was a good thing that I was scared you were gonna say, Well, Lord, slow down, you know,

133
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:17.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I am walking with you. So you know if this is your decision in this moment in in your life, then I'm right here beside you will walk through. We'll talk through we'll, we'll get through whatever pops up.

134
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the great part about this therapeutic alliance is that

135
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't get to do. I will not judge you for any decisions that you make.

136
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, you're making the best decision that you can make for you in this moment, and it is something that you've always wanted.

137
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I just want you to keep your eyes open. Keep your blinders off.

138
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:49.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And know that even from the very beginning, the problems in your relationship with him are two sided

139
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:55.260
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, they're not one sided so you know what I mean, as long as you you you know keep that peace.

140
00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:01.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're prepared, whatever happens is going to happen in the future. It's about walking through day by day right now.

141
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah right, gaining strength in your recovery and what an awesome thing that he's willing to go to meetings with you and support you and learn about what you've, you know, got to walk through and what you've got to do in order to continue on this path that rocks.

142
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:21.570
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, I mean, he's definitely show me like he loves me on a level. I didn't even know like existed in that he's willing to

143
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:28.560
Lauren Kelly: Accept because again like drugs or I've never been a part of his world. So it's not like he knows drug addicts have friends who are joined out except for him to like accept

144
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:36.270
Lauren Kelly: The fact that he's in love with the drug addict and lives with a drug addict, like that's something I never even thought he could do and to see that not only can he except that he can

145
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:43.620
Lauren Kelly: Pretty much embrace it and even want to be a part of the street, you know, it'd be one thing for him just support me going to meetings and okay yeah you can go, whatever, but

146
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:53.100
Lauren Kelly: He, you know, we're working in my workbook for hours where you know I'm asking him, will you know this is something I've noticed to me. Do you notice that, well, yeah, I've noticed that. And this and, you know, and we really

147
00:17:53.430 --> 00:18:00.690
Lauren Kelly: Talk through everything and and he has always a really interesting perspective on things because he can see it from whole different light than I can, you know, because I'm only seeing things from within.

148
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.300
Lauren Kelly: And sometimes I don't think I'm making as much progress as I am. And he's like, No, no, no. You need to realize what you've done here, you know, and

149
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:14.100
Lauren Kelly: And so he he makes me he brings out a whole new level of like pride in my recovery that I didn't have before because if the one I love more than anything.

150
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:21.330
Lauren Kelly: Can see these positive changes in me, then that's all I ever wanted. You know, and then that means I'm doing something right here, you know, and

151
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:31.410
Lauren Kelly: Again, like this is all I ever wanted. And maybe because I'm now getting it. I'm like terrified of it a little bit and and even told me a couple days ago that like

152
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.930
Lauren Kelly: That one of the things he always loved about me was that I was like

153
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:43.680
Lauren Kelly: Super, super effective with him. And I guess since I had been back I hadn't been that way I and I asked him, like, percentage wise, what was then we said about 60% of what something like almost half as, you know,

154
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:50.370
Lauren Kelly: Less affection. And I said, I kind of thought about it for a minute. And I thought, you know, I think that's my just fear of, like, you know,

155
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.300
Lauren Kelly: This is so good. I'm scared to like enjoy it too much because

156
00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:02.010
Lauren Kelly: What if you know, but but at the end of the day, like I know I'm not going to screw up the way I screwed up before I know I'm never gonna, I'm not going to use I'm

157
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:10.560
Lauren Kelly: I'm not gonna lie, I'm not and if if I did by accident. I would go to him and tell him right after you know what I mean, if that is something stupid slip, but it's not going to be

158
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:19.500
Lauren Kelly: A grand betrayal. It's not an end if something like that happens on his end it, then you know I can't control that. But I can control me and my actions and

159
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.070
Lauren Kelly: I know that I'm not going to do that. So, in my mind, I really see our biggest problem.

160
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:33.150
Lauren Kelly: Being a misunderstanding or, you know, just some little issues and those kind of things we've never had problems working through it's only been like the brand or trails that we've had issues, you know, big problems with

161
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:42.720
Lauren Kelly: And after how much we've gone through and how much we hurt each other and how much we've decided to forgive each other for it. Like I just don't see that happening. I understand that the possibility

162
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.280
Lauren Kelly: I know on my end, it's not. I can't control his end, but I just don't

163
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:53.370
Lauren Kelly: See us working this hard to get back together and to forgive each other for things we thought we could never forgive each other for

164
00:19:53.610 --> 00:20:08.040
Lauren Kelly: And to be in this great place. Just to fuck it up again. You know, I just, I don't see that I obviously my eyes are open and I know like life is life and anything can happen, but I know for me I i'm not capable of doing hurting him in that way ever again. And so

165
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:18.720
Lauren Kelly: My piece of it is those things won't happen. So anything that any misunderstanding or argument or anything is something we can work through. So I don't see

166
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:32.310
Lauren Kelly: That, you know, I think we're in like a great place. The best place I've ever been in any relationship, the most healthiest place like the I just, I feel like we can face things and we can do it together and we can do it in a healthy way and

167
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.210
Lauren Kelly: I'm really excited about that. There is this little bit of fear in me. But again, I don't want my life to be driven by fear.

168
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:45.330
Lauren Kelly: It's just so good that I'm scared. You know, and I don't really know how to get like past that and and

169
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:54.930
Lauren Kelly: And completely break that wall down. He says, I asked him, I think, last night, have I been doing better with affection thing. And he and he said, yeah, ever since. I'm glad I brought it up because you have, you know, been doing better and

170
00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.100
Lauren Kelly: I'm trying to kind of break down that wall, but I still feel it a little bit of like again like I'm still asking you, like, Is it okay if I go back, but you know like

171
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:08.550
Lauren Kelly: I still have this little bit of fear, am I doing the right thing. Am I not, but I know what feels good and right in my heart, and this feels good. Right.

172
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.730
Lauren Kelly: Heart, but there's just a stupid part of my brain of like, well, what if this and what if that and what if this but you know

173
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:23.100
Lauren Kelly: To be honest, without him. I'm absolutely miserable. You know, I don't eat. I don't sleep I cry. I'm miserable and with him like

174
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.830
Lauren Kelly: every second of my day is just like fulfilled and happy you know whether I'm with him or not, like,

175
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:38.280
Lauren Kelly: I'm just happy and at peace knowing like work good and, you know, at the end of the day when he gets off work or I'm done, you know, with my therapy or whatever, like I'm going to get to see him and

176
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:44.430
Lauren Kelly: And you know tomorrow I'm looking for this meeting to go through with them and just having that support. They're not having to walk through that alone and

177
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:50.700
Lauren Kelly: It's just, it's, it's everything I wanted and everything I've been working towards and

178
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:56.220
Lauren Kelly: Then to be on and not like all I've been working towards is a relationship with him. But what I've been working towards is a healthy, happy life.

179
00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:07.200
Lauren Kelly: You know, and he's a huge piece of that. And it's kind of hard for me to picture a healthy, happy life without him. I know I can still be clean, without him that's on an issue but

180
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:17.190
Lauren Kelly: My happiest healthiest is with him in my life, you know, and it feels really awesome to have that, again, I just have that little fear of, like, Oh my gosh, what if I'm jumping

181
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:28.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, okay. So it's good to have a little bit of healthy fear. Yeah, and you know it is. It's very good, and it will dissipate the longer that this goes good

182
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I

183
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:36.720
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, I want you to recognize something, and that is that you have to work through being happy with yourself.

184
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:44.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And no, no matter what happens between you and Paul Lauren is going to be okay. Lauren will learn how to find her happiness within Lauren

185
00:22:45.090 --> 00:23:01.590
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so you've got to really keep your eye on Warren and where she's at and what she's doing. And, you know, being in recovery is a very selfish selfless way to live. So working internally on you doing

186
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The work that you're beginning to do allows for the rest of your relationships to flourish.

187
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:15.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, right. So there has to be, you know, that whole piece of you being able to venture

188
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:29.880
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to do this for yourself as well. Still getting a sponsor still even doing a book study with your in a book workbook and sitting with women and working through that stuff.

189
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Would be really beneficial because then you'll be able to build those female relationships that will support you.

190
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:43.500
Lauren Kelly: I'm going to do tonight by myself so I'm doing that tonight. And then we're doing this, my recovery thing tomorrow. So yeah, I'm hoping to make some connections or it's more women.

191
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:55.170
Lauren Kelly: Doing that tonight. So that's definitely something I'm working harder. And I'd like to make some friendships in recovery and oh, also, um, so, you know, in our group, you know the girl era, and then

192
00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:01.230
Lauren Kelly: She reached out to me on Facebook and she's, she's like the only younger one that's around myself like I kind of relate

193
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:07.350
Lauren Kelly: Group like certain things like she'll say, I'm just like, oh, I really relate to her, and it was funny because I've kind of been thinking like a week before that of like

194
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:15.870
Lauren Kelly: I kinda want to like exchange numbers with her because I wouldn't mind just like checking in with her. See how she's doing and whatever, but I was like, how do I do that. My only contact with hers and group. And I'm like, I don't know if

195
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.520
Lauren Kelly: I should be like hey Chiara. And then I thought, like maybe. That'd be weird to the other girls that I

196
00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:30.270
Lauren Kelly: Didn't ask for their number, whatever, but she found you on Facebook. And so, um, so, yeah, like she and I have kind of start talking outside of group. And I'm like, that's really what she's Sacramento, which is only, like, an hour from me.

197
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:38.220
Lauren Kelly: So like that would be cool to like maybe one day go meet her, and go to a meeting with her or something. And so I want to see. Is that okay, but I do that that we're allowed to do that.

198
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, I think it's awesome.

199
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:45.840
Lauren Kelly: Okay, so, um, I just thought, the more you know female friends I have in this, the better you know and

200
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.970
Lauren Kelly: You know, even if it's text here and there to check in.

201
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:55.320
Lauren Kelly: We're fighting the same battle. And I think our recovery dates are like a week or something off so they're like right parallel to each other, you know,

202
00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.540
Lauren Kelly: Um, but it was interesting that group yesterday she was talking about how she

203
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:08.190
Lauren Kelly: Was breaking up like her dad's medications for him, and there was oxy cotton there and she was like shaking having it in her hand and almost took it.

204
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.870
Lauren Kelly: And but she was too scared to tell her dad. Hey, I'm in recovery. I can't do this anymore. And like

205
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:20.910
Lauren Kelly: Paul and I were talking about that after the fact that I'm like, that's terrifying to me. I feel like she's setting yourself up for failure because here. She's handling these feels like she's too scared to tell someone

206
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:30.720
Lauren Kelly: Hey, I'm in recovery. I can't handle your pills anymore. And I was thinking, like, not like I'm further along than that. But I was thinking like if I hadn't been honest with like Paul and like the person I live with and that sort of thing.

207
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:35.340
Lauren Kelly: About being in recovery. Like, I don't think I would be successful at all. You know, and so I was thinking like

208
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.570
Lauren Kelly: I like to talk to her about that, like, not in group or anything. Just how much like

209
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:49.980
Lauren Kelly: Being honest with the people in my life, and especially the people you live with how beneficial that sense to me. And how her dad's probably not gonna be mad at her. He's probably going to rally around her. And that's what she's like she has this fear but

210
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:56.400
Lauren Kelly: It's not like hey I because she said she uses still oxy cotton from him and she doesn't want him to be bad about that and everything. And I'm like,

211
00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:01.740
Lauren Kelly: You know, it's not like you're still using, you can say, Look, I've got two months to clean time under my belt. I'm changing and all that, but

212
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.840
Lauren Kelly: It just kind of when I hear other people that are still so scared of like being honest with the people in their life. It makes me feel

213
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:18.600
Lauren Kelly: Really proud that I've done that, you know, and obviously not with everyone like my mom so doesn't know that lives hours and hours away and is super religious, whatever. But I've done it with several of my close friends I've done it with Paul

214
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:29.310
Lauren Kelly: In depth on every level. It'd be gone in and out of every you know it's gotten into every single lie and and gone in depth about what it was why I did it. You know, all those things.

215
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:34.410
Lauren Kelly: And that's been a really like liberating and freeing experience for me because now there's nothing

216
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:42.270
Lauren Kelly: I have to worry about him, finding out about. There's nothing from the assets going to come out because he said that if something has been asking you, like, yeah, we talked about that for an hour a month.

217
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.420
Lauren Kelly: You know what I mean, like, there's nothing that's going to come out anymore and

218
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:55.050
Lauren Kelly: You know, for the last almost 10 years of my life. I just had these fears of everyone around me finding out what I was really doing and who I really wasn't. I don't have to do that anymore and

219
00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:07.650
Lauren Kelly: And it just it's it's better than taking pills. It's better than any high I had before, of just feeling like I can just look in the mirror and I can go to sleep at night. And I've actually been sleeping better than I have in years and

220
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:13.410
Lauren Kelly: I just for the first time ever. I've actually been like feeling better about myself. And again, like

221
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.930
Lauren Kelly: I've been setting boundaries with Paul and telling him what I need, like, one thing I told him is like you know I don't want

222
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:29.310
Lauren Kelly: To when we had the original conversation. I said, you know, you need to file for divorce, like that's something that needs to happen. I can't get serious with you until you found. He's like, done. And he was calling like mediators and lawyers and stuff. The next day,

223
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.200
Lauren Kelly: To set appointments for that, like, and he's like anything that's important to you, just let me know and

224
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:47.670
Lauren Kelly: You know, I will do it. And I will be accountable to you for so he's willing to have. It's not just, like, well, you need to be accountable and the trust issues are with you. He's recognizing that I have that with him, too. And that he's willing to face that however I need him to and

225
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.550
Lauren Kelly: And so, yeah, it's like, and I was thinking about it. And I was thinking, like, I honestly think this

226
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.380
Lauren Kelly: This is the first time in my life.

227
00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:06.330
Lauren Kelly: Not only like with friends or relationships like this is literally the first time I've ever set a boundary with anyone. I've never told a boyfriend before like you can't talk to me like that or like you can't touch me. You can't put your hands on like

228
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:18.450
Lauren Kelly: I've never done that before. I've always just thought, okay, this. You know what I mean. And for the first time ever. I'm like, this is what I need. You need to do this, this and you know and and they're not unreasonable like the reasonable things they're fair, you know, and

229
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:31.350
Lauren Kelly: And it's like, that's one thing. Like we both say like if there's something we're going to ask the other one. It's going to be a reasonable thing. It's not going to be some unfair totally out there thing you know it's going to be reasonable and understandable and

230
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:38.190
Lauren Kelly: It just, it feels really good to tell people like this is how you're allowed to treat me. This is not how you're allowed to treat you know and I

231
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:46.680
Lauren Kelly: And literally never done that before. And that's crazy to me that I'm a 36 year old woman, and I've never like told someone know before you know you can't do that and

232
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:55.860
Lauren Kelly: I basically let friends and family members and relationships. Just walk all over me, which makes my self worth about this big, you know, and now I

233
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:03.180
Lauren Kelly: You know, I'm not quite to that point yet where I'm like, cool. I'm super worthy of love and I love myself and all that, but like I am getting to a point where

234
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:12.270
Lauren Kelly: I'm starting to think like, I'm not this shitty person, you know, and even like I'm seeing like the real Bourne come out more and more every day and it's making me

235
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.990
Lauren Kelly: It's just driving me like every day that I have under my belt is I'm just stronger and stronger in the fact that I never ever want to use it.

236
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:29.220
Lauren Kelly: And I never want to be that person again and and know that I really won't. I, I, there's nothing like that could make me use again it. There's really not and and

237
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:41.190
Lauren Kelly: It just and knowing that it's not for Paul because I've been without Paul and I still stay clean you know and and I had surgery and I still stay clean and I you know what I mean, I've done all these things and and

238
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:52.020
Lauren Kelly: I just, I'm just really happy with where I'm at. I recognize. I still have a lot, a lot, a lot of work to do, but I'm actually really seeing like the Harvard kind of paying off now.

239
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.760
Lauren Kelly: You know, in my relationships and

240
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:02.130
Lauren Kelly: And also the way that I'm feeling about myself, you know, and I haven't felt like a positive feeling about myself. I'm 10 years you know and

241
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:09.030
Lauren Kelly: So just seeing how hard I'm working every day how how productive. I am every day, how much I get done every day.

242
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:17.550
Lauren Kelly: Just every day. I'm just moving forward. And I feel like I'm taking leaps and bounds and just in the last 60 days I could make a list of literally like 25 things that I've done.

243
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:27.510
Lauren Kelly: That I neglected for 10 years that I've just checked off the list. Oh, also yesterday, I finally found out I got the results from that cancer screening. I had, and I'm cancer free. Everything was benign.

244
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:34.590
Lauren Kelly: Nice. Yes. And that was like I was super scared because I've neglected that for like four years, so I thought it would be back.

245
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:44.850
Lauren Kelly: tenfold. You know, and so I finally just found out they just want me to check up on it once a year. And, you know, so I don't have to worry about it till March of next year or even think about it.

246
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:53.310
Lauren Kelly: And so that was yesterday. That was huge, you know that now I have a clean bill of health. So that was the one thing kind of hold me back. Can I get back to work again, or do I do with this now.

247
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.370
Lauren Kelly: And so it just kind of feels like nothing stopping me and I just feel like I don't know if it's God or the universe, but like

248
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:09.240
Lauren Kelly: I feel like it's rewarding me like no you're doing so well, and like, we're not going to have this helping hold you back, you're going to place for boring, you're doing so well and it's like now. It seemed like bad things.

249
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:16.110
Lauren Kelly: Used to just kind of follow me around, but that was when I was a bad person. It's like I had had karma, coming back to me because I was a bad person, and now

250
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:27.360
Lauren Kelly: That I'm not lying to anybody and being 100% transparent with the people I love. I'm owning my past decisions, but more than that. I'm focused on becoming this better person.

251
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:37.860
Lauren Kelly: And always moving forward and never just been okay with where I'm at today. Knowing I just I have so much more work to do. And I need to just constantly progress and be focused, you know, eyes on the prize and be focused on

252
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:43.410
Lauren Kelly: Where I want to be, you know, a year under my belt two years in a row 10 years under my belt. Meantime,

253
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:56.640
Lauren Kelly: And knowing I'm going to get there and being willing to do whatever it takes to get there and knowing it says Lauren journey and not like Lauren and Paul journey or, you know, anything like that. Um, it's

254
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:03.300
Lauren Kelly: Actually finally seeing like it pay off or like that first month of recovery. It's like you're just there's so much guilt and

255
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:10.260
Lauren Kelly: All you can think about is the past, and how do I get through this. Like, and trying to do the word but not really seen it yet, like now I'm in, you know,

256
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:19.200
Lauren Kelly: I think I actually lost track. I think I'm around like 70 days or something like that. I know I was 60 days I think like last Thursday or something. So I'm like,

257
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:24.810
Lauren Kelly: Not last Thursday, but the Thursday before. So yeah, I'm like over like a week and a half over that, um,

258
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:31.560
Lauren Kelly: So, you know, I'm actually, I'm just way more clear headed now. You know, I just, I'm able to

259
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:37.980
Lauren Kelly: Really like process things in a healthier way. Like I said, like when we had a little just minor disagreement, the other day.

260
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:45.060
Lauren Kelly: I got that overwhelm or and feeling where it got really into my head and that kind of started to spiral with. Oh my gosh. This means that, and these negative things and he was able to be

261
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:51.570
Lauren Kelly: Just like Lori know calm down, you know, and, and I was able to take a step back and within like five to 10 minutes. The whole thing was like clear

262
00:32:52.230 --> 00:33:05.340
Lauren Kelly: You know, and, and he handled it. Nobody raised their voice. No, but you know, it's just it was actually a really like love being healthy conversation and and we're we were better than ever, you know, and knowing that I can handle conflict or

263
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:11.220
Lauren Kelly: You know, not happy or great feelings without getting overwhelmed and running like I did before, you know, and

264
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:21.330
Lauren Kelly: And like, no, no, no. Let's sit here. Let's look each other in the face and let's handle this, you know, and let's do it in a way that's healthy for both of us. And, and then let's drop it and move forward. Once we handled it and not live

265
00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:29.040
Lauren Kelly: You live in this moment all day. You know what I mean. And, and it's not just me doing that he's been amazing at that too. So, um,

266
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:37.170
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, it, it fills it just, it feels really great. And again, like I think he was right when we said this is this is so huge for us because this is the first time.

267
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:46.110
Lauren Kelly: We can like walk for move forward in a relationship completely unencumbered, you know, and we're just out there and and it does like you know obviously

268
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:56.460
Lauren Kelly: The relationship was great in the beginning before either of us have heard each other, but I actually wouldn't trade that what I have now for that because this is so much more real it. No, because

269
00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:06.300
Lauren Kelly: You know back then when things were great. Perfect. He didn't really know who I was. They know what I was doing, you know, in a mean and now

270
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.970
Lauren Kelly: Those when I'm doing. He knows who I am. For the depths of my core and and and

271
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:21.810
Lauren Kelly: To know that like I always thought I was just horrible shitty person to my core and that's why I didn't want people to see that. But now seeing like, no, that was like attic or that's not who like boring Kelly is and

272
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:32.550
Lauren Kelly: And now I get to really be morning Kelly. And I'm like, well, or Kelly is that she'd ever put like she's actually kind of cool. And like, you know, like being clear headed as she's actually a really good friend and she's a really awesome girlfriend and

273
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.010
Lauren Kelly: And she's reliable and dependable and when my friends.

274
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:41.760
Lauren Kelly: Text me or call me like I had a few friends so me like you're really responsive now like before I text you or call you and you and get back to me for days or whatever and like

275
00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:47.880
Lauren Kelly: Now I hear right back from you and things, and I hadn't even noticed I was doing that, but that's just like me, respecting the people in my life more

276
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:53.400
Lauren Kelly: You know, and so people in my life for noticing these changes in me and meeting them more dependable person and

277
00:34:53.610 --> 00:35:04.170
Lauren Kelly: That's who I've always wanted to be. I wanted to be that friend, you can count on. Like if you need a ride to the airport, I will show up and I'll be there on time, you know, and, and for the longest time I wasn't that person, you know, I was the least dependable friend.

278
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:13.980
Lauren Kelly: He's reliable person and it's just, it's really cool seeing it even the people that are close to me and seeing like them. Notice

279
00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.130
Lauren Kelly: Here that that's one of my favorite things to seeing that like

280
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:25.560
Lauren Kelly: It's not just me see it. The people that I really love in that matter the most of your secret to and that that's that's almost like the biggest passion five of them all, you know, more than like getting

281
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:33.240
Lauren Kelly: Fixed or like any of these little things I've done just seeing that, like, people can actually see I'm changing and that it's it's worth

282
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:39.780
Lauren Kelly: You know, and it just makes me think, like, there's nothing I would give this up, or is it just feels so good to me like

283
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:50.310
Lauren Kelly: I can't imagine anything making me want to go back to that she plays like why why would I want that life again. There's nothing about the life I want. There's nothing that's appealing to me about that.

284
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.500
Lauren Kelly: I truly feel better.

285
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.810
Lauren Kelly: Even physically now every day. Then when I was getting high. I thought like, Oh my gosh, I'm going to risk getting a high, you know, like

286
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:08.640
Lauren Kelly: I actually feel better now than any pill ever made me feel. And I don't know why I can see that back then that this actually feels physically better I sleep better, I'm not throwing up all the time.

287
00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:19.470
Lauren Kelly: You know, I want to work out. I do things that are productive all day. And so just like being on my ass in high, you know I it's it's so much more of a fulfilling life and I can't believe I

288
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:28.230
Lauren Kelly: Just didn't have a grasp of that for so many years, you know, I just, I guess my head was just in the cloud or something because I just didn't know

289
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:39.600
Lauren Kelly: How much was to offer me on the other side, you know, or sure was in seeing that now and I'm only a few months in a couple months in, like, I feel like that's just going to be more and more significant. The further I go and

290
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.350
Lauren Kelly: The more I see

291
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:47.550
Lauren Kelly: You know my hard work paid off because I know I'm just going to keep blazing forward on this path like nothing's been a different year stop me.

292
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:55.890
Lauren Kelly: I've been through a lot of hardship in these couple months. And I've still move forward. And I feel like now with things with like pollinate back on track.

293
00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:05.310
Lauren Kelly: It just gives me like even more just drive like that just fire under my ass like I just want to go even faster, you know, like I'm not like I want to like speed through things, but I just want to

294
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.080
Lauren Kelly: I want to accomplish so much and I just, I honestly like didn't care before about those fantasies.

295
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.910
Lauren Kelly: I care so much more about just being the best version of myself in anything I do

296
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:20.580
Lauren Kelly: To do that, you know, like at the end of every one of our calls. I always ask you, like, what more can I be doing what more can I be doing. It's like

297
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:29.790
Lauren Kelly: There's nothing I if you said, I think you should get this look. I think you need to go. There's, like, I'll do it. You know, like there's nothing. I'm not willing to do to strengthen my recovery to

298
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:36.270
Lauren Kelly: Make sure I'm successful with it to just move forward in every way and

299
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:46.740
Lauren Kelly: You know, I'm just like surrendering into it like I need this, you know, I need this program I need this help. I can't do it on my own. I need group I need therapy. I need all these things and like

300
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:52.260
Lauren Kelly: I think it was Kara. She had asked. I think it was a couple weeks ago about how she she said she wanted to maybe do group.

301
00:37:52.590 --> 00:38:01.620
Lauren Kelly: Like every other week or once a month or something. And Dr. Announcer said something that I had never thought I'd been he said one of the reasons why the Suboxone treatment is so I'm

302
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:08.010
Lauren Kelly: So successful is because of the accountability factor, you know, if we just gave you your Suboxone for a month and said okay, we'll check in with you in a month.

303
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:14.100
Lauren Kelly: It wouldn't be a successful, but it's because you know you have group every week that you need to check into it's because you have these drug test me

304
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:27.420
Lauren Kelly: Because you have therapy that keeps you on track and I realized, he's totally right. Like if I had the option to do therapy, a little bit less or group little less, I would say, No, I'm not ready for that, like, I need this you know and and and again

305
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:35.670
Lauren Kelly: When I first came in. I'm like, I don't know if I need meetings and I don't know if I need therapy and stuff like that. I'm like, Oh, no, no, no, I need the high you know and and I don't

306
00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:40.710
Lauren Kelly: I wouldn't want to tone it down or stepping back at all like, I realize I think he's totally right. It's

307
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.720
Lauren Kelly: The fact that I'm checking in multiple times a week and I have this accountability. It's really helped me

308
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:55.830
Lauren Kelly: Stay, you know, on the right path. So I wouldn't want to come down like my treatment or take a step back in any way. You know, I know that I need this. Yeah, it just seems like I'm really

309
00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:03.450
Lauren Kelly: Like humble and surrendering to, like, I need this. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. And I'm not going to do anything to divert

310
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Have you heard anything from your friend Nico.

311
00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.280
Lauren Kelly: Yes. So we did have a conversation. Finally, about

312
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:21.750
Lauren Kelly: The whole him wanting to be my boyfriend and all this kind of stuff. So I'm

313
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:30.870
Lauren Kelly: Basically, so I had text him to tell him that I got my registration in my license back which were huge things that had been promised from me for years.

314
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:38.010
Lauren Kelly: Of, you know, I would get pulled over and stuff and and he knew all about this. So I thought, out of all people. He would be really happy like oh my gosh, that's great.

315
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.310
Lauren Kelly: So I so I texted me and said, Hey, how are you doing, just wanted to check it on UCL work was today or whatever, you know, just being a friend just let him.

316
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.570
Lauren Kelly: Know here, whatever.

317
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.320
Lauren Kelly: And, um, and he said, Oh, I'm fine or something and

318
00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:57.600
Lauren Kelly: And I said, again, I just want to let you know actually was at the DMV for several hours yesterday. I got my license and my registration bad titles and my name like I'm moving forward.

319
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:07.200
Lauren Kelly: And he literally said nothing to that. And then he he just wrote, you know, I've been thinking really deeply for the last like week and all I can think of is this one question what MIT.

320
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:15.780
Lauren Kelly: Which is the same question he asked me, you know, before and and I said well you know I already answered that. A couple weeks ago.

321
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:24.780
Lauren Kelly: Did you ask me that, because you wanted to answer to change or did you ask me that, because you don't remember the answer you know and and he didn't get back to me for a long time. And I'm like,

322
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:35.400
Lauren Kelly: This is why it's hard for me to have conversations with unico because the second I asked you a question. You just like disappear. You know, he wants to like have asked me the hard questions, but he can't deal with the dialogue, you know, and

323
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:41.310
Lauren Kelly: They said, you know, it'd be one thing if I just said, oh, you know, when he had asked me that question. The first time we got together.

324
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:44.730
Lauren Kelly: And when I admitted to him. You know what was going on.

325
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:54.210
Lauren Kelly: And if I just said, Oh, your friend to me, but I had, I think I gave him like a 1520 minute explanation of how you know most of the my old friends and everyone I wanted to leave in the past that he was someone I cared.

326
00:40:54.420 --> 00:41:03.450
Lauren Kelly: About enough that I really wanted to make a living amends. When I wanted to bring into my clean future and to show to be that reliable dependable awesome friend that you can count on.

327
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:11.670
Lauren Kelly: That he had been to me that I had not been to him in the past and and i really explained that in that. So when he asked me again, you know, this is all even think about is, what am I to it's like

328
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:18.420
Lauren Kelly: You know answer that. But, um, you know, if you're thinking, if you keep asking the question you're going to get a different answer. That's

329
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:24.630
Lauren Kelly: Not what's going to happen here you know and and so it was weird. Again, like he kept focusing on when I was using. And he said,

330
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.040
Lauren Kelly: Well, who, you know,

331
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:33.600
Lauren Kelly: Used to like say I love you. When we get off the phone. And I'm like, I literally do that with every like I do that with my girlfriends like friends, people I care about before I get off the phone because

332
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:38.370
Lauren Kelly: I've lost a lot of friends and my car accidents and things that I just have that belief. You never know when someone's going to

333
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.480
Lauren Kelly: You know, to your last conversation. So, and I care about. So, and that's something I do and

334
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:51.420
Lauren Kelly: And I said, You know, I do that with girlfriends. I do that with family. I do that with a lot of people and you know it never was like I'm in love with us, like, Okay. Love You by, you know, kind of thing and

335
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.900
Lauren Kelly: And then he'd bring the pool. You know, there was times like, you know, I

336
00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:05.160
Lauren Kelly: thought that there would be something you know like back in August of last year, I told you I wanted to be with you and you didn't really, um, you know, you said that you couldn't be with me, but you didn't say like

337
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:13.350
Lauren Kelly: Forever. And so I was led to believe that there was a chance. And I said, Nico. I was using very heavily in fact, then you know I you know I said, to be honest, like

338
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.460
Lauren Kelly: I was a manipulative person. So if in any way I made you feel

339
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:24.960
Lauren Kelly: Like there was a chance. I know I was always clear with you that there wasn't. But if you're saying an action or, you know, I know my words. I told you that wouldn't happen. But if you're saying

340
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:39.030
Lauren Kelly: There was maybe because I hung out with you or whatever it was that made you feel that way. And, you know, I'm sorry that you feel that way. But, you know, that was my drug out of your and and and i'm not saying let's forget about it. And let's not talk about it but you know I

341
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:44.430
Lauren Kelly: That's not who I was and that wasn't how I felt like I'm telling you right now. I'm being clear with you.

342
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:54.960
Lauren Kelly: There is no romantic component to our relationship and there will be, it's not just like oh I need more clean time under my belt and then we can date, like, No, no, it's, it's not happening, you know, and

343
00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:05.790
Lauren Kelly: And and he just kept going back to will will use it like when you were, you know, back in August or November, and I'm like, again, Nico. I was using that. And it got to the point in the conversation where I said,

344
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:15.840
Lauren Kelly: It seems to me that you like to be better when I was in needy drug addict like that. That's really the feeling I'm getting here because now that I'm strong. And I said, People, when's the last time I asked you for me $1

345
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:24.960
Lauren Kelly: Like anything. And he was like, seven, eight months ago, you know, and I'm like, isn't this better. You know that I'm not this meeting URL calling you asking you for money all the time and

346
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:29.700
Lauren Kelly: make any promises. I'm not fulfilling like isn't this better and and here I'm getting my license back and I'm

347
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:35.790
Lauren Kelly: You know, and I said, that's one thing that shows me you're not interested in being a friend of me because I told you I made this huge you know

348
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:44.850
Lauren Kelly: Great step in life and you didn't even have anything. It wasn't like, Oh, that's great. And then we move on. Next to you literally didn't even comment on it meant nothing to you and it's all just about you and what you want for me.

349
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:53.700
Lauren Kelly: And why you're not getting it. And, and all you can bring up as well. When you were a drug addict that you you made, and he kept saying, you made me fall in love with you, you made, I, I felt, and I'm like,

350
00:43:54.420 --> 00:44:04.980
Lauren Kelly: I'm sorry that you fill in those me but like I told you 100 times even when I was using like that. That was not what our relationship was. And that's not what it was ever going to be. I'm sorry that you decided

351
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:09.450
Lauren Kelly: That, oh, she's wrong should want to be with me one day, so it's safe for me to fall in love with it but like

352
00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.100
Lauren Kelly: I was very clear with you and it's like he's mad at me for his own field.

353
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:22.110
Lauren Kelly: You know what I mean. And like, I'm sorry. And, and it was upsetting to me because it's like it's again it's like he he is more comfortable when I need it.

354
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:31.290
Lauren Kelly: You know what I mean. And now that I'm in this position where you know I don't need money for drugs are like really the only money I need is for like say gas and food and like

355
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:34.530
Lauren Kelly: Because I'm not working right now Paul helps me with that. You know what I mean. So

356
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:47.730
Lauren Kelly: I don't have to revert back to, you know, doing drug dealers or like doing the things I used to do for money or having to, you know, hit up friends for money and make promises. Oh, I can pay you back from this day when I know I can't or whatever.

357
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:55.410
Lauren Kelly: And I would think of friends is so much in my other friends who, you know, like the friend I'm seeing with now. I used to, you know, borrow money from him and stuff.

358
00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:08.400
Lauren Kelly: And he's just super supportive of me being clean and sober. He loves this new Lauren because he just wants to be my friend. So there's no like weirdness there because the only one who's like, Well, what about back when you're using a book like it's like he wants me to be that girl again.

359
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:21.150
Lauren Kelly: Or not, that's weird to me. I'm like, if you cared about me as a person and as a friend at all. You would be so you know but instead it's like you want the needy Lauren back because I feel like he had more control of the girl who needed something, you know,

360
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:32.850
Lauren Kelly: And now that I don't need literally anything from him, and I've asked nothing. Nothing. All I've done is offered him film. I want to be a friend to I want to offer these I'm not even asking for his forgiveness. I'm just offering him.

361
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:38.850
Lauren Kelly: Explanations and truth and honesty and all the things that he like doesn't want it, you know, and

362
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:51.420
Lauren Kelly: So the end of the conversation ended with him just being mad at me and and and the last thing I said was, I'm sorry I couldn't be your girlfriend, but I can be a really kick ass friend if you'll let you know and and he ended up writing me back.

363
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:58.290
Lauren Kelly: Like a couple hours later, and I was already asleep. By that time, and it said something like, I'm like, I can't be

364
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:03.330
Lauren Kelly: Your girlfriend or I or he said, even if you can't be my girlfriend.

365
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:14.610
Lauren Kelly: I want you to be. I HOPE YOU ARE YOU SAID, EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T. I CAN'T BE WITH YOU. You are like the one person I can confide in and talk to more than anyone. So I hope

366
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:19.530
Lauren Kelly: That like I can deal with separating those so that he said, I don't know if I'll ever not

367
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:24.330
Lauren Kelly: You know, be in love with her have those feelings towards you, but I hope I can separate them. And that's kind of how it ended.

368
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:37.110
Lauren Kelly: And so that was like maybe Thursday or something that last week and I was a little irritated by like by the end of that conversation where I'm just being honest and truthful for like the fourth conversation with him and he's a agree with me for being honest and truthful and

369
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:45.600
Lauren Kelly: Like basically can't celebrate any of my successes in my recovery or in my life only wants to know why I can't give him what he wants, you know,

370
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.640
Lauren Kelly: Even though I've explained it into multiple times.

371
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:59.100
Lauren Kelly: I was a little irritated. So I when I saw those Texas. I was kind of happy in the morning when I saw them that, like, okay, maybe he he's kind of coming around. But I so I didn't check back for a few days.

372
00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:06.120
Lauren Kelly: Because I was still kind of just irritated at how that conversation went yesterday, I was like, you know what I mean to text Eco, you know, and I wrote him and said, hey,

373
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:16.320
Lauren Kelly: Just wanted to check in with you. I know our last conversation was really heavy. But, you know, if you are willing to move forward with our friendship. I would love to do that. And, you know, just one. See if you want to hang out anytime soon.

374
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.130
Lauren Kelly: And he texted me back with it depends on what you had in mind.

375
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:29.790
Lauren Kelly: And like, pull it out, we're together when this happened and Paul's like that's a weird answer like anything friends do. Let's get coffee. Let's get lunch. Like, what do you mean it depends on what I have in mind like

376
00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:39.630
Lauren Kelly: I don't know. And I didn't even know how to answer that. So I actually hadn't even text back yet, but I was gonna say something like, you know, nothing specific but just thought we could catch up and grab a cup of coffee or something you know I

377
00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:47.400
Lauren Kelly: Was I don't know. So again, it's like these email answers of like like super emotional answers from who's like, put the pedal was a good at, like,

378
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:53.550
Lauren Kelly: Again, that's not how my other friends talk to me. You know what I mean, it's just, it's just there's there's just always this

379
00:47:54.390 --> 00:48:02.280
Lauren Kelly: Lingering tension in the air. Anytime I spend time with him of that he wants something for me that I'm not giving him, and it's really awkward and I don't like it, and

380
00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.700
Lauren Kelly: I want that to be removed, you know, and it's like

381
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:13.890
Lauren Kelly: And I said that in depth. It was the first time if I was like, look, it's basically like I don't mean to sound mean but it's it's not going to happen. And it's not just not gonna happen today it's it's

382
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:24.810
Lauren Kelly: I do not feel that way towards you. It's not something that's on the horizon. You have to accept that like friendship is all that I have to offer you like I kept saying that that that's all that I have to offer you.

383
00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:33.540
Lauren Kelly: And and so it's like it'll be interesting. I definitely think I'll need to hang out with them to see if he can be a full friend and hang out and talk like friends or if there's going to be just that.

384
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:46.680
Lauren Kelly: That tension there of like it's almost like a an awkward like sexual attention. We're like he just looks at me in this way of like I want something you're not giving me and that's uncomfortable as hell for me and like I guess when I was using

385
00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:53.790
Lauren Kelly: Either didn't notice my discomfort or I didn't care as much because I needed money or I needed, whatever. So I'd hang out with them, even if it was a little

386
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.900
Lauren Kelly: Tense and awkward, but at least I got my couple hundred bucks typically use that day.

387
00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:10.650
Lauren Kelly: Whenever I'm now. I don't want to be in those uncomfortable situations and I don't want friendships that are one sided where all you want. You just want what you want from me. And when I tell you something great. I did. You can't even acknowledge it. You know what I mean, because I'm not

388
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.990
Lauren Kelly: gonna lie, you know, and, and I've cut off, I had two girlfriends that I thought were really good friends that

389
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:21.720
Lauren Kelly: You know, we used to get your clothes and stuff together that I've ended up cutting both those friends up because I realized that now that I'm clean

390
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:28.140
Lauren Kelly: Those friendships are so one sided like those girls only want from me, you know, and I mean like they don't they have nothing to offer them.

391
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:39.390
Lauren Kelly: To try to be friends to them and they're always the victim and they are asking me for money and they want this. They want that. And I realized like, again, these are friendships. I don't need and I'm okay with having like one or two good friends.

392
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:47.100
Lauren Kelly: Instead of 10 shitty ones that are all using me for something so so like I'm willing to, like, drop the friendship and equal if I have to.

393
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:54.630
Lauren Kelly: But it'll be interesting. I feel like maybe in the next few days to a week I'm going to try hanging out with them again and see if he's capable of that but

394
00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:04.530
Lauren Kelly: I mean I think within this month here like I'll know if they're either is a friendship with him that can work or not, but I'm no longer willing to have one if that freezes.

395
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.280
Lauren Kelly: romantic tension, whatever is still there. Like, I don't want to be

396
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:16.770
Lauren Kelly: Uncomfortable. I don't want someone to push their wants on me and and to basically want me to be in a needy position again and instead of celebrating

397
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:27.000
Lauren Kelly: Me not needing anything and become you, the person I was always supposed to be. And if you can't even see that. Are you happy for that. Then you aren't the right kind of person for my life, you know,

398
00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:33.330
Lauren Kelly: So, um, so, I mean, it'll be interesting to see, I think, nothing's going to really tell me that other than hanging out with them, you know,

399
00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:42.540
Lauren Kelly: But it'll be interesting to see where that goes. So, so, yeah, I was, I kind of thought we had before. But then that text yesterday was really depends on what you had in mind, or what I was like

400
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:51.570
Lauren Kelly: I don't know what you want me to say but it, you know, I don't know. So I don't know what what do you think about that, like how she is there anything I should do to handle that, or just try out

401
00:50:52.920 --> 00:51:00.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I would definitely try one time. But yeah, it sounds like that you may have to let that relationship. Go.

402
00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I'll tell you why.

403
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:03.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because there.

404
00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:18.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There are people out there that really pride themselves on vulnerable people and you know you cannot tell me that there's not a piece of him that knew that there was something that was going on.

405
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:29.340
Lauren Kelly: Oh, totally. Yeah, he admitted that to me later that like things didn't match up and you know he definitely had questions and stuff. And now, a lot of this is all coming together, you know. So, for sure. He definitely knew for sure.

406
00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.100
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean. And when

407
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:37.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're in that situation, it's almost a predatory ol thing.

408
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:47.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, where, you know, maybe he doesn't feel confident enough in himself to be able to get a girlfriend and this is his way of helping somebody and expecting something in return.

409
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when it doesn't get

410
00:51:52.020 --> 00:52:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, when he doesn't get what he wants, he can't understand why. So, you know, there's a piece of it that that really kind of brings that up for me that wonder if that's not what you know where this was, yeah. And he also reminds me of a school age. Boy, that won't take no for an answer.

411
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:11.610
Lauren Kelly: Totally

412
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:24.210
Lauren Kelly: He's like arguing with me. And I'm like, you don't argue someone into wanting to be with you, like, that's not how it works. It's a feeling based thing and if the feeling, isn't there. You're not gonna like with like your logic talked me into okay I

413
00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:24.660
Lauren Kelly: Guess I'm

414
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:30.450
Lauren Kelly: Love with You. Now, like that's not and then on top of it, like he knows about Paul, he knows that I was like the love of my life so

415
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:37.500
Lauren Kelly: Even if like Finnegan even if Paul was in in the picture. I wouldn't want anything to do with Nico. But Paul is very much in the picture. So like, at least at the very least.

416
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:45.000
Lauren Kelly: Respect for my relationship and and the thing I've been working towards. And the thing that matters so much that he doesn't respect that, you know, I think, in his mind.

417
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:49.770
Lauren Kelly: I don't know if he thinks he's done more from you than Paul or I owe him more than I. Oh, Paul, or what but

418
00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:56.550
Lauren Kelly: In some way he thinks he's like the significant man in my life when I've done nothing to make him feel that way and and he feels like

419
00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:07.230
Lauren Kelly: It, you know, like any other friend if it's like say you were saying, when you say, hey, I can't hang out today since something came up Nico's, the only one that's like well what came up. Tell me what in like he just thinks it's a man's level of like

420
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:13.500
Lauren Kelly: Accountability out of me that like not even Paul this. You know what I mean, like, it's almost like a fatherly or a boyfriend like

421
00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:24.300
Lauren Kelly: Like submit and it's uncomfortable and weird to me and it's like why why can't you just treat me like a normal friend I have other guy friends and they don't treat me this way, you know, and it's just I i'm not

422
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:32.700
Lauren Kelly: dumb enough to think this is a normal friendship. There's, there's something weird there. And it's that you want more than I'm willing to give you. And I don't know if you can like let go of

423
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:44.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, you'll know you'll figure it out. Within the next time you hang out with them. But if if that tension still there and it's not easy and he's not coming around. Then I would distance myself from him because he's unhealthy.

424
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.050
Lauren Kelly: Yeah yeah

425
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:58.530
Lauren Kelly: You know, I'd rather have one or two good people in my life than like these unhealthy relationships that are making me feel bad for being clean and for accomplishing things, you know, you can't be supportive of that, then I don't have the room for you.

426
00:53:59.070 --> 00:53:59.340
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right.

427
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's almost like an hour. It's like a power and control thing.

428
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, he, he needs you to need him.

429
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:12.960
Lauren Kelly: Yes, yes, that is 100% what I'm getting out. But then I feel a little guilty because I think, you know, Nico did do a lot for me. There's times like

430
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:20.670
Lauren Kelly: You know, say my car broke down that he would help you know drive or like there's, you know, times I actually didn't need groceries. He helped me get food, you know, help me buy dog food. There's

431
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:28.440
Lauren Kelly: There were times that like I needed a friend and he was there for me so I feel kind of bad, like, okay, now that you're not being exactly what I want. I'm willing to drop you. But

432
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:38.040
Lauren Kelly: At the same time, again, recovery has to be the most important thing to me. And if you have the mindset that you want me unwell and needy, I cannot have you be a part of my

433
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:50.970
Lauren Kelly: Life, you know, and so I I do feel like I owe him friendship and and that, but I don't feel like it. I have to do it on his terms which is there's always going to be a romantic

434
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:52.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You don't know him anything

435
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.120
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You do not

436
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: owe him anything

437
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:59.100
Lauren Kelly: That he was such a good friend of me for so long. When I was a shitty person like

438
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:08.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You're giving him every opportunity to step up to the plate and be a friend with boundaries and he at this point hasn't been willing to accept that.

439
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:12.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Sure, right, which is totally unhealthy, which is a predator.

440
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:20.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Predator that preys on vulnerable people praise on vulnerable women he needs people to need him.

441
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.430
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.

442
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:24.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's that's so

443
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:34.170
Lauren Kelly: The way the conversation. That's the vibe I get and and again this is now like our fourth or fifth conversation. This isn't the person were at that may be useless or soft by the information he didn't know how to process it.

444
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:40.860
Lauren Kelly: Were like a month into this now, and every conversation. Again, the more honest and open. I am within the angry or he gets instead of like

445
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:49.920
Lauren Kelly: Understand, that's not I've had these conversations with several friends and that's not the way any of them have gone. They've everybody else has been happy I'm being honest with them says, Oh, wow. Now, a lot make sense.

446
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:53.850
Lauren Kelly: Well, I'm really proud and now they'll tell me all the great things they see me that are so different.

447
00:55:54.210 --> 00:56:05.310
Lauren Kelly: He hasn't highlighted anything different, you know, even though I've way more so on. So with them and doing all like things to show him. I'm a better friend he he's never once said, Why aren't I really noticed you know you getting back to me, or I've noticed you

448
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.180
Lauren Kelly: Reaching out to me to hang on, sort of, it always being on my end or would like

449
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:19.890
Lauren Kelly: Nothing that I've done, he has. He said, Wow, that's great. Lauren, it's all been. Why isn't it like this, the way it was before. I'm like, because I was looking drug addict before, and I'm not anymore. This is

450
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:29.880
Lauren Kelly: This is a way better, more and, like, how do you not see that I haven't asked you for anything and eight months. How is that not a better person to be in your life and the one who needed something every day, you know,

451
00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:31.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Cuz he's a little sick to

452
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:32.730
Yeah.

453
00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:37.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's what you gotta you know remember and hang out with a one time.

454
00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And see, but I have a feeling that you're going to have to distance yourself and focused on the positive in your life. And eventually, he'll either come around, or you won't he'll find somebody else that it

455
00:56:52.920 --> 00:57:01.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Will need him. Yeah, but there are with them. Yeah. And that's exactly it. So what are you going to work on this week.

456
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:14.100
Lauren Kelly: Do the I'm really excited about the smart recovery, meaning I want to do the women's meeting to try to connect with more women, you know, just see even have people to just type some testing with, you know, just more to create a better

457
00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:26.400
Lauren Kelly: Community of recovery and I'm way more comfortable doing that with women I've just found that I just did. I just, you know, again, you said it earlier recovery such like a vulnerable place to be, that

458
00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:32.250
Lauren Kelly: If I just don't want to be like vulnerable like that with other guys. You know what I mean like I just feel way more comfortable doing that with

459
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:39.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, going on with them. Anyways, yeah. So my focus is definitely on the women's meetings.

460
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:40.110
And

461
00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:48.540
Lauren Kelly: Yet just and then the workbook. That's the other thing that's just, I've been working in every day and I'm just loving it just going through like each question and just

462
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:59.820
Lauren Kelly: I mean sometimes one question I can work on for like an hour, you know, and some of them you can answer pretty quickly, but others like one question was, like, how have you heard people in your addiction and I'm like, How much time do you have, I can write a novel here, you know,

463
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:09.090
Lauren Kelly: So it's, it's just I since I've been recovering. I haven't found anything more thought provoking or anything that gets more to like the core issues than that so

464
00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:18.150
Lauren Kelly: I'm just really getting in depth in that and the women's means, I think, are my two main things like personally like in my personal life outside of recovery. I want to

465
00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:26.400
Lauren Kelly: I want to work more I've been exercising a lot like every day and and making it more and more intense every day and it's been really like working for me. It makes me

466
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:31.800
Lauren Kelly: More tired at the end of the day, I feel better about myself. Its natural dopa me and you know what I mean. So

467
00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:39.990
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, that's, yeah, I would do. And then also you know now that I'm thinking of moving back with Paul and I have, I think I told you I finally paid off my storage that I hadn't really

468
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:47.370
Lauren Kelly: So I it's, it's just, you know, a mess of stuff. So I needed to start going through things and like organizing stuff and bringing it falls and all that so

469
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:57.270
Lauren Kelly: In my personal life exercising and getting organized but in my recovery like getting a bigger community of women and checking out that smart recovery and really diving into that.

470
00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:05.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay. Okay, good. Those are good. Definitely good things active steps to take. So

471
00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:12.570
Lauren Kelly: Is there anything that you that you can think of that I'm not doing or that I do Julian or that you're like hey, it'd be great if you did this story.

472
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:15.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Find a sponsor to help you go through that work. Yeah.

473
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:17.490
Lauren Kelly: Yeah, okay.

474
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.800
Lauren Kelly: Female I will come out.

475
00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.780
Lauren Kelly: Hopefully these women meetings to kind of

476
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:29.310
Lauren Kelly: move that forward that should bigger pool of women than it is when I was only going to meetings, there's like three women and 15

477
00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:36.360
Lauren Kelly: You know so and then two of the three women are like, you know, mathematics that are still using and like one

478
00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:45.270
Lauren Kelly: Is I you know I might kind of relate to her. So, you know, so it's I haven't really found that person. I totally related to, but the pickings are slim at regular meetings, I think.

479
00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:51.720
Lauren Kelly: Diving into these women meetings will give me they'll pull it into Dropbox to find somebody I connect with and contrast

480
00:59:52.080 --> 01:00:02.310
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yes, and it will you probably won't find that you know this person one time or two times, but just keep going back, go to different meetings. Definitely and keep your eyes and ears open

481
01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:04.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Absolutely. OK.

482
01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:05.310
Lauren Kelly: I will do that.

483
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.210
Lauren Kelly: Anything I

484
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.850
Lauren Kelly: Do because I wanted to anything I can do so.

485
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:18.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Know you're doing it, you're doing everything that you should be doing. So just keep on the same path, keep doing what you're doing. I mean, you're doing so many in

486
01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:29.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So many different so much work in so many different areas right now that you just kind of want to hone in where you're at. Yeah but stepping outside your box start evaluating about finding a sponsor.

487
01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.900
Lauren Kelly: But outside of that you think I'm doing. You think I'm doing okay and

488
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:39.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Exceptionally. What do you mean, I think you're doing awesome. You know what I mean.

489
01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:50.640
Lauren Kelly: I just want to make sure that you know I value your opinion, a lot so means a lot. You know, it was hearing that from you means a lot that I like that. I mean, I just

490
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:52.050

Quentono W.E. Neal: So far, is kind of take me a while.

525
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like how long

526
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.820
Quentono W.E. Neal: About a month now it's gonna burn up a whole month now.

527
01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:23.070
Quentono W.E. Neal: That and that's

528
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:28.410
Quentono W.E. Neal: That's, that's what I'm not constant on it, though, is not when I'm not persistent on it.

529
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:33.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And when you're persistent on it. How long does it take you

530
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:38.760
Quentono W.E. Neal: Away from persistent on it should only take me like three or four days.

531
01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:40.440
To do that.

532
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:42.840
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, but when I'm

533
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:50.130
Quentono W.E. Neal: When I'm not really like in the mood and kind of feeling like like slow or like sludgy you know I

534
01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.710
Quentono W.E. Neal: I kind of just like. Give it a break.

535
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.060
Quentono W.E. Neal: Plus my my hands tues my hand, my hand.

536
01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:01.890
Quentono W.E. Neal: I don't know what I have yet. And then I don't know what I've been diagnosed it

537
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.130
Quentono W.E. Neal: But I got a

538
01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:11.490
Quentono W.E. Neal: tingling feeling not feeling it. And it's like painful in the morning times

539
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I probably got to go get it checked out.

540
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:17.280
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah.

541
01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:18.600
Quentono W.E. Neal: And

542
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:22.800
Quentono W.E. Neal: I was I was trying to

543
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:29.850
Quentono W.E. Neal: See if they can give me something for it, or at least helped me with, you know, and they're just

544
01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:38.490
Quentono W.E. Neal: It just said put ice on it and make sure it's elevated and they couldn't give you no more help on

545
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:41.040
Quentono W.E. Neal: What can I do to

546
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:54.840
Quentono W.E. Neal: get it fixed. So I'm just, you know, I'm just, I got this. This little squishy toy or whatever that kind of like strengthen it and stuff. And it's mainly in my hands and

547
01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:06.300
Quentono W.E. Neal: It used to get like that back in the day when I used to draw up and not use it a lot. So that's the, that's how scary now.

548
01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like writers cramp or something.

549
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:16.230
Quentono W.E. Neal: Oh, kind of, kind of like that. But I think more I'm kind of leaning a little bit more towards

550
01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.410
Quentono W.E. Neal: The riotous or like carpal tunnel.

551
01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.900

Quentono W.E. Neal: Well, first I went down there.

563
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:16.650
Quentono W.E. Neal: I talked to somebody and they said they appointed me somewhere else where they can help me. And so I went back there.

564
01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:32.970
Quentono W.E. Neal: And they told me that the person that was was was going to help me. Yes, he's not going to be back for two weeks because I guess he goes to A. He's like a medicine man. I guess he goes out of town to come to different states and he

565
01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:38.070
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like, does the religious ceremonies in one Alex where and all that stuff like sweat lodge and shit like that.

566
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.230
Quentono W.E. Neal: So that's what he was doing.

567
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:48.240
Quentono W.E. Neal: Well, I was trying to see if I get a medicine bag and they said that she's oh I got off the phone with him.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.840
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, well,

572
01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:10.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yes. Maybe. Probably. Probably not.

573
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:12.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why

574
01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.520
Quentono W.E. Neal: I'm, um,

575
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.790
Quentono W.E. Neal: I don't know.

576
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.520
Quentono W.E. Neal: I'm just thinking about not going to sweat.

577
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:30.150
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why

578
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.840
Quentono W.E. Neal: Don't know it's because I don't want to

579
01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:36.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Why don't you want to

580
01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:37.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't

581
01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:38.490
Quentono W.E. Neal: Want to

582
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.120
Quentono W.E. Neal: I don't know, I just, I just don't feel like it like

583
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:51.960
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like I was I was all I was all into it and stuff like that. And until I went down and kind of sculpt everything out.

584
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:59.190
Quentono W.E. Neal: I just don't think that it would be the right, the right place for me at the right time right now you go

585
01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What makes you come to that conclusion.

586
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:09.450
Quentono W.E. Neal: I don't know. Just, just having a feeling that I don't want to hang it. I don't want to go down here.

587
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what alternatives. Do you have

588
01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.120
Quentono W.E. Neal: Well, alternative

589
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:20.370
Quentono W.E. Neal: Um,

590
01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: Well,

591
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:29.460
Quentono W.E. Neal: I don't want to turn I went chairs. Two weeks ago, I was supposed to go this week.

592
01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:31.380
Quentono W.E. Neal: Church this week.

593
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:33.300
Quentono W.E. Neal: I've been

594
01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:41.520
Quentono W.E. Neal: Busy i've been i've actually busy helping out a friend to them happen on my lady.

595
01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:56.820
Quentono W.E. Neal: She's going through like Sundance to any bands and stuff like that. So I'm really kind of like helping her like get stuff together and whatnot. So I can't be going down to the down there and

596
01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.490
Quentono W.E. Neal: Okay, big time for that.

597
01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So tell me what you can make time for

598
01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.690
Quentono W.E. Neal: Dude, the thing that I can make time for is

599
01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:13.290
Quentono W.E. Neal: Me helping out my girl like

600
01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:15.390
And

601
01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:22.050
Quentono W.E. Neal: My sobriety.

602
01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.230
Quentono W.E. Neal: This is basically the meeting a focus on

603
01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:33.570
Quentono W.E. Neal: Just it just, I don't, I don't want to relapse us it and then I know I'm not going to relapse. But there's, there comes a time where you never know, you know,

604
01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:39.060
Quentono W.E. Neal: I already know. Like, like I'm relying on my past instincts like

605
01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:46.140
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like oh yeah i know i know i'm not gonna relax because I'm clean you know I may say that now, but

606
01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:55.470
Quentono W.E. Neal: Now, what if what if someone just says, Hey, what's up, what's up gene is my home use Mahoney, and I knew him and the pink or whatever. And I knew I

607
01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:04.080
Quentono W.E. Neal: Was able to up man. How you doing, oh shit no time no see. And all of a sudden, you know, boom. You know, so that's kind of why

608
01:10:05.490 --> 01:10:07.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: You say what you have time for.

609
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:11.400
Quentono W.E. Neal: My sobriety. I, oh, oh.

610
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And what we're

611
01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:16.020
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like, well, in what way like

612
01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:21.720
Quentono W.E. Neal: Sober way doing the right way. You know, like, like for me.

613
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:24.090
Like

614
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:42.270
Quentono W.E. Neal: It'd be nice to get involved into something, but that's not something that I want to get involved in right now. I don't want to get involved into going to sweat lodge right now because that's not what I want to focus on right now, you know. And the reason why that is.

615
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:52.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: Is because I can only focus on one thing. I already tried it before I already tried to be multitask double and all that and

616
01:10:53.010 --> 01:11:02.970
Quentono W.E. Neal: You know, it's only good for a certain amount of time. And after a while, it just ends up, you know, you end up getting mixed up and down multitasking. So it's not good to be focused on that.

617
01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:06.000
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like my, my main thing is like

618
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:15.720
Quentono W.E. Neal: Is a just being sober right now and helping my spouse out and everything.

619
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: And

620
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.990
Quentono W.E. Neal: renaming my family.

621
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:25.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Doing what

622
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.450
Quentono W.E. Neal: reunite with my family.

623
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:31.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

624
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:33.660
Quentono W.E. Neal: Real quick.

625
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:39.240
Quentono W.E. Neal: Let me ask you a question like, like why why do you like is it like

626
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.140
Quentono W.E. Neal: It's just your job and you get paid.

627
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:45.270
Quentono W.E. Neal: So we can see here

628
01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:49.140
Quentono W.E. Neal: In this thing called individual therapy.

629
01:11:50.370 --> 01:12:02.580
Quentono W.E. Neal: About Nothing. You know, like, like, like for example, like what I see from us, like I really don't see like, I see that you kind of help me out. But it's just it just seems like

630
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:05.580
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like you're gonna like you want me to go

631
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.790
Quentono W.E. Neal: Go on these these

632
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:19.890
Quentono W.E. Neal: These missions to see if see if, like, you know, are these expert explorer things and like

633
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:26.130
Quentono W.E. Neal: That's not what I want to do, though, like what I what I'm doing right now.

634
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:31.020
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like I'm comfortable with it. Right now I'm comfortable where I'm at.

635
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:36.720
Quentono W.E. Neal: Because my eyes are open now that I'm sober.

636
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.750
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like my eyes are open to like

637
01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:55.590
Quentono W.E. Neal: This is not like go go run out and go get involved into things like my my my my my kind of thinking is like, okay, now you're sober just just slowly progress and slowly work back up. Don't just jump into things and everything, you know,

638
01:12:57.090 --> 01:13:02.670
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like I've been. I've been working out. I haven't working out. I pay that much. I'm exercising.

639
01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.730
Quentono W.E. Neal: And it's been about two weeks to have an issue says

640
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And why did you stop that.

641
01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:12.630
Quentono W.E. Neal: I'm

642
01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.590
Quentono W.E. Neal: Because

643
01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:18.390
Quentono W.E. Neal: I just

644
01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.110
Quentono W.E. Neal: stopped it.

645
01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:26.430
Quentono W.E. Neal: started, I started drawing

646
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.570
Quentono W.E. Neal: So I stopped exercising.

647
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:35.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: started drawing stopped exercising.

648
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:40.110
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, no, no, I'm drawing, like, I don't know, like

649
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.420
Quentono W.E. Neal: Now I'm drawing and now I'm into this like drawing more now.

650
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.550
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, there's nothing wrong with that because

651
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.660
Quentono W.E. Neal: That's good here.

652
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:56.400
Quentono W.E. Neal: Two years ago, two years ago. That's how to use it. That's how exactly how was to

653
01:13:58.230 --> 01:13:58.890
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like like

654
01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:14.790
Quentono W.E. Neal: That's crazy. Like, even with even with holding holding the job. I would only hold hold the job for like for summer season or for like eight or nine months and then I would quit and get a different job.

655
01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:26.790
Quentono W.E. Neal: Because I already knew that job. So I figure I wanted to do something now. And then I go to a different tub and I figured like when I started knowing

656
01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.970
Quentono W.E. Neal: That I start to know that that's not even right that's not even asked you to do know me.

657
01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:34.710
So,

658
01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, it's about finding what makes you happy.

659
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean, whatever that looks like.

660
01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:49.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And certainly people bounce around from job to job when they can't find one that they're happy content.

661
01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:52.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know it doing

662
01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:55.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's a piece of it.

663
01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:57.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you already

664
01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.070
Quentono W.E. Neal: Said that you wanted to

665
01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:02.370

668
01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.070
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like for example, like

Quentono W.E. Neal: Like this, why stop there society.

670
01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:18.750

673
01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:28.770
Quentono W.E. Neal: Work on your shoes. And then I started sewing.

674
01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:31.530
Quentono W.E. Neal: You know what I mean.

675
01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.060

Quentono W.E. Neal: Like

680
01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:51.150
Quentono W.E. Neal: I don't know what what you guys call that in your life in your world. Like what you learn from a book or whatever on that calm.

681
01:15:52.110 --> 01:16:10.980
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like addictive behaviors or whatever, what it's called but or what would you, what would you label me in in one of the profiles listed in the book that you studied for what class that you took on the job that you're holding. Now, you know, um, it would mean you'd be me like

684
01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:33.210
Quentono W.E. Neal: And instead of doing drugs do that instead of the drugs, but at the same time there's still there's still thought in my mind every day.

685
01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:40.950
Quentono W.E. Neal: I think I can hire or if I watch a commercial on the TV. I go, somebody drinking or or for wash to

686
01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:53.790
Quentono W.E. Neal: The National Geographic and the shooting. And I'll leave, I'll leave it on to that station all day and I'll just, I'll be uplifted by by the use of drugs by the by the drug use, that's being shown on the TV, you know,

687
01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:58.200
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like, it'll actually it'll actually trigger and it'll actually like

688
01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:07.530
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like fulfill those electric electrons or whatever those things that are in your head, you know that shock or whatever, you know,

689
01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Me like like

690
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:19.710
Quentono W.E. Neal: It'll feed. It'll feed. It'll feed it, and it's it's just shipped out like how that does that, you know, so I kind of, I kind of got interested, I kind of wanted to kind of know about that. So I

691
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:27.060
Quentono W.E. Neal: I went to this this website. I don't remember what the websites called but I started learning about the brain and how like

692
01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:36.270
Quentono W.E. Neal: There's this front frontal lobe. There's different parts of your brain and in the front brain is called the the Neil our neocortex.

693
01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:48.240
Quentono W.E. Neal: And for example, like I start to know about my drinking now I was. Oh, OK. OK. That's why when I drink so much and I blinked out. And then I woke up and you know

694
01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:59.430
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like I was in jail because me and my brother got into a fight you know shit like that you know your your front or neocortex gives out when you have intake you volume high volumes of alcohol and

695
01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:07.890
Quentono W.E. Neal: When it when it starts to fade out, it starts to give out so like basically like

696
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:16.950
Quentono W.E. Neal: You can't really you can't really be imperative thinking you know what I mean like you can't really rely, it gets really hard to make out. You know what I mean. So

697
01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:27.630
Quentono W.E. Neal: It's like a trip a trip out or like, though, though, like the reptilian gland that that little Glenn and the bat, and that's like that's like say for example, like

698
01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:46.050
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like if someone gets hit right here right away. Their, their brain goes down to this area, unless they all share. I bought a fight back, or I'm gonna die are like, Oh, shit. I better. I better get it to survival more and I've heard her start running. Are you know what I mean.

699
01:18:46.320 --> 01:19:03.240
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, and they call that the Chilean grand is kind of like the you know how like reptiles like like even the little ones like how are you ready contender, like, you know what I mean, that's kind of why they call it the reptilian Glenn like the size of the reptilian brain but

700
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:10.140
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, just just just chips out how that how that kind of like how they have different, like, you know what I mean.

701
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:21.360
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, like different things. I call a drug shut down, different, different parts of the brain and like different things, you know, that's kind of that's kind of interest to me though.

702
01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:26.070
Quentono W.E. Neal: Oh, no question on that on the internet. You're trying to learn

703
01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.890
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's cool, that's cool that you're

704
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:32.850
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Trying to learn all you can about the way your brain works.

705
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:44.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's important that you know those that you have that information. And I want to kind of back up a little bit and just kind of explain to you. First off, that

706
01:19:45.630 --> 01:20:06.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My background is more than just out of a book that I have my own story to tell and based off of my experience and other people that I have watched and there are certain things that we need to do to maintain recovery and it's get involved and get engaged in things

707
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:14.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That are outside ourselves to be able to stay connected within a community of other people that are staying sober.

708
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:29.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's why I keep you and I keep having the conversation about the sweat lodge. It's not so much that spiritual aspect of things, but the connectivity of other people that are trying to stay sober as well.

709
01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's that. And, and I believe that

710
01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:42.330
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Art in its purest form is one of the best therapeutic things that you could possibly do.

711
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:45.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But I also know that

712
01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:55.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Physical exercise helps with domains and really does the heart pump in and gets the mind alerts and so there's that that

713
01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: As well.

714
01:20:57.810 --> 01:21:03.930
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And being in recovery really is about finding balance within all things in your life right

715
01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:19.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's not just about one thing or another and putting all your eggs in one basket. But it's really about finding a balance with between work between recovery between family, you know, between dealing with the issues that

716
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Took you into using and kept you into using

717
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:32.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's it's healing from all of that stuff and based off of my experience before I ever opened a book to learn about

718
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About this profession and you have to have a passion for this profession because I can tell you that the pay for this.

719
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:48.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Profession is minimal versus the mental and emotional

720
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.110
Quentono W.E. Neal: Message already

721
01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:51.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: About that.

722
01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:56.640
Quentono W.E. Neal: Because I was looking on, I was looking at on

723
01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.490
Quentono W.E. Neal: People that do like

724
01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:01.560
Quentono W.E. Neal: For example,

725
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:15.630
Quentono W.E. Neal: They fix on those air conditioners on top of the building or whatever the electrical thing and they do like water heaters boilers that whatnot, with the metric whatever air conditioning and whatnot. Well,

726
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.770
Quentono W.E. Neal: I was looking at that last night and there there's

727
01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.410
Quentono W.E. Neal: A 4042 42 but it is something something something

728
01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.480
Quentono W.E. Neal: Was the outside down

729
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:29.100
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, I was as a damn and then

730
01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.140
Quentono W.E. Neal: And then I was kind of thinking like

731
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:32.970
Quentono W.E. Neal: And they are

732
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.800
Quentono W.E. Neal: They are

733
01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:43.260
Quentono W.E. Neal: What they do you go you to what you do their classes you their classes you sign up. You do you do their classes and they'll pay you for them.

734
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:56.250
Quentono W.E. Neal: And they'll pay you to start, start working and stuff. And they'll help you get a job one. I like that. So it's just a little like they had all kinds of all kinds of stuff like I did like they were like for LABORERS FOR

735
01:22:56.250 --> 01:23:02.550
Quentono W.E. Neal: Women and you know desk work all that would not, you know, computer graphics will not so that I thought that was

736
01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:05.910
Quentono W.E. Neal: SOMETHING PRETTY INTERESTING TO GET INTO

737
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.980
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Computer Graphics really can help with your

738
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:17.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: With your artwork, because computer graphics is our art in the computer world.

739
01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:19.920
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah.

740
01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

741
01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Did I answer your questions a little bit

742
01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:26.760
Yeah.

743
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:29.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

744
01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:33.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I don't want you to think for one second that my

745
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:37.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My perception or

746
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:40.620
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: My knowledge it strictly comes out.

747
01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.160
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Of look

748
01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:42.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, because it doesn't

749
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:51.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So knowing that peace knowing that I'm, you know, I had to walk the walk, I continue to walk the walk.

750
01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:52.890
Quentono W.E. Neal: Is what makes it all.

751
01:23:53.670 --> 01:24:09.090
Quentono W.E. Neal: Let me, let me. Can I hear your testimony. Let me hear your testimony this it seems like it seems like, I don't have a level a level of acceptance, because I never heard your side yet so I'm kind of just assuming that

752
01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:18.060
Quentono W.E. Neal: You know what I mean that you never just had a passion for it that you just kind of, oh, well, we'll just we'll just get it because it's a job, you know,

753
01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:19.290
Yeah.

754
01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.490
Quentono W.E. Neal: I don't want to hear your, your, your side.

755
01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:31.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, I'll give it to you in a general way I don't share my story outside of my support system.

756
01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:48.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I come from addiction, my family, you know, addicted addiction. My parents addiction myself, you know, long line since I was a kid, you know, that's what my life consisted of

757
01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I have lost

758
01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: People very close to me.

759
01:24:55.650 --> 01:24:59.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In tragic ways I've walked through some pretty horrific trauma.

760
01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And drugs and alcohol were always my best friend.

761
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:20.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Until they weren't anymore until they quit working until I was waking up in places that were unsafe for a young girl to wake up into until I found myself in vulnerable positions and at risk for losing my freedom.

762
01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:44.790
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I made a choice. And I started going to meetings I grabbed ahold of somebody in a meeting and held on to her for my whole life. And she walked me through. And that is how come and why I'm able to sit here with you today. If it wasn't for that I'd probably be dead.

763
01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:56.190
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know my life was wild. And it was crazy. And it was about fulfilling things within myself that I didn't get as a child, or as a teenager.

764
01:25:57.990 --> 01:26:07.740
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So I didn't begin my venture into this field until I was in my 40s 30s.

765
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: MID 30s.

766
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:13.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I've been on this path, ever since.

767
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:19.440
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

768
01:26:20.490 --> 01:26:20.880
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah.

769
01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.030
Quentono W.E. Neal: That sounds about right.

770
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.650
Yeah.

771
01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:41.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And so I got here by being sober by being willing to do the work being willing to step outside my comfort zone. Do the things that were suggested that I do that I didn't want to do because

772
01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:43.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again,

773
01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.250
Quentono W.E. Neal: You know what I mean, yeah, okay, well,

774
01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:56.100
Quentono W.E. Neal: I found one support group. I found one support group that that I'm willing to work with. And, um,

775
01:26:58.050 --> 01:27:09.240
Quentono W.E. Neal: It's a place where they do art to and everybody else goes goes there and they come down, down to do art and it's open. It's like a community thing.

776
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.820
And

777
01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:27.720
Quentono W.E. Neal: I went in there and talk to some people got a tour around the place. And a lot of actually a lot of people that have just two different tests are with like like one will do silversmith not just different types

778
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:34.770
Quentono W.E. Neal: Anyway mean painting, you know, even like lessons and stuff like that for music and whatnot. Um,

779
01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:44.100
Quentono W.E. Neal: I think that's pretty good. And then I think that's pretty good pace. Right. I think I'd be more comfortable enough, you know,

780
01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:45.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And do it.

781
01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:55.170
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because this is about your recovery. This isn't about mine. This is about what's going to work for you, what's going to help you and support you.

782
01:27:57.150 --> 01:28:01.020
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to build a solid foundation for your recovery. Right.

783
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.220
Yeah.

784
01:28:03.330 --> 01:28:09.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A na doesn't fit everybody you know what I mean, it's about what is going to work for you.

785
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:23.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And if this is the avenue that you think is going to work best for you. Then I say, you go for it and you engage and you build a server support system around art around some of them something that you're passionate about that gives you joy.

786
01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:39.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What I know at this stage in my life is that life is too short. And before we know it. We have lived, you know, most of our life and we have less time on this earth. And we've already been on this earth. And if we don't get to a point where we learn how to live.

787
01:28:40.290 --> 01:28:52.200
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And be happy without adding substances in our body, we never get to experience the true meaning of what happiness really is what it means to be free of those monkeys on our box.

788
01:28:53.790 --> 01:29:00.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, doing things experiencing things. You know what I mean, building a life in recovery means you find what makes you happy.

789
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:02.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

790
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:05.820
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah, actually I do.

791
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.830
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like

792
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:17.370
Quentono W.E. Neal: where we're at. We're at the moment when the new again out of your diction, like, oh, this is how this. How about and

793
01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:18.840
Like

794
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:22.440
Quentono W.E. Neal: I almost every emotion that was

795
01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:30.960
Quentono W.E. Neal: That was like on Happy, happy emotion or love or joy or even like like like

796
01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:41.850
Quentono W.E. Neal: A brother, sister, our boyfriend, girlfriend, you know, the all those types of emotions that you know you know around with people and stuff.

797
01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.040
Quentono W.E. Neal: You just like it's

798
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:52.830
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like for me, when I started being sober. My feeling my emotion channel system.

799
01:29:53.940 --> 01:30:02.880
Quentono W.E. Neal: It still kind of numbed so like to being to start having someone show you to having someone, show me that they love me.

800
01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:19.110
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like my flesh and I my mind my body. Tell me just laughing that you don't love me. What the fuck oh fuck are you, you know, like it's just laughing inside me. And, but, on the other, sober side, it's like

801
01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:29.250
Quentono W.E. Neal: Oh man, this is this is this is the religion. This is a real deal right here. This is the real deal like like it's hard for you to recognize, but it's actually the real deal.

802
01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:37.170
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like you know I even had a copy of the time you've heard a Stat Man, you got a good thing. He got a good thing in your life, man.

803
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:39.270
Quentono W.E. Neal: And

804
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:45.810
Quentono W.E. Neal: But it's not. I mean, it is my fault, it's not their fault. It's my fault because you know

805
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.720
Quentono W.E. Neal: I got fucked up on drugs, you know,

806
01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.350
Quentono W.E. Neal: I was like, you know, so I

807
01:30:53.610 --> 01:30:55.530
Quentono W.E. Neal: It's hard for me to get back in because like

808
01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:01.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: When I was when I was young when I was 16 when I was at

809
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:02.610
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like

810
01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:13.290
Quentono W.E. Neal: I used to have all the emotions as to have a used to be fine. I used to be energetic. I used to be outgoing easy going with people I was always social

811
01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:22.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: I was always not in the mix. But I was, you know what I mean. Yeah. And it was it was more it seemed like it was more easier for me back in the day.

812
01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:31.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: To to just, you know what I mean to the. Hey, what's up man. How's it going, cool. All right. That's what's up. Haha, you know, and actually really mean it.

813
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.220
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: XD

814
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:37.920
Quentono W.E. Neal: really mean it when it's coming out of you and you know actually used to really feel it. Come, you know what it means.

815
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:38.580
Quentono W.E. Neal: You know,

816
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:43.830
Quentono W.E. Neal: To hear it coming out of someone to actually feel it coming out of them, you know, hearing it from them.

817
01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:55.950
Quentono W.E. Neal: Right now I feel that, like, I don't have that you know that now that I'm walking back from my sobriety that it's barely it's barely my lights barely book coming back.

818
01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.700
Quentono W.E. Neal: So that

819
01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Takes time how much

820
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:02.340
Time.

821
01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:03.840
All right.

822
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: How long

823
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:06.840
Quentono W.E. Neal: Have you been sober.

824
01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.130
Quentono W.E. Neal: For bottom

825
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:10.200
Quentono W.E. Neal: Lot of month and a half.

826
01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:11.820
Quentono W.E. Neal: Know,

827
01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:16.020
Quentono W.E. Neal: As well. When I first started this program. It was a month and a half.

828
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.370
So,

829
01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.350
Quentono W.E. Neal: I'm

830
01:32:20.610 --> 01:32:21.150
To change.

831
01:32:24.570 --> 01:32:26.580
Quentono W.E. Neal: Three months. Okay.

832
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:28.860
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yep, three months.

833
01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:44.490
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're gonna have to give your mind, in your body time. It takes can take up to a year before we are completely healed from the destruction that drugs and alcohol dude Are our mind in our body.

834
01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.110
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Takes

835
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:51.870
Quentono W.E. Neal: Place up so it takes it to a year. Yeah, for it to automatically

836
01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:57.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your body's regenerating and healing itself right now, but it takes time for that to happen.

837
01:32:58.650 --> 01:33:11.130
Quentono W.E. Neal: Okay, so, so when they say when they say that it takes only three days for method commodity system, it is actually taking the year for your mind to actually fully develop and give back to its normal self. Right.

838
01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, to recover.

839
01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From the damage that that that that drug does

840
01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:30.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, yes. It takes time. It's like alcohol and your liver. You know when you are a an alcoholic a chronic alcoholic and you quit drinking and you have

841
01:33:30.630 --> 01:33:44.940
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your at that point where you're almost you're your livers almost going into services at that point. It's like, it still has a chance to heal itself, but the minute that the damage is done. The damage is done.

842
01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:46.650
Quentono W.E. Neal: Okay, what about

843
01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:54.840
Quentono W.E. Neal: What about if there's just a little like a little bit of scarring on the liver and it's not cirrhosis.

844
01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:58.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Then it has an opportunity to heal.

845
01:33:59.670 --> 01:34:00.240
Quentono W.E. Neal: For

846
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:01.350
All right, well,

847
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Thank you.

848
01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:05.430
Quentono W.E. Neal: Well, cuz

849
01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:09.030
Quentono W.E. Neal: Cuz i don't know if i told you but

850
01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.800
Quentono W.E. Neal: That's, that's how my liver is drinking right now that's like

851
01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:18.000
Quentono W.E. Neal: This that's from that.

852
01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:27.480
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It has an opportunity to repair itself. But when the damage getting getting too expensive. It can't even repair itself. There's this thing called to have ever heard of wet.

853
01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:30.600
Quentono W.E. Neal: wet, wet brain.

854
01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:31.380
Yeah.

855
01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:42.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So as late stay late stage, alcoholism, somebody that drinks from morning till night they cannot live without alcohol. Their, their stomach is swollen.

856
01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:51.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They're losing their memory and and they just won't quit drinking and there's this thing called Warnecke in Corsica off.

857
01:34:52.680 --> 01:35:03.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So it's like it's two things. So they start they're diagnosed with what with dementia. The beginning phases of dementia, but

858
01:35:03.930 --> 01:35:09.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The longer than they keep drinking, the more they keep drinking it goes straight into correspond, which means

859
01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:21.420
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: There they all simers it means they can't repair itself. It's done. The damage is permanent. But if they would have stopped drinking when they first started losing their memory and

860
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:36.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And the doctor said, now's the time to stop because you know you're you're heading into dementia. We're not warming course golf is dementia and Alzheimer's. Okay, so they're just in the beginning phases of getting dementia.

861
01:35:38.010 --> 01:35:49.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They if they stopped drinking their brain could heal itself, but the minute that the damage. You know, it goes so extensive that they get all timers. There's no repairing it

862
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:57.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Is the damage is permanent. It's like that the same scenario with your liver. It's like right now there's a little scar on it.

863
01:35:57.810 --> 01:36:08.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's called a war room a war wound. Right. The body can heal itself. But if you were continually if you were to continually drink the damage will become era.

864
01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:26.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Era repairable, you know, eventually, you would have to have a new liver and when that happens, you know, if you're an alcoholic. It's hard to get a liver, you know, it'll kill you. So you, the more that you do, the more expensive. The damage becomes

865
01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:33.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So stopping and giving, giving your body a year, giving your body, you know, and mind.

866
01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:35.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: A year to completely heal itself.

867
01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:37.320
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So,

868
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:38.580
Quentono W.E. Neal: So you want me

869
01:36:39.450 --> 01:36:43.710
Quentono W.E. Neal: So what needs to happen is I need to give my body, a whole year.

870
01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:50.850
Quentono W.E. Neal: Not drink any alcohol. Yeah, in order for it to heal for how long. Don't like

871
01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.120
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like a duration of like how long like

872
01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:57.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well, you kind of

873
01:36:57.810 --> 01:37:06.090
Quentono W.E. Neal: So, so, like, okay, so if I give it a year for repair costs a percentage like that that

874
01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:09.570
Quentono W.E. Neal: That is has a healing effect for it.

875
01:37:10.110 --> 01:37:15.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It will have a healing effect, but I can tell you that if you after a year. If you start drinking again.

876
01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.360
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your, your liver your liver.

877
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:19.290
Quentono W.E. Neal: Is go back down.

878
01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Again, yeah, totally. It totally you've got

879
01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:23.970
Quentono W.E. Neal: This crazy

880
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:27.540
Quentono W.E. Neal: So it's basically just

881
01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.570
Quentono W.E. Neal: Don't drink at all. Yeah.

882
01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:43.020
Quentono W.E. Neal: Okay, so. Okay, what about if you drink, say, see if I drink, okay. I'VE BEEN SOBER say I've been. I've been. So I relax. I'm up as I've been

883
01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:54.780
Quentono W.E. Neal: I really am like two weeks, but that was just a little shot and little beer. But still, you know, so that, so since I realized that that does that still mean that just like you have to start all over again.

884
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:07.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It depends on you. It depends on your program who you're working with, that's up to you. You get to own your sobriety however way you believe it should be.

885
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:10.560
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay.

886
01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:11.970
Quentono W.E. Neal: All right, all right.

887
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:21.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: I'm definitely not wanting to tell you what's right and what's wrong. And what's the appropriate. There's no rules. That's the great part about it. There's no set rules. There are suggestions.

888
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:37.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right. But there's no set rules. You get to find your bottom base, you get to find your base of honesty it within yourself and truthfulness within yourself. You get to walk your path and figure out what best suits your recovery.

889
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:48.180
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's the great part about recovery is there's no right or wrong way to do it other than not drinking and put or using putting mind altering substances in your body, you know,

890
01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:50.970
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The only thing

891
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:56.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The rest is up to you to create however way works for you.

892
01:38:59.160 --> 01:38:59.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

893
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:01.170
Yeah.

894
01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.890
Quentono W.E. Neal: Makes perfect sense. Perfect sense

895
01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:18.450
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what recovery means and the things that it gives you know not using drugs and alcohol. The things that it gives you emotionally eventually your emotions you start being able to feel them a little bit

896
01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:33.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: They'll start coming back. You'll keep getting more and more mental clarity and you'll start wanting and have the desire to be the best person that you can be. You know what I mean.

897
01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You'll let go of the guilt.

898
01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:49.500
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: From the past or the belief that you're not good enough. And how could anybody. Love you, that that direct statement inside your head count is a direct result from something you experienced in your past.

899
01:39:50.610 --> 01:40:05.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That told you, you weren't good enough. Yeah. And the crazy part about this, about addiction is that this is the way that I view it. Okay, my understanding of it is that you know how we have voices inside our head that talk to us.

900
01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:10.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Right, you get into arguments with yourself. Sometimes I know I do.

901
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, um,

902
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:21.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, so our addiction is one of those voices inside your head and every suggestion that it has the energy back to using

903
01:40:23.610 --> 01:40:24.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Every suggestion.

904
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:31.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Because there's no bet there's no good suggestion from your addiction. Right. It's about

905
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:35.640
Quentono W.E. Neal: You know where it always starts at and without I know him. I know it starts at

906
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:37.170
Quentono W.E. Neal: Were on

907
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:54.540
Quentono W.E. Neal: Come on, we can we can hustle, man. You can make one badass our words go out there and sell it for like 5060 bucks for that. I know you hustle it like that because you got to like that and go buy a ball right now for come up real quick. It's like

908
01:40:55.650 --> 01:40:56.010
Quentono W.E. Neal: And

909
01:40:57.150 --> 01:41:02.670
Quentono W.E. Neal: It's crazy, because I know within myself that that can never happen. Yeah, you know,

910
01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:08.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That is that is your addiction talking to you right there. Yeah, you know,

911
01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.500
Quentono W.E. Neal: It may, it may go

912
01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:21.000
Quentono W.E. Neal: Away, it may go a little bit like amazing. Yeah, I'll make a couple hundred dollars and reopen have my Motel six or whatever for a good week or two and then after that match.

913
01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:22.770
And

914
01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.910
Quentono W.E. Neal: I don't know. Probably back in jail. No.

915
01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:30.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: One thing about it. One thing about it is that it's a falsity.

916
01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:40.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's a false. Yes, it's a false it what it tells you is false. It has one job and that is

917
01:41:40.230 --> 01:41:40.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To take you out.

918
01:41:41.130 --> 01:41:43.260
Quentono W.E. Neal: Period and what a better way.

919
01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:50.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What a better way. And that's reality of it addiction, has one job, and that is to keep you in that life and to take you out.

920
01:41:51.540 --> 01:42:02.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, that's what it wants. There's nothing else at once because that's the end result. Right. The end result is you know either Odeon or going back to prison or

921
01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:12.810
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, dying of cirrhosis of the liver. If you're drinking or dying of Alzheimer's or, you know, dementia, if you think about the outcome when you play the tape forward.

922
01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:25.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: What's at the end of the road, not being happy not not selling your artwork and bettering yourself but it's to keep you in the depths of hell.

923
01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.520
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's what this diseases. It is period.

924
01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:32.100
Quentono W.E. Neal: Like

925
01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:39.840
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It might be good for the first little bit, but eventually you go right back into that whole spiraling effect that whole piece where it's hell.

926
01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:50.370
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you think about it, that voice. It has one job is cutting it's baffling it will lie to you it will do anything. It can take to drag you back.

927
01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:58.050
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: In your mind. And the minute that you that you entertain the thoughts that it's putting in your head.

928
01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.870
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The stronger those thoughts get

929
01:43:02.490 --> 01:43:11.670
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The easier it is for her to hook you and say, one time won't hurt. I could drink one beer. It's okay, I can you know I can use for one day. That's fine.

930
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:15.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Those are all lies. Those are lies there lies.

931
01:43:17.130 --> 01:43:26.010
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So when you really break it down and you take your addiction and you look at it like it is this voice inside your head that has one job.

932
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:29.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's to take you out.

933
01:43:31.230 --> 01:43:48.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The great part about it is that the other part of you. The loving the carrying the happy. The, the, the strong willed person your spiritual, mental and emotional well being. Physical is a lot stronger than that one voice, if you feed that

934
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: But if you're feeding your addiction and you're you're

935
01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:59.610
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Dancing around the idea that impossibly might be right. It's winning

936
01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:06.510
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It gets stronger those thoughts get stronger your cravings get get stronger.

937
01:44:07.770 --> 01:44:09.630
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense. You know,

938
01:44:11.250 --> 01:44:12.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It's whatever you feed.

939
01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.230
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Will grow.

940
01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:36.240
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Now I can tell you that you always have those thoughts will come. The longer you're in sobriety those thoughts will come, but they'll come less frequent and you'll be able to identify them and just kind of blow, blow it out of your mind. I, I say foul words to mind when it happens.

941
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:49.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Like get out of here, you know, get the F out of here. Where do you think you're doing I'm in a good place in my life I have this going on this going on this going on this going on. I don't ever want to go back and feel the way I felt when I was using

942
01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:50.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Ever

943
01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:54.690
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's the combative part of it.

944
01:44:55.710 --> 01:45:10.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you've got to combat those thoughts in your head that tells you it's a good idea that tells you one says one time is okay. You know what I mean, you've got to combat it and know when when your addiction is talking to you and you know it because you just identified

945
01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.830
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know how it talks to you.

946
01:45:15.570 --> 01:45:17.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's how we change it and how we fight it.

947
01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:26.730
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And again we build a sober support system we we really hone in on other people that are trying to do exactly what we're doing.

948
01:45:27.330 --> 01:45:35.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's where we stay in the middle of it. We don't keep secrets. When we have those thoughts. We talked about it with our sober people because that takes the power out of it.

949
01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:40.650
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Your addiction wants you to keep secrets because secrets. Keep you sick.

950
01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:49.080
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: The longer you're keeping secrets, the more you're keeping secrets, the more you're not telling your silver people that you're having those thoughts. The bigger they become

951
01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:51.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That make sense.

952
01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.010
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah.

953
01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:54.840
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah.

954
01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:03.750
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you get to design and create your sobriety for, however, will work for you.

955
01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:15.990
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Where I want what I would like to see you do is just do do some of it do something step outside your comfort zone and figure out what direction you want to go.

956
01:46:16.530 --> 01:46:29.280
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And start walking in that direction. If it's to engage in this in this community art program do it. I say go do it build up on what you have, you have this this awesome gift.

957
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:44.640
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Build up on it. You know what I mean. Put your energy in there, take the power out of your addiction. Don't entertain those thoughts, not for one minute because those thoughts can lead you back to prison brought back to jail.

958
01:46:46.050 --> 01:46:48.540
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Or can take you out. Just depends

959
01:46:50.250 --> 01:47:02.040
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You have a life to live. You have a have a child to raise you have a relationship to flourish, you know, you have all these good things that are going for you. And that's what you need to focus on

960
01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:04.920
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That makes sense.

961
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:07.110
Quentono W.E. Neal: Yeah. Makes sense.

962
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:10.680
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I didn't come out of a book that came out with my personal experience.

963
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.390
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All right.

964
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:15.150
Quentono W.E. Neal: All right.

965
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:17.610
Quentono W.E. Neal: Okay. All right.

966
01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:21.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So you're going to art program. Yeah.

967
01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:22.740
Quentono W.E. Neal: Check it out.

968
01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:27.030
Quentono W.E. Neal: I'll check you out. See how it is. OK.

969
01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:39.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Isolation is no good for anybody because isolation Neil allows you to stay in your head and allows your addiction to tickle around up there and give you these little underlying thoughts, you know,

970
01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:50.250
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You want to get out of your head, you want to, you want to be be doing things that are healthy and good for you, because that's what helps us gain our strength in recovery.

971
01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:52.980
Quentono W.E. Neal: Okay.

972
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.120
All right.

973
01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:55.560
Quentono W.E. Neal: All right.

974
01:47:57.900 --> 01:47:58.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: All right.

975
01:47:59.610 --> 01:48:00.900
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Okay, so you have a mission.

976
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:02.340
All right.

977
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.050

01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.380
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Get out.

981
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:13.320
Quentono W.E. Neal: No mission.
