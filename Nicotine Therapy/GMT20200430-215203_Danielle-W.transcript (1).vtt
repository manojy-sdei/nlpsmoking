Lisa Goodwill: Okay.

301
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:00.600
Lisa Goodwill: Though

302
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.110
Jenn C.: Natalie.

303
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:11.460
Jenn C.: Yes, it's Jen a cochran what time tomorrow morning. Do you want me to

304
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.400
Natalie Austin: At a time. Anytime I'm good all morning.

305
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.450
Jenn C.: Do I

306
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.790
Jenn C.: Or just your room.

307
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.300
Natalie Austin: And I think you have to go to the VC again.

308
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.890
Unfortunately, yeah.

309
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:24.120
Natalie Austin: Yes.

310
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.090
Natalie Austin: I know it is

311
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.940
Natalie Austin: I'm supposed to be hooked on my bar room. I've easier. Huh.

312
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.020
Yeah.

313
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.620
Richelle Direny: I think, I think the full I really honestly think a lot of the holdup I mean not to excuse

314
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:47.970
Richelle Direny: Because I have heard the complaint about PC being a lot of people coming through. But I think part of it is, it's I I had to tell them to to create a room for me.

315
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.200
Richelle Direny: Because of me being in a session. So I think that's what

316
00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.970
Richelle Direny: I had to. Because usually, we send we send

317
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.570
Richelle Direny: Like 30 minutes ahead of time, but I had a session.

318
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.900
Richelle Direny: Prior to this, so I'm

319
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.100
Jenn C.: Obviously don't understand why they don't keep the same room number

320
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.700
I know

321
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.530
Jenn C.: Like

322
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.550
Richelle Direny: I think they just sent a message. It seems like it's

323
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:24.420
Richelle Direny: A lot of people in the zoom. So they are telling that people are still coming in, um, it's

324
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.860

358

Natalie Austin: Us.

368
00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.120
Richelle Direny: I think they also encourage that you guys try to check

369
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.600
Richelle Direny: 30 to 45 minutes earlier.

370
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.330
Jenn C.: Right. But now it's like an hour.

371
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.160
Natalie Austin: I know

372
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:36.150
Alvin: I know

373
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.730
Rhi Rhi R: A new group.

374
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.420
Richelle Direny: With them.

375
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.800
Richelle Direny: On Monday.

376
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.610
Richelle Direny: The 11th, maybe it will kind of cut back

377
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.020
Jenn C.: And like, do I have the wrong surveys, because the one is like

378
00:25:52.710 --> 00:26:00.180
Jenn C.: The, the very first survey, I had to fill out just for to be in bright heart. It's like asking like, where

379
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.530
Jenn C.: Where does alcoholics.

380
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.430
Jenn C.: And all that

381
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.500
Jenn C.: Like fill that out every week.

382
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:13.440
Richelle Direny: Somebody

383
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:19.350
Jenn C.: I thought it was only the one to i thought we only had to fill the one about our family history out the first time.

384
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.840
Jenn C.: And then the one survey every week.

385
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.420
Jenn C.: But now they're saying both of them every week.

386
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.130
Jenn C.: And that makes no sense. How many times I gotta tell him that my you know father didn't beat me.

387
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.560
Jenette Luckett: They told me it's called like

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:22.020
Richelle Direny: If I think my arm, just in case I get frozen Frozen. If I'm frozen guys, just let me know. And so I'm going to turn over the

494
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.700
Richelle Direny: Handles to you, Natalie, just in case.

495
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.280
Natalie Austin: I'm you're right, man.

496
00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.360
Richelle Direny: So I went back

497
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.680
Richelle Direny: Home in a dark place hope.

498
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.180
Richelle Direny: I'm in the sense

499
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:46.560
Richelle Direny: That pope in a dark place. I'm talking about where is your place.

500
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.810
Richelle Direny: For some people, their dark place can

501
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:48.960
Christa: Be

502
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.730
Richelle Direny: They could be experiencing that

503
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:51.300
Jenette Luckett: Right now.

504
00:33:51.930 --> 00:34:11.310
Richelle Direny: I'm us amid the crisis in everything that's going on, just as it applies to you personally that can be your dark place now. Or you could have experienced or dark place and I want just you to hear what was your way of finding hope.

505
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.320
Richelle Direny: While you work in that dark place.

506
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.060
Richelle Direny: I know earlier.

507
00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:17.700
Richelle Direny: We had people talk about for them.

508
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:32.190
Richelle Direny: It's holding on to face. So for them, their hope is just their belief in God, I'm just having faith in God. Some people just, it's not even an option, but they just have to have hope other people gave other reasons and so

509
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.090
Richelle Direny: You know, after

510
00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:38.280
Richelle Direny: You know, people were sharing. I thought to myself, okay for us to be confident about, you know,

511
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.980
Richelle Direny: Why we say that I have hope now.

512
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.630
Christa: It's because we have experienced

513
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.050
Richelle Direny: Different things in life that makes us feel so confident

514
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:46.980
Richelle Direny: About where we

515
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.020
Richelle Direny: Are today and you know

516
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.670
Richelle Direny: Maybe it was you had

517
00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.230
George Zimmerman: A confidence. But now,

518
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:53.700

526
00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:26.460
Richelle Direny: On talking so I'm gonna start with

527
00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:28.650
Eric Owens: April.

528
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.840
Richelle Direny: I'm gonna have you share how did you

529
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.350
Eric Owens: Find hope.

530
00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.670
april carte: I found hope to my children, um,

531
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.760
april carte: You know what, I'm lost. Or I feel like giving up. I just

532
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.590
april carte: Think about them, my children, my mom, my family.

533
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.090
april carte: And that, you know, gives me hope to keep going.

534
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.730
april carte: I mean that and doing god you know i'm not

535
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:06.060
april carte: The most religious person in the world, but I do believe in God and I do believe in divine intervention. So

536
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:12.330
april carte: I just pray about it. You know, my children, keep me going. My mom, my family.

537
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.450
april carte: I just find hoping that

538
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:20.790
april carte: Yes.

539
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.810
Richelle Direny: Okay. Okay, thanks thing, um,

540
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.570
Richelle Direny: Let's because we have so many people here um

541
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.780
Richelle Direny: Why don't you go ahead and share

542
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.430
Richelle Direny: Okay.

543
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.650
Richelle Direny: Go ahead CRISPR

544
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:41.400
Okay.

545
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.170
Christa: Um, it's funny that you mentioned this.

546
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.540
Christa: because something happened to me a year ago that

547
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:58.440
Christa: I had and I had a lot of things happen like back to back to back.

548
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.540
Christa: And

549
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:15.210
Christa: It's, it's an emotional thing but anyways. At this point I had lost hope in divine intervention until it happened. Um, and I realized that we

550
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.180
Christa: As human beings are so much

551
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.560
Christa: More than this body.

552
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:21.630
Christa: And

553
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:42.720
Christa: That's what gives me hope. Every day, like if something bad happens, I can easily discard that is it's okay, it's going to be better because we are so much more than this material world in this material body that we put so much ego mentality into. Does that make sense.

554
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:56.040
Christa: So that's what gets me through there. I it was to me. It was my divine intervention. It was my wake up and now I know this is just

555
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:06.690
Christa: I don't know. It's like a game to me now, and we are the controllers and you just gotta, you have to have that faith so you can control it the right way, you know,

556
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:21.450
Richelle Direny: And like I said earlier, it's that for you to get to that place to speak about what you to speak about hope now and to speak the way you're speaking today, like you said you had went through some

557
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.700
Richelle Direny: already experienced some things

558
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.330
Richelle Direny: So while you experienced that now that you come out of it.

559
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:31.710
Richelle Direny: When you look back, you're like, Okay, now I can speak with confidence. Like there's

560
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:32.340
Richelle Direny: More to

561
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:39.870
Richelle Direny: This than what we are looking at there is more to it. It's based on your experience that you share with other people.

562
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:49.290
Richelle Direny: And why you share. And that's why, like tonight because, again, you know, I don't really want to limit on the air. You know, labor on the point because there was a lot of people and I really like

563
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:59.010
Richelle Direny: You know, people to share, but it's just that point of and why I've always even say, and I know there's a lot of new people here today and you know if you don't want to share. That's fine.

564
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:03.330
Richelle Direny: Because, you know, you want to know what the group is all about and and what it looks like but

565
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:15.840
Richelle Direny: It's, it's your group and it's for you to share with each other because, you know, somebody might be in a dark place and it was funny because with this topic earlier in the group.

566
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:31.440
Richelle Direny: Someone talks about, wow, you know, it's a lot to have hope because someone a loved one their partner their spouse had just attempted suicide. A few days ago. And so now they're having to have hope for that person who

567
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:45.900
Richelle Direny: Even though they attempted suicide was not successful. So now I have to have hope. And I have to have strength for that person. So it's that they're trying to find hope for themselves and for someone else. And so it's sharing with others because

568
00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.470
Richelle Direny: The thing is, we're all going through something, it may not

569
00:39:50.130 --> 00:40:00.750
Richelle Direny: look exactly the same, but we're all going through something. And so if I say, you know what, for me today. I find hoping my children. I have find hope in my family. That's what I'm finding in

570
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:10.410
Richelle Direny: And you look into that and you say, wow, you know what, maybe I can do that too. I find hope because I've been through this and I know there's more to life than just what I'm looking at.

571
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.840
Richelle Direny: Yes. Maybe that I could look at that.

572
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.570
Richelle Direny: And I can find meaning and understanding that

573
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:16.860
Richelle Direny: And so

574
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:29.490
Richelle Direny: Everyone, you know, it's just speaking from your place, and just, you know, when you're sharing. Just be mindful that it's okay to share. And I know we're all new and nobody knows any one for the most part, at least.

575
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:41.130
Richelle Direny: From anything sure don't know me but it's sharing with each other. You're hoping that it will help you get through even just today.

576
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:52.620
Richelle Direny: Maybe you just face something this morning and I need somehow to get through today because sometimes we get to that in life. I just need to get through this hour. That's why I just

577
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:56.220
Richelle Direny: Need to be able to get through this hour. That's it.

578
00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:07.050
Richelle Direny: It could even get a smallest. I just need to get through the next minute every minute of the day is important. Every minute eight is crucial. That's just how much the life has gotten me down.

579
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:25.110
Richelle Direny: And it's okay, it's okay because we all get to that place like I just need to get through this minute. And so, but be, you know, again, everything here is confidential, you know, but just encourage each other to know. Listen, I find my hope because I know I went through some

580
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:33.270
Richelle Direny: And when I was going through my crap. You know, I'm just sugar called me up because it's a recording session yell but

581
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:33.780
Richelle Direny: You know,

582
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.160
Richelle Direny: What I went through my crap. I know where where I am today.

583
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.530
Richelle Direny: So thank you so much. Krista

584
00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.150
Christa: M You're welcome.

585
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.280
Richelle Direny: I'm going to have

586
00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.030
Roxy, you want to share

587
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.670
Roxanne Arnold: Not really. Do I have to do. I'm kind of I can

588
00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:06.870
Roxanne Arnold: But I kind of missed whatever you the initial statement was I just got a new phone. And I couldn't get it to download the zoom app. So I

Richelle Direny: And while you share

594

Richelle Direny: You can tell Miss I said if you need a refill. So you get a double whammy.

595
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.860
Roxanne Arnold: Oh yeah, okay.

596
00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.940
Roxanne Arnold: What what was, what are we sharing on

597
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.660
Richelle Direny: Place. How do you find hope.

598
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:32.970
Roxanne Arnold: How do I find how

599
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.480
Roxanne Arnold: I, I'm going to have to say.

600
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.380
Roxanne Arnold: Sometimes it's more challenging.

601
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:47.250
Roxanne Arnold: Than others, but I'm going to say through a

602
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:50.190
Roxanne Arnold: Support Network and

603
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.230
Roxanne Arnold: Through prayer.

604
00:42:55.350 --> 00:43:02.940
Roxanne Arnold: That's really how I find hope or just even if a small good thing happens. I try to tell myself, you know,

605
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:07.950
Roxanne Arnold: Things will be okay. That kind of thing affirmations.

606

613
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:46.290
Richelle Direny: You know it's it's it's good, like you said, finding hope. I know, I know, for me personally, I like to be around people. I like to do what I'm doing now talk

614
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.030
Richelle Direny: So,

615
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.650
Richelle Direny: Sometimes when I'm feeling down

616
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:50.880
Rhi Rhi R: Having people

617
00:43:51.120 --> 00:44:01.650
Richelle Direny: Talk to me is what helps me and sometimes. Have you ever been through those moments where you need somebody to talk to. And it seemed like nobody in your phone was the answer the phone.

618
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:10.260
Richelle Direny: And it's like, you talk to somebody and they get up want to answer their phone. And so sometimes I'm just like, All right, guys. Well, since nobody wants to

619
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.520
Christa: Be no attention today.

620
00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.190
Richelle Direny: You got it. And this is where you

621
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.810
Christa: We don't have to have a conversation because

622
00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:16.050
Richelle Direny: I need

623
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:16.980
Richelle Direny: This moment.

624
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.030
Roxanne Arnold: And that's just

625
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:27.240
Richelle Direny: Like you said, that's how you find it, you reach for this you reach for that. It's finding some outlet of being able to get something to fill you up.

626
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.370
Roxanne Arnold: So you have for the woman.

627

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:44.730
Roxanne Arnold: Nice and something I just asked him real quick. I'm sorry gnarly. I don't want to stay over anything

631
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.130
Roxanne Arnold: And even calling me in the tablets instead of the film.

632
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:54.330
Roxanne Arnold: Film and I think you probably just

634
00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.320

Richelle Direny: And I said, hey, just

780
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.420
Richelle Direny: Want to go ahead and reschedule.

781
00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:19.860

782
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:21.540
Jen D: It seems like some special day.

783
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:35.430
Jen D: I didn't get anything I've done in my email, and because of work I have to get up at four in the morning, touch the buckets that I work until 615 and I don't get home until 830 so there's my day.

790
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:55.380
Richelle Direny: Only way if you only way you can communicate is through email, I will respond to an email.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:03.510
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's fine. But I knew you were at work. So that's why I said, Hey, do you want

Jen D: to reschedule.

794
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:10.590
Jen D: Yeah, I don't want you to think I'm blowing you guys off because I'm not so I just started your

795
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:12.000
Richelle Direny: I know, I know I

796
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.520
Richelle Direny: Remember that I remember that you started yesterday.

797
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:15.930
Richelle Direny: I remember if

798
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:18.750
Richelle Direny: I have a whole lot of creation, but I remember

799
00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.570
Richelle Direny: I remember, don't worry. So, um, I

800
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:21.900
Wish

801
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:27.450
Richelle Direny: Somebody said to Russia.

802
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.120
Rhi Rhi R: Amy, Brianna Brianna.

803
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:32.250
Natalie Austin: Read me

804
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.640
Rhi Rhi R: you text me our appointment.

805
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.560
Rhi Rhi R: Because I'll get the text message because I accidentally deleted everything my texting.

806
00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:43.410
Rhi Rhi R: Or something. I don't know. So I couldn't get back to you.

807
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:44.880
Richelle Direny: Okay.

808
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.910
Richelle Direny: I wonder if you don't you don't have an appointment with me.

809
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:48.180
Richelle Direny: But

810
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:50.550
Jen D: Let me write down the people who

811
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.410
Richelle Direny: Have an appointment.

812
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.960
Richelle Direny: I'll send you an appointment.

813
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.220
Jen D: Okay, thanks.

814
00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:00.600
Richelle Direny: Okay, and then

815
00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:06.420
Richelle Direny: Like I said, I see a lot of new faces on here. Let me see if I could quickly, um,

816
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:15.510
Richelle Direny: Since time is coming night. Let me quickly see if I because there's a lot of new faces. And so the other thing is that bright heart is kind of tightening up on

817
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:26.460
Richelle Direny: Kind of the part patient in terms of attending group like it's very important to attend group because you're you're refills are attached to your group attendance and if you're not

818
00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:27.480
Richelle Direny: Coming to group.

819
00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:37.770
Richelle Direny: Then it will, you know, it will affect you getting the refills. So I really truly try my best to remind everybody, and give everybody their appointment times

820
00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:55.350
Richelle Direny: And send reminders. Now, unfortunately, if your therapist is Maggie, um, you know, I just verbally tell it to you during group time when your appointment is so like Jen Jeanette your appointment with Maggie is on the 27th at seven.

821
00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:04.230
Richelle Direny: Um, and so far in the group right now. That is the only person.

822
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:06.450
Christa: I see.

823
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:19.980
Richelle Direny: Oh no, Roxanne your appointment with Maggie is on the sixth at 7pm.

824
00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.530
Richelle Direny: Okay, you got it. Rock fan.

825
00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:24.630
Roxanne Arnold: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

826
00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:30.690
Richelle Direny: And then I think that's it. Nobody else in this

827
00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.350
Richelle Direny: Group is

828
00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:32.340
On her calendar.

829
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:35.880
Roxanne Arnold: Nobody else

830
00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:43.920
Richelle Direny: On this group is on her calendar. So I'm and then from my calendar. I already gave out everyone in her

831
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:54.540
Richelle Direny: Of getting your, your, especially because your new the very first appointment. The very first appointment with your therapist of important appointment. That's how we get to know you.

832
00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.720
Richelle Direny: That's how we're able to get to build a treatment plan.

833
00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:10.440
Richelle Direny: And even though, even if you have an appointment outside. That's fine. Don't stop seeing your therapists outside continue doing it but just for bright heart. You know, it's important just to do that very first appointment, because that is a part of the

834
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:16.500
Richelle Direny: Program. And then, you know, you just continue to attend your outside appointments. Okay.

835
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.510
Richelle Direny: So, um,

836
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.330
Richelle Direny: Everybody does anybody need to

837
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:28.740
Richelle Direny: To share or to get there. Really didn't get it.

838
00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:34.650
Natalie Austin: I think I got everybody

839
00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:36.810
Roxanne Arnold: For everybody okay

840
00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:38.460
Richelle Direny: Now,

841
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.190
Richelle Direny: this cool thing.

842
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.090
Richelle Direny: Parting statement. It's just, I just wanted to just share again, you know,

843
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.440
Richelle Direny: Everyone usually

844
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:46.770
Richelle Direny: In

845
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:52.740
Richelle Direny: The group will have everyone, um, you know, try to share or just the to weigh

846
00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:55.200
Richelle Direny: In on I'm

847
00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:07.650
Richelle Direny: Just waiting on the topic. Um, but, you know, I just want just to let everyone know you know we're all here for each other. Um, there is hope.

848
00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:18.120
Richelle Direny: Whether it's you're in this dark place. Now, or just anytime we all experience dark places and it's why it's called seasons. We all experience different season in our lives.

849
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:22.440
Richelle Direny: That season could be your dark place could be financial, it could be health

850
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:31.860
Richelle Direny: It could be with a family member, it could be feeling ostracized by your family or certain group of friends, whatever it is. And you just kind of feel low and you feel depressed or what have you.

851
00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:43.080
Richelle Direny: It's just, it's finding that hope and whatever that that is for you. Remember part of how you found hope in the past when you work in that dark place.

852
00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:51.330
Richelle Direny: It's somewhat how the addiction started because you use that for some or for a lot of, you're not going to say for everybody, but for the

853
00:59:51.930 --> 01:00:02.820
Richelle Direny: Most of you use that to kind of numb the feeling of anxiety, whether it's social anxiety, whatever it is you use that that's how that addiction.

854
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:10.710
Richelle Direny: You know you turned to whatever it was that you were addicted to you help to do with the anxiety you, it helps you to

855
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:18.420
Richelle Direny: Deal with the hurt and the pain that feeling of isolation depression. It's just, I don't want to feel. I don't want to think

856
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:29.850
Richelle Direny: I don't want to just be a part and the only way I can do that. Is this life that addiction that you entered, and that's what the whole was back then. And at some point in time.

857
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:33.780
Richelle Direny: You've experienced something where you're like, You know what, I don't want to be in the storm anymore.

858
01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:46.800
Richelle Direny: I don't want, I don't like how it's making me feel. I just don't like it. And so now you're on this journey of recovery and some of you have been learning for a while. So now you know for a lot of people who

859
01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:55.560
Richelle Direny: Are new to our group today, there was this topic that I talked about. I refer to the song and the line and the songs and I can see clearly. Now the rain is gone.

860
01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:03.690
Richelle Direny: I can see all the obstacles in my way. And it's going to be a bright sunshiny day. And so that's kind of where that hope is now that you're out of that storm.

861
01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:11.070
Richelle Direny: You're here now you can see all of the obstacles. Now there is a hope that it is going to be a bright sunshiny day

862
01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:25.170
Richelle Direny: And you have to find what am I holding on to what helped me to get through that and you know what if that if that's what whatever I find to hold on to today and it's helping me get through every minute of the day, or every just hour of the day.

863
01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:36.780
Richelle Direny: Just keep holding on to that because you know what eventually is going to come along and you're going to say, hey, you know what, I hope, whether it's faith in God, whether it's faith in my family, whatever it is.

864
01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:45.390
Richelle Direny: You will find it. And that's what you hold on to. And that's what keeps you going and before you know it, you will be years down the line. And you're like, man.

865
01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:51.510
Richelle Direny: I've gotten so far and I don't even know how I got there, because it just our resilience

866
01:01:52.230 --> 01:02:01.020
Richelle Direny: And, you know, coming to group is always helpful going to individual is also very helpful too because in individual you can talk about those.

867
01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:10.980
Richelle Direny: Those intimate things and you're processing it, I believe that when you go to individual. It's not that the counselor, is there to give them all of the answers or what have you.

868
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:14.910
Richelle Direny: A counselor is only as knowledgeable as you make them in mean that

869
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.190
Richelle Direny: You're telling them what is going on, kind of like when you go to the doctor doctor can't solve your problems you'll tell them what's going on.

870
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:29.730
Richelle Direny: Thank God. They know mine readers, you have to tell them what's going on. And then they can lead you on that path and help you get on that path, but a lot of its you're figuring out, like, wow.

871
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:38.880
Richelle Direny: Wow, like, now I get it. And that's, you know, helping even in that to find hope is just to get those tools to put in your toolbox to get through.

872
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:53.760
Richelle Direny: So hopefully you guys got something out of today. I'm hoping, but just continue coming and I'll be here, Natalie, and I will be here on whatever day of the week you choose will be here. Okay. So thank you everyone.

873
01:02:55.020 --> 01:03:06.960

Natalie Austin: Yeah.

904
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:09.150
Because

905
01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:16.290
George Zimmerman: Yeah, well, cuz I have individuals with Serena. I've already done.

906
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:24.750
George Zimmerman: My first individual with her and my second one is scheduled for the fifth, or six, I don't remember exactly what day, but it's a fit or the sex.

907
01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:33.300
George Zimmerman: And we hadn't heard Justin and I hadn't heard anything about the group's yet a little bit like I knew it was still getting figured out with our groups.

908
01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:41.520
George Zimmerman: What groups should we join. I'm not sure. Should we cuz it was Thursday at 6pm right

909
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.430
Natalie Austin: Yeah, that's the one you're in right now. Yeah.

910
01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:46.200
Natalie Austin: But if we

911
01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:50.640
Natalie Austin: Got at least I think he would just just joined this one until we can get on Monday group I

912
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.810
Natalie Austin: Said okay

913
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.930
George Zimmerman: Somebody will it be okay if Justin does this as well, because we don't want anything to affect our program.

914
01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:03.660
Natalie Austin: Yeah, he has to come to a noon. Was he didn't come in at lunchtime.

915
01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:05.880
George Zimmerman: And honestly,

916
01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:12.300
George Zimmerman: Maybe he could talk to a supervisor then and see because our, our lunches kind of change quite frequently.

917
01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.480
George Zimmerman: Maybe he could talk to a supervisor credit

918
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:18.270
George Zimmerman: Be either the Monday or the Thursday, one for

919
01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.030
Natalie Austin: Yes, yes. Okay.

920
01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.420
George Zimmerman: Or I'll talk to my one of us will figure it out and see if one of us.

921
01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.670
George Zimmerman: Yeah. Lunch around noon and then

922
01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.360
George Zimmerman: It's an hour. Is it an hour long group would

923
01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:31.710
George Zimmerman: Yeah.

924
01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:32.280
Yeah.

925
01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:34.650
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

926
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:37.440
Richelle Direny: But you have both of you have to come to two separate groups.

927
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:41.070
Natalie Austin: Right after the problem. Yeah, that's what we're gonna do.

928
01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:47.910
George Zimmerman: Yeah, cuz our lunch break. It's only 45 minutes. So if we were to do it. Would it be okay if we did a 45 minute

929
01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:49.440
Natalie Austin: Yeah.

930
01:06:54.300 --> 01:07:03.000
George Zimmerman: So starting next week, then we'll try to make sure that each of us is doing one group and then to the individuals because I know he has his individual setup as well so

931
01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:05.670
All right.

932
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:07.320
Natalie Austin: Wonderful.

933
