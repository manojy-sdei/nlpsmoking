00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Long time no see.

2
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.430
No.

3
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.130
For real.

4
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Going on. I assure been wondering if you're getting that license, but I know you're trying to get CEOs to get licensure kickin and I just been wondering how you doing,

5
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.870
Bethany Shadid: I'm doing I'm doing all right I my life that I have my license. So that's good. Last I checked, it's an active

6
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice.

7
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.420
Bethany Shadid: Um, so I haven't said anything to work because I don't want to go back

8
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.710
Bethany Shadid: And I it was really causing some anxiety because a coworker asked me.

9
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.160
Bethany Shadid: Was like

10
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:48.660
Bethany Shadid: Oh, she, she said, so what did they say to you when you turned in all of your stuff. And I was like, I'm nothing. I didn't really tell her, but I was anxious because I, I didn't want her or anybody else reminding them.

11
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.150
Bethany Shadid: That once my license with active that I could go back so

12
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.060
Bethany Shadid: I told her, just not to say anything. They haven't said anything to me.

13
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.480
Bethany Shadid: And my so I was like to get rid of the anxiety.

14
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.750
Bethany Shadid: Because like I need to

15
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.440
Bethany Shadid: Decide what what I need to do for me that so that when this arises.

16
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:36.000
Bethany Shadid: I am sure of my decision. And I don't have to like have all this anxiety, just you know festering and me so I'm after a lot of prayer and contemplation.

17
00:02:36.930 --> 00:03:00.780
Bethany Shadid: I decided that if they call me to have me come back. Then I'm going to let them know that, you know, kind of like how we rehearsed before with the quitting that, you know, I've had time to think. And I think that, you know, in all honesty, it but it just wasn't working.

18
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.760
Bethany Shadid: And

19
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.220
Bethany Shadid: At this time i i i don't i don't want to come back and I would rather work on the front line.

20
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.140
Bethany Shadid: Then do that.

21
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.640
Bethany Shadid: So I'm preparing myself. I actually, you know,

22
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.310
Bethany Shadid: Worst case scenario or not. Worst case but

23
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:39.330
Bethany Shadid: You know, they could have me work in the hospital with a coven 19 thing. But that doesn't bother me so much. I feel kind of bad that I've been able to

24
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.210
Bethany Shadid: Not work this whole time.

25
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So is is that our focus today.

26
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Is really

27
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Around that preparation. We could do that, what do you what. Okay, which one

28
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.340
Bethany Shadid: Know, basically just letting you know that I it was bothering me but I

29
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:21.000
Bethany Shadid: I have become okay with our, how would you say I learned that in order to release the anxiety about what's going to happen if they call I sorted it out in my head and and have released beings, because I know what I'm going to do.

30
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You made a decision.

31
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Yes, I see that

32
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really, that's cool.

33
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:35.160
Bethany Shadid: Just letting it go and realizing that don't have to go back is a really good stress reliever to

34
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Fantastic. Yeah.

35
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.120
Bethany Shadid: Go ahead.

36
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And not. Yeah, that's just wasn't a good fit. No, no.

37
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.270
So,

38
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:57.930
Bethany Shadid: There were a few things I was going to tell you, um, I spent the first few weeks really

39
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.100
Bethany Shadid: Um, I was so exhausted from my job. Oh yeah, and

40
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.830
Bethany Shadid: Was pretty mad at myself.

41
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:27.390
Bethany Shadid: For how little I got done and you know, and after a while when I made the decision of not going back. And you know what is going to be good for me. Um,

42
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.340
Bethany Shadid: I started making some healthier decisions and actually being more productive.

43
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.150
Bethany Shadid: Around here. So I've really worked on getting my place together.

44
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.810
Bethany Shadid: Doing a lot of arts and crafts and projects and

45
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.520
Bethany Shadid: The other thing to my health. So

46
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.640
Bethany Shadid: I started doing some yoga ish stretches

47
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:08.640
Bethany Shadid: Before because I realized that laying around all day doesn't help me feel any better.

48
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:20.400
Bethany Shadid: And I also noticed that going up to the eight milligrams. I got really constipated again really bloated.

49
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.580
Bethany Shadid: And I ended up getting this

50
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:39.810
Bethany Shadid: It's called activated at activate I forget, but it's prebiotics probiotics and a superfood.

51
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.470
Bethany Shadid: Blend and you drink it every morning and it's really started to help things

52
00:06:48.510 --> 00:07:04.800
Bethany Shadid: I've been on it, maybe like five or six days and I'm noticing some really good things I'm gut wise and I know my gut health is so important. You know, for my overall health. So

53
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.160
Bethany Shadid: That's what I've done there.

54
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:26.370
Bethany Shadid: I think, oh, and I'm so I'm collecting unemployment, but it's much less than my

55
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.440
Bethany Shadid: What I'm used to.

56
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.810
Bethany Shadid: And I have to do my taxes.

57
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:40.560
Bethany Shadid: To get the stimulus money or whatever, which is a headache.

58
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.540
Bethany Shadid: Um,

59
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:51.210
Bethany Shadid: And it's been very triggering and so

60
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Your voice just got shaky.

61
00:07:53.550 --> 00:08:00.870
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. And so that's actually I think maybe where we can work.

62
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.430
Bethany Shadid: Yep, um,

63
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:12.570
Bethany Shadid: We had a really good family couple over zoom last night and all of us were

64
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:25.110
Bethany Shadid: Chatting my sister got engaged over the coven quarantine thing. And I'm very happy for her. Um,

65
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.370
Bethany Shadid: But something came up in the

66
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:50.040
Bethany Shadid: Oh, my sister made a joke and said I got my check right away and I was really excited about it. My sister's really hilarious, but she was just joking. She said, I was so excited I got mine right away until my friend told me that they give the checks to the ugly people first.

67
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.550
Bethany Shadid: And I was like, you know, we're all laughing and everything and

68
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.530
Bethany Shadid: And then I jumped in and said I must be gorgeous.

69
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.810
Bethany Shadid: Because I still haven't gotten mine.

70
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:22.890
Bethany Shadid: Yeah. And then my, my cousin jumped in and was like, you started guide years. Oh my gosh, you need to go, you know, and she jumped and she doesn't know the story, but she was just giving some friendly advice. I didn't think any more of it.

71
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.000
Bethany Shadid: But my dad texted me

72
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

73
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I got it.

74
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:47.820
Bethany Shadid: Basically, he was like, I need you to take this seriously, um, you know, because we're helping you need to do your taxes so that you can get this money and pay your rent you know he was

75
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I got it.

76
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.590
Bethany Shadid: So it really

77
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.320
Bethany Shadid: Prior to him getting in it.

78
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.090
Bethany Shadid: It was already something that was it's been a struggle.

79
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.300
Bethany Shadid: Um, so I haven't paid taxes for the past two years.

80
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.080
Bethany Shadid: The reason is I tried to do my

81
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.270
Bethany Shadid: Taxes.

82
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:19.980
Bethany Shadid: But

83
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.570
Bethany Shadid: My homelessness.

84
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.090
Bethany Shadid: That here.

85
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.870
Bethany Shadid: I lost my health insurance halfway through the year.

86
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:42.120
Bethany Shadid: And there's a penalty if you don't have insurance, you have to pay

87
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.270
Bethany Shadid: And at the time I couldn't pay and so I filed for an extension.

88
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.790
Bethany Shadid: So,

89
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.050
Bethany Shadid: I was going to do it this year.

90
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.050
Bethany Shadid: But then

91
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:05.280
Bethany Shadid: I took that big chunk of time off after I moved out here when I started working with you guys.

92
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:14.100
Bethany Shadid: And so there's just a lot of complicated pieces involved in this task.

93
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.760
Bethany Shadid: Yep. And it's something that I've always done my own taxes, it's not

94
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.630
Bethany Shadid: But because of all of the stuff that I have to

95
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:37.530
Bethany Shadid: Think about and gather documentation for and

96
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.410
Bethany Shadid: Then my dad.

97
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:50.610
Bethany Shadid: You know, bringing it up and how even though I'm really proud of myself for everything I've done

98
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.460
Bethany Shadid: To get on my feet.

99
00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:04.140
Bethany Shadid: He doesn't see it that way, he's, you know, worried that he's going to have to pay you know money because I'm out of work.

100
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:20.490
Bethany Shadid: And so the other thing, too, is in the month of March, it was my birthday and my, my parents went ahead and paid my rent that month as a birthday guest.

101
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.770
Bethany Shadid: I didn't ask for it. I didn't

102
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.540
Bethany Shadid: But they were they mailed it to my apartment.

103
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:49.650
Bethany Shadid: So I had no saying I was just grateful and, you know, a little apprehensive. And sure enough, I knew I was going to back up, because in the text message. My dad was like you know we've been helping you a lot lately. And I'm thinking to myself, What do you mean

104
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.140
Bethany Shadid: So,

105
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.820
Bethany Shadid: You know, I, and I know better. A gift is never a gift with my

106
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.920
Bethany Shadid: So,

107
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:11.070
Bethany Shadid: It's been very triggering I've been trying to breathe and check in with my distress level right

108
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.310
Bethany Shadid: Right, it

109
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.270
Bethany Shadid: Is so easy to procrastinate.

110
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I've got an idea. Right.

111
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Talking about. I think I get it.

112
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you went into default mode. I think it's been a minute. I think when you and I are connecting on a more regular basis. It's easier to remember some of those perspective skills that you have. It's just they get forgotten. And so now that

113
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: That tender spot of shame getting activated. That's what it looks like out here like

114
00:13:54.030 --> 00:14:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and so it makes it in a possibility to get things done when we're in it. We're I'm

115
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it's hard to get anything done so.

116
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.550
Bethany Shadid: That actually really helps because in my head.

117
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.740
Bethany Shadid: I was

118
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.970
Bethany Shadid: Like I was able to text my dad. So I had time to think.

119
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:26.280
Bethany Shadid: And I was very conscious. Like, I started going into my whole defending myself and then deleted it all.

120
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.020
Bethany Shadid: And didn't give him you know content to go after me.

121
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:39.720
Bethany Shadid: And I finally like got it down to the like what I know. Like I you know the grain of truth.

122
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:50.460
Bethany Shadid: Okay, which is, I know you. You've done a lot to help me. And I know you're only doing this because love me and you know kept it

123
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.290
Bethany Shadid: You know,

124
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.280
Bethany Shadid: Good. And that kind of squashed it but

125
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:07.110
Bethany Shadid: I was like I'm doing everything but I'm still like, what is this. So, but as soon as you said stream.

126
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:13.440
Bethany Shadid: That really hit me up cuz it it's like

127
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.760
Bethany Shadid: I know

128
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So that different parts of the brain that's all, that's all that is

129
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be both. Notice how productive you were, how much self you could get to enjoy decorating you got in your sense of agency and you got clear you use a decision making.

130
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what I'm going to do with my job, my bodies on the line. I'm going to speak my truth. You've got all this clarity.

131
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And then family and then family of origin. In fact, you were able to see

132
00:15:51.750 --> 00:16:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: HAVING SOME FUN. You can even see perspective with a friend. You could call it, you call it friendly advice, but when it comes to dad, and we'll just keep it right there.

133
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of revert back to an old interpretation. You don't quite have habituated

134
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What to Do you did some cool things. So look what you did, for she went defensive and because right. It's the same thing as that's that's subjective unit of distress, because you now have time

135
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you writing it. Maybe it was you were able to say I'm doing what I always did. I'm doing it and what you ended up doing was you validated his feelings. You said you've been very generous.

136
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know you only have love in your heart for me for that. Okay. And then you said that squashed it

137
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Does work those things work. I still

138
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Felt the shame.

139
00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:48.870
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

140
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So, some don't forget all the cool things that you did. You did some great stuff.

141
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see what we got here. What, what do we have available in your environment right there to do some desensitization around that chain. I'm see you're in bed. Do you have a setting.

142
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.880
Bethany Shadid: Actually on a couch.

143
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, do you have to, to finish to vertical things that we could do some end or do you have some ability to. Okay, let's go grab it. Let's do it right around this topic.

144
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to have your eyes, nice and level with those objects so that you're not straining them and you can be just looking bilaterally.

145
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Just now.

146
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with what you just said right piece of

147
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The emotion shame.

148
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And it was activated with what see if we can grab it and this is just really lean in Word and let's, let's see, what's the first thing that comes to mind that emotion of shame I recognize it and it got activated.

149
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as I saw my dad was the center of attacks. Nope. It was when I saw he said some word in the text or a suit, maybe happen in this gathering this zoom meeting when, when was the closest you can find it.

150
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.570
Bethany Shadid: Um,

151
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.890
Bethany Shadid: I

152
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.930
Bethany Shadid: I still a child, I can't take care of

153
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

154
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember that that thought ran through your head when

155
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You were in play in the zoom meeting or was it when the text when he that came through what what point would you say

156
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:22.740
Bethany Shadid: As soon as it came out in the zoom name. Oh, I thought, was

157
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.510
Bethany Shadid: You know the content I shouldn't have said anything.

158
00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.780
Bethany Shadid: But

159
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.380
Bethany Shadid: When I got the text, it was

160
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.620
Bethany Shadid: Like this is never going to end like I'm never gonna be able to

161
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.310
Bethany Shadid: Like he like he though is gonna feel like I he has

162
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.320
Bethany Shadid: Parent

163
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: So looking a you're using the phone for your device right now for our, our

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so do you see your phone.

167
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.600
Bethany Shadid: No, it moved it. Okay.

168
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that phone.

169
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as was it you saw that it was your dad did you already know what he was going to write

170
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:32.640
Bethany Shadid: I got a little like a hint notification.

171
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.040
Bethany Shadid: And the first few lines I was already like

172
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.010
Bethany Shadid: Oh no, and I don't want to read the text, you know,

173
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and then

174
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Aside is

175
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: This will never end. He will always treat me well. He'll always feel like he has to parent me

176
00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

177
00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one.

178
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

179
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's let's go into that, I said, is the belief. I still can't take care of myself is that the belief about yourself that you. Let's see if it is, what's the

180
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.070
Bethany Shadid: It's not, it's the belief

181
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.940
Bethany Shadid: It triggers.

182
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.190
Bethany Shadid: Me feeling like no matter what I do.

183
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:36.300
Bethany Shadid: It's never going to be good enough. It's never going to be able to prove that I'm a capable human being.

184
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it

185
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not good enough, is that the core

186
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.530
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

187
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.610
Okay.

188
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, we're going to get through it. Let's see if we can find the positive one, what would have been convenient.

189
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Would have been a nice

190
00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: belief about yourself at that moment when he was carrying on. I know we got to really stretch the imagination, but what would have been convenient. The positive of belief about the self.

191
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.060
Bethany Shadid: I don't know, a positive, but I do have

192
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.110
Bethany Shadid: I

193
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.570
Bethany Shadid: Thought that this is my, my dad's

194
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.130
Bethany Shadid: Issue.

195
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Go. So let's let's hold on to that. This is my dad's my dad's issue.

196
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Now go to. I am so when you're with. This is my dad's issue I am

197
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go.

198
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.600
Bethany Shadid: Five years old.

199
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.000
Bethany Shadid: Will do this.

200
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:00.840
And yeah.

201
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And on let's give that a number. So I know where to put it in here and I can watch as it changes how distressed. Are you right now.

202
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Number is that

203
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.460
Bethany Shadid: That Bindi

204
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:23.910
Here.

205
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And pay attention to your body. See where it's messaging you that something important is going on right now.

206
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We're talking about something really important

207
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What's happening inside

208
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.190
Bethany Shadid: Well, I'm hot.

209
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.420
Uh huh.

210
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:56.550
Bethany Shadid: It's almost like an aura of being hot. I don't know if that makes sense. Like a

211
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.060
Bethany Shadid: An outside of me.

212
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.590
Bethany Shadid: Tension

213
00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Tension is felt in in what part

214
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.280
Bethany Shadid: Of my neck folders, but there's almost like a

215
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.700
Bethany Shadid: Slow to

216
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and it's not much. Okay.

217
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.440
All right.

218
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get this set up here. Let's get me so I'm dead center so that I gaze is such because right now, you're often or you might be. But the way it's I'm seeing you. It's Austin or so is is this phone if you could put your hands up face to

219
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Face and then these two objects are about

220
00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:01.290
Bethany Shadid: Yes. Yeah, it's the camera. It's getting distorted view.

221
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me watch your eyes. Then I'm just going to have a go left to right. I want to see how they look. And you're going to check and see if it hurts you might be too close.

222
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to look at me. You're just going to look at those two types of objects me it'll just be a peripheral setting the tempo type of peripheral. You don't have to stop in the middle. You don't have to look at me just look at the two objects.

223
00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I think sit back maybe an inch. I'm guessing, just to touch. Are you risk to shoulder distance away or a bit closer. There we go. Save. Now from there. Now do it ready. Here we go.

224
00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't look at me just peripherally will keep your head straight just the eyes, that's going to get it now. Just how does this feel in your

225
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of that ocular. I don't know what the word is that ocular area he you know

226
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.250
Bethany Shadid: It's good.

227
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.000
Horrible.

228
00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I want to have access to some of these other pieces in my notes. So I gotta wait this little database up okay he's awake.

229
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And so if you're up to it. I'm 70s still does pretty high. Maybe we could spend a little bit of time bringing it down just to touch maybe by bringing into the working memory.

230
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your people

231
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring in holy trinity of

232
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective nature, the protective figure

233
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, bringing that in. It's that clear awareness that you came to on your own, you realize, Wait a minute. I know exactly what the protective figure is and it's God you did that on February 10 I have a know

234
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

235
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.210
Now,

236
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And feel that throughout your body kind of have that that sense of it and have it neat that original right that heat that was coming from the outside just kind of have that contact happen.

237
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And then be aware nationally of Jesus Christ as a nurturing figure wanting

238
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: For you at all times your growth.

239
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: wanting nothing for himself, but just that giving and wanting

240
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: For you to reach your potential that in and of itself. That's it.

241
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And be present with that.

242
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And the other figure of the Holy Spirit, knowing exactly what to do when to do it, how to do it and being present with that.

243
00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's let's kind of open your eyes. And we'll do a nice slow iteration holding all three, the Holy Trinity.

244
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And breathing.

245
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only breathing, but paying attention to the neck.

246
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And the shoulders.

247
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And as it drops into other parts of the body.

248
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You sure you're holding on to those images of you know them.

249
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Belly breath.

250
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale out the mouth.

251
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: deflating that belly balloon.

252
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting that beat quiet and stillness happen.

253
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Having to do nothing.

254
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Just tune in.

255
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And scan the body again see

256
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: See what you notice

257
00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Level of distress, you're in now.

258
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.350
Bethany Shadid: Pretty girl.

259
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not at 70

260
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What like 5050 okay so let's move on down.

261
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's kind of a useful area to be an actually. There's just enough of that register that something importance at stake.

262
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's stressing that we're dissociating and we can't use all the parts of our brain. So that might be a good place for us to sort of go into the desensitization part

263
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Giving that them brain of yours a chance to pre process so

264
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This one you can always it's your mind. You can do whatever you want with it.

265
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: But you'll hear me do those familiar things like pull up that WORST piece having gotten into the second line maybe of that text and realizing I don't want to read this but your image of it, pulling it into your working awareness and the

266
00:30:49.890 --> 00:31:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not enough. I'm never going to be good enough just holding that one and you have it there. Have them, you're gonna have to pull those both the worst image of it and that negative. I'm not enough.

267
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The iteration will be faster if you can kind of tell us a little faster.

268
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's breathe in.

269
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: An exhale out of the mouth, letting it all go nice slow exhale

270
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring that chin down to the chest.

271
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Open up the back of that neck.

272
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's bring that chin up

273
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's open it wide and notice the difference and how it feels.

274
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: To open up that space.

275
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:03.330
Bethany Shadid: Who

276
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Can tell me what's coming up casting through your, your thoughts and whatnot.

277
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.510
Bethany Shadid: It was really, it's like a hopeless. You know, like

278
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.160
Bethany Shadid: That avoidant nature of

279
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.270
Bethany Shadid: Is triggered of

280
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:42.000
Bethany Shadid: Facing that text are facing my father feeling like I have to answer the questions and go through

281
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: A HOLD ON, IN THIS ONE hopelessness and my avoid nature and pull up that that mercy image right there that image, you had, you're going to go with that hold those two things.

282
00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do keep reading.

283
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing great.

284
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about right now.

285
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.440
Bethany Shadid: It really ties back to my

286
00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.370
Bethany Shadid: Reason for me being homeless.

287
00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.110
Bethany Shadid: Because when I was

288
00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.020
Bethany Shadid: Having

289
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:05.310
Bethany Shadid: Unbelievable struggles

290
00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:12.840
Bethany Shadid: I opted to live in my car.

291
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.560
Bethany Shadid: Rather than deal with it.

292
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Go with that go with that. Now pull up that WORST piece around that message with the tax and what you just had go with that whole both there.

293
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And breathe into it. Don't forget to breathe.

294
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Out worst image.

295
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And that tying back to the reason for the homelessness that unbelievable struggle.

296
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And electing to do that.

297
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together in hillbilly breath.

298
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, letting it all go

299
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And let that beat have nothing of a mind blank and quiet happen.

300
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let that space of nothing, just be there.

301
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up.

302
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.320
Bethany Shadid: How

303
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.740
Bethany Shadid: Just how

304
00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.280
Bethany Shadid: Painful

305
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:07.290
Bethany Shadid: Trying to get help from my family is

306
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to do some

307
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.390
Bethany Shadid: open hand and

308
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.500
Bethany Shadid: So my mind at the time it was like I wanted to run away and

309
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.690
Bethany Shadid: Start a new life.

310
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.380
Bethany Shadid: detach myself.

311
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So that was

312
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.490
Bethany Shadid: Probably completely

313
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so try painful trying to help painful trying to get help that one. That's something I don't know if I've done this with you. Let's do a bridge.

314
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Into it's so painful trying to get help. You need wants you to go back and Bridget to the earliest memory.

315
00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:00.510
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have of having tried and the pain of trying to get help.

316
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Not going to stay there without doing the iteration. So I want you to open your eyes. This is the work you're doing it and doing great. And I want you to hold that image.

317
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And I want you to hold the negative cognition. I'm not enough WORST piece of that bridge younger earlier image and I'm not enough.

318
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing into. You're doing great.

319
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent. You got it.

320
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhaling and

321
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhaling go

322
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me check. I'm white level of distress. What number yet right now.

323
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.500
Bethany Shadid: Probably in the indie

324
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

325
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that you could bring it

326
00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Bring in the Holy Trinity and only bring in that bridged memory and let's bring them together. Let's bring them together this iteration will be slower Holy Trinity recognize it in your body as soon as they arrive.

327
00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Earlier bridged memory.

328
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Miss let me paste down just a little bit here.

329
00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going through your mind.

330
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.760
Bethany Shadid: Well obviously the

331
00:39:55.170 --> 00:40:02.790
Bethany Shadid: earliest memories of trying to get help from my parents was during my abuse.

332
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.870
Bethany Shadid: But a few others came up that I

333
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:15.330
Bethany Shadid: Haven't thought about in a very long time.

334
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.520
Bethany Shadid: And unrelated to the abuse. Other things like

335
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You just have to hold on, we won't spend time in storytelling. You ready

336
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:36.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold all them bring them up. They were fragments. They're coming up here for a reason. So let's pay attention to on

337
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Should we keep the Trinity present with them while those other things that came up and let's hold those both together unrelated.

338
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Events.

339
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing great.

340
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale together. Inhale.

341
00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it all go to mind blank for chest and

342
00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Rest there.

343
00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And then looking at what comes up through the mind what you're aware of what do you notice

344
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:12.030
Bethany Shadid: How

345
00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:17.430
Bethany Shadid: God's always been there and I've

346
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.690
Bethany Shadid: Been doing the best in

347
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:24.660
Bethany Shadid: My whole life.

348
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that. Hold that you're gonna go. Okay.

349
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Intention

350
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:51.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoulders.

351
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Altogether.

352
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale. And then when you're ready, exhaling it all out, letting it go

353
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What comes up for you.

354
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.230
Bethany Shadid: Tired. I am

355
00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:56.880
Bethany Shadid: Doing this with them.

356
00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go with that.

357
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: With them.

358
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Make sure you connect that truth back to your body.

359
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Have that communication happened to the neck and shoulders and whatever else. If it's not my invitation that you tune in.

360
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you right now.

361
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.380
Bethany Shadid: The difficulty of doing it.

362
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.900
Bethany Shadid: On my own right.

363
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.450
Bethany Shadid: It's this double edged sword.

364
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:23.250
Bethany Shadid: It's

365
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:25.740
Bethany Shadid: On my own,

366
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.670
Bethany Shadid: Peace of mind.

367
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.490
Bethany Shadid: Or helping assistance with turmoil and

368
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:42.360
Bethany Shadid: I haven't always had the auction.

369
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.490
Bethany Shadid: Or, you know, the freedom to choose.

370
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

371
00:45:55.650 --> 00:46:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so only because we're, we're, where we are in time, time wise. Let's see if we can kind of bring this to a close, see if there's anything

372
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, because you said some really important stuff just now. Are you able to sort of put that duality. I've either kind of have this or this. And I didn't even know that I had a choice.

373
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So see if you can put, if anything, be compartmentalised and put it in a container or in a container and get some distance from it. Or maybe you don't want to. What, what, what is the

374
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:44.040
Bethany Shadid: What's i know that i want to i think it's given me a much better understanding of why it's so triggering

375
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.600
Bethany Shadid: And it's not just financial it's

376
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.210
Bethany Shadid: Help

377
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:53.670
Bethany Shadid: General

378
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.800
Bethany Shadid: And I can think of the times I've gone

379
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.920
Bethany Shadid: For help

380
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.280
Bethany Shadid: Who've been at my lowest

381
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:08.460
Bethany Shadid: And the

382
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.780
Bethany Shadid: Whole not being believed ties into it so strongly

383
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:20.640
Bethany Shadid: And why, you know, all these

384
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:35.190
Bethany Shadid: Emotions apprehension avoidance comes in when I him. You know, it seems a little like the current issue, but how much

385
00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.130
Bethany Shadid: Is behind it.

386
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.720
Bethany Shadid: Yeah.

387
00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, why don't we do this, I can see it doesn't look like I developed a distancing metaphor with you some

388
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: borrow someone else's

389
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.250
And

390
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That you take the the phenomenon may take a color of shape of

391
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being believed. It's got its own energy force fields right here.

392
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, not being believed super old there's lots of stories that justify its existence. This

393
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like you to put it

394
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: On a leaf have it float down river on a ship as it sails away rocket ship going into outer space.

395
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Or hey, right. It's a car zooming past this way and you're heading in this direction and you see it in the rearview mirror and it's getting further and further away.

396
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Or in a balloon and off it goes. Never to be seen again out of the atmosphere to pick your own distancing metaphor. And I want you to put that

397
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being believed that phenomenon.

398
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:46.890
Gwenevere Abriel: In

399
00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:47.730
Gwenevere Abriel: That imagery

400
00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you picture.

401
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.960
Bethany Shadid: All of those lanterns.

402
00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.760
Bethany Shadid: You paper lanterns. The light in it slips away.

403
00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So, close your eyes and picture floating away.

404
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice what you say to it as it goes.

405
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.190
Bethany Shadid: God knows

406
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.770
Bethany Shadid: knows the truth.

407
00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see it moving further away.

408
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost slow kind of the air moves it this way, in that it moves consistently away.

409
00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are there with grounded.

410
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Connected to this planet.

411
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: To these forces that you can always see this holy trinity.

412
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: The one this body can feel, surely, is this gravitational pull to the center of the earth.

413
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Whenever you want to get grounded in this holy trinity feel that gravity.

414
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You remain there.

415
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, you did a lot so

416
00:50:53.220 --> 00:51:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: My next client isn't in here just yet. So can you tell me what you notice. Can we do a little while we can.

417
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.110
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I think.

418
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.440
Bethany Shadid: I like the distancing metaphor.

419
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.520
Bethany Shadid: I could even do it in real life.

420
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.450
Bethany Shadid: My

421
00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:33.000
Bethany Shadid: I have a strong desire to draw my visual imagery of my holy trinity.

422
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:37.170
Bethany Shadid: So I'm like that.

423
00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:39.240
Bethany Shadid: That's cool.

424
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe, maybe the way to stay connected to your experience today if there is it's doing this drawing.

425
00:51:50.370 --> 00:52:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And also you really liked this new distancing metaphor. This might be tying in with before you pick up the phone.

426
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Before you walk outside again before you make social interpersonal contact

427
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Brief

428
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want you to picture. Can you even see that lantern anymore and not being believed and in its place, you are there.

429
00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: With this holy trinity.

430
00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Contact

431
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: With the outside world and you pick up the phone and you look at the text. Let that kind of proceed and let that be the mindset and that space that you're in. As you meet this the new contact, you know,

432
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:49.980
Bethany Shadid: Very good.

433
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.350
Bethany Shadid: Yeah, I don't think I've had something to

434
00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.860
Bethany Shadid: Do prior to

435
00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:07.020
Bethany Shadid: This social contact. So definitely

436
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:09.480
Bethany Shadid: Try that.

437
00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:14.340
Bethany Shadid: And draw it so that I solidify it

438
00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.620
Bethany Shadid: In my mind,

439
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's bring it up to kind of superficial stuff. Let's bring it up here got this distance me just hear what kind of level of distress, you're at right now kind of how activated, are you what charges left

440
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.750
