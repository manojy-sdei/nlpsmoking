00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: On a Friday I was abused it sure that you sound.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Good gorgeous.

3
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.480
Elizabeth Sandoval: Thank you.

4
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I see he's got some dark under his eyes, his are hard to see him like that.

5
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.740
Yeah.

6
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.330
Elizabeth Sandoval: Its arms are about as big as mine, or would say because my brother has always been like a big stocky guy, you know, like

7
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:34.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know he he was a boxing trainer used to train my nephew. He was professional for a while. But then he got sick. And yeah, so he had to stop doing all those things. So

8
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Did he have a really

9
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.090
Hard

10
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:49.020
Elizabeth Sandoval: He's kind of like all he doesn't sleep. He doesn't eat or drink march and when he asked to like they have to give them as medicine.

11
00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:00.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like smash it up like with apple sauce or something and it's hard for him to get it down because I guess it's so hard for him to swallow. Now, because that mass is so big.

12
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.610
Elizabeth Sandoval: So then he started

13
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.080
Elizabeth Sandoval: I didn't know

14
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Was up here. OK.

15
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.790
Elizabeth Sandoval: Now it is, it's, it's like him his airway now so

16
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.230
Elizabeth Sandoval: He

17
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.650
Elizabeth Sandoval: I feel like he prefers

18
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: He's is he saying he's in in physical pain.

19
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.610
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah he is may have them pretty medicated they're just keeping them, you know, comfortable

20
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:39.900
Elizabeth Sandoval: Right. That's a hospice does. They don't give them any like IV fluids. No, not be, you know, letting it run its course. But it's horrible to see

21
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's running its course, you know,

22
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.160
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's very hard.

23
00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are hanging out with with your son or your daughter with your mom.

24
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What's it like to be around them through this process.

25
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.930
Elizabeth Sandoval: Um, they it feels good, like we all feel. I feel like we're all supporting each other. We're all there for each other, you know,

26
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.720
Elizabeth Sandoval: I know everyone is taking it kind of in a different way.

27
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: Um,

28
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.000
Elizabeth Sandoval: But I think like as far as our family, we've we've become like stronger together so

29
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's good.

30
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: There was something you had, I can review the note that we had met before, but you had

31
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it was your nice

32
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see it nice having a hard time I have to step up and be more there for her and my nephew is that you

33
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Know there is it changed.

34
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:06.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: A little bit. I still have it is just because I feel like they're, they're kind of like close to me and maybe they come in spend more time with me. I don't know, maybe because

35
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.360
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know.

36
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.950
Elizabeth Sandoval: But

37
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.070
Elizabeth Sandoval: The only thing that

38
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:27.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: Kind of like no other drinking, you know, and it's not a good way to. I know they're hurting. But if I'm trying to like

39
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: Stir them in the way of like saying like, oh my goodness decisions. People know you're hurting and sorry but that's like one thing

40
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like I have to step up to

41
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

42
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.660
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know.

43
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.560
Oh,

44
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Last time and look it takes probably everything you've got to get through each day, but

45
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It. We're kind of back to some of what we talked about last time, which was

46
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: To maybe write down some things that might be kind of positive and fun to do with them instead of drinking

47
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.400
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

48
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of

49
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.840
That

50
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:20.610
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well I that's my theme. It's just like they call and do their thing and then like when I see them, they're drunk or something. So I'm like, Dang, we could have done something else. Totally different you know together.

51
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:42.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: Even like coming like them coming over to grow and stuff, you know I am. I'm so down with that. But I always tell them I don't want no alcohol and you know like I want you guys just to come eat and but that's not what I want in my house. You know, I kind of, I put my like enforce that you

52
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: Have different

53
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you having. How does enforcing look like because on one hand, they're drinking and then you say you're enforcing I'm just curious. Are you having trouble enforcing it.

54
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: I guess maybe

55
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.450
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know, they want to come over, like

56
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:17.430
Elizabeth Sandoval: There, they've already been drinking. So I'll try to keep them from like leaving or driving, you know. Um, but yeah, I know I will let them do it here. I really

57
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.560
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, you guys can come over, but users are going to be drinking

58
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: This this party, please, you know,

59
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Here's your son is 19 right and

60
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: She's 20

61
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: She's actually just turned 21

62
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: Now our main

63
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.030
Elizabeth Sandoval: may sit here and start a birthday.

64
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And for you with with alcohol is this one of these things that it doesn't trouble you. It's not the same as as a heroin and opiate and math. It's not the same as that, kind of, I mean every house and families a little

65
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:16.980
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah yeah I'm for me. I've never had like a big like thing with drinking. Remember that's never was my thing. I mean, I drink, probably, like, you know, when I was like in my 20s and stuff a little bit. But never was like every day or, you know,

66
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: This this moment. So

67
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.530
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, so it kind of bothers me.

68
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:32.190
Elizabeth Sandoval: When they do agree because I don't know, I just, I feel like I just I can't control everything. You know, so relax live

69
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is one of those moments where you think you have tried to enforce it. And this is where you're maybe using that radical acceptance. You're just saying this is

70
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your good I kind of step back and not not tell them I'm going to take this away or this way because you've done that with him before. You've, you've tried to change his behavior.

71
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

72
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.810
Elizabeth Sandoval: But

73
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.520
Elizabeth Sandoval: I mean,

74
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: I took him to step away from him.

75
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:19.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know he's he's not allowed to use his car, he you know he takes off with my my niece, you know, so

76
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:20.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know.

77
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.460
Elizabeth Sandoval: That's the only thing I feel like

78
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.870
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know. I can stop them from leaving sometimes, you know,

79
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.110
We

80
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:42.510
Elizabeth Sandoval: Can always having our time. He is actually starting to talk with a therapist himself to I've been waiting on months on it like

81
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:59.010
Elizabeth Sandoval: And they finally called him last week, and he had like a little like session like Probably so. So, you know, to introduce himself and all that. So hopefully that'll help him. Okay, I know.

82
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:00.660
Yeah.

83
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:14.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: My niece and my nephew, I really just need to kind of like step back. So with them. Like, I mean, we know if they want to come over to my house. They know what I want. If they can respect that and they can you know hang out.

84
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:29.160
Elizabeth Sandoval: I want to be there for them. But that's no i don't agree with that. And I don't think that's going to help them in any way like get past this little well not this little bump. But this gigantic

85
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.380
Elizabeth Sandoval: Thing that's going on in their lives, you know, their father.

86
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it bring up for you, their approach to solving this grief problem. What does it bring up for you.

87
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well, I know they're just like trying to run away from it and we know

88
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.670
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just for me. I just don't want them to be like me or hand me and all later on in life.

89
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:10.980
Elizabeth Sandoval: And have this problem being all of the addiction. That's the thing that really bothers me.

90
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.560
Elizabeth Sandoval: They're so young, you know,

91
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that you're ready.

92
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think you've developed enough resources coping skills self confidence to go out and face life without a substance in you. Do you think you've learned what you need.

93
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.070
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know, I can't say I'm completely well

94
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:55.740
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'm still like had some work to go. But yeah, I think I've learned a lot, you know, my perspective of life is so much different. When I was on drugs, you know,

95
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.830
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like I feel like my mind is clear, like my the way i think i think you know

96
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: But

97
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:15.750
Elizabeth Sandoval: No, no, everything is kind of crazy the world like we can't even go shopping and do normal things know

98
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.010
Elizabeth Sandoval: Kind of crazy everything

99
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You seem today.

100
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Like the feelings, the awareness of what's going on. It's not quite as much on the surface as sometimes maybe last week it was, what do you think you're doing a little differently. This week, and maybe last week.

101
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.030
Elizabeth Sandoval: Acceptance. I guess I like this past week, I was like, you know,

102
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:55.350
Elizabeth Sandoval: I know this is gonna hurt me, but I don't want to, you know, suffer, you know,

103
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:03.720
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't want him to like because I started when I really like my me look so

104
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:19.200
Elizabeth Sandoval: You've been falling down and he's so like stubborn. He wants to keep going you know he wants to get up and, you know, but he does cat. And then he like he doesn't even like like sense. You know, when he talks.

105
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.840
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just want him to me in peace, I guess.

106
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.040
Elizabeth Sandoval: Already last week I was like angry and

107
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: I wasn't feeling good, because I don't like medicine this stuff, you know,

108
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: I mean, I feel better. This week, with some extent a little messed up, but

109
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.250
Elizabeth Sandoval: My mind feels better than last

110
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: Part have all the emotions.

111
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just such an incredibly difficult time so difficult.

112
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.950
Elizabeth Sandoval: Then I worry about everything.

113
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what worries you

114
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:23.640
Elizabeth Sandoval: Worry about my son I worry about my niece and my nephew you no

115
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:34.830
Elizabeth Sandoval: Worries I know my parents will be okay because like my mom's doing better like she's accepted it, too. And she's like,

116
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.830
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, like I know I'm preparing my dad will get this are strong together, you know,

117
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.760
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just worry for my niece and my nephew.

118
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.150
Elizabeth Sandoval: Mostly

119
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.230
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah.

120
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The other way that you see it from

121
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That your parents because that's the first time I've heard that they're good together and they'll get through it together and that surprised me during that

122
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And but to lose a child. I don't think most parents are prepared for that I

123
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why you see it the other way, as if the parents seem like a

124
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you think your parents would be cope better

125
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.770
Elizabeth Sandoval: No I don't, I don't know, like

126
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.630
Elizabeth Sandoval: Okay.

127
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.360
Gwenevere Abriel: It just surprised me. That's all.

128
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: I see you know

129
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: Kind of expected me that

130
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Will die right in our lifetime, and kind of expect that, but not our

131
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:50.520
Show.

132
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: No, my mom.

133
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.120
Elizabeth Sandoval: She acts like you're strong. I don't really know what's gonna

134
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:10.020
Elizabeth Sandoval: Know, she had a she, she is in our team like strong and she's like, she's like, I know he's gonna be okay. Like, I know it's going to be in peace, you know,

135
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:16.710
Elizabeth Sandoval: I know she's hurting, but I just don't know what's gonna happen you know when the date does come

136
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.670
Elizabeth Sandoval: Maybe that's just like the mask that they learn to live.

137
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.100
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know.

138
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.690

Elizabeth Sandoval: Like I lost last two days. I just find it them to myself.

142
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.920
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because I guess I just haven't been filling good to my stomach and stuff. But yeah, they're there for me.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:53.700
Elizabeth Sandoval: Um,

144
00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:03.600
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just, I know they're, you know, with like with my brother, though, you know, and their programs are probably on here.

145
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Has there been an opportunity to have gatherings with mother and father together and you and your children. Has there been a way to kind of get together, or as coven keeping you apart or too much tension. Like, have you been able to get together.

146
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:40.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, well, like when we go, Where's like my mom and my dad or will be both of my brothers. So it's like I said, we spent a lot of time together at my brother's house. You know, like where they're like a lot. So, yeah.

147
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:48.810
Elizabeth Sandoval: These last few days, like I said, my stomach been kind of messed up. So I didn't want to go over there, you know, maybe have like a little bug going on.

148
00:16:49.680 --> 00:17:02.640
Elizabeth Sandoval: So I haven't been to my brothers, but I know like they're always nervous or somebody like that later. He's funny because he's like, like I just want everybody to leave me alone.

149
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.910
Elizabeth Sandoval: He's like, hi.

150
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.020
Elizabeth Sandoval: You're, you're, you're like, oh,

151
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.020
Elizabeth Sandoval: Good. He's just like wants to be left alone, but

152
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: He wants people in

153
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.200
Elizabeth Sandoval: Our

154
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So balancing what you want and a little bit of his having to reconcile because he's having to face this himself to and ultimately we do

155
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: We do die alone. Right. I mean, no matter even if someone's there we face that ourselves. And I'm wondering if he wants those moments to to sort of process it and you can't quite do it.

156
00:17:46.650 --> 00:18:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe he's trying to show a happy face for you for mom. But maybe maybe in the quiet, he can sort of process it and and sort of get in touch with his own spirituality and kind of reconciling that as much as you can. I mean, you probably have so much

157
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

158
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: opiate in him. I don't know, but

159
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wonder if if that's okay for him. Is that okay, that he takes some time for himself. Alright.

160
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:24.540
Elizabeth Sandoval: Alright, so when he asked some time to get out of the room and you know he's like

161
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.360
Elizabeth Sandoval: Can you guys like stop talking.

162
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.990
You know,

163
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.750
Elizabeth Sandoval: They'll say it so but y'all say like, okay, let's find brother or

164
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.130
Elizabeth Sandoval: Uncle go out there, seeking threats or whatever.

165
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:45.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: But um you know the last time he was trying to like he hasn't been making much sense. So like

166
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:55.200
Elizabeth Sandoval: No, like I think he'll be thinking of like the last spot. Maybe he was sleeping. We'll pause and then it'll be like five minutes later and healthy like oh

167
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.140
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, he's in and out.

168
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:16.470
Elizabeth Sandoval: Awful man they're bringing them. They bought them a hospital bed and stuff because it's hard for him to breathe correctly. So he's like, why are you bringing you all this stuff they brought in a wheelchair. Like, I don't even know curry bringing all this stuff for me for

169
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.660
Elizabeth Sandoval: Me, but he just ramped off with the food.

170
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.060
Elizabeth Sandoval: Kind of, or I think he did all he's been having a lot of false

171
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.620
Elizabeth Sandoval: So it's not what

172
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You described your relationship with as

173
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys just have each other, something that you had explained as if somehow you had this

174
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all you have is one another that that sense is that continuing to be the feeling

175
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I just just he and I, I wondered what you meant by that. So,

176
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:06.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well, I mean, like, just growing up and my best wedding. No.

177
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:19.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: And it's funny because he's always been. I feel like I've always been like this, a little stronger than some wings like he needed me. You know, it's like when we

178
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: Plan, we

179
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:38.190
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like dark and he's like a big guy. He's six years older than me. So here I am like, okay, like let's push push push our best together makes a little sense. And then we were good, like, you know, we were just tired all the time he was just

180
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:52.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: He was never like I mean, brother, you know, feat a funny show like some brothers and sisters each each other, open, you never have fights like that we were just we always got along pretty well.

181
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.970
Elizabeth Sandoval: Set when I got older, you will try to like me. I don't like that guy or I don't like that day or, you know,

182
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Being protective

183
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.220
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah, the big brother for you.

184
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me, tell me about

185
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That breath and that that hand motion. Are you feeling especially anxious this morning.

186
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

187
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it, is it the dynamic in here. Is it about the rest of the day. Is it your son. What do you think the the primary anxious part is

188
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Not wanting to talk, is it kind of you prefer to just be quiet and

189
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: not feel well, tell me about the anxiety.

190
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:57.360
Elizabeth Sandoval: Or is this just anxiety of knowing what's going to come, you know, but

191
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:07.320
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know, I just think of all the things and all the claims that you my brother have had, you know,

192
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.950
Elizabeth Sandoval: When we grow up like when we're going up.

193
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But those those memories aren't going anywhere. And the more you talk with

194
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That means that they're not going to disappear from your brain.

195
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: They'll get pruned away. So we've got to keep talking about them. Right. Yeah. Probably don't just your memory, it starts to fade a bit talking about them. So tell me more, tell me another sweet story about you.

196
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:01.380
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just like when we say we were just always makeup jokes and

197
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.690
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like you, it always makes me laugh. You know, before I went to sleep.

198
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:18.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: We used to watch the Three Stooges and your little and then the other day. The other night I woke up and I never on like it three something in the morning.

199
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.990
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like I thought about him.

200
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.230
Elizabeth Sandoval: We're just like when playing and riding bikes together.

201
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:30.870
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

202
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.310
Elizabeth Sandoval: I remember he would make me his like little

203
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:43.200
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like his, his even football, so he put me on his like football pads and everything.

204
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.420
Elizabeth Sandoval: Yeah. Ya know, like stand there and put on. He put all these tabs on me. And then he like,

205
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.790
Elizabeth Sandoval: Not run me over all crazy but

206
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:54.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

207
00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: I don't know what kinds of fun things. And then when we got older, just like

208
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: GOING CAMPING

209
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:06.780
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know,

210
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.570
Elizabeth Sandoval: Time with her thumb.

211
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:33.690
Elizabeth Sandoval: Where one time we went to pickles or something. And we were pretty far like down, you know, to drop goes down because like the rivers quite down the wave and I had my daughter, she was a baby at the time was a big and

212
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:49.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: Oh my gosh, it started raining so hard, like, so we had to get everything and then we are all of us and all the kids are running up bigger and the lightning was so bad and all the kids are speaking now.

213
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:56.610
Elizabeth Sandoval: And we're just like, so when we have to and kind of ruined the mission.

214
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were to to share in some way. Maybe now maybe later.

215
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: He said to him for what he taught you about yourself.

216
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think you would be grateful to him for what he taught you about life or about yourself. What are you grateful for.

217
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.810
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just that means to always like

218
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.200
Elizabeth Sandoval: He's always been

219
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.880
Elizabeth Sandoval: He saw dependable, you know, like

220
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.270
Elizabeth Sandoval: A such a great father apparent.

221
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.330
Elizabeth Sandoval: Uh huh, kids, you know,

222
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.670
Elizabeth Sandoval: He was when he was. Well, I mean, you know, like I said he was

223
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.730
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just really

224
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.450
Elizabeth Sandoval: Strong

225
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.630
Elizabeth Sandoval: Being there for my kids when after their father died.

226
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.680
Elizabeth Sandoval: So he like took on the role of third father than two.

227
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:25.830
Elizabeth Sandoval: Because my boys were little. They were privately son was how you can so

228
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.090
Elizabeth Sandoval: He spent a lot of time with the boys.

229
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:32.580
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

230
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.550
Elizabeth Sandoval: I'm really thankful for that.

231
00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.370
Elizabeth Sandoval: Comes out

232
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, I guess I had wondered if it was a bit like you're losing their father again was

233
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.080
Elizabeth Sandoval: School

234
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I had wondered

235
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.200
Elizabeth Sandoval: older boy.

236
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.480
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just want to go to this again.

237
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:42.390
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like I heard from my god that was just my husband, he wasn't big blood with this is my brother, my blood, you know, late brother.

238
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.980
Elizabeth Sandoval: It's still affecting so I just

239
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.370
Elizabeth Sandoval: I know this has been in effect for awhile.

240
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.800
Elizabeth Sandoval: Forever.

241
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: I just let her be strong.

242
00:27:59.280 --> 00:27:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You will

243
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You will

244
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that you could do to offer for your son.

245
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: That alcohol cannot give. Do you think you can offer it alcohol just won't fill that void. You think you can do

246
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.280
Elizabeth Sandoval: Just maybe say peace.

247
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:52.260
Elizabeth Sandoval: Be there for you to talk and like one night, you know, when how we had that conversation about, you know, instead of getting mad at him for, like, cuz he came home, not too long ago in not in good shape.

248
00:28:52.800 --> 00:29:03.750
Elizabeth Sandoval: Right, so I was at first I was like, oh, you know what, I went in. I told him, hey what's going on and I cradled in basically like a little be, you know, a nice

249
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:15.960
Elizabeth Sandoval: Pace, and they help them when they just he was talking about my brother. He was talking about wait about his dad, you know, they just let him loose let it out, you know,

250
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

251
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.170
Elizabeth Sandoval: And that was such a good like

252
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: A relief is such a better

253
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:31.560
Elizabeth Sandoval: Idea is that we actually not like, Oh my God, you know, but he just like let it out. So that was great.

254
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:34.770
Elizabeth Sandoval: And it was good.

255
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That was beautiful. Right, that's, that's where he you are holding containing that grief for him.

256
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, who holds and contains yours.

257
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.410
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know your

258
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Mother kind of puts her head in the sand. A bit doesn't she, she's not really sort of she's pretending like it's not like everything's as usual.

259
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.160
Elizabeth Sandoval: Well yeah, I mean,

260
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:20.250
Elizabeth Sandoval: I guess maybe I'm just trying, or I put that facade, but I don't need that, you know, like, I'm just trying to be strong for her to, you know, I don't need that.

261
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.190
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know, so maybe that's why

262
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:25.890
Elizabeth Sandoval: I

263
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:33.330
Elizabeth Sandoval: I mean, if my parents agree. I definitely say like, you know, they're not there for me to, they are

264
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:38.520
Elizabeth Sandoval: My dad great man. My mom's a great woman.

265
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.040
Elizabeth Sandoval: Or just

266
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.740
Elizabeth Sandoval: Not

267
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:49.230
Elizabeth Sandoval: Not I guess that affection in like giving hugs when stuff.

268
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.370
Right, you know,

269
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:53.940
Elizabeth Sandoval: But, um,

270
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But it

271
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Matters, though, because you're left you're you're helping your son and your, you know, you were containing that you

272
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you need to feel that sense of support. Now I know you were dating someone but is he, as he kind of moved out for a little while.

273
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.020
Elizabeth Sandoval: No, you know,

274
00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.060
Elizabeth Sandoval: Like he's

275
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:31.950
Elizabeth Sandoval: He's been giving me support, you know, I mean, people can, you know, help people better as far as, you know, going, going with us.

276
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.860
Elizabeth Sandoval: You know he's helping me

277
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:47.970
Elizabeth Sandoval: I mean he works during the day and he's also doing school so he's a little preoccupied to so I expect you know

278
00:31:49.680 --> 00:32:00.210
Elizabeth Sandoval: Too much, but he is here for me, you know, here for the kids. Good. Does the shopping for me, which is great to go to the girls prefer doesn't like everything

279
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.650
Elizabeth Sandoval: Works every day.

280
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.080
Elizabeth Sandoval: So,

281
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you filling your days. What are you doing most of the days are you doing

282
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.100
Elizabeth Sandoval: My brothers.

Elizabeth Sandoval: Or two little kids, they're all they're wrapping up school, but they've been doing like online school

284
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.920
