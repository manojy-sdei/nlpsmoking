00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.540
Helena Rouhe: Hello.

2
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.440
Oh,

3
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.220
Brian Riley: Can you hear me.

4
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.210
Yep.

5
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.740
Brian Riley: Holy cow, sorry again.

6
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:33.570
Helena Rouhe: No worries. I actually have a lot of random stuff including a puppy eating a dog bed in those few moments. So, all without to have a little time to deal with all that nonsense.

7
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.810
Brian Riley: Perfect, yeah, I'd, you know, an earlier in the day.

8
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.470
Brian Riley: I even thought about canceling but

9
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.710
Brian Riley: It made more sense to

10
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.140
Brian Riley: Meet I

11
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.220
Brian Riley: Esters in Santa Cruz.

12
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.750
Brian Riley: And that instantly gives me

13
00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:56.970
Brian Riley: You know the

14
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.680
Brian Riley: Feeling that I should, you know, be

15
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:11.010
Brian Riley: behave the way I use you know that instinctual. Whoo, feeling and

16
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.580
Brian Riley: You know fucking cancel everything and

17
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.280
Brian Riley: You know obsessed in my own space and all that shit and

18
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.790
Brian Riley: Yeah, I wouldn't have felt right you know

19
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.730
Helena Rouhe: So you recognize the a reaction, but didn't engage the reaction.

20
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.560
Brian Riley: Yeah, and good

21
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.980
Brian Riley: Yeah, and it's good. What's, what's

22
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.610
Brian Riley: What's good is that we can talk about this, this thing that is

23
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.000
Brian Riley: Constant I that the way that

24
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.320
Brian Riley: The way I kind of think of it is, um,

25
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.500
Brian Riley: There's a few

26
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.450
Brian Riley: You know, and I guess.

27
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:02.700
Brian Riley: I guess, I guess.

28
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.520
Brian Riley: Best. Think of it and talk about it in terms of like what I've learned in a day.

29
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.450
Brian Riley: Or, you know, things that I've heard, which is

30
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.680
Brian Riley: You know, and this kind of gives it a general

31
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.120
Brian Riley: You know names to things and feelings and whatever, but

32
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.860
Brian Riley: Like it said that

33
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.000
Brian Riley: You know, as you

34
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.440
Brian Riley: Work on your defects.

35
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.050
Brian Riley: Whatever step that is that the defects will be removed.

36
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.580
Brian Riley: That

37
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.820
Brian Riley: A day will fly or you will fight with yourself and that no, hold on.

38
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.450
Brian Riley: Um, and

39
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.790
Brian Riley: And I guess that's kind of what I'm, what I'm feeling like a few things.

40
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.730
Brian Riley: Like this feeling that started today.

41
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.780
Brian Riley: Around two

42
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.030
Brian Riley: And I don't know if we've talked about it before but

43
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:26.670
Brian Riley: I think we did when I was little, it would be on. Yeah, we have talked about this, it was on Sundays.

44
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.240
Brian Riley: And it was that it was a creepy.

45
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.280
Brian Riley: Sort of

46
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:49.200
Brian Riley: I think a term for it is impending doom, which I think is too strong for what this is now because I know what that is. And it's not. And it's, you know what, in early sobriety. It was a feeling of

47
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.320
Brian Riley: The other shoe drop or, you know, whatever. Um,

48
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:03.240
Brian Riley: And like, you know, I've worked on all of that, you know, through the years and years, especially the last couple of years and

49
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:11.280
Brian Riley: And still, it's there. And I don't know what it is.

50
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.450
Brian Riley: Well, what I understand it to be.

51
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:23.790
Brian Riley: Is, you know, and I referred good for a long time as a little spot of shadow

52
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.660
Brian Riley: That just refuses to

53
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.050
Brian Riley: get absorbed by

54
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:47.910
Brian Riley: Yay, a better fucking you know like what it comes down to it, really, honestly, like right now in my conscious mind. My understanding is there is really nothing to worry at all like I

55
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.830
Brian Riley: I'm there's justification.

56
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.320
Brian Riley: For me,

57
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.750
Brian Riley: At this moment.

58
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.010
Brian Riley: To be completely happy.

59
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.270
Brian Riley: With not like

60
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.050
Brian Riley: A bad feeling in the world.

61
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.160
Brian Riley: But then the next second there's this little thing.

62
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.100
Brian Riley: And it's fucking struggle. It's so crazy. Does it make sense.

63
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:35.610
Brian Riley: What

64
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.200
Brian Riley: Thoughts

65
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:38.910
Brian Riley: Do

66
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:47.310
Helena Rouhe: Well, I mean it's, I think you hit the nail on the head. This is something that you've been struggling with since you were a little kid.

67
00:19:47.940 --> 00:20:00.540
Helena Rouhe: And there was a element of safety, your reaction to safety, you know, the primal fear concern that turns into anxiety that turns into fear that turns into anger that turns into rebellion and

68
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:06.630
Helena Rouhe: You know you tie all those primal emotions into something and you're going to have to use your adult brain to

69
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:19.830
Helena Rouhe: Work yourself out of it. Just keep it in check. And you practice that enough times, and then it becomes less of a problem, especially if you're not using substances or something else is going to antagonize the drama.

70
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.190
Brian Riley: That's your answer. So what what

71
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.830
Helena Rouhe: Did you catch anything. I just

72
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.210
Brian Riley: I was

73
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:39.600
Brian Riley: Sitting

74
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:59.760
Helena Rouhe: So this is these feelings are attached to a very young part of yourself. Yes. So the young part of yourself, you know, any young part of ourselves comes from a place of am I safe. Yeah. Do I need to

75
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:12.210
Helena Rouhe: Make myself safe and if I have to make myself it safe. Then I'm going to be pissed off, angry, upset because as a young person I shouldn't have to do that the people who are in charge of me should do that.

76
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:19.920
Helena Rouhe: So if the answer to. Am I safe, whether it's true or not. If the perception of safety is no

77
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:21.480
Helena Rouhe: Not safe.

78
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.990
Brian Riley: So you right away that it's a safety issue a security thing.

79
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.030
Helena Rouhe: Well, any childhood connection is going to always start with safety.

80
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:52.830
Helena Rouhe: Because we need to know that our primal needs are met, which is are we safe. Are we fed or water or we sheltered. Are we comfortable, all of that as a part of safety. So basic needs aren't being met or not being met, to the degree that help you feel comfortable and safe.

81
00:21:53.970 --> 00:22:05.910
Helena Rouhe: You know, then they're either not consistent or they're held over you or it's a chaotic life you know if there's some element of it. That doesn't feel safe.

82
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:16.560
Helena Rouhe: Because the environment doesn't feel safe or something about the environment as until, say, then we're going to react to that and we're going to be pissed off or upset or fearful or all of the above.

83
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:26.850
Helena Rouhe: And then have our own ways of managing those feelings and and either. We're going to internalize them and take them out of ourselves or we're going to externalize them and take them out on it.

84
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:42.390
Brian Riley: So,

85
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.600
Brian Riley: This has been kind of coming up a lot of meetings.

86
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.200
Brian Riley: And I guess it always has been. I've been hearing it more

87
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.930
Brian Riley: Okay, and

88
00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:01.740
Brian Riley: I'm like, when I talk with my sponsor or when I talk with anybody.

89
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.760
Brian Riley: About a relapse, or really

90
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:14.610
Brian Riley: I say what I know and and is that there's these three things that I must have in place.

91
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.300
Brian Riley: To best present

92
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:25.170
Brian Riley: And what that's communication with my sponsor meetings.

93
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:27.990
Brian Riley: And some sort of service.

94
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.660
Brian Riley: And so

95
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.550
Brian Riley: And that's just like nothing. I know.

96
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.410
Brian Riley: And so

97
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.020
Brian Riley: My sponsor.

98
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:53.370
Brian Riley: He from the time he came into the room. She was always very interested in why people like he's never really spoke from a very like the first couple months.

99
00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:11.310
Brian Riley: He was always blown away and always like really intrigued as to how somebody 25 years and go back this is good stories exploring this story, he tells his sponsor gay man. Not long ago, asked me, so he did and

100
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.940
Brian Riley: And he's done this through the years and he always figures out the same thing.

101
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:29.820
Brian Riley: Nice. I'm listening to them. I'm filling in the blank and he says there's three things. And I'm like, I know, I know you know your sponsors, like I already know that. And he says,

102
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.120
Brian Riley: He stopped going to meetings.

103
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.730
Brian Riley: He stopped talking to sponsor.

104
00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:38.790
Brian Riley: And

105
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.240
Brian Riley: He failed to increase

106
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.010
Brian Riley: Or he failed to

107
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.440
Brian Riley: Nourish or whatever his spiritual condition.

108
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:55.920
Brian Riley: And

109
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:16.050
Brian Riley: There was a guy at a meeting a couple weeks ago and he said in no uncertain terms. It was as if something he just knew, and there was no question about he just said, you know, like not consider any he just is the thing, you know, and he said that

110
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.510
Brian Riley: He wished he knew from the beginning.

111
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:29.280
Brian Riley: That what the answer is because he knows the answer now and that is

112
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.700
Brian Riley: His relationship with God.

113
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:46.980
Brian Riley: And I don't know, I'm not saying one way or another. That's the answer. Whatever. It's part of the answer or whatever.

114
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.360
Brian Riley: But

115
00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.140
Brian Riley: I am starting to believe more

116
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.650
Brian Riley: That my

117
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.340
Brian Riley: Ultimate

118
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.420
Brian Riley: happiness and contentment.

119
00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.710
Brian Riley: Is somehow tied in

120
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.220
Brian Riley: With the stronger bond with my higher

121
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.120
Brian Riley: What are your thoughts.

122
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:28.410
Helena Rouhe: Well, it goes back to safety. Again, if we feel like we're grounded in something, if we're part of something bigger than ourselves.

123
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:47.280
Helena Rouhe: Then we have something to ground us connect us be accountable to some other piece to the puzzle. If it's all about us and we are supposed to ground ourselves, unless somebody has a very strong ego strength and they are very kind of

124
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.500
Helena Rouhe: Self involved.

125
00:26:50.610 --> 00:27:00.690
Helena Rouhe: They tend to people tend to flounder, because we don't do well being grounded in ourselves, we do need to have accountability. We are typically a social creature

126
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:17.250
Helena Rouhe: That needs to be accountable to a bigger picture and then it's up to each of us to identify what that bigger picture. It is that the rooms of that nature, is it God, you know, you have to decide that, but then being accountable to that gives you again that that

127
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:30.150
Helena Rouhe: The opportunity to be a child. Again, if you will, or something that you are connected to that will provide safety and grounding to you in a way that we otherwise wouldn't find

128
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:44.520
Brian Riley: I just, I gotta grab my phone because I'm waiting for pickup.

129
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.590
Brian Riley: I'm

130
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:52.920
Helena Rouhe: Using headphones so because so that you're not having your session go out into the universe, are you okay

131
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.580
Brian Riley: I'm totally alone. Okay, I'm in the yard.

132
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.060
Brian Riley: Unless it makes you more comfortable. I mean, I know there's no

133
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.160
Helena Rouhe: No, it's your, your session.

134
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:11.940
Brian Riley: Yeah, there's a she's gonna be pulling up. I'm probably gonna have to excuse myself for one minute to pass the dog.

135
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:28.740
Brian Riley: Okay, yeah. Something I got thinking that's so that's that's where a lot of my thinking has been has been, um, I would say, mainly though.

136
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.690
Brian Riley: But what I really been

137
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.470
Brian Riley: Working on

138
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.710
Brian Riley: And I'm like, wanting to use a different word than working in trying to just

139
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.990
Brian Riley: Be easy and kind with myself.

140
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.440
Brian Riley: As opposed to how are used to

141
00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:57.120
Brian Riley: And

142
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:14.340
Brian Riley: I think we talked about this before, like all of these things over the past couple of years that I've that I've tried to set an emotion and it feels as if the time has come, you know now to just let it happen.

143
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.110
Brian Riley: And

144
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.010
Brian Riley: And it's so far it's

145
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.980
Brian Riley: Good. What I'm finding is

146
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.840
Brian Riley: My days start out very strong

147
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.670
Brian Riley: And I think I'm able to

148
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.930
Brian Riley: Because by the end of the day.

149
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.470
Brian Riley: If there's there's times rattling really fearful of the night.

150
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.760
Brian Riley: Because where I go.

151
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.530
Brian Riley: Meant

152
00:29:55.050 --> 00:30:02.070
Brian Riley: I could get very upset. Very down and start drilling a hole in

153
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.220
Brian Riley: You know my fucking my confidence in life and all that.

154
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.570
Brian Riley: And it's, it's all tied into

155
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.120
Brian Riley: And there's no way around it.

156
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.710
Brian Riley: Creative thing and

157
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:24.000
Brian Riley: A

158
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:38.880
Brian Riley: Couple weeks ago I think of rumors around my birthday. You know, I really said it was and what the fuck is what would it. What is, what is that I wanted to do.

159
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:49.140
Brian Riley: That not why, what do I need to do what, what, what is it that I need to do what you know like enough is enough. What the fuck do I need to do here, you know, and

160
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.790
Brian Riley: I'm just, I need to create these things.

161
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.370
Brian Riley: And I've been having a feeling that

162
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.910
Brian Riley: I want to do more of them.

163
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.860
Brian Riley: And so

164
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.850
Brian Riley: I need to get it done. I just, I need to get it done and I need to get it done early in the day.

165
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:47.100
Brian Riley: And show for the rest of the day. I'm free. If I want to do more. I could do more if I don't want to do anything. It doesn't matter because I already did. When I fucking, you know, so every day. I have writing for 30 minutes

166
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:50.670
Brian Riley: Editing

167
00:31:51.750 --> 00:32:01.560
Brian Riley: For 30 minutes illustrating either 30 minutes or three illustrations square and then reading my own material.

168
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.130
Brian Riley: For 30 minutes it's fucking two hours a day.

169
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.890
Brian Riley: Right and

170
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.130
Brian Riley: That is reasonable.

171
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.040
Brian Riley: Like, that's the minimum

172
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.770
Brian Riley: You know where

173
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.860
Brian Riley: I fight with like my whole day should be right, but I know that that's just not possible.

174
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:27.780
Brian Riley: And it's not even possible for me meant like I just I can't. I want. I'm not gonna do it like

175
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:34.740
Brian Riley: When I when I did that through that year. And I was, you know, I got published and it's like, I know I have no doubts about being published and all that stuff.

176
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:48.900
Brian Riley: But I mean, I was getting a lot of shit done. I got a lot that I was crazy. I was miserable, and I was just constantly tormented by it and sitting there for hours and writing it down on post this. My time is like, I'm not. I'm just not. I'm not gonna I refuse to do it.

177
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:55.290
Brian Riley: But I'm insisting, so I'm like putting things on myself.

178
00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:01.110
Brian Riley: And I'm training my schedule so that

179
00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.010
Brian Riley: And it's actually working like I really wanted

180
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.200
Brian Riley: Like I really want to write. And so I look forward to it and

181
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:17.250
Brian Riley: And I schedule it during the day between my walks and

182
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.190
Brian Riley: I've been walking in writing, which works out. Point being,

183
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.730
Brian Riley: Talking about defects that are holding on.

184
00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.760
Brian Riley: I'm still fighting with getting those things.

185
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.880
Brian Riley: If I failed myself.

186
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.960
Brian Riley: And I think having that

187
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:47.280
Helena Rouhe: Well, I mean, last time we met you seem to be in a much more kind of several places, this and that you were okay with kind of going with the flow, if you will. And you felt like

188
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:58.530
Helena Rouhe: Things are kind of moving along, and everything's okay and now it's sounding like you're getting a bit more regimented in your thought process. And are you rebelling against the need to be regimented like it's

189
00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:08.010
Helena Rouhe: Like you were okay with it. But now you feel like you're not doing enough. So now you need to be this, this and this and if you don't do that, you're a bad person.

190
00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:15.360
Helena Rouhe: So, I mean, again, it sounds a little bit like if we go from a big picture standpoint.

191
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:27.090
Helena Rouhe: A little kid rebelling and kind of beating themselves up. So life is good and everything's cruising along and now the sudden you get a regimented parents in there and says, if you're not doing the right things you're, you know, do this, or else

192
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.390
Helena Rouhe: And now, listen, you're a bad guy and you're gonna get in trouble.

193
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.660
Brian Riley: But I know

194
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:41.100
Brian Riley: There's there's things that it always comes back and

195
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:50.490
Brian Riley: I know. And I have to admit to myself that I will not be happy.

196
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.250
Brian Riley: If I do not create and express myself creatively.

197
00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:58.650
Why

198
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.710
Helena Rouhe: Why do I have to be so regimented

199
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.480
Brian Riley: Because if I don't do it.

200
00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:17.940
Brian Riley: I fucking hate myself. So then I'm going to fix that by fucking making myself do it like I have to do that.

201
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.490
Helena Rouhe: Or you're in a power struggle.

202
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.440
Brian Riley: And guess

203
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:34.230
Brian Riley: Because, and this, and this goes back to what we were talking about last time. Like if I fucking get an inch. I'll take a mile. And so then I'll fall fucking I, you know, and it's like I have to be

204
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.170
Helena Rouhe: I mean, I thought, why not

205
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:46.470
Helena Rouhe: Check on a bigger. I mean, so we're still kind of pushing on a string here, you know, reacting the symptoms as opposed to the bigger picture, which is

206
00:35:47.100 --> 00:36:01.890
Helena Rouhe: Maybe you're tired, you know, like maybe there's other reasons why you're not doing something that day. Why does it have to be do this or else you know give yourself an inch. You take a mile. I mean, this is all really negative judgmental reactionary stuff that you're having here.

207
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.590
Brian Riley: Good tired to what you know.

208
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:14.460
Helena Rouhe: Well, I mean, tired, you're tired. I mean, I don't you still

209
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:29.850
Helena Rouhe: I guess what I, what is your biggest fear about all of this that you're just going to somehow turn into a little slots in the side of the corner and just shut down completely. You're not going to be able to do your job as far as managing the dog thing, you're not going to be able to

210
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:36.270
Brian Riley: Let me know. So there's zero concern about the dog. Okay.

211
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.160
Helena Rouhe: Well then. So what I mean.

212
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:54.660
Helena Rouhe: The whole point of creativity is that you give it space to be what it needs to be. So that means that they're going to be times when you're super creative and it feels like it's almost 24 seven

213
00:36:55.020 --> 00:37:05.730
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and then they're going to be times when it's going to be barely anything. And that's part of the process. And if you're trying to regiment creativity. You're always going to fail me not to be an ass but

214
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.450
Brian Riley: That's always going to be a challenge.

215
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:17.310
Brian Riley: Because I mean, I've seen again and again like writers or whoever always say that, you know,

216
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:27.210
Brian Riley: Every day, you do not feel fucking creative and brilliant every day. And that's when it comes down to labor and that's when it comes down to discipline.

217
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.330
Brian Riley: So you do it regardless

218
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:36.870
Helena Rouhe: Why well i think i mean i get that I've certainly heard that, but

219
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.830
Helena Rouhe: I just think that for your personality that's going to set you up for

220
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.420
Helena Rouhe: Problems.

221
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.250
Yeah, I

222
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.390
Helena Rouhe: Mean, you're already struggling with it.

223
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:57.930
Brian Riley: Oh, is really, I just really wanted to come to a thing where I'm as happy with.

224
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:00.990
Brian Riley: It's a daily

225
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.050
Brian Riley: Daily and I

226
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.200
Brian Riley: Don't have an expectation of what

227
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.920
Brian Riley: That's part of my life, I guess, right.

228
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:27.930
Helena Rouhe: Exactly. I think you're always going to be a bidding day because that's your very nature. Yeah, I think that's the thing that kind of drives you so you want to be not angsty, I think that over time you'll just you're less saying, See now than you were a year ago. Yeah.

229
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:33.120
Helena Rouhe: So, I mean, over time, it's going to settle down and until then.

230
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:49.080
Helena Rouhe: You just got to trust the process and you know maybe instead of being dropped dead. You have to do it every day, maybe look at once a week mean if you're, you know, if you really sit down and you're struggling that week. Why does it have to be

231
00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:58.530
Helena Rouhe: You know, yes or no. Do this, or else you know, anytime you get into a power struggle with yourself, you're setting yourself up for failure. It's like

232
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.190
Helena Rouhe: You know, Esther, Lisa. Now I've got

233
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:17.130
Helena Rouhe: Thing off kind of attitude. You know, you don't. You didn't do that. So it's the same kind of thing of, oh, I'm not feeling this today. Well, it's okay to not feel it today, but that also doesn't mean you need to never feel it again.

234
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:32.310
Helena Rouhe: Like if you take a break for a day or a week. Now, if you have a few have a deadline for something that's different, but if these are just projects that you're working on or working towards something then respect the process a little bit

235
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.780
Brian Riley: Well, I guess what I am.

236
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.620
Helena Rouhe: Very nature.

237
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.370
Brian Riley: What I what I fear is that

238
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.810
Brian Riley: I've always

239
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.790
Brian Riley: Not always. Well, yeah, it's, it's been like, there's been

240
00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.560
Brian Riley: You know the show or

241
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.870
Brian Riley: The fucking

242
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:05.370
Brian Riley: Yeah, like the the event or the, you know, I know that there's not

243
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:08.760
Brian Riley: I just I think with

244
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:28.230
Brian Riley: And I always think about my, my friends and people I've known through the years, who completely stop and just let it go, and all those dreams and it's okay. I think it's just a slight fear that I will just

245
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.170
Brian Riley: Which is the

246
00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:35.970
Brian Riley: Chance to

247
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.590
Brian Riley: Like, I mean I physically and mentally cannot like whenever I'm

248
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:53.100
Brian Riley: Watching anything or there's inspiration and I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do with it. But it's you know it's there. And so I must do something with it and i like i know i must create

249
00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:59.850
Brian Riley: Hold on. This woman is here. Let me just, I got to what mushy Nico Nico look

250
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.180
Helena Rouhe: Oh, Qt

251
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.260
Brian Riley: Really nice.

252
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.420
Helena Rouhe: Yeah. Wow.

253
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.580
Brian Riley: So there's mountains here. Hold on one second. Okay.

254
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.120
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

255
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.080
Brian Riley: Okay, so yeah, you've helped

256
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.560
Brian Riley: So,

257
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.260
Brian Riley: You know, and I always think of

258
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.890
Brian Riley: You know, you said this thing one time.

259
00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.490
Brian Riley: And I always think of it when

260
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:28.530
Brian Riley: You know, like I've never done this long term. So, and I really just don't know what to expect, you know and and

261
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:34.170
Brian Riley: I've been actually wrote it down earlier as the thing that burn, you know, as they do.

262
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.090
Brian Riley: Just have to try to have just really

263
00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.930
Brian Riley: This is kind of a letter saying I

264
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:50.190
Brian Riley: Have zero expectations, except for what's expected of me.

265
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:54.060
Helena Rouhe: Like it

266
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:55.380
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

267
00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.660
Brian Riley: Yeah, I'm trying to. That's right.

268
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:09.690
Helena Rouhe: So maybe you need to have that written down somewhere, something will you can refer to that on a regular basis to see you have the visual accountability to it. Yeah.

269
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:12.540
Yeah.

270
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:24.780
Brian Riley: Other than that I received a real real nice letter. And I got to reply to her handwritten letter.

271
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:27.480
Brian Riley: With

272
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:33.180
Brian Riley: She knows

273
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.500
Brian Riley: I was dying.

274
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:41.880
Brian Riley: With all these

275
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.490
Brian Riley: For scripts prescriptions.

276
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:46.740
Brian Riley: She gave me

277
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:51.150
Brian Riley: She wrote up this individual.

278
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:52.920
Brian Riley: You

279
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:56.820
Helena Rouhe: Know,

280
00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.020
Brian Riley: She was sure the new

281
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:09.690
Brian Riley: Would you know but she knew I would be freaking out. And so she dated these scriptures stack of prescription for my medications funny.

282
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.120
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, and

283
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.010
Brian Riley: Yeah, there's great

284
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:16.020
Brian Riley: saga.

285
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.070
Brian Riley: And

286
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.640
Brian Riley: Other than that, I'm trying

287
00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.270
Brian Riley: To be a fucking man about this and

288
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:44.460
Brian Riley: It's ruining my little vacation. Here I fucking don't like that men's me. I don't like I don't want to go. I don't want to go with, and it's

289
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.150
Brian Riley: Been

290
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:58.920
Brian Riley: But the fucking one of my sponsor wants me to be my home group. And these are the guys that saved his life and he's the fucking Secretary at the thing and he's insisting I go and so

291
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:06.000
Brian Riley: That we talked about this. I think maybe you know I was with Dr. Waters, I went

292
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:13.230
Brian Riley: After the relapse. This last time suck, because I had to raise my hand.

293
00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:15.030
Brian Riley: And

294
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:17.760
Brian Riley: It's not in my head.

295
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.820
Brian Riley: You know, and I can't talk to my sponsor about it because it's in my head.

296
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.540
Brian Riley: And the judging from

297
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:29.040
Brian Riley: Fuel

298
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.790
Brian Riley: Oh, and they just did.

299
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:39.660
Brian Riley: And it was like I got out of it. So quick because I was gonna, I was gonna

300
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.730
Brian Riley: If anybody said fucking stupid, stupid thing.

301
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:52.020
Brian Riley: It's just there's certain personality types that I don't care for in there.

302
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.900
Brian Riley: And a good number of America.

303
00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.110
Brian Riley: And

304
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.180
Brian Riley: He there was no question about it. I'm going tonight.

305
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:14.430
Brian Riley: Chill out

306
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.840
Helena Rouhe: What, what do we do to manage impossible situation.

307
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.670
Brian Riley: I just fucking there's a ton of it now. What would, what do you

308
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.110
Helena Rouhe: What do you do to manage impossible situations when you

309
00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:47.130
Helena Rouhe: Find yourself really irritated. You tell me. Do you breathe, do you, what do you do to kind of manage something super annoying. Okay, so lots of deep breathing. Find the positive, even if it's really small. You're alive, you're breathing.

310
00:47:51.900 --> 00:48:00.000
Helena Rouhe: Me, it's going to come down to, you know, really small things in order to keep yourself engaged in the process. So you don't just fixate on the negative

311
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:10.320
Helena Rouhe: Because fixating on the negative doesn't isn't going to make it any different for you.

312
00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:18.120
Brian Riley: Yeah.

313
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:22.980
Brian Riley: Yeah, some

314
00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:26.880
Brian Riley: Things.

315
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:29.640
Brian Riley: I

316
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.650
Brian Riley: Surprised myself.

317
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:38.400
Brian Riley: With this and

318
00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.150
Brian Riley: I'm trying not to overthink live done it.

319
00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.180
Brian Riley: But it's helped I

320
00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:56.130
Brian Riley: For really from the beginning. During the day, walking dogs in between trips I listened to.

321
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.050
Brian Riley: And it's come, it's more complex than

322
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.620
Brian Riley: In the beginning, I listened to it.

323
00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:15.270
Brian Riley: Out of just shock and then I listened to it for a fuller picture of everything. And now I

324
00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.150
Brian Riley: I admire him.

325
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:30.390
Brian Riley: And it has really changed. I think it's given me a broader on. I've never been political

326
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:38.100
Brian Riley: I've never been a feeling of a part of the society and over whatever but I listened to fuckin worshipping

327
00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:40.170
Brian Riley: And

328
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:49.470
Brian Riley: After him there's basically talk radio it's it's it's low on the dial FM Todd talks.

329
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.970
Brian Riley: And so it's news every half hour.

330
00:49:55.500 --> 00:50:08.400
Brian Riley: And it was getting pretty fucking crazy. There was, I was at a stoplight and every day. The virus was getting more and was like a horror film.

331
00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:30.090
Brian Riley: Again and again and again it was that scene where it's on the radio and are talking about the corn in and with, you know, you know, and I'm there was a guy in a mask fucking face mask pedestrian no mask and it was like it all came together as horrifying reality.

332
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:31.500
Brian Riley: And

333
00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.990
Brian Riley: So I stopped listening I drive it sounds

334
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.350
Brian Riley: Or I drive with

335
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:43.320
Brian Riley: Music that I like.

336
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:48.480
Brian Riley: That gets me creatively. I've been doing a lot of visual

337
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:49.830
Helena Rouhe: Okay.

338
00:50:50.460 --> 00:51:03.810
Brian Riley: Which I used to do. Years ago for screenplays specifically working whatever I can see scenes and the whole thing and I would develop things around that and I've been doing that and actually playing Eric

339
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:20.010
Brian Riley: And I pulled out an old thing from LA, and I made a playlist. And I just, just sort of like developing this project like driving and

340
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:26.640
Brian Riley: I don't know what the fuck is going on. I know in the world. That's it. I've shut it out.

341
00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:33.390
Brian Riley: I don't know. I don't know where the viruses. I don't know the status of

342
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.940
Brian Riley: I'm I imagine the one time that I turned it back on.

343
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:46.830
Brian Riley: The synchronicity was insane. It was the governor of California announcing its states state of emergency.

344
00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:54.630
Brian Riley: We're losing business.

345
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.230
Brian Riley: People's travels or they cancelled or changed. I

346
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.900
Brian Riley: Used to I used to be really, really scared of potential viruses stuff, you know,

347
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.900
Brian Riley: And I think that's part of it and

348
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:12.270
Brian Riley: I'm in denial

349
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:24.330
Helena Rouhe: Even as well. So we've gotten ramped up a little bit on the whole power struggle control thing because you're feeling a little bit overwhelmed by the environment right now so

350
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:32.310
Helena Rouhe: Getting kind of crank step on your internal environment and kind of exerting more control on that because that feels like you have something to do or say

351
00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.560
Brian Riley: Yeah, that's

352
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.220
Brian Riley: So interesting

353
00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:52.380
Yeah.

354
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:54.390
Brian Riley: It feels like

355
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:01.110
Brian Riley: It's a balance.

356
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.770
Brian Riley: And I refused to struggle, keeping it felt

357
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.660
Brian Riley: Like, I'm not going to fight to keep

358
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.590
Brian Riley: The balance. I'm going to

359
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.170
Brian Riley: Understand

360
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.480
Brian Riley: That

361
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:34.770
Brian Riley: There is a balance and when it is off balance. I'm going to look at my partner.

362
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.800
Brian Riley: If I have a partner, it will

363
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.740
Brian Riley: Own that and

364
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:43.890
Brian Riley: Do my part in

365
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.770
Brian Riley: reestablishing the balance.

366
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.580
Brian Riley: But otherwise, I'm not going to suffer.

367
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.340
Brian Riley: And I'm not going to fight.

368
00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:00.780
Brian Riley: It, you know, and that's that's it all comes down to turning it over and acceptance.

369
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.030
Helena Rouhe: All that, you know,

370
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.420
Right.

371
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:08.760
Brian Riley: Yeah, it's good.

372
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.660
Brian Riley: I've been meditating. I've been trying to do everything was still at like warm

373
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:17.820
Okay.

374
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.340
Brian Riley: It's just sitting quiet and breathing. Yeah, that's good.

375
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.140
Brian Riley: That's a big deal or

376
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:26.730
And

377
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:30.900
Helena Rouhe: I like it.

378
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.980
Helena Rouhe: So can we talk about group for a second.

379
00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:35.640
Yeah.

380
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:45.990
Helena Rouhe: So Dr. Waters, because she's leaving, we are transferring people over to the next available, Doc, who is great. It's Dr. Debbie

381
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:59.550
Helena Rouhe: PACHTER and I worked with him since the beginning. And he's fantastic he cannot hear what he has other things going on on Wednesday. So we have to move the group to Mondays at seven.

382
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.950
Brian Riley: OK. OK.

383
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:10.650
Helena Rouhe: That's actually starting next week. So I do have group tomorrow, but he but then we'll switch the group over to Mondays at seven.

384
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:12.210
So,

385
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:14.340
Brian Riley: Good.

386
00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:32.640
Helena Rouhe: You can still see i think that at some point staff is going to reach out for you to meet Dr. PACHTER so that you guys can meet each other and he can get a sense of your situation and follow up with all of your needs. So I'm not saying that you have to come to group either

387
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.390
Helena Rouhe: Tomorrow, or even Monday, but whenever you are, you know,

388
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.760
Helena Rouhe: You'll probably be meeting with him. Pretty soon.

389
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.220
Helena Rouhe: If they haven't reached out to you already, they will. And the next, you know, couple of weeks you'll meet with him.

390
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:53.520
Helena Rouhe: So just know that the group is going to be starting on Mondays at seven o'clock and he'll be there. So you're welcome to

391
00:55:54.090 --> 00:56:05.490
Helena Rouhe: Meet him next week. If you don't already have an individual session set up with him, or you can wait till the individual session if you're good, which sounds like you're good on meds. I know Dr. Waters willing to make sure you're squared away.

392
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:13.260
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, so if that's not a big concern, then you can also wait until you meet with them for an individual session and then join group. It's totally up to you.

393
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:19.470
Brian Riley: Okay, I think I'm fairly sure no I didn't write it down. But I'm fairly sure that we have a

394
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.520
Brian Riley: couple's session with Sean and

395
00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:32.790
Helena Rouhe: And that's why I didn't want to say this is something you have to do right now because I wanted to be, you know, good with the whole situation so

396
00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:39.780
Brian Riley: Okay. So in the end, you're saying that I'm going to hear from him, regardless

397
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.580
Helena Rouhe: In the end, I'm saying that you're going to hear from staff.

398
00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.920
Brian Riley: To set up an appointment to meet with him.

399
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.670
Helena Rouhe: Alright, cool. And if you already have a conflict with

400
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:51.120
Brian Riley: Group.

401
00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:57.540
Helena Rouhe: FOR MONDAY THE 16th and don't worry about the 16th, but maybe put it on your calendar for the following week, which is

402
00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:00.420
Helena Rouhe: Probably the

403
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:02.850
Helena Rouhe: 2030

404
00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:03.810
Okay.

405
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:06.990
Brian Riley: Okay, what time

406
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:08.940
Helena Rouhe: 7pm.

407
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:16.800
Brian Riley: Okay. All right. And then when do you want to meet again.

408
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.410
Helena Rouhe: So we can do that.

409
00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:35.400
Helena Rouhe: So if you have a couple special with Sean next week and

410
00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:47.280
Helena Rouhe: While we we've been doing it every three weeks, right, that every three weeks. So three weeks from we're going to be literal about that three weeks from today would be the 31st. Okay.

411
00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:50.730
Helena Rouhe: So we can do that that work. Yeah.

412
00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.080
Brian Riley: And

413
00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.580
Brian Riley: It's

414
00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:55.920
Brian Riley: Fine.

Helena Rouhe: I can do six

418
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:05.640
Brian Riley: Okay, let's do it. Okay.

Helena Rouhe: At 7pm.

423
00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:40.680
Helena Rouhe: Okay, and then you should be hearing from staffs in to kind of set up a time to meet with our factor if you don't hear from them. By the end of this week, then I would go ahead and ask them, or maybe when you check in for your session was shot on the 16th.

424
00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:54.420
Helena Rouhe: You can ask them if they have them if they can set up an appointment with you to meet with Dr. Factor and they don't need to do it right then. But just as something to put in everybody's he'll

425
00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:55.860
