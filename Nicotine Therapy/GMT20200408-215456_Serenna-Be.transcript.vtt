00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.920
Serenna Beers: They're traveling for business or

2
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.480
Serenna Beers: Hi there.

3
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.440
Christina Frazee: Hi.

4
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.880
Serenna Beers: How are you today.

5
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.060
Serenna Beers: All right. Yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.440
Serenna Beers: Um, tell me, I know we completed your bio psychosocial and this is just our first initial meeting right

7
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.280
Christina Frazee: Right.

8
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.620
Serenna Beers: Right. Okay. Why don't you kind of just share with me kind of what's been happening with you over the last week.

9
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.930
Christina Frazee: A lot of

10
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.730
Christina Frazee: I don't know. I want to let downs, I guess.

11
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:15.780
Christina Frazee: I've just been having a really hard time because with everything with the coronavirus and like, you know, stay at home stuff and you know I haven't been able to see my kids.

12
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.610
Christina Frazee: At all, like, I'm supposed to have them every other weekend. Now, not even having that is just really hard and I

13
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.020
Christina Frazee: I've been calling mediation and I finally got ahold of them just the, you know, be let down that

14
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:43.530
Christina Frazee: Pretty much. There's nothing I can do. Unless I want to file paperwork and take them to court. But the courts aren't open. So it's just hard. I'm trying to deal with that and everything going on.

15
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.210
Serenna Beers: So how are you dealing with it.

16
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.070
Christina Frazee: I've been really just

17
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.110
Christina Frazee: questioning why I even bother.

18
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.630
Christina Frazee: Doing going to work or getting up in the morning, you know, just the way to pass.

19
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.480
Serenna Beers: Okay.

20
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:16.980
Serenna Beers: Have you talked to your doctor about that remind me. Who's your is it Katrina groves, is it

21
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.670
Christina Frazee: Yeah, she's, she's who I see through for Suboxone for my groups.

22
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.420
Christina Frazee: And then

23
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.660
Christina Frazee: My primary physician is Dr. Peter

24
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.560
Christina Frazee: I actually have an appointment with her tomorrow.

25
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.760
Serenna Beers: Oh, good.

26
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.720
Christina Frazee: But it's only on the phone because they're not taking client any patients.

27
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.210
Christina Frazee: Because of the whole thing. So it's going to be weird because

28
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.500
I'm

29
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:56.460
Christina Frazee: Like it's been two days. Now I broke out, and I have this like the blistering on my nose. So I don't know how I'm going to describe that over the phone to her, but I have an appointment with Dr. Peter tomorrow at 10 over the phone so

30
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.650
Serenna Beers: Is it so it's just a telephone call it isn't like a zoom

31
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.780
Christina Frazee: No, it's just a telephone call.

32
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.530
Okay.

33
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.380
Serenna Beers: Well, I mean that they're having to kind of change their practices, a little bit. I mean, as long as you're, you know,

34
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:25.020
Serenna Beers: I would imagine that there's probably things that that that they can do. And I would imagine that there's certain things that that they're going to trust you more.

35
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:35.730
Serenna Beers: You know with because if she can't see you. And if there's something going on with you i mean i i can't imagine that they don't have a backup plan.

36
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.810
Christina Frazee: But

37
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.510
Serenna Beers: What I would hope that you're going to kind of share with her, though, is that it is it a her or him.

38
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.020
Serenna Beers: Or her. Okay, is that you're going to share with her. Some of the depression and even if it's sit

39
00:03:49.890 --> 00:04:10.380
Serenna Beers: Situational that you're open with with her about it because what what we don't want to see is for you to go backwards and to kind of go down that rabbit hole because depression is very real. And it can be just as you know as heart heart harmful to you, you know, as anything else.

40
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:23.130
Christina Frazee: Yeah, thanks. Like, I know that because I'm supposed to be taking medication, I haven't been taking it. So that's kind of like maybe self sabotage or whatever.

41
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:35.520
Christina Frazee: I know she's going to tell me to start taking my medication. Again, but it's just once you get stuck. It's kind of hard to dig yourself a hole, you know. Yeah.

42
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.320
Serenna Beers: So, so you were on medication for that.

43
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.640
Yeah.

44
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.020
And

45
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.470
Serenna Beers: What did you take, if you don't mind me asking

46
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:54.690
Serenna Beers: All off. Okay. Did you find that that was that that that that helped though.

47
00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:03.450
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay, what would you be, you know, open to that, maybe even if it was for short, short term.

48
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.890
Christina Frazee: Yeah, it's just, um, I know that I should be taking my meds and you really need to

49
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.830
Christina Frazee: Focus on getting back into a routine of picking my meds every day on time.

50
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.900
Christina Frazee: I'm like I said with depression, you just

51
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.590
Christina Frazee: Don't know. It's just really hard to just

52
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:36.270
Christina Frazee: even want to do better. Like I said, like I just feel like, what's the point of doing better just but I know that's just negative thinking and stuff. I just

53
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.140
Christina Frazee: Once I am only meant they feel so much better. It's just

54
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.690
Christina Frazee: I don't know, it's kind of a setback, you know, not being able to see my kids and stuff.

55
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.380
Serenna Beers: Well, for one, I just want to validate the fact that I mean that's not a small thing.

56
00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:08.220
Serenna Beers: Christina. That is a huge thing especially you know as a mom, your kids are your entire world and you didn't put in all this work to have them when you can have them just to have it stopped and whether it's, you know,

57
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:20.730
Serenna Beers: The fact that it's beyond your control probably makes it really harder. I mean, quite honestly. And so what you don't want to do though is lose sight of

58
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:41.190
Serenna Beers: Of the main goal. And that's definitely not to go backwards, right. So then what do you do in the meantime to take, take care of yourself. So is there anything that you know that you can do. I mean, deep depression. I just want you to know, you know,

59
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:50.610
Serenna Beers: It's been a while since I've had it so severely that it was debilitating, but I do understand about depression. There's times when

60
00:06:50.970 --> 00:07:02.580
Serenna Beers: DVD oppression and and it's it's weird. You might have good good days with it and then you when you have the the bad days with it you know unless you have been through it. You really don't

61
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:10.890
Serenna Beers: Understand, because to most it's like oh geez, just get up and smile or just, you know, people don't understand

62
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:20.880
Serenna Beers: Yeah, there's no smiling when you feel that low. There's no just oh let's just, you know, put our big girl panties on. I mean, there's none of that.

63
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:33.090
Serenna Beers: It is so immobilising and so do you know things. I mean, do you, do you know yourself well enough to know what you could potentially do. Is there anything that does help.

64
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.310
Christina Frazee: Um,

65
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:50.850
Christina Frazee: No, I just try and make it through the day, you know, and it is hard because people that haven't had it or don't have it distinct like oh, you're just sad, but that's not it at all, you know,

66
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.370
Christina Frazee: I just

67
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.970
Christina Frazee: It's just literally like every single day. I'm just like, don't give up today, you know,

68
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:11.310
Serenna Beers: And do you do you feel suicidal at all. And I have to ask that you you understand right

69
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.190
Christina Frazee: I understand. I know I don't. It's more of just a feeling like

70
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.040
Serenna Beers: Hopeless little bit

71
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.150
Yeah.

72
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.870
Serenna Beers: Like, what's the point in trying when the end result isn't really what I want anyway.

73
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.370
Christina Frazee: Yeah, and

74
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.580
Christina Frazee: I'm trying to get caught up in the moment, like I

75
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:47.490
Christina Frazee: It's it's weird because you try and stay in the moment and stay present but then there's also the reverse side of it, like the dark side of it. Like you just get so caught up in the middle like you just think that there's no

76
00:08:48.540 --> 00:09:01.140
Christina Frazee: Happy ending and I need to just tell myself, you know, this isn't forever that I, you know, in the future, when this is all gone. I can get my kids back but it's hard to see that light at the end of the tunnel, you know, I mean,

77
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:11.670
Serenna Beers: Do you well. It's that sense of impending doom and there is nothing more terrifying than that sense of impending doom.

78
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.610
Serenna Beers: Yeah, that does that make sense.

79
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.560
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

80
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.910
Serenna Beers: Are you able to to talk, talk with your kids.

81
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.130
Christina Frazee: Yeah, but

82
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:31.380
Serenna Beers: I mean, I, I know it's not the same thing. I just didn't know if you were at least at minimum able to like talk talk with them.

83
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:40.080
Christina Frazee: Yeah, it's just hard because like I haven't talked to him in a couple days like I can talk to them every night, but then when I talked to him on the phone.

84
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.300
Christina Frazee: Like it might just be me, but I feel like the

85
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.880
Christina Frazee: Just don't even want to talk to me because it's just the same thing again, like I love you. I miss you and it's just

86
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.540
Christina Frazee: I just feel like they're just over it.

87
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.600
Serenna Beers: How, what are their ages.

88
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.760
Christina Frazee: 11 and eight.

89
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.220
Serenna Beers: Have you tried things like

90
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:32.190
Serenna Beers: Googling what to talk to kids about what to I mean there's i mean the the internet can really be a plethora of information. And when you just kind of run out of things to like talk about, like, like I have this I have this book, so I have a 10 year old and I have this book and it's called

91
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.940
Serenna Beers: Infinite questions to ask your kids and and there are things like

92
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.800
Serenna Beers: I'm trying to think of where I put that book.

93
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:58.950
Serenna Beers: So that I so that I could I could let you see it, things like if you had a choice between telling a lie, or telling the truth. Even if you hurt someone.

94
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:09.150
Serenna Beers: What choice would you make and why. And you may not want to share that that one, but I'm I was just trying to think of an example of one. Another one was

95
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.390
Serenna Beers: If you could be anybody in the whole world, what would you be and why. And it's just kind of a fun game.

96
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:23.760
Serenna Beers: Because especially in this technology age, you know, where it seems like kids are so hyper focused on lots of different things other than like

97
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:32.370
Serenna Beers: Their parents or other than like socializing. It just kind of opens up a like like a community cation.

98
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:43.020
Serenna Beers: What if you were to draw them a picture or something and say, You know what, I was just so bored today because I missed you. This is what I drew you and this is why. So this is me.

99
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:51.780
Serenna Beers: You would be amazed at how you might be, be able to generate a different kind of a conversation that maybe you never had.

100
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.390
Serenna Beers: Out of doing something different.

101
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.700
Serenna Beers: Yeah, you know what I mean.

102
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:04.800
Christina Frazee: It would be easier if I could do like FaceTime with them or whatever, but it's just a regular phone call. And so it's this kind of hard. You know,

103
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.440
Serenna Beers: Is there a reason why you can't do that.

104
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.630
Serenna Beers: A FaceTime CALL.

105
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:17.460
Christina Frazee: Do because I don't know, I tried talking to their dad, a few days ago.

106
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:29.010
Christina Frazee: And I just, I asked him, you know, if we could do FaceTime, and then you just started yelling at me and then I just ended up coming out. We just got frustrated. But, um, I don't know, I just

107
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.200
Christina Frazee: It's just frustrating.

108
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.690
Serenna Beers: Um,

109
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:50.190
Serenna Beers: Is it possible for for you just to shoot him a very generic text like hey, just checking in with with you to see if it's possible to do a FaceTime CALL smiley face. It's all

110
00:12:50.910 --> 00:13:01.410
Serenna Beers: If not fine, but I, of course, I, I just want to ask almost letting him know that you're aware, he has the power, but just so that you can maybe

111
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:12.630
Serenna Beers: Just check in with him so he knows that you still are here, but you're not going anywhere that you're very interested and maybe maybe just meet them meet him at a

112
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:29.490
Serenna Beers: At a MEET. MEET THEM IN THE MIDDLE with it there as because if you're on the phone with them. It's kind of like he's on the spot. Maybe if you send them a text. Maybe he might think about it. I mean, I'm just trying to throw out options.

113
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.050
Serenna Beers: I

114
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:39.120
Serenna Beers: Come from a very similar background as far as I it. I had to fight to get my kids back

115
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:46.500
Serenna Beers: And I dealt with my ex husband whom had a had all the cards I wasn't allowed to call them. I wasn't allowed to say I love you for so long.

116
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:56.910
Serenna Beers: And I dealt with that, like, kind of control where he had all the power for two years, Christina two solid years almost to the day

117
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:03.720
Serenna Beers: And they weren't even allowed to leave with me, even to go to ice cream. I had to come visit them at his house and

118
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:11.940
Serenna Beers: And I'm sharing this with you, not, not because I don't understand. I'm sharing this with you because I empathize because I have been where you're at.

119
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:27.330
Serenna Beers: And it's very frustrating, especially when you're honestly trying your very best. And so how do you, how do you not get discouraged because you know your babies need you to keep fighting.

120
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:28.800
Christina Frazee: You know,

121
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:51.450
Serenna Beers: Your they need. They need you to keep fighting. Even when you feel like you don't want want to. So, you know, get upset and maybe you know vent with me or event with your you know someone that you're close with but don't give the power to your, to your

122
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.960
Serenna Beers: Kids his dad because it sounds like he's too.

123
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.280
Serenna Beers: Immature to really can't handle your emotions.

124
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.890
Serenna Beers: Yeah, you know what I mean.

125
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.870
Christina Frazee: Yeah, and he makes it seem like

126
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.800
Christina Frazee: He doesn't know why I'm bothering him and like

127
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.950
Christina Frazee: I don't, it's just

128
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.570
Christina Frazee: I don't know. This is a hard thing to deal with the hell of it is

129
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:18.900
Like

130
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:31.170
Christina Frazee: It's like my kids are my whole life and my whole reason for living. And then once that's taken away your reason for living. You know, it's kind of hard to go on from

131
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:33.780
Christina Frazee: So,

132
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.480
Serenna Beers: I, I want to give you some facts.

133
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:45.900
Serenna Beers: Even though it feels like it's been taken away the fact is it's just been stopped it hasn't been taken away. Correct.

134
00:15:47.100 --> 00:16:02.580
Serenna Beers: Very important that you understand that because if you turn that that statement that it's been taken away into a fact in your mind that can cause you to be emotionally reactive, which is not going to help you. Right.

135
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:10.620
Serenna Beers: So the fact of the matter is, is it's been stopped. Does it suck. That's probably put putting it lightly.

136
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:27.720
Serenna Beers: Especially because of the fact that your kids are your whole world. So what do you do now that you don't have them with you. So what are you going to do to manage to that anxiety and that overwhelming sense of loss because that's what it is, what can you do

137
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.370
Christina Frazee: Yeah.

138
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.650
Serenna Beers: I'm asking you.

139
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.610
Christina Frazee: I keep telling myself like I keep saying, I need to journal. I'm

140
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:55.530
Christina Frazee: Even if it's like writing letters to them so that later on when I do have them. They can see like me. I tried calling you and he wouldn't let me talk to you again and I'm just thinking about you guys that we I'm like getting it out.

141
00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:07.050
Christina Frazee: And then when I have them. They can see like all this times they thought about them and all the times I woke up crying because I didn't have the next me and you know that we're getting our faces.

142
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:22.830
Christina Frazee: I just need to be proactive about stuff instead of saying, Do it cuz I know just help out, you know, and I need to stop negative thinking because it's just a downward spiral.

143
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:32.040
Serenna Beers: So why don't you and I, I'm not going to overwhelm you. But let's just set to specific very positive.

144
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:49.230
Serenna Beers: Healthy goals that have to do with one year depression and to just establishing that reap that sustaining that connection that you've built and the, the, the, the progress that you've made with your kids.

145
00:17:52.290 --> 00:18:02.130
Serenna Beers: So that it so that that's not stopped and and and you brought up a very valid point which, mind you, is very effective letters to your kids are very effective.

146
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:13.410
Serenna Beers: I know that from experience. It's amazing. You would be amazed at what that would do for them if they knew that their mom while they've been apart.

147
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:27.660
Serenna Beers: Thought about them and look so much so that she drew them a little picture. Make a mini star card. I mean, that probably sounds really silly, but to 11 and an eight year old. That's probably going to just be huge.

148
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.640
Serenna Beers: Yeah, you know,

149
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:30.720
Christina Frazee: Yeah.

150
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.630
Serenna Beers: So what's one specific thing that you

151
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.640
Serenna Beers: That you can do to help you manage through your depression.

152
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.320
Christina Frazee: I need to start taking my meds, like starting tonight. Okay.

153
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:50.130
Serenna Beers: Medication. So you're committing to trying to follow through with that goal, right.

154
00:18:50.520 --> 00:19:01.590
Serenna Beers: Yes. Okay. And then I'll follow up with you about this because it's funny when when we know we're accountable to someone, it's kind of we have more likelihood to follow through.

155
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:09.810
Serenna Beers: And along with battling the symptoms of depression there. There's not a lot of follow through. Unless there's accountability.

156
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:16.860
Serenna Beers: A task. So kind of look at it as I'm trying to be your accountability partner to right now. Okay, so you're agreeing

157
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.810
Serenna Beers: That starting tonight, you are going to take your medication. Right. Yes. Okay.

158
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:36.000
Serenna Beers: Now, what about something that you can do so that way you feel that you haven't lost control with your kids. What's something that you can do in this time where you can't be with them that you that you can still work on

159
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.720
Serenna Beers: building that relationship with them.

160
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.830
Christina Frazee: I think I'm just writing it down.

161
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:50.910
Christina Frazee: Maybe every night like when I do take my meds right a little bit, um,

162
00:19:51.540 --> 00:20:05.700
Serenna Beers: Can I hang on really quick. Can I place you on hold. I gotta grab my door because I just moved into my new place, and I just need to make sure that I can have them fix something that's broken. Okay, hang on real

163
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:06.990
Okay.

164
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.660
Serenna Beers: Hello.

165
00:20:49.410 --> 00:21:03.570
Serenna Beers: Hello, I am so sorry. I just moved into my new place. And so I didn't want my daughter to answer the door. So thank you. OK. So number two if if if you could go back to the beginning of that.

166
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:09.300
Christina Frazee: And just write a little bit every night. That way I'm kind of

167
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.260
Christina Frazee: Getting it out of my head.

168
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.270
Christina Frazee: My head.

169
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.750
Christina Frazee: Even if it's just

170
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:27.810
Christina Frazee: Even if I can't write a whole bunch or, you know, right, if they're not writing a letter to my kids are writing on feeling just even if I just write down

171
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.780
Christina Frazee: This isn't forever, you know,

172
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:37.290
Christina Frazee: Something little like to kind of remind myself you know that it's not going to be forever.

173
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:51.990
Serenna Beers: Okay. And so here's what I'm going to do for the accountability piece. Okay. Because it's real easy. If you think, Gosh, I don't even know how I feel. Because when especially when you struggle with depression and or anxiety.

174
00:21:53.250 --> 00:22:02.130
Serenna Beers: It's hard to kind of, it's kind of difficult to at times to really decipher what you feel, because you feel like this is kind of like this, right.

175
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:12.000
Serenna Beers: So, just so that you can commit to starting to write every single night. Even if you only write down three things you're grateful for every day.

176
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:21.750
Serenna Beers: you at least need to write that. So even if you don't write, you know, hey, I feel really like crap today. But I know things are going to get better. But, you know, whatever.

177
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.780
Serenna Beers: Even if you don't have anything to write. I want you to commit to writing at least three

178
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.180
Serenna Beers: Things you're grateful for every day because

179
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:42.930
Serenna Beers: An attitude of gratitude. I mean, knowing that you're grateful for things, even in the smallest things like like you have a roof over your head. That's huge. You know what, there's lots of folks out there right now that that that don't

180
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:53.460
Serenna Beers: If you have food, food in your fridge, you're very lucky. The fact that you are sober and you get to see your kids. There's lots of parents moms and dads that have screwed.

181
00:22:53.790 --> 00:23:09.570
Serenna Beers: It up so bad that they don't ever get to see them again, that's not you. Right, right. The purpose of really understanding or or identifying what you're grateful for, is because then it helps you to really see gosh

182
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:17.670
Serenna Beers: It sucks right now, but maybe I really don't have it as bad as I'm telling myself that I have it because our mind. Oh my goodness.

183
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:34.560
Serenna Beers: If you want to see something funny so i i posted this on my Facebook, the other day, because it's so funny because even after all this time abstaining from out from alcohol and drugs. I still have that come that that

184
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:42.720
Serenna Beers: Mini where I'm you know I live in fear. All of a sudden, I'm overly zealous happy like everything's

185
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:56.580
Serenna Beers: Like, everything's good life is so great. Like that crazy almost euphoric high on life. And then I'm in fear and then I'm mad, and then I'm missing that but there's this video and it's juggling the Jenkins, where it's

186
00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:57.510
Christina Frazee: Her

187
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.240
Serenna Beers: Oh, I know she's got what she if you look up

188
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:16.470
Serenna Beers: Can I see juggling the Jenkins, the committee, it'll show her as and she represents like motivation, insomnia, fear, oh my gosh, it is so classic and it really just makes you think

189
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:26.910
Serenna Beers: Wow, this is really like kind of what my head is like every day and you're really not that far off from the rest of the world you you really aren't. It's just

190
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:39.870
Serenna Beers: folks that have kind of struggled with anxiety, depression, addiction. We just talked about it more everybody else kind of holds it in. We just are open with the world about it. Right.

191
00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:45.930
Serenna Beers: But it really does put things into into perspective of how we can literally

192
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:57.090
Serenna Beers: Let our mind take over and will spin us out right we small thing and make it big, or take a big thing and make it small. And it's really about perspective.

193
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:04.620
Serenna Beers: Which my point is, is if you can always figure out what it is that you're grateful for.

194
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:14.490
Serenna Beers: It kind of helps you to take those things and really put them into perspective so that they don't consume you and create even more.

195
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:35.940
Serenna Beers: Difficulty for you to manage your everyday life. You know what I mean. Yeah. Depression sucks it can literally stop you and bring you to your knees and you can also do things to help yourself to get through it, too. And that's what we're talking about is you being proactive right now. Right.

196
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:47.970
Serenna Beers: Yes. Okay. So from the when I first talked to you and you were pretty emotional. How are you, how do you feel now.

197
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.860
Christina Frazee: I feel good.

198
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.510
Serenna Beers: Yeah. Yeah. What's your anxiety level, on a scale of zero to 10

199
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.520
Christina Frazee: Zero. Okay.

200
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:06.240
Serenna Beers: How does your depression feel just really quick, like how we just to think about it, your first thought.

201
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.610
Christina Frazee: I would say like a two.

202
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.300
Okay.

203
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:23.430
Serenna Beers: So I want you to remember when it starts to rise, how quickly you just talking about it. Hence, you go into the book and journaling, how, how quickly you were able to bring that down just in the matter of the last 20 minutes

204
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.370
Serenna Beers: Okay, okay.

205
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:33.690
Serenna Beers: Can you commit to that. So journal writing, even if you're just writing what you're grateful for. That's, that's a must.

206
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:46.410
Serenna Beers: That's above and beyond writing other stuff you're agreeing to write every day, three things. Sure. Great, great grateful for and then you are going to work on starting tonight to take your medication.

207
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.680
Serenna Beers: Right deal. Okay.

208
00:26:50.280 --> 00:27:02.490
Serenna Beers: Okay. And this is going to pass. This is a moment, just like the way we feel build and break emotions are like that. They're just like waves there. They're going to build and then they're going to break

209
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:09.540
Serenna Beers: It's the way that it's all, it's, it's a way that it's always been an it's a way that it's always going to be, I mean,

210
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:25.080
Serenna Beers: Think about it. Every emotion that you've ever felt you feel it and then it kind of just goes off, right. You feel it and then it just goes off. That's with anything. So when you feel at your absolute worst remember that there is an end in sight. You just have to hang on for a little while.

211
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:27.810
Serenna Beers: Okay.

212
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.730
