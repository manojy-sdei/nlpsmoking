1
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.450
Ariel Mirabal: Good morning.

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.620
Morning.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.139
Ariel Mirabal: I'm so sorry. My daughter walked out here, and I was like, it's so early. I don't know why she's awake.

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to take a second and kind of see if you can set up the

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Phone somewhere. So it's propped up. I don't think quite have enough time to to start em, Dr. But you know what, even the piece that I'm thinking of doing today, it's still part of it. So it's still going to feel like we're we're working towards that.

7
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

8
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.890
Ariel Mirabal: Sitting in the garage. So

9
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, I see.

10
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I'd like to do today with with what we've got here as far as timing is to

11
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Develop the anchor room with you and this is basically a safe space so that you can use imagery. You can use this. It's not only just that in and of itself for for future your use but developing the room itself has a lot of therapeutic benefit.

12
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:26.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it takes one session rarely most times three or four, it takes a while to develop. It's not like, oh, remember when you were, you know, up in the mountains and it was a sunny day, this is pretty intense.

13
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.590
Ariel Mirabal: So,

14
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A couple of instructions to it, it'll be tempting for you to want to insert insert memory.

15
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:48.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll probably be tempted to want to force memory. But that's not what the invitation is the invitation is to get everything that you need and want in there. Yes, I will be asking

16
00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Three memory questions. I'll tell you what they are at least two of them. One of them is going to be an age old I'll do. Okay. And how old are you, and then that's it, not jam in everything that was going on at that memory.

17
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to naturally do it and there's no wrong way for you to do this activity. I could screw it up but you you can't, okay. I don't want you to be thinking, oh, I'm not doing this right. Nope. There's no way you can do it wrong.

18
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

19
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's usually like okay, good. So I can't can't say anything wrong. Can't do anything wrong. Fantastic. So, um, so the other memory pieces I might ask you, Hey, did she have a nickname.

20
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: At that age. Did you have a nickname at that age and you'll say yes or no and then what is it that's the other memory pieces third one's going to happen somewhere in the middle of the activity.

21
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you'll know it's it's a real precise zeroed in kind of memory question.

22
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: But if it naturally comes up. Hey, this is. Oh, I remember it was this. I remember this. You might hear me say, okay, you're remembering it was it was pink.

23
00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that what you want right now. So that's kind of where that are you forcing in memory into this space.

24
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Or are you kind of letting what the need is emerge and so that you might hear me do a little bit of that. It doesn't mean you did anything wrong.

25
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It just means I'm guiding it means I'm going to be doing guiding so all have lots of questions that will move you along to the next step.

26
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You do not have to do my job for me, which is the analysis part you can just just okay. Oh, look at that, look what just came up and then because I can't read your mind.

27
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Unfortunately, right. I gotta have some words with it. So I know that's going on with you.

28
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, I care about the body. I want to know what's happening. Is there a big like

29
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, stress response. Is there a big tightening stomach turning all those kind of things I want. I want to hear about them. They're all relevant for me. Okay.

30
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So that said, let's develop this anchor room and the anchor room starts kind of with a sense of where you're at now like

31
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you feeling blocked, you know, kind of stuck, you've been trying to solve something and you're kind of stuck. You've mentioned a couple of things to me. And there's a theme that keeps showing up in group.

32
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if that's where you're feeling

33
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.190
Ariel Mirabal: Boy, I am I just, what were you thinking as far as like

34
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.990
Ariel Mirabal: What I know

35
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I, yeah, I do.

36
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the, hey, I need to provide right like in right here. I'm right. I gotta tell you

37
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.590
Ariel Mirabal: Yes, the acceptance for yeah because I'm working on that.

38
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um, let's find a

39
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Minor really not as useful as how you word it so go into what we were just doing I heard you say acceptance, maybe it's something else. It just take a few seconds to kind of just get in touch with what how you would say, I'm feeling blocked around and what that is.

40
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.040
Ariel Mirabal: I do know something like right away. We just

41
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.200
Ariel Mirabal: Want to make sure

42
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.990
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, I just wanted to make sure that door was closed. Um,

43
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.600
Ariel Mirabal: I did think of something right away. As far as like how I am. And I've literally been having a little bit of

44
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.750
Ariel Mirabal: There's just been a little tension in the house with my boyfriend's mother and I

45
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.630
Ariel Mirabal: Usually been very good about getting along with each other. We have butt heads a few times in the past, but it's just been really hardly and

46
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.130
Ariel Mirabal: There's just been. I don't know if it's just me being insecure.

47
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So is it is it. So see if you can say, I feel blocked around, see if we can sort of fine tune that I get the inner personal and it's Arlene, we're talking about

48
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.140
Ariel Mirabal: Yes. Okay.

49
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.620
So,

50
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Much with the block.

51
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.410
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, let me think.

52
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.220
Ariel Mirabal: It's like my biggest issue right now so I feel blocked.

53
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.900
Ariel Mirabal: From being able to

54
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.490
Ariel Mirabal: Openly speak to her, I think. Okay.

55
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.550
Ariel Mirabal: And like it boosts her

56
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Get close

57
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.500
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, and being able to get close to her.

58
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. All right. Um, and

59
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do do it, just a little bit of grounding now just sort of turn your attention. My eyes are closed now and let's just see if we can sort of through breath and body awareness just sort of get into a state of

60
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Just the slow rhythm.

61
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Of tuning in Word.

62
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And paying attention to messages that come from more subtle cues, maybe shifts

63
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you'll notice a little movement in hand or shoulder or neck or something might just move ever so slightly. We don't want to miss that opportunity to hear the message.

64
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

65
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe focusing for a moment on breath.

66
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Now just sort of having that belly breathing.

67
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Alone expanding

68
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: deflating

69
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Setting the intention for experiencing release new information.

70
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: New understanding insight.

71
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Into

72
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Not feeling able to be open to speak.

73
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To her and get close to her.

74
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's understand a little bit more what the emotion is when you have that thought when you hold it there and you think I'm not able to openly speak.

75
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To our lean and get close to her. What's the emotion you feel

76
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.430
Ariel Mirabal: Good makes me really sad.

77
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: makes you sad. Okay.

78
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And where do you feel that schematically in your body.

79
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.680
Ariel Mirabal: Like my stomach. I think I

80
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:32.520
Think

81
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed a little bit of sort of tight shoulders a little bit of this to just a little bit of this and sort of a stiffening. Is that how it felt as you tried to identify it wasn't sure.

82
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.300
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, absolutely. Very, very a lot of stiff.

83
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.970
Ariel Mirabal: Feel like I will go my fingers a lot when I'm really trying to focus on something.

84
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I care. I want to know that. Yeah, I can't see them. So that's good. I went on my thing. I'm trying to focus

85
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.510
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, like I feel like are my feet, something like move something moves. It's either my hands or my feet.

86
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.670
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, I'm really trying to

87
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.130
Ariel Mirabal: Think about something.

88
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.280
Ariel Mirabal: Or it's my fingers. I'm just really trying to be like discrete both my fingers.

89
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.810
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, and I'm

90
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.770
Ariel Mirabal: really anxious and that's why I feel like it's in my I feel it in my stomach because I get these like

91
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:42.810
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know what you call them like little knots in your stomach. When I get anxious and it's kind of like, I don't know. It doesn't hurt or anything, but obviously it's something that I can feel

92
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's there's not only this, it started with sad, but then when you touch into the stomach, it, it felt anxious, like the emotion kind of was more of an anxious

93
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. And then an awareness that the hands and the feet are kind of being discreet while you're trying to focus

94
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

95
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:08.760
Ariel Mirabal: I feel like there.

96
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.990
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah, like you would probably barely be able to notice if you're sitting in front of me.

97
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to tell me that

98
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:27.330
Ariel Mirabal: Or I be one of those like restless leg syndrome that you can see I'm like always wiggling my. It's always my right leg. Actually my right.

99
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

100
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.450
Ariel Mirabal: Yeah.

101
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And is it bouncing up and down.

102
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

103
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So get in touch with originating with I can't, can't get close with

104
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: CAN'T SPEAK TO can't get close sad.

105
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: And then anxious

106
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And that stomach having a knot.

107
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And then this is this is the memory question go back to the earliest age that you remember that that was president

108
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.540
Ariel Mirabal: Oh, man.

109
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.370
Ariel Mirabal: I feel like this was within the very first year.

110
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.270
Ariel Mirabal: That rusty and I were together, which was eight years ago.

111
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.650
Ariel Mirabal: But

112
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.150
Ariel Mirabal: It was a specific incidents that I thought of right when you asked me that.

113
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.000
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, harder for me.

114
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.430
Ariel Mirabal: To feel like

115
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:46.290
Ariel Mirabal: Even that she wanted me to be close. It was when we got our first apartment. Together we moved out. And of course, I, I know that this is another thing I'm going to miss my daughter so much when she leaves out, you know,

116
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:56.640
Ariel Mirabal: But, you know, he moved out with me. And I remember him saying something about her calling and saying something to do you miss

117
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:05.040
Ariel Mirabal: Do you miss any of the things that I used to make for you and cook for you like it was something like that. And I kind of made me feel like that was kind of like the little first kickoff.

118
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:19.680
Ariel Mirabal: Like okay, that's, you know, that's nothing. That's his mom misses and no mean it's just as He really is. It's very attached to it. So it's kind of one of those and and same thing, vice versa if her in her son so they have this bond.

119
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:27.870
Ariel Mirabal: And I think that it really hurt her. When him and I started to get serious and that that kind of showed a little bit and

120
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:41.100
Ariel Mirabal: It made me a little nervous because I would never try to get known about but it just made me nervous. I mean, you feel like that's what she thought or something, you know, so then there's just since then eight years ago. And that was the start with

121
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bit of right now there's a real press I'm noticing, and I could be off with this a real process to try to address the dynamics between you

122
00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And Arlene is a real like you're focused on not notice I didn't say, remember the first communication of first discord.

123
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What I asked was to go bridge back further. So go back into the actual body come back into your body. And I know you're you're giving me these stories and they're very useful. And I've made notes on them.

124
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm want to know more about the body's response and how old this is so go go in to just how it feels to be sad.

125
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That you cannot

126
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Openly speak and get close to someone, you want to

127
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.990
Ariel Mirabal: And that's deeper that's like anyone not just her

128
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:59.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right, that I'm looking for that earlier stage, but you're likely to find it by paying attention to how old it is in the stomach because it starts with sad.

129
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:08.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's an awareness of knots in the stomach and it, it becomes this anxious

130
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:23.340
Ariel Mirabal: God, I feel like since I was like a little kid. I feel bad, like thinking about the feeling and how it feels when I like you're saying when I feel like that and remembering feeling like that before.

131
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.440
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, at such a young age. I feel like I was always really shy, like I couldn't talk to people ever

132
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:32.910
I was

133
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So is this again. That's the only question is age noticing you're wanting to give me a story.

134
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.940
Ariel Mirabal: Right, I'm thinking like six years old.

135
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it does a six year old have a nickname.

136
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.650
Ariel Mirabal: My nickname was Bluebell

137
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

138
00:14:53.670 --> 00:15:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If I called you, that would you sort if I were to distinguish adult you from the child six year old self. If I said Lou LaBelle and then there was Arielle

139
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Then you'd be able to have these distinctions of age. Fantastic. Thank you. And just, just notice how how tempting. It is again to want to give memory story to it. Right. Remember, I mentioned that was probably going to happen. And there it is.

140
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:20.700
As productive.

141
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: But we got we got the age we got age six and I even have a nickname. And so the only other memory question.

142
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Is going to come much, much later.

143
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go. This is right brain stuff not stored knowledge tucked away over on the left side. This is going to be. We're heading into cookie.

144
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.130
Ariel Mirabal: Okay.

145
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: We're heading into metaphor.

146
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Heading into imagery, the one

147
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Where imagination lives.

148
00:15:52.740 --> 00:16:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it may not have physically existed before. But it can exist in your imagination as we're talking about it. So try your very best to not censor, I want to know.

149
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:19.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What pops up first, because that's where the psychodynamic parts come into play. It's what comes up first before all of the social conditioning comes in and you swatted away and think to yourself, I shouldn't say that.

150
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I want. I want to know the first filter. No.

151
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Filtered I just, there's nothing you can say honestly at this point 20 some years of doing this.

152
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, what are you going to say that's good surprise me. I

153
00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: was surprised. I'm always surprised. Every day shocked me about that one.

154
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so really give yourself just carte blanche permission to just whatever comes up and we'll just take it from there. Just let my next question. Guys, you don't have to analyze. Well, why did she say that don't bother. I'm here for that. OK.

155
00:16:53.010 --> 00:17:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, enough work for us to catch the first response, let alone to all these other pieces. So here we go.

156
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can giggle you can definitely. LAUGH Okay.

157
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: We can laugh to get through it if it seems totally silly. So my first question is, when you think about being in this home that you're in now.

158
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, just sort of walk through the rooms and kind of picture the color and what's around and you know picture your daughter. You just put her back to sleep and all the different people around in the space that you're in. That's your calling home.

159
00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'd like you to in your imagination. Add a room.

160
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Attach a room to this home and it can be any size any shape anything

161
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But just notice where you attached it. And what you notice about this room and as much as you can. We're going to get into describing it. So tell me what you notice

162
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.410
Ariel Mirabal: Any kind of a room. Yeah, something

163
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:03.270
Ariel Mirabal: Anything.

164
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.320
Yeah.

165
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:09.900
Ariel Mirabal: Okay.

166
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.800
Ariel Mirabal: This

167
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.040
Ariel Mirabal: Additional room.

168
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.480
Ariel Mirabal: For some reason the color of the walls, keep changing in my head.

169
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I got changing from what to what, what did you know it started with and then changed.

170
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.480
Ariel Mirabal: I had like teal green in my head.

171
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.940
Ariel Mirabal: It's not the same color like a light green in my head that I had like a pink.

172
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.040
Ariel Mirabal: Apostle purple.

173
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.800
Ariel Mirabal: I had a deep red like thinking of what forest color. I don't know why I was just thinking of all kinds, we

174
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't have to do any of the you notice that you're, you don't have to know why I'm doing that for you today. You're paying me for it. You might as well let me do it.

175
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.150
Ariel Mirabal: Okay.

176
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I can change it to this pale, I gotta take to out here. It's like a pale green

177
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:18.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay and pink pastel them purple then deep red. And so now, so maybe we just just sort of go in with the color of the room keeps changing. And just noticed the size of it and other if there's windows. If there's things on the walls, just kind of tune in there.

178
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:29.610
Ariel Mirabal: There is a window and it's facing the mountain, so I can see out of the way.

179
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.850
Ariel Mirabal: And have a nice view.

180
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.930
Ariel Mirabal: The room is empty.

181
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.860
Ariel Mirabal: There's nothing in the room. It's just an open space link. There's no furniture.

182
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.190
Ariel Mirabal: Just the window.

183
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Described the window, the size any blinds curtains.

184
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.520
Ariel Mirabal: It's quite a large window there is absolutely no blinds or curtains on

185
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.530
Ariel Mirabal: It's one of those ones that has like the crisscrosses going through it.

186
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.190
Okay.

187
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.240
Ariel Mirabal: Just a really big size window on one of the walls.

188
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.680
Ariel Mirabal: And it's just straight out.

189
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.950
Ariel Mirabal: With the view of the mountains.

190
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.150
Ariel Mirabal: And it's just like a quiet, peaceful room.

191
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:28.260
Ariel Mirabal: Like a room for personal space and thoughts to go like, there's nothing in there. There's no furniture.

192
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: A space for

193
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Something and thoughts.

194
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.130
Ariel Mirabal: As a space for quiet like

195
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: quiet place and thoughts. Okay. Yep.

196
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And

197
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice anything else on the walls now have this window and

198
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The colors keep changing

199
00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:11.430
Ariel Mirabal: The colors are still changing. I'm still not seeing a specific color. But if I added any kind of paint to the wall, it would have been trees and river like a river running through the trees, something like nature and walls and

200
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.450
Ariel Mirabal: I would see that on one of the walls of this room.

201
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Definitely

202
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.480
Ariel Mirabal: The wall that's

203
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.880
Ariel Mirabal: Opposite of the window.

204
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.820
Ariel Mirabal: Just be a huge wall like a mural paint have a forest.

205
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: The same with the trees and the rivers that with that is that

206
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Or is it a different ok ok for us.

207
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.520
Ariel Mirabal: It is completely off, but I'm seeing light blue for the for the walls.

208
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.470
Ariel Mirabal: Right side.

209
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:53.700
Ariel Mirabal: Just like

210
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.360
Ariel Mirabal: None of the colors that were there before.

211
00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:58.560
Ariel Mirabal: Just like

212
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.000
Ariel Mirabal: To left and right wolves, and then there's that big window in the front and then European

213
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:04.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

214
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if you can have a sense of you mentioned earlier that it's quiet. This time really focus on

215
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice the sound when you're in that space, what you hear.

216
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.680
Ariel Mirabal: Myself breathing as your Eric slow

217
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a

218
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.220
Ariel Mirabal: Nice coming through them.

219
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.270
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're breathing.

220
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

221
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's air flow, there's a there's a breeze. And then there's all sort of your breathing.

222
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:47.850
Yes.

223
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you notice how it feels, on the skin, the temperature of this room.

224
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.060
Ariel Mirabal: It's very cool.

225
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.690
Ariel Mirabal: There's a ceiling fan.

226
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.880
Ariel Mirabal: There's a ceiling fan.

227
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you notice for a cent that's in there.

228
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.460
Ariel Mirabal: Like a woodsy sense

229
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.070
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know how to describe that.

230
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.040
Ariel Mirabal: Would be set.

231
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice now this last bit any taste that you notice

232
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.340
Ariel Mirabal: No taste.

233
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.300
Taste.

234
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at how you got there, you get into this space.

235
00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:51.450
Ariel Mirabal: I walked in there.

236
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:52.830
And

237
00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh locked in. And can you describe the doorway door everything about it color what it's made of. No handle handle just the whole deal just into detail about it.

238
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.700
Ariel Mirabal: Right away, see like white trim around the around the door.

239
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:15.600
Ariel Mirabal: Okay, it's

240
00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.360
Ariel Mirabal: It's around door. It's not square one and

241
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:19.860
Ariel Mirabal: Felt like a round top

242
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.460
Ariel Mirabal: Sort of, but it does have a door.

243
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:30.720
Ariel Mirabal: opens and closes just a white door. I'm just doing the white door. Okay.

244
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you think it's made of

245
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.060
Ariel Mirabal: Wood.

246
00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and handles any kind of locking system.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.690
Ariel Mirabal: The door locks it would be just a

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And

253
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This is like a

254
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Like a steel color oppression Nicole kind of colors or another color that

255
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.620
Ariel Mirabal: It's cold.

256

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.480
Ariel Mirabal: Know, while I'm outside the room. Sorry. So it would be on my left. If I'm standing inside the room.

262
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you lock the door from the inside the room.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you revisit the imagery

271
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So get a sense of what you're doing in that room. What are you doing in there.

272
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.050
Ariel Mirabal: looking out the window.

273
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.040
Okay.

275
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:46.620
Ariel Mirabal: Yes.

276
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.810
Ariel Mirabal: A hardwood floor.

277
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.700
Ariel Mirabal: It feels kind of cool little cool bottom of my feet.

278
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:03.960
Ariel Mirabal: Still soft

279
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And subtle.

280
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.460
Ariel Mirabal: Soft on the little grainy, I guess. Yeah.

281
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Often grainy.

282
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:12.750
Ariel Mirabal: stuff but grainy.

283
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

284
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I will colors that wood floor.

285
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.700
Ariel Mirabal: During dark brown

286
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Just notice your hands. What they're doing while you're in there.

287
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: What are they up to

288
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.660
Ariel Mirabal: Together, I have my hands together in front of me just

289
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.260
Ariel Mirabal: Relax really relaxed.

290
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice anything else in the room.

291
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.760
Ariel Mirabal: Can I say that I hear hummingbirds, because the windows open

292
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.650
Ariel Mirabal: Course, okay.

293
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: windows open

294
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

295
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.450
Ariel Mirabal: I do hear hummingbirds. So I guess it's a piece

296
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the emotion you feel

297
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:35.940
Ariel Mirabal: Calm.

298
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Check in with your stomach and see if it concurs if there's any tightness and you twisting anything in there. Any, anything just scan the whole body. Maybe while you're in that space in this anchor room.

299
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Check the head. I saw kids ears scanning down into the mouth, the neck, the throat.

300
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoulders.

301
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Arms.

302
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Lungs.

303
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.280
Ariel Mirabal: butterflies in my stomach.

304
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:15.450
Okay.

305
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else kind of moving sit bonds thighs knees calves feet.

306
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's talk a little bit more about that stomach. What do you think the butterflies.

307
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Messages. What does that have to say what's the message because something's going on.

308
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.640
Ariel Mirabal: I think that maybe it's

309
00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:57.630
Ariel Mirabal: It's

310
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:04.590
Ariel Mirabal: It's a I mean it's obviously a, it's a good feeling. It's like I maybe I feel

311
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:12.180
Ariel Mirabal: Happy to be happy, or just to be at peace in that room quiet or

312
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.790
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, it's very interesting because I don't necessarily like to be by myself.

313
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay here with me.

314
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:33.030
Ariel Mirabal: Stay here with anything that really makes me feel calm and very at peace and just totally okay. And it just felt I was happy about that. Like I was excited about that.

315
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Stay with it. Stay right there with it, go back in to that, that the message from butterflies in the stomach is hey, I'm happy.

316
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And I feel at peace.

317
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And they can notice the hummingbird can notice the breeze as it may be touches the skin can notice your own breath.

318
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So just imagining that

319
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Lula Bell was in that space.

320
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it change to she meaning you blue belt. Do you want anything else in that room right now.

321
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:27.390
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, I see myself as Ludo running around so excited.

322
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.770
Ariel Mirabal: Playing with Barbies, and they're

323
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: OK.

324
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.180
Ariel Mirabal: Cancel.

325
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.070
Ariel Mirabal: My daughter loves Barbies.

326
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I, she's sitting, standing. Are you seeing more things in the room now.

327
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.170
Ariel Mirabal: Seeing a little bed like a little twin size bed.

328
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.860
Ariel Mirabal: A little canopy on it and then little

329
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.930
Ariel Mirabal: Princess castle with the Barbies. I'm running around the room playing with the Barbies.

330
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.010
Ariel Mirabal: Making them like

Ariel Mirabal: See myself just running. I'm going to move out here. That's okay.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.280
Ariel Mirabal: I'm just going to move outside somebody just came out.

334
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And just try to stay with this without explaining it. Just try your best to stay with without going somewhere else. Okay, in your mind, we don't lose the work you're doing here.

335
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's running around flying the Barbies through the air and you're running so excited. There's a Barbie Castle, you can see a twin size bed and with a canopy any new colors emerge and the canopy and twin size, but

336
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:52.020
Ariel Mirabal: Pink.

337
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Pink. Pink. Pink.

338
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:55.530
Ariel Mirabal: light pink.

339
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.700
Pink.

340
00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.680
Uh huh.

341
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And just the flooring change.

342
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.840
Ariel Mirabal: The forest is the same.

343
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else change as little bell. Looks around.

344
00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.410
Ariel Mirabal: It looks like the walls are all just pink.

345
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: In temperature

346
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Same sounds

347
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.890
Ariel Mirabal: I mean, same I guess I would say just

348
00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:46.680
Ariel Mirabal: Like not cold, but just a normal temperature right in between. Okay. Holden and just

349
00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:48.000
Just

350
00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.500
Ariel Mirabal: Yes.

351
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, temperature,

352
00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Check. Check on emotion house, you little bell. How you feeling, they're

353
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:03.870
Ariel Mirabal: Playful

354
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Down. Alright, so I'm going to get into the first part of the question. I remember I said there'd be three things we do memory with this is this is that third one.

355
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I invite you, not to rush to the answer, getting to it fastest isn't the most meaningful. It's an odd question, so give it time. Let me rephrase it a few times, let there be not let lots of silence to see if your body likes the answer if you really think you're you've got it. Okay.

356
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

357
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: In this room.

358
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Little about

359
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What misinformation.

360
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: At this age of six, did you absorb and have to believe

361
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to survive.

362
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This misinformation this lie that you had to believe at that age.

363
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Arielle knows the adult self knows his BS. It's not true.

364
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But little bell had to believe it in order to survive.

365
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know little about what the misinformation was

366
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.550
Ariel Mirabal: You have to really think about that one.

367
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Will sit with it, then don't don't rush it let it, let it happen. I'll just keep sort of paraphrasing it

368
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: A little bell

369
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to survive.

370
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: In that home.

371
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You had to believe something

372
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You make choices and decisions based on that. And what was the misinformation.

373
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It was a lie. You now know as an adult Arielle it's not true, but back then you had to believe it in order to survive.

374
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you catching some of them passing by and rolling them out. And I'm wondering if you're having some guesses.

375
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.520
Ariel Mirabal: Having one and I'm kind of rolling it out because I don't know if it's

376
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:37.590
Ariel Mirabal: Really

377
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:42.420
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know. I'm not sure it's not an exact let me

378
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me here.

379
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.060
Ariel Mirabal: I keep thinking about my mom and

380
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:58.260
Ariel Mirabal: I mean she wasn't a liar, necessarily, but she always said things that obviously now today. I'm like, that was not true.

381
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:14.010
Ariel Mirabal: Like I mean things like everything's too good to be true type of stuff that she would say, and it wasn't necessarily things to survive. Really, it was just things to I grew up trying to accept everything that she said

382
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:22.170
Ariel Mirabal: And now that we're me. I'm all grown up. I do realize that she was not right about a lot of things.

383
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so she stay there for a second.

384
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.840
Ariel Mirabal: And she used to say that all the time. Everything is to like literally too good to be true.

385
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:40.740
Okay.

386
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:57.000
Ariel Mirabal: So I never like ordered anything like growing up, I would never do things that look like there was a huge sale. I didn't even if it really was a huge sale, I would completely like walk right by and be like, whatever, that's too good to be true. It was always like that with me because

387
00:37:58.050 --> 00:37:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so stay there. Okay.

388
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: To stay there.

389
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing is as

390
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: It appears

391
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:17.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Good.

392
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: That

393
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Enjoyment that excitement that you perceive is not real.

394
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

395
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Not as good as it appears

396
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: We're getting closer and closer

397
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.370
Ariel Mirabal: Look, I'm starting to think of other stuff now too.

398
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, this is a pretty heavy, heavy one right here. So let me just see.

399
00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do it again. So just let let the let the answer comes so it's about little bell

400
00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticing that outside that room.

401
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: She has to cope adapt.

402
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: To misinformation out there outside that room.

403
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Arielle knows the truth but out there in order for six year old you to survive in that family in that community in that culture, you had to believe it.

404
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the lie.

405
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.970
Ariel Mirabal: This is just the same thing or this am I staying

406
00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The same thing to see what comes up.

407
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.590
Ariel Mirabal: People are terrible. My mom would say things about some people in the family.

408
00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.050
Ariel Mirabal: Sara Lee, it's just always things that my mom would say

409
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.530
Ariel Mirabal: And I keep thinking about. And as far as the same thing.

410
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.820
Ariel Mirabal: Still can't think of a lie, necessarily.

411
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's okay, it's not it's not supposed to be so concrete you're pushing hard for it to be a lie. That's why.

412
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that square. It's not that concrete just want to we go with what you did, which has to do with

413
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You would see things

414
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You would have a perception and your mom.

415
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Would tell you what you're seeing and sensing is not what it is.

416
00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that good.

417
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not going to make you happy. That ain't that great. You can't trust what you see here feel sense

418
00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not that good.

419
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And in fact,

420
00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: People can be terrible.

421
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see, we'll do this last part might need some refinement, but let me keep investigating here. So let's just see

422
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I would like you to get in touch with sort of this dual awareness that Lubell kind of picture, picture either being her. You can kind of see her from a distance, and then Arielle and little bell

423
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Have access to communicating with each other. How might that happen, how might they be able to talk to one another. How, what do you picture.

424
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.920
Ariel Mirabal: I just pictured myself really talking to her face to face.

425
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.260
Gwenevere Abriel: How are you both in the room.

426
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:00.120
Ariel Mirabal: Yes.

427
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay and so go real slow on this, try to catch the first response, not what you think the analysis is remember on here. I can do that for us.

428
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So little bell

429
00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You do seem a little uncertain about what the misinformation was your only six

430
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.440

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.940
Ariel Mirabal: Just to be strong and

446
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.850
Ariel Mirabal: Not to worry so much about what other people think.

447
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.010
Ariel Mirabal: And

448
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.400

451
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.890
Ariel Mirabal: I would say

452
00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:13.530
Ariel Mirabal: If something bad happens, and there's nothing that you can do or say

453
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.550
Ariel Mirabal: Just

454
00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:19.680
Ariel Mirabal: Take a deep breath.

455
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.680
Ariel Mirabal: And try to walk away.

456
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.790
Ariel Mirabal: And that's probably what I would try to say

457
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.600
Ariel Mirabal: Take a deep breath.

458
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What does she need to walk away and take a deep breath from

459
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:48.690
Ariel Mirabal: From the stress. Don't take in the stress. I mean, I can't tell a six year old that. But I mean, don't let it get you down. Don't let it make you sad. Don't let it overwhelm you.

460
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:49.110

463
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:09.420
Ariel Mirabal: Just if anything happens if somebody is mean to her or hurts her feelings.

464
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.800
Ariel Mirabal: Or says something bad to her calls her name or

465
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Who might do that.

466
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.490
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know mean kids at school.

Gwenevere Abriel: This one, this is her world here.

473
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.780
Ariel Mirabal: I would tell her.

474
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:14.220
Ariel Mirabal: To try not to let things hurt her so so badly, try not to let your feelings get so hurt.

475
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.310
Ariel Mirabal: I don't know how I would say that to

476
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at her and tell her you understand what she's going through what's hurting her

477
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.240
Ariel Mirabal: I think it is that just

478
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.420
Ariel Mirabal: At the age of

479
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.330
