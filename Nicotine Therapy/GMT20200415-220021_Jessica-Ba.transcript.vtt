Misty Moncada: Was forever as long like

22
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.030
Misty Moncada: It was what like

23
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.760
Misty Moncada: Maybe eight hours from Clovis to Dallas and then it kept cutting out when I was in group on Friday.

24
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.810
Misty Moncada: And I

25
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.260
Misty Moncada: Disaster. And I was like, is there any way I could just not. I mean, we're on the highway. If we're tired.

26
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:22.110
Misty Moncada: Hours. He said that was fine. But I was in India for a little bit. It was it was law. It was long by time we go from Clovis we go straight. We didn't rest. We got to Dallas and it was like maybe eight, nine hours.

27
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.000
Drive.

28
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I thought, you know, cuz then I was like, well, it's going to be challenging because if you fly, then you have to like corn to sell quarantine.

29
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For 14 days when you return. So I guess you guys avoided. Some of the chaos by driving

30
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.550
Misty Moncada: Yeah, and the roads were like

31
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.240
Misty Moncada: It was okay. You know, I don't know. We had fun. We it was being my mom and my grandma. By the time we got here. We're

32
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.740
Misty Moncada: Already here.

33
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:11.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, looks nice over there. Um, so last time we spoke, you had some challenges with your daughter and some guilt with like past parenting experiences. Where are you with that relationship today.

34
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.850
Misty Moncada: I'm okay. Right now my daughter and I like I took my

35
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:23.310
Misty Moncada: Grandson brought him. She's still got a lot to work on. I'm also angry about a lot of things I had told you that I was stressed out about my job.

36
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

37
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.400
Misty Moncada: I get a letter in the mail saying I have a warrant for Larson.

38
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:50.940
Misty Moncada: I'm like, What's going on, like what's going on. He calls instead that I stole from him, and I said, this is not true. This is not true. Like why would we do that. I have a letter in the mail I Larson guitar decides to be informed by April 30

39
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.550
Misty Moncada: To call the police departments.

40
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.630
Misty Moncada: That I robbed.

41
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:15.900
Misty Moncada: And I immediately contacted my old job. Nice to Genesis, like, what is going on. Like I had already told you once I was with this guy you send me that they called Adult Protective Services and my job flipped it around and said they never told adult protective services that I recorded

42
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.550
Misty Moncada: Nine to mess with

43
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.040
Misty Moncada: So when I report it to a PSA PSA was like okay just just never reported this is what's going on and

44
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:37.110
Misty Moncada: The boss on the phone was like, Well, nobody twisting your arm me go back to Earth. I said, Will you are you as my boss use that I had to go at least three days and I didn't want to lose my job.

45
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.130
So I went

46
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:54.270
Misty Moncada: I don't know. What do you say nice though, I just got some papers in larceny and I have to show up. I called his sister is what is going on. And she said, You have like a 10 person. Please excuse like you'll, you'll be fine. He's not but he's never follow up question for me.

47
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Wow.

48
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.970
Misty Moncada: So I'm going through a bunch of like

49
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:13.170
Misty Moncada: I'm always going through something and I'm, I'm okay with it. Like, I'm not going to go on it because I didn't do anything. Um, I guess in the police report it stated that

50
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:26.430
Misty Moncada: It's the various items that were sold it isn't it is paid. And then it says that, um, I had jumped over the fence to try to go after me like you couldn't because because

51
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:36.840
Misty Moncada: Because he's not able to that was not true. He was trying to fill on me and he had me locked in those days and I jumped eight. So now I just have to go to court and just leave my

52
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fortunate situation, I would have never expected this unfold. After what we discussed last meeting.

53
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:57.090
Misty Moncada: Well, I would have never expected either. And then, uh, so I get a letter in the mail from the Municipal Court saying I have a cookie. And I'm like,

54
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:05.160
Misty Moncada: Oh my probation officer. And I'm like, is this. I don't know. And he's like, misty like I don't even have nothing. My computer like what are you talking about

55
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:13.830
Misty Moncada: I said there's this I gotta let him. I'll say Mars me. He's like, whoa, like all the ports on on so that's why I called my old job.

56
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:30.840
Misty Moncada: It was so rude about it. They were like, Well, we didn't make you go back, you went on your own. And I was like, you know, I did everything to keep my job and I even met you know admitted that he was trying to hit on me. So hey, oh no, they're making it look like it's like a bunch of crap on

57
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:38.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This point is he stayed versus she say and your job did not do the respectful thing by document in your concerns.

58
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:47.520
Misty Moncada: And and what's crazy is my boss, my boss boss of the job was out of town, she was doing field work, you know,

59
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.140
Misty Moncada: Out there in Albuquerque so

60
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.940
Misty Moncada: When I report it to

61
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:57.570
Misty Moncada: When my boss came back and she said, what's going on, misty night reporters. She goes, no one every portage News reported anything

62
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:13.350
Misty Moncada: So it's all just like a hush hush kind of thing and and I'm really mad, and then the lady was like, well don't you need to report it to your PO and I was like I did. Charlie did that. I told her she was ours.

63
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:22.110
Misty Moncada: On price it and I shouldn't do this. I'll be rude. I was like, arms, one for all and I was like, no, bitch. But I'll have a problem being back on for a few lucky with me. I told her.

64
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:37.530
Misty Moncada: He bought because like, You're being rude. Now I had already reported this and you're being rude, you never miss any of this stuff and so like I should do that because that does not make me look good at all. But she was just kind of being like, arrogant, like, Don't you need to report this.

65
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.340
Misty Moncada: You know,

66
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.630
Misty Moncada: Aren't you on parole.

67
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.650
Misty Moncada: Know I'm on probation.

68
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ya.

69
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Know, so

70
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:50.100
Misty Moncada: I was real rude about that I shouldn't even do that. I was way out of character, but like it just got me so angry. So my boss boss had no idea.

71
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.440
Misty Moncada: That kind of help.

72
00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:11.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So my question for you said your responses, but I did you have an opportunity to practice the the pause and then the reflect. But clearly, she activated that trigger response where it's to get pause and reflect. I'm just going to react.

73
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.490
Misty Moncada: Because I she said it twice.

74
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.330
Misty Moncada: At first, is like

75
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.010
Misty Moncada: Going to have a PO

76
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:28.500
Misty Moncada: Aren't you on parole or no please don't Archie, why don't you have appeal and aren't you on production. She goes, go to that appeal, you need to report this to and when she said that. Yeah.

77
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.490
Misty Moncada: I was like, look.

78
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.220
Misty Moncada: I'm not, I'm not have a problem with that.

79
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:42.540
Misty Moncada: Role and I didn't seem like I just, but I was asked on a three way call and I should've did that it was me. Well, they had me on a not a three way call speaker at a conference call.

80
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.910
Misty Moncada: Okay. It was me her and

81
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.730
Misty Moncada: The boss on office talking, but I was at home.

82
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.950
Misty Moncada: I really did that.

83
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.900
Misty Moncada: But she just like triggered me like I felt like she was taunting me like okay like

84
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.270
Misty Moncada: You recorded it whatever other crap like it.

85
00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:57.960
Misty Moncada: And then

86
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:04.980
Misty Moncada: When I told my boss about it. My boss was like nobody reported this thing. So it kind of made me look like a liar.

87
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.740
Misty Moncada: You know, like, okay, misty just went

88
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.080
Misty Moncada: On her own kind of thing after the incident happened.

89
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.710
Misty Moncada: And so it was no time for me to

90
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do it was just like

91
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.800
Misty Moncada: All like he's making at

92
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:34.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, she caught you an already high in moment. Have you already had some challenges with this patient because your concerns. I'm curious when you told them about what was happening with this patient was it a face to face conversation phone call or did you put anything in writing.

93
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.080
Misty Moncada: It was I left his house one day.

94
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:37.770
And

95
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.050
Misty Moncada: And I went immediately.

96
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:50.910
Misty Moncada: Into the office I reported it. I said, I don't want to work for him. No, but I didn't put into writing. I didn't do a grievance I this is my first time doing home health care. Yeah.

97
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.170
Misty Moncada: I don't know how to do all this

98
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:59.760
Misty Moncada: So, um, when I reported it now. She's all we're gonna let me to know the whole answer those what was said.

99
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:06.480
Misty Moncada: Here. Well, I don't know how to do all this paperwork. Maybe I should have asked, maybe I should have been so like naive.

100
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:16.620
Misty Moncada: About i did i left straight from his house I clocked out that day and then I reported it and I told her, I'm not going back. I'm not going

101
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:25.110
Misty Moncada: And I meant that I said you can. She goes, wait, we have another five people report, I said, okay, that's fine. But I'm not going back and I didn't go back after he

102
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:36.870
Misty Moncada: Tried to do what he did the last time I did not feel that I didn't agree to anything. And then he got a new home health care provider. So she was going to be out for three days and he requested me. Oh.

103
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:47.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, well, you know, there's a lot of us that we are fearful because I remember you said that experience made you feel uncomfortable you was a little afraid.

104
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:57.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There was so much on the line. We don't think the best and our state of fear. So I could understand, especially if this is your first time doing home health care.

105
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:04.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not going through the proper measures, but now you know this type of business. Any concern, put it in writing.

106
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:27.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: An email and email them so that the end of the day, you always have your documentation. But in hindsight, of everything that happened. I could understand why this is no for you. Who would expect home health care to be, you know, to be on in that compromising position like that. Right.

107
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.570
Misty Moncada: I think a little bit of

108
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.160
Misty Moncada: A break over there.

109
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.830
Misty Moncada: Beautiful. I love it.

110
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.460
Misty Moncada: But that's

111
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:54.120
Misty Moncada: The way I felt like them. I think I was so hurt with the situation like and then like when I feel hurt. I'm aggressive like I was still a lot. I need to learn about my feelings like I can get aggressive and just be aggressive back and had not have no filter like

112
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.870
Misty Moncada: Not at all.

113
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.340
Misty Moncada: And so for me I need to practice. I need to learn how to be a little bit more

114
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:07.440
Misty Moncada: Offer and act more adult life. And I did admit this in group one time I was like, there's some things I really need to work on and so

115
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:18.990
Misty Moncada: It just made me so angry, but his sister had said that she would go with me to of course, if needed, and she will help me because I've been friends with this family for a long time, like

116
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:24.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I just got accused to his sister is open to going to court with you.

117
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:32.610
Misty Moncada: Yeah, she said. She said, Okay, she's been my friend was like, we hang out here and there. Her name is Barry. She's a wonderful person and

118
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:42.780
Misty Moncada: Perry said misty I will go to court with you if I have to. I will help you in any way I can because you're not the first person he's done this dude. He's just never filed a police report.

119
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.050
Misty Moncada: And I said, Look, I said what excuse me is going. And I said, I don't even want to know.

120
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.370
Misty Moncada: Only one. No.

121
00:13:50.580 --> 00:14:04.470
Misty Moncada: I don't care. I don't want to give a speech, I guess, for I don't want to know anything but um she agreed that she would go with it. So I hope that, and even if she doesn't. I just hope it I tell my side, the story and not do it.

122
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.340
Yeah.

123
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:20.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, this is something that you'd recognize that when your emotion is feeling disrespected your reaction is to react right away with anger.

124
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:30.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you don't have that filter. So remember what we talked about last time with identifying what the emotion is so you know she made that comment.

125
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:39.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On trump the role you since then your body. The disrespect because your body gave you that response that reaction. And so that's where that pause comes in.

126
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:53.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Granite she needed to be quitting her place because as a supervisor. She did not do what she should have done to protect her employees. So I understand the frustration, but in that. Pause

127
00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:07.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There would have been an opportunity to have her and knowledge what she went wrong in that conversation. And then now there's no opportunity for them to look at you as the aggressor, but

128
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:18.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What does that even look like for you because he accused of stealing. I'm the RV firing you are, you are correct. How does that affect your employment with them.

129
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.460
Misty Moncada: I'm no longer employed with them.

130
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:28.080
Misty Moncada: I told them to ourselves. And that I will see them in court, if I have to. I told I told him I said that I wasn't going to go back

131
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:39.270
Misty Moncada: And then I immediately contacted my probation officer, which is like this. You're doing so good. Like, I will be out for you. Like you're completing all your classes for probation, you

132
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:49.020
Misty Moncada: You haven't missed any you know payments you haven't got no dirty us and us like I will go help you if I can if I need it. He's like you were doing great.

133
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:59.280
Misty Moncada: Nice to look. I said, I don't know what's going on, but I never told my people about the incident, either. I just, I only know my work, you know, not really understanding, but I'm

134
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:08.010
Misty Moncada: I'm not going to go back. I'm not going to go work with him and I just kind of sit at home and kind of stay away from it. They haven't called me so

135
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.320
Misty Moncada: I mean, I'm OK. Now I'm a little like over the stress.

136
00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:29.310
Misty Moncada: That I'll just tell you like that one day, I was just like wow, like, like, Wow. And then, you know, for her to just say we went back and I was like, he said you need it. You only requested me and it was

137
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.350
Misty Moncada: Hard because he's already

138
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:40.560
Misty Moncada: Fire like 50 caregivers. So they were like, Well, he request you we really need you. And I thought, okay, like this is my job. I'm doing what they say.

139
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.470
Misty Moncada: I told her this is for him. It's all right. I'm not going back for

140
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:52.440
Misty Moncada: Sure. And she said, yeah, you're not going back. So I thought, because it already knew the incident the pirates today. I was going to be okay. Is she said she has spoken about it.

141
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.980
Misty Moncada: Yesterday, and I spoke to them about the incident.

142
00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:06.810
Misty Moncada: And I told him that he is you cannot be asking you to be doing other things for him, and I said, Okay, thank you. But I don't know if that's really true or not, because it wasn't my actual boss.

143
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:25.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you know, you can't even on I think you're making the right choice by just looking for a different employer to begin with that they didn't protect you. They, they compromise your safety and they didn't even document. So you're making the right decision.

144
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:27.930
Misty Moncada: And then I felt like when

145
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.030
Misty Moncada: When adult protective services from the state.

146
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:41.880
Misty Moncada: Of New Mexico, call me. Yeah, I had no idea that I had already reported at one time because my employment fails to notify them of that. So it's making me look like I never did nothing at all.

147
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:42.630
Mm hmm.

148
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:44.280
Misty Moncada: So,

149
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:44.880
Yeah.

150
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.690
Misty Moncada: I don't know, I just I just hope for better days. Like, I didn't have bad, but I wouldn't have any luck in the world.

151
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.150
Misty Moncada: I haven't worked for

152
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No, it's going to work out for you, it definitely will.

153
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:03.330
Misty Moncada: Other than that, I've been getting along great with my daughter so far.

154
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:12.540
Misty Moncada: I brought my grandson with those to give her some time because you know she is, you know, doing drugs here and there. And so, um,

155
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:20.070
Misty Moncada: Well, I mean, me and my mom just thought away that away from everything all the stress and Clovis

156
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well,

157
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How was how was the communication with your daughter should be more respectful communication.

158
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.820
I'm

159
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:44.130
Misty Moncada: more distant and, I guess, I guess I'm just kind of worried about that. Like, she's the she's communicating more respectfully, but she's just like, Okay, I gotta go talk to you later. So hang up immediately.

160
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.450
Misty Moncada: Why they buy

161
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.150
Misty Moncada: Or it's like okay, you guys have a good time by

162
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:49.920
Misty Moncada: You know, so it's kind of

163
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.860
Misty Moncada: Like high end by. Talk to you later.

164
00:18:53.910 --> 00:19:04.260
Misty Moncada: This has more more verbal like to tech, but not through phone so I'm just letting her be because I felt a lot of stress on my plate.

165
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

166
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.720
Misty Moncada: He's 21 and just letting her do her right now and figure out what

167
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:19.320
Misty Moncada: He wants is fine. I can, I will literally lose my mind. If I focus on her what I'm going through right now.

168
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.910
Misty Moncada: A lot of

169
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:29.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, let me. Let's see what progress you've made on when we met we develop the treatment time together.

170
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:47.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because right now in this state probably seems like nothing's working well. Um, but I seen progress. You know, I've seen you shift from the ex husband. That was a trigger for you and you know you establish that firm boundaries.

171
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:59.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, and you were able to protect yourself in that situation, you know, when you had that that slip up, you got right back on you opened up on your attorney who consistently.

172
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:09.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Those are the things that's working well for you and the fact that this situation can happen and your probation officer could already not questioning

173
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:18.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: can already be in a position to be supportive. That says a lot because probation officers, they're always on guard waiting for the slip up right

174
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:25.950
Misty Moncada: But the fact that your probation officer was able to at first, not question it not challenge it. But know that

175
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:37.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Misty, it's going to be okay. And even the guy sister to want to support you. That says a lot of you built those relationships and those connections and that they see integrity and

176
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:46.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's not something that a lot of people can identify and other and others. So I'm taking a list of those things that you're doing well.

177
00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:54.030
Misty Moncada: Right. And, and, like, I just want to keep going you know I'm trying really hard and

178
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:59.760
Misty Moncada: My attitude is one big thing I want to work on. I have a bad attitude every night.

179
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:14.700
Misty Moncada: Maybe not like like things before I react to things and spit out no filters say things that I don't care about and like that's going to go like that, gentle part of me has to go already and I'm trying so hard to get rid of that.

180
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.020
Misty Moncada: You got one of my

181
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.010
Misty Moncada: main goals. This

182
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:30.720
Misty Moncada: Year is to focus on how I can speak to other one. I'm angry. I'm not just get so mad and you like at you and this and that and and you know and then like, I'm here with some

183
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.690
Misty Moncada: Basic I have two children that I don't have custody of my two youngest and

184
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.560
Misty Moncada: I've got to see them. I've got to spend time with them.

185
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:51.570
Misty Moncada: Once graduating this year. Once graduating next year and like they're not raised, like this, like all ghetto talking and for you.

186
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.790
Misty Moncada: Know, and I'm like last time.

187
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.850
Misty Moncada: I got to spend time with him. And we were laughing Is taking

188
00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:16.140
Misty Moncada: Pictures and I just you know my way of speaking around not just them, but not all my family's like this. That's kind of just, that's my main goal. My main focus. I know I have a lot of just my attitude water just anger I lot of angry.

189
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.470
Misty Moncada: I have a lot of anger towards

190
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:33.480
Misty Moncada: A lot of things. And you're basically my problem or what I've done to myself not everybody's done in its flow. What the hell am I angry. I'm angry that I put myself in a sense you know I can't be angry to everybody else for it, you know.

191
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:49.200
Misty Moncada: And that's one thing that I need to focus on like I'm angry at myself for the things I've been there myself. But like I, my goal is to focus on how I speak to others how I react to things, not just right away jumps to some conclusion after for, you know,

192
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:56.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah well you respond like this because of the condition of your life experiences.

193
00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:04.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You had a rough upbringing. You were incarcerated for a long period of time. And so this has been your mentality. So Bible

194
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:14.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Present yourself in a way that people learn not to disrespect you and so that's why the disrespect is a challenge for you because then you internalize

195
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:25.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, if you feel that you can disrespect me that we've added present myself in a way for you to know better. So now let me give you reason to know why you can't be suspect

196
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:41.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's why there's that challenge in the communication and whenever that disrespect rises up and go back into the survival. So it's, it's the emotions that we talked about. Did you get the opportunity, like we talked about last time to love those emotions on a day to day basis.

197
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.590
Misty Moncada: I'm Steve, I have not.

198
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.530
Misty Moncada: I apologize, I have not. But I did save

199
00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.040
Misty Moncada: The charts.

200
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:47.970
Misty Moncada: On my phone.

201
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.360
Misty Moncada: I did. And just like and

202
00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.480
Misty Moncada: I think I've been so like like

203
00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:01.380
Misty Moncada: My mind has been wrecked with everything going on. I haven't had time to really focus. So I saved them.

204
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:14.430
Misty Moncada: Just as a reminder, like all my emotions to remind me because I kind of liked those emotion and those emotional pictures. It just, it just shows me a lot like within myself like how I reacted today.

205
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or

206
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.870
Misty Moncada: You know, so hopefully I could start working on that. But I apologize, I

207
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:27.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's okay. But this gives you the opportunity to really work on the skills that you want to apply it.

208
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:44.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And, like you, I like that chart because it shows us that emotions aren't just like for, you know, we have this limited emotional vocabulary, where we think that it's either angry happiness, sadness or disappointment and there's so many different emotions.

209
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.410
Misty Moncada: That can derive from right

210
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right when we can adequately define

211
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.220
What we're

212
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:57.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's how we can mold the behaviors thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. If you don't remember anything else.

213
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:10.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you don't have that chart, think about that as you go about your day and any emotion arises for you. What am I thinking what am I feeling. Okay. And how will I behave. Now, as a result of these thoughts and these fields.

214
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.840
Misty Moncada: Right.

215
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, Misty, um, where we talk, um, you talked about

216
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:25.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: staying sober and going to group every week. How's that been for you.

217
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:32.730
Misty Moncada: I have been sober. I've been going to group every Friday this Friday I am like I said, if

218
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.250
Misty Moncada: You're on the highway. Yes.

219
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.210
Misty Moncada: And

220
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:50.190
Misty Moncada: I've been coined to group and my you a cup. They sent me you a cup in the mail. I never received it, and they're saying like, go to the post office that are post office in town is blows like our little town is all freaked out about the coronavirus thing so

221
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.690
Misty Moncada: Maybe I'll be helping my

222
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:55.890
Misty Moncada: Broker

223
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Other than that I have not respond to her. Okay.

224
00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:05.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You've been attending our session. I think you only missed one. You've been consistent with that.

225
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:12.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Usage one want to seek employment and you, you have the employment. But this happens so

226
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm guessing the process is going to have to start again. Do you have any other leads

227
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.480
Misty Moncada: I'm

228
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.100
Misty Moncada: After coming to visit. I think I want to move back over here.

229
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I wouldn't

230
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:36.780
Misty Moncada: I wouldn't say that housing to go see if I could get application and they they're close to my sister, she works in an office. She printed out one online, um,

231
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:53.490
Misty Moncada: Maybe just a fresh start, and just get away from closes right now, but I'm also on probation to so I don't know. I'd have to ask my probation officer. I've done everything I've had to do. So one class, I have to do me a VIP class. Well, maybe I could transfer it. Um, I don't know.

232
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.000
Misty Moncada: Other than that, like I'm

233
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.870
Misty Moncada: I mean, I'm trying to stay away from everything and

234
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.910
Misty Moncada: Yes, a focus, but if

235
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:11.370
Misty Moncada: I'm really angry right now, a lot of stuff. So I just kind of, I guess this was a stress reliever. The Getaway

236
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, when is your probation over

237
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.420
Misty Moncada: I just got put on

238
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh you froze. What was that I see.

239
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You froze. What did you say how long is it published

240
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.500
Misty Moncada: And I just got put on probation. In January for 15

241
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:47.310
Misty Moncada: Months and so one year, but I'd actually completed since January I've completed all my counseling. I completed my DWI select all my community service for

242
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.590
Misty Moncada: Probation all I have is

243
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:59.520
Misty Moncada: One VIP class and then the rest of my payments every month for the rest of the year. So my VIP classes have been so I've actually like excelled and all my probation.

244
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.090
Yeah.

245
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:07.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's let's play this up. If your probation officer were to say know

246
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:16.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what could you do to change your surroundings. Even if you still have to go to close this so that it can still feel like a fresh start for you.

247
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.110
Misty Moncada: I don't know.

248
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.250
Misty Moncada: Small town.

249
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where I live, and

250
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.080
Misty Moncada: So it's like I

251
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:40.980
Misty Moncada: I don't know, like I'm still doing good. I'm still sober off heroin. That's not affecting it. Um, I know some days I stress. I just want to take off and I know that I can't do that. So I get kind of scared that I'm going to relax. Sometimes

252
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.330
Misty Moncada: I get really

253
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.100
Misty Moncada: scared that I'm like

254
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:50.310
Misty Moncada: I'm doing good. And I haven't school, but I don't know I get so stressed out. Some days I just want to go off.

255
00:28:52.920 --> 00:29:04.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To think about that because I don't want it, the probation officer says, No, I don't want that to be one more bad thing, and then it send you over, you know, to want to use so

256
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:22.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Come up in the best case scenario, um, well actually, in the worst case scenario vision officer says, no, you have to stay here until etc. What can miss the still do to get the feeling that she's feeling right now in Texas, where it feels like a fresh start for her.

257
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.560
Misty Moncada: I don't know yet like

258
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.200
Misty Moncada: I don't know. I'd have to figure something out like is

259
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This such a small

260
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.990

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: May not have

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.270
Misty Moncada: Been I have been

266
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.090
Misty Moncada: And then boom, and then like

267
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:52.830
Misty Moncada: It's just, I guess I'm stressed out about it, but I can't run for me to Cameron from all my issues face.

268
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.520
Misty Moncada: But I don't know I stuck it yourself out for probation officer says, No, I'm just happy.

269
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:02.790
Misty Moncada: That I'm right now. I just

270
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.510
Misty Moncada: I'm just happy I'm away. Yeah.

271
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:24.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah so enjoying this this moment. And if you feel like you. You're on the verge of water relapse. You know how to reach me let's schedule a session call someone in the virtual clinic and just have someone to talk to your mind, you have all the progress extremely well.

272
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:33.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, any new triggers you identified. So you said the anger that you were dealing with is kind of making you tempted to use

273
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anything else

274
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:36.810
Misty Moncada: I'm

275
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:42.270
Misty Moncada: Mainly just a anger and then you fighting with my kids like

276
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For me,

277
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:58.710
Misty Moncada: That was another thing. But since I've been away. I just kind of like, I guess the bright for me arguing with me with my son or my daughters. So like, I'm not stressed stressed out right now. Maybe by time I get home. I'll feel better.

278
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:00.750
You know,

279
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:11.520
Misty Moncada: I need to find other ways to stress relief and I was working out at the gym. But then I found out I had like a ball behind my kneecap and I went

280
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:22.170
Misty Moncada: To the doctor and I got a piece that we need x rays when he said that he doesn't understand how this really been hurting, but I have like a day for me at my whole life.

281
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:23.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One.

282
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.890
Misty Moncada: One group higher my kneecap on the right.

283
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:33.900
Misty Moncada: Side grew higher than we have on the web. He's like, why are we started hurting you. I don't know. So like working out with my stress reliever.

284
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Until my mid cap started to

285
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.250
Misty Moncada: Hurt. I felt like I popped it out of place.

286
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:46.080
Misty Moncada: And he said, then it should have heard a long time ago. So I can maybe I can work for this game and maybe just work on my arms.

287
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, not my list not

288
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.990
Misty Moncada: That was a big stress reliever.

289
00:31:52.920 --> 00:32:02.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. Do you find yoga. I know some people they can't do yoga, they can't do meditation, because it's too slow for them. Do you find that relaxing for you.

290
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:05.010
Misty Moncada: I tried at

291
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:17.760
Misty Moncada: Yoga one time and we'll meditation and one of our mental health groups for probation and I think I panicked because I've come a victim of violent crimes and like

292
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.740
Misty Moncada: I was in a room full of people I

293
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.990
Misty Moncada: Did not know and she wanted us to close your eyes.

294
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.030
Misty Moncada: And then we tried it again a

295
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:37.080
Misty Moncada: Second time but I had my back towards the door. And I knew. Nobody was behind so I kind of felt a little bit more time, but I bet, I bet if I did it at home, I would probably be more comfortable. I know.

296
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:39.420
Misty Moncada: That's

297
00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.380
Misty Moncada: Not a bad idea.

298
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:52.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah. I have been doing a little bit of meditation. I personally don't like yoga in those things because it's too slow. I want to sweat. I want to feel like I'm doing been active

299
00:32:53.040 --> 00:33:01.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For meditation has been really helpful for me during this time of just China multitask with kids out of school trying to work.

300
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:16.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's been a lot, and I've been really shot that meditation is really helped me to feel a lot more calmer to mentally and physically so um that's y axis, you're busy, you're on the go to. So I was curious to know

301
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you enjoyed meditation.

302
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:24.930
Misty Moncada: And I can. I said, I tried to just twice, and I think I probably at the second time I started to feel more

303
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:28.170
Misty Moncada: Comfortable and I probably would enjoy it at home.

304
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.660
Misty Moncada: Yeah.

305
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.090
Misty Moncada: Yeah, I get that.

306
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:42.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Work given a second shot I there's a free app that's called insight timer that they have the recorded meditations for you and you can pick

307
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:55.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Based on whatever category, you're feeling at that moment. So, something, something to think about. They have some longer ones and some shorter ones, and it's free because I heard a lot of meditation apps, you have to pay for it. So,

308
00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:03.600
Misty Moncada: I should just got. I got some catchy catchy gas tank top. I should just do me. You're gonna get off.

309
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:15.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, do that. You definitely little stress reliever. Um, so you identify some stresses and now we're already applied some things to help you know where resource here.

310
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:25.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't be shy can feel that I can't do every other week. I want to do every week now because I need more resources, um, let me know. We can do that. Okay.

311
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:31.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any short term or long term goals that you want to add to your treatment for

312
00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:34.260
Misty Moncada: I'm

313
00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:48.390
Misty Moncada: Like I said, I'm still doing good on time remaining sober and my thing is just, I guess, I don't know, maybe that every person who are trying to stay sober staying sober fears. My biggest fears, relax.

314
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.150
Misty Moncada: All the obstacles that I have going on.

315
00:34:52.290 --> 00:35:04.260
Misty Moncada: You know me. Learning to focus or deal with day to day issues of life is my biggest fear because I've never had to deal with us so long, like 20 years so

316
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:15.360
Misty Moncada: Me dealing with stress. It's just me, learning how to cope. Right. You know, like an adult not and not be childish and not be like, Okay, I'm not gonna deal with this time around.

317
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.580
Misty Moncada: Yeah, now

318
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.890
Misty Moncada: I want to be able to learn how to cope with the

319
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.010
Misty Moncada: Last one of my long term goals. Right. Yeah.

320
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:34.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, I can tell you now what is helpful for people is to have a plan put in place already don't wait for the moment to come where your trigger and then try to come up with a plan.

321
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:43.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's why I said, What would you do if PL says you can't go. It's already having a plan.

322
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.980
In place.

323
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.420
Sorry, I guess. Okay.

324
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.360
Misty Moncada: From money to decorate.

325
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:54.660
Misty Moncada: My god.

326
00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:02.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's already having that friend be in place so that I shared my screen with you I'm

327
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:08.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Saying that you know how to respond when it happened because this is a natural course of sobriety.

328
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:19.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To have the temptations to have the triggers and to have the fear of relax. The longer you stay sober, the more confident you feel in being able to boy.

329
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:28.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I shared some red flags thoughts for you because there's a constant battle see between be addicted mind and a sober mind.

330
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:39.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And once you can find the distinction between when the added mine is speaking to you. And when the sober mind is speaking to you. That's where you can get a better sense of how to navigate

331
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:50.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right. So these are what these are some of the terms that the addicted. My will tell you when you're having those moments of anger, frustration with communication.

332
00:36:50.700 --> 00:37:02.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it will tell you that you have to, you have to either pop up and just say, how you feel, with no filter, you have to eat or drink or you have to use heroin.

333
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Addicted mind that speaking to you.

334
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On the other hand, sober mind is telling you pause and reflect

335
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The added mind will convince you to keep secrets. Nobody has to know

336
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:31.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No one's here but you already activated the sober minded, you told me a session I'm I'm fearful that I might slip up because it's a lot of bad stuff happening right

337
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.270
Misty Moncada: I am. I'm very fearful because I get really frustrated and like

338
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:44.820
Misty Moncada: In my ways the frustration. We're just running to a needle in my arm, and I felt so much better. I had no worries. I had stress, I'm

339
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:56.940
Misty Moncada: Running to a bottle and injury, Tina. And I feel like okay I'm perfectly fine now. So that's what stresses me because I know if I split my arm. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna

340
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:04.500
Misty Moncada: I'm not gonna, I don't know how to do heroin. Just one night and be okay. No, I'm going to be on a mission for like

341
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:08.970
Misty Moncada: Two, three weeks to no one's going to hear from me. Talk to me. And I'm asked for any phone calls or

342
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.680
Misty Moncada: Emails, or I'm not going to care.

343
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:11.670
And so

344
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.410
Misty Moncada: I just

345
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:30.660
Misty Moncada: I'm being really strong about that and I'm proud of myself and I feel like I'm a bit overwhelmed. As soon as we got here. I slept like the first three days. Um, I slept and like my aunt was like

346
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.830
Misty Moncada: My mom likes me to get up my moms like old fashioned

347
00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:35.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like you

348
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.260
Misty Moncada: gotta, you gotta

349
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:41.220
Misty Moncada: I am spike know personally and so

350
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.770
Misty Moncada: I think I was still overwhelmed with

351
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:48.960
Misty Moncada: Life and everything going on. I rest for three days. I finally got up and I was to have to get up now.

352
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.840
Misty Moncada: I kind of felt like once I got here and saving happy. I felt like I was depressed.

353
00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:03.660
Misty Moncada: That was weird. Once I got here, I felt like, Dad, or maybe overwhelmed or I don't know what it was, but I just

354
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.930
Misty Moncada: I wanted to pull up in this bathroom and

355
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:09.420
Misty Moncada: So,

356
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:20.370
Misty Moncada: I don't know, maybe because what I'm coping with or what I'm going through, or I don't know so many emotions. I have mixed emotion right now. I don't know how to cook. Right. Yeah.

357
00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:26.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. And because earlier you said you like it there. You want to move there.

358
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:44.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But then you said, now you're saying that it felt the pressing. And I'm wondering if when you got there and you slap. It's probably because like you mentioned, this is a different scenery. This is a different environment. You can let your guard down and just allow yourself to rest.

359
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.800
Misty Moncada: And I can I say, Okay, I don't know. I hope I'm just going to work.

360
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.210
Misty Moncada: Hi baby, my girl.

361
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.000
Misty Moncada: Okay, let me let me too. I'm

362
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.930
Misty Moncada: Using this when I first started my addiction.

363
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:04.980
Misty Moncada: Maybe did I feel that way. And I don't know, I thought I'd ask you that.

364
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.240
Misty Moncada: When I live here. I was a bad crack it like

365
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.150
Misty Moncada: Bad because I started crap. Before I started here.

366
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.970
Misty Moncada: And this is where my addiction was

367
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.830
Misty Moncada: Yeah, we're

368
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:27.930
Misty Moncada: Started out. So when I got here. I haven't been hearing years and I know I changed in that I don't do that anymore. But I think maybe I got kind of air.

369
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:41.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: As a trigger person, places and things are triggers where you used to use. It's a trigger. And even if the last drug of choice was heroin because you had an extent of other drugs.

370
00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:50.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The addy brain will convince you that it doesn't matter any brain may tell you he wants to try the craft is not as bad as the heroin.

371
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:52.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I did.

372
00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.820
Misty Moncada: It. I just want

373
00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You to use

374
00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.860
Misty Moncada: I started smoking crack cocaine here.

375
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.240
Misty Moncada: And when I moved from here was when I got started on my hair.

376
00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:09.870
Misty Moncada: I started my heroin addiction here as well and move back to New Mexico. I'm from New Mexico.

377
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.460
Misty Moncada: That was years

378
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:15.300
Misty Moncada: So I took that heroin addiction. Oh yeah, but I was only smoking.

379
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.490
Misty Moncada: Heroin I started here then.

380
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.930
Misty Moncada: Ended up

381
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:32.700
Misty Moncada: Doing more there but like this for like a whole 10 years here. I was wrong crack cocaine. So when I got here. I think you I was kind of scared. Today I will go to the store before before our therapy, man.

382
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:43.140
Misty Moncada: And I drove down that way down the whole story just to see how how much change and like it didn't make me nervous and

383
00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.140
Misty Moncada: The drive down that way cuz I don't know anybody here anymore.

384
00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.030
Misty Moncada: But it made me nervous.

385
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.410
Misty Moncada: Yeah.

386
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:55.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So could it be in in tune with this environment is the trigger for you.

387
00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so maybe even challenging, would it be best to move back here.

388
00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:19.890
