00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:22.470
Matthew Knauff: An EMT, and if you turn 18 within so long you can start your EMT basic class when you're 17 like the half. So I did that and I hurt my back and my Squadron, and went to the hospital. I was already getting invited in. Yes, though at 17 every month, like I got 44 from my family doctor

628
00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:33.510

Natalie Austin: Oh yeah. Did you say a pain management doctor that point.

633
00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:57.090
Matthew Knauff: It was a theme a doctor that I worked with, but I didn't see a payment with Dr. I ended up seeing the pain management doctor

634
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:58.020
Natalie Austin: Okay.

635
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:06.750
Matthew Knauff: And I had myself convince them. I had this awful pain that you know was, but I mean it really wasn't yet. I was terribly, terribly addicted to

636
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.810
Matthew Knauff: Opioids I mean that was

637
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:11.400
Matthew Knauff: My life.

638
00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:15.180
Natalie Austin: Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.930
Matthew Knauff: I mean, windy prescribing them to me. I went there, seeking them after cigno

640
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:35.880
Matthew Knauff: I don't. Yeah. And I would manipulated him very much because i right at that time, like I was temping in doctors offices and people from Purdue and endo were coming in in teaching you how to look for what a drug seeker was like and what

641
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:43.080
Matthew Knauff: Yeah years were. And so I I learned all that very well. Exactly what to say what not to say.

642
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:50.400
Natalie Austin: Yeah you been in the medical field, you would know that

643
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:51.840
Yeah.

644
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:54.990
Natalie Austin: Okay. So how old are you now.

645
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:56.640
Matthew Knauff: I'm 37

646
00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.730
Natalie Austin: Okay, so this all started when you're like 15

647
00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.730
Natalie Austin: Wow, it's a long time. Huh.

648
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:03.960

650
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:15.840
Matthew Knauff: Clean I had almost overdosed and I had heard about you just started here in my area about, you know, Suboxone and stuff.

651
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:28.200
Matthew Knauff: Because I never even considered getting clean because I never even thought there was that I never even had that hope or anything. It was even 16 there for me and for once. I thought maybe there is like there was a little bit of hope. And so I

652
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.750
Matthew Knauff: When I want and was

653

Matthew Knauff: Oh my goodness, just from opioids, not from right

704
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:08.430
Natalie Austin: Right, right. Well, that's more than focusing on opioids.

705
00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:09.690
Natalie Austin: Yeah, but

706
00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:16.080
Natalie Austin: Because that's what the medicines treats to buy the medicine doesn't treat all the other stuff.

707
00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:17.550
I know

708
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:23.640
Natalie Austin: Yeah, that'd be nice to have a treatment for methamphetamine. So, yeah.

709
00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:34.290
Matthew Knauff: I was actually invited for a long time for that. And it really helped, but, um, when I had my last relapse. The on one testosterone and also in dem it

710
00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:45.780
Matthew Knauff: This a new doctor calm for my family doctor and she was a nurse practitioner, she getting believed in me getting either of them to leave in testosterone treatment and she believed in the

00:57:46.170 --> 00:58:00.450
Matthew Knauff: By these become more thing, and she just like cold turkey quit taking a week off of it and I've been on testosterone so long. It made my body quit producing its own so I gave you like 60 pounds and went into is pretty rough and so I

712
00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.870
Matthew Knauff: When I relapse doing amphetamines last so

713
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.890

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.370
Matthew Knauff: That's not excuse but

715
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:12.030
Natalie Austin: I know well let's kind of traumatizing

716
00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:26.250

Natalie Austin: Yeah. Okay. Okay.

723
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.140
Natalie Austin: Do you see a psychiatrist for that.

724
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.710
Matthew Knauff: No, no, I just see my family practitioner.

725
00:58:59.100 --> 00:58:59.430
Okay.

726
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:10.680
Matthew Knauff: Are you in Ohio. Also, or

727
00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:15.630
Natalie Austin: No, I'm actually, I'm right over the border though I'm in Pennsylvania.

728
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:20.940
Matthew Knauff: Oh, I used to go to a doctor in Pennsylvania, actually, when it was hard in Washington, Pennsylvania.

729
00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.860
Matthew Knauff: Oh, yeah, yeah.

730
00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.010
Matthew Knauff: He was a recovery pathways.

731
00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:28.170
Natalie Austin: Oh yeah, I've heard of that. Okay.

732
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:33.420
Matthew Knauff: That was like a far drive it was three hours. One way though.

733
00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:35.700
Natalie Austin: Yeah, I was gonna say

734
00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:38.520
Natalie Austin: As far

735
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:43.920
Natalie Austin: Okay, so you have low testosterone. How do you get that your age.

736
00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:49.260
Matthew Knauff: Is actually why I don't know by time you're

737
00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.380
Matthew Knauff: In your 30s, that can actually happen like

738
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:57.060
Matthew Knauff: And there's a big debate on what's low but mine was like super, super low

739
00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:03.510
Matthew Knauff: So I don't know if my I think maybe that my natural leaders on the lower side always

740
01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:07.560
Matthew Knauff: And that's maybe why when you quicker.

741
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:08.820
Natalie Austin: Okay.

742
01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:14.430
Matthew Knauff: Because I remember when I was younger, having it done and it was like in the like the lower range of what it was.

743
01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:16.830
Natalie Austin: But that was still considered normal. So

744
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:24.750
Matthew Knauff: I would say that that's probably what maybe had to be with what my problem was, because it completely took the depression like basically away.

745
01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.860
Natalie Austin: Okay, that's great. Wow. It's wild how are

746
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:33.330
Natalie Austin: You know, our hormones affect our mood today.

747
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.820
Matthew Knauff: Yeah, I would never dreamed that

748
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.950
Matthew Knauff: It would do anything like that.

749
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.540
Natalie Austin: I know. Wow.

750
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:42.990
Natalie Austin: Okay, so

751
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.740
Natalie Austin: Let's go into the past medical history.

752
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:54.330
Natalie Austin: Yep, chronic pain syndrome opioid dependence low testosterone.

753
01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:59.970
Natalie Austin: History of depression, any other day of diabetes.

754
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:03.960
Natalie Austin: Thyroid high cholesterol.

755
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:06.030
Natalie Austin: Note on that.

756
01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.400
Natalie Austin: Any other medical diagnosis. Besides those four

757
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:16.290
Matthew Knauff: Nobody's having anxiety and as we've been told for like over a decade and

758
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:18.180
Matthew Knauff: My dad.

759
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:32.970
Matthew Knauff: He died like right in front of me and went into cardiac arrest and I live in a small town and there wasn't the squad was out. So it was like 45 minutes before we could get help in it. Me being empty it really messed with me and so

760
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:44.790
Matthew Knauff: I after that really got battle and the bentos like it and I started going to this place and day. I told him I would agree to taper down, but I really didn't consider it.

761
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:49.860
Matthew Knauff: And I just got to where I thought I could handle. Nothing anymore. Like I know Mike said he got worse.

762
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:55.860
Matthew Knauff: And I guess it was just between doses. I was kind of going into withdrawal, a little bit. And that's why we felt like I couldn't handle nothing

763
01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:09.420
Matthew Knauff: In that that was another good thing happened around the tempo and testosterone was I tapered off the business. I couldn't believe that I done it. That's been like two years now and that I feel so much better from that.

764
01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:10.680
Okay.

765
01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:12.810
Natalie Austin: It was

766
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.660
