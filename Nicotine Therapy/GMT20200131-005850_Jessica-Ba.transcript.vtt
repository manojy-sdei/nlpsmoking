Misty Moncada: Okay, how

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: About now much better. Yeah.

10
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.260
Misty Moncada: Okay i i've never logged in on my tablet and I have a chapter of the keyboard. And I thought, I tried for the first time, but

11
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.290
Misty Moncada: I guess it's not working. Great. So

12
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I was just like a lot of rattling

13
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.390
Misty Moncada: So hey,

14
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you been since we last spoke

15
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.090
Misty Moncada: I'm good, I'm good. I'm doing

16
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.720
Misty Moncada: I'm doing a lot of meetings.

17
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:47.430
Misty Moncada: I went like last week, I went to Celebrate Recovery. I went to work as I went to the gym twice I had mental health therapy. I had a group, my group session on Friday. I've been doing everything I can. And I had community service.

18
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:59.370
Misty Moncada: So I'm doing everything I can to remain sober, I feel a little overwhelmed. But today, I didn't have anything to do. So I went to work out at the gym and I got my grandson ready for school and I slept.

19
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, was making me feel overwhelmed.

20
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.480
Misty Moncada: Because I'm not used to regular life and doing all this stuff.

21
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.320
Misty Moncada: This is all new to me.

22
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what's this process been like for you.

23
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.190
Misty Moncada: Um, it

24
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.310
Misty Moncada: I mean, I'm doing it, I'm just

25
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.180
Misty Moncada: Like a little bit overwhelmed by it but I'm getting it done. So I'm trying to adjust the best I can.

26
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:55.200
Misty Moncada: I don't know. I guess it's okay yeah I mean today. My mom let me sleep and I like she just let me rest. So I slept quite a bit. And I don't know if it's I'm pushing myself so I because I don't. When I have idle time I think about getting high.

27
00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.410
Misty Moncada: Yeah. So in order for me to not do that. I just stay busy.

28
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, that's a good, that's a good thing to do. I always encourage people that have it stabilized.

29
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Fully in the recovery like some people have been so for so long you speak to them. They say, there really aren't any trump triggers. They don't see themselves going back

30
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:32.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But the fact that you can acknowledge that you're in a vulnerable state of your sobriety where you need to remain committed and that committed means just keep in my mind map the drug and anything aside from that will trigger

31
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:45.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: A relapse. So just that awareness can help keep you accountable. Now the therapies that you see is she working on other things where she working solely on your relapse.

32
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.640
Misty Moncada: And sobriety, geez.

33
00:06:48.900 --> 00:07:01.290
Misty Moncada: I started seeing her because I was diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety. So I've been seeing her since last year. Well, I started seeing a different therapists and she's my new one. And then when I got put on probation.

34
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:20.430
Misty Moncada: I had to start seeing their therapy for mental health and having a group once a week for mental health. So I'm now I have to go. But I had been going on my own for much trying to get some sort of help with my mental like the mental illness that they diagnosed me with and my addiction.

35
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Whoa.

36
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like you mental health and the addiction.

37
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.480
When

38
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Will you usually it's like the main focus

39
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:49.560
Misty Moncada: I'm like, I like what I'm doing right now. I like the pattern. So like my focus is sobriety and I like knowing that I can vent to her.

40
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:58.230
Misty Moncada: I can talk to her, she put me in a class and I had my first group on Tuesday, and she asked me how I felt about it and I liked it like

41
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:13.050
Misty Moncada: It was not like a strict OH group. It was like everybody got to talk about issues and we play Bingo. And, you know, it was just a different kind of groups. So for me I my focus is sobriety with all these groups and her. Yeah.

42
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:26.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What, what would be the difference between you go to those groups and that therapy versus right how it helps groups in therapy. I just want to make sure I don't cross in one

43
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:39.510
Misty Moncada: I'm, uh, I'm okay with both of them. Like I feel like the more feedback. I'm getting on my addiction, the better. I feel like I'm okay with this therapy with you. I'm okay with my group every Friday.

44
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:53.310
Misty Moncada: Um, I like in group on Friday, how she posted like pictures for us to see and like you know explain to us things that I never recognized. So I'm learning for everything.

45
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's been your biggest takeaway so far I'm

46
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: From legacy score.

47
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: NPS me

48
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.700
Misty Moncada: Might be biggest sweat.

49
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:16.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your biggest takeaway from just everything. You mentioned the group you're Learning Ally both of the programs. What's been like a big takeaway for you that you just kind of been thinking about

50
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.160
Misty Moncada: Um, I'm

51
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:30.420
Misty Moncada: Like, I don't know, I just think that like the pros and cons. Like when I start getting overwhelmed. I just think of how far I've come.

52
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:41.100
Misty Moncada: You know, so I'm like, when I start getting frustrated, like I've been going to the gym. So, because I know I've been getting like irritable with everything lately I've been a

53
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:51.360
Misty Moncada: Like just hateful about beings. And I don't know if that's just because I'm not used to life itself. But when I start thinking about good I think about the bad I should think about that. I think about

54
00:09:51.720 --> 00:10:02.010
Misty Moncada: The good you know kind of Wayne both things outside unbalanced. I just don't stay positive. I think about all the negative things in case it were to happen. Yeah.

55
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:13.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, you've been to so many different things so many different experiences that you're almost waiting for the next event to happen.

56
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so

57
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:20.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With that, yeah, comes the anxiety. You know, so your bag gnosis but also

58
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:36.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Intensify that you know when you're focused on are you so used to things that working well. A lot of people are conditioned then to just wait for. Okay, what's next, what's the next experience that I have where I will be a she's

59
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.280
Misty Moncada: A writer writer.

60
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I want to share a video with you.

61
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That helps to do just some basic

62
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Regulation, so that when you find yourself.

63
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In a position of

64
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Influence and you can kind of do this self check in.

65
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:03.600
Misty Moncada: Okay.

66
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can you hear it.

67
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.140
Misty Moncada: No.

68
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:39.600
Misty Moncada: It sounds like it's cutting out mind body practices and mindfulness practices that can help you and your clients to regulate your mind, your body, your emotions and even your impulses

69
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:51.600
Misty Moncada: Now I learned recently that we have close to 100,000 thoughts. A day all swirling around in our minds, just like the glitter in this jar. You can get hard to see, or think clearly at all.

70
00:11:53.790 --> 00:12:06.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And for our clients who are maybe struggling with anxiety with depression or with trauma. We knew that most of these thoughts are going to be pretty negative pretty unpleasant often even pretty terrifying and certainly not always so accurate.

71
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:19.500
So what I want to share with you are a few ways we can help our clients just settle their minds, not to get rid of their thoughts but just to be able to see things a bit more clearly bit more accurately, in the course of day to day life.

72
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:32.490
So with that, I'd like to introduce you to a short practice. I learned over the years. It's an acronym halt, and it simply stands for a little mind body check in with yourself, you can ask yourself, are you hungry.

73
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:41.550
Are you angry or anxious, a feeling lonely unless they are you tired, and then what can you do about those things.

74
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.360
So let's start by checking in right now. Are you feeling hungry.

75
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.190
Because if we're feeling hungry. If our blood sugar is low. We know that's going to depress our mood in our clients mood.

76
00:12:54.030 --> 00:13:05.850
Well, so am I getting enough glucose into the prefrontal cortex where we think things through where we control our impulses are we see things a bit more clearly and we're really able to do are focusing and have our executive functions.

77
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:14.070
So being hungry means that we're really losing our mind not able to think so straight so we can help our clients with this a little bit with this and black and

78
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:23.100
Secondly, H stands for angry or anxious. These are basically representative of our fight and flight response, how we feel when we're stressed out.

79
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:30.240
When we're angry or anxious cortisol is coursing through us and we'll talk about how to deal with that in a moment.

80
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.450
But it's also shutting shutting off our prefrontal cortex again where we think things through.

81
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:44.130
Showing off our insular cortex where we take other people's perspective where we have empathy, where we understand where other people are coming from.

82
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:55.200
And so we're really certainly not at our best because our amygdala is turned on telling us that everything looks like a danger and really giving us an inaccurate perception of what's happening in the world around us.

83
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.680
Next return toward L lonely.

84
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:06.420
Misty Moncada: Now one old saying we have courses right if your mind is a dangerous neighborhood. Don't go there alone.

85
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:13.380
Misty Moncada: Right. That's the job of US therapists to accompany our clients and our patients when their mind is a dangerous neighborhood.

86
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:22.260
Misty Moncada: So it's encouraging them to reach out to not be so disconnected to help them build and maintain that network of support.

87
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:32.160
Misty Moncada: Because we know also from the research on positive psychology and when our clients have more emotional and social support from people around them and and network, they're going to be happier.

88
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.620
Misty Moncada: Their moods going to be better even their physical health is going to be better when they're not so long, like

89
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.400
Lastly, T stands for tired.

90
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:55.290
Misty Moncada: Now what happens when we're tired at the end of a long day. But our willpower shuts down or prefrontal cortex again shuts down can think things through can't focus can't manage our impulses, or even regulate our emotions so well.

91
00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:02.070
Misty Moncada: And what else is happening even after a night of not so good sleep, which we know so many of our clients are struggling with

92
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.860
Misty Moncada: They're actually almost losing a few IQ points for each each hour that we're not getting sleep at night.

93
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:16.050
Misty Moncada: So our clients are really not at their best in terms of learning how to take care of themselves and do the work that they need to do in therapy when they're feeling tired.

94
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:32.520
Misty Moncada: So it's a simple acronym for both ourselves and to share with our clients just check in every so often. Are you feeling hungry. Are you feeling angry or anxious feeling lonely. Are you feeling tired. What, perhaps, can you do about that.

95
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:44.850
And there's some single thing, simple things we can do for hungry and lonely and maybe even for tired. I prefer angry and anxious, what can we do. Well, this is where some mind body settling techniques can be helpful.

96
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.330
And so maybe if we have that cortisol coursing through us, that are constantly they want to shake it out.

97
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:59.250
Misty Moncada: Shake out one hand the other hand shaking your head should get your feet, your feet. It's actually helps loosen up

98
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:11.520
Misty Moncada: Saw throughout the system once or animals do after they've been stressed out, so they don't develop PTSD and quite the same way humans do. And then just stop, think we've shaken up the jar and I are self to settle

99
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.010
Pulling your hair settling on the top of your head.

100
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.830
In your island. So on top of each other.

101
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.470
Your tongue, lips settle in your mouth.

102
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.800
sensations of your hand sewing and you'll have

103
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.690
Your back and leg settling on the chair.

104
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.800
Mostly your feet settle on the floor.

105
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.260
scaling back up to your body.

106
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.490
While your eyes to open

107
00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.350
Maybe even finding yourself just a bit more settle a bit more clear. Just like the glitter on the john

108
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:15.840
So these are just a few simple practices, you can use yourself, share with your clients when they're struggling. The halt hungry angry lonely entire just a real simple mindful checking

109
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:30.870
It is shake it off and then settle it down practice and really helps us settle in ground ourselves up our clients ground themselves in the course of day to day life when they're feeling a little bit overwhelmed agitated and activated with anger, anxiety,

110
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.050
So hope you found these couple of practices.

111
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, you're on the video.

112
00:17:49.590 --> 00:18:01.320
Misty Moncada: Um, I like how he's talking about being overwhelmed because that's exactly how I felt so um I like how he is explaining like how to deal with that.

113
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:13.410
Misty Moncada: Um, that's funny, because that's what I'm dealing with right now being overwhelmed. So I think that was a good video. I think that was just meant for me to see

114
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:26.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You videos and different resources when people say certain things are just triggers me to to share certain materials, I found that video. I'm

115
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:42.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Very helpful because oftentimes we have these emotions and we don't know where that's coming from. Where's it routed from and I can tell you, if I'm hungry or from Asia is because of like time or something like that. I have a mood.

116
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like I'm very irritable.

117
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:53.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or, you know, people will try to connect with me and they're trying to figure out why. And typically, if I do the whole chicken. I can identify why

118
00:18:53.610 --> 00:19:05.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I may not be as welcoming to other people. Why I may be discipline myself from people. So this is something that I would encourage you to do every day to do a check in.

119
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:17.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And particularly in situations or events that you know will create a trigger or free environment so

120
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.320
Misty Moncada: Think about a day.

121
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:25.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To day what events situations people or places usually cause you to get into move

122
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:34.170
Misty Moncada: Um, it's just because I've had a lot to do you like probation. I had community service. And I have to start going to group for them.

123
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:45.030
Misty Moncada: And I have to see a therapist for them and I see a therapist with you and I do my group on Friday. And then I was going to as a Celebrate Recovery, but that, you know, just to do them.

124
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:54.360
Misty Moncada: So I think starting out, because I never live like life like this is so long. I'm getting overwhelmed. But I'm getting it done.

125
00:19:54.750 --> 00:20:00.090
Misty Moncada: And at the end of the day, I feel accomplished. I feel like I got it done. I'm okay. But like

126
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:14.610
Misty Moncada: During those moments. Oh, in the now I have my grandson temporary custody. He's three years old. So like, that's another thing for me is because, like all these classes. I have to go to and and I have to ask my mom to watch him.

127
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:26.430
Misty Moncada: You know, so like, I'm just so many things I'm I get a one with but it doesn't bother me as bad where I feel like I have to go use it, doesn't it, I just

128
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:38.250
Misty Moncada: I feel like I have to stop and take a deep breath and then afterwards when I've accomplished everything at the end of the day, I feel accomplished, like, wow, I did it. And I feel so good. Yeah.

129
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:55.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You describe that real well it's not necessarily the action of what you have to do because like you said you're getting it done. And that's actually a good affirmation to remind yourself every day that you're getting it done that statement in

130
00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is a sense of pride and accomplishment. So when you find yourself.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right before you want to go into group writing right before you have to go to therapy with Celebrate Recovery which appeal do that health check.

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In my hungry angry anxious Noli

135
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:27.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And whatever emotion comes comes up. You can literally do this to release all the cortisol.

136
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Allow yourself to settle

137
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.570

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:51.660
Misty Moncada: right in. I like a select at the end of the day, I feel so accomplished on like, wow, like I did it. Like, I feel so good and then

143
00:21:52.230 --> 00:22:02.130
Misty Moncada: I also like I went to Barnes and Nobles and bought a book. I wanted to read and I went and bought the a book. So like at nighttime when I feel relaxed, I can just kind of read

144
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:10.050
Misty Moncada: And then my therapist wanted me to keep a little journal my feelings that way if I ever feel like I want to

145
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:22.620
Misty Moncada: Relapse like what triggered me my feeling so I've been doing this as well. So I'm doing anything I can to remain sober and if this helps or they feel it's going to help. And I'm just going to try it.

146
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:24.330
Yeah.

152
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:53.970
Misty Moncada: Now and then I just got put on probation. Barely. So I got out of jail on the wealth and

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:21.990
Misty Moncada: So, I mean, there's a lot of things I'm having to do, but I, I'm okay with that. Like, I'm not stressing. Like I said, I just get a little frustrated but that's okay. That's going to happen to me, you know,

166
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:15.120

167
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:31.950
Misty Moncada: I'm going to be more overwhelmed. But like, I'm also I had other appointments that not just what I had to focus on. Like I made an eye doctor point being got glasses. Again, I made a dentist's appointment and had my cleaning, um,

Misty Moncada: So, you know, those are other appointments that I got done and I was okay with that. Like it was

170
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:56.520
Misty Moncada: Okay, right now, you know, because I got everything that I needed to and I needed new glasses, which I should have monitoring.

171
00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:08.280
Misty Moncada: But I was cleaning. So I took them off, you know, and then I needed my teeth clean and you know I needed to go for annual. So these were things that I threw in the back burner and didn't care about

172
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:19.560
Misty Moncada: So for me right now. I just spill so good that I'm focusing on what needs to be done and like my calendar was all this whole month and then now like

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I'm seeing that all of these things that you're doing to

176
00:25:43.230 --> 00:26:01.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Improve yourself. You know, I'm already seeing the fruits of that I'm seeing it from to supply because I'm hearing when you speak that if you come up with this is overwhelming. I'll hear you say. But I'm getting it done. You know, you would say, I'm stressed, but I'm okay. Right.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And right there is yes already replaced the

178
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.450

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:20.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Case inactive those negative thoughts stopping it and replacing it with the affirmation interested to know how old in your style of thinking. Was this a new skill that you you're using

181
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:26.670
Misty Moncada: As a new skill that I'm using. And I'm learning from you guys. I'm learning for bright heart health. Every Friday.

182
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:42.990
Misty Moncada: I'm learning from therapy. I'm learning from Celebrate Recovery every little piece that I get from anybody I'm putting these all together. Now, the old me, I would have been like, I don't care. I don't care what I have to do so leave me alone. I'm

183
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:53.700
Misty Moncada: I am so proud of myself. I'VE BEEN SOBER SINCE January 1 faithfully because I did a shot of heroin on January 1. That was my last day. So like for me.

184
00:26:54.690 --> 00:27:04.440
Misty Moncada: I have. I haven't had my veins itch lot but like the craving in my mouth. No, because I'm on the program, you know, and I'm doing I'm taking my Suboxone but

185
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:21.720
Misty Moncada: Like I know my veins itch and that kind of bothers me. But like, other than that, like, I'm so proud of myself because to me, I've come a long way. You know 29 days to me is is amazing, you know, to just faithfully be off of heroin. What's the

186
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's the longest time span that you've been offered

187
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:34.170
Misty Moncada: I can remember like when I went to prison. Prison didn't even stop me from doing heroin.

188
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:42.810
Misty Moncada: And I did heroin in prison, and then I know I've stopped, like maybe months at a time. But restarted. I think maybe just a few months.

189
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:59.970
Misty Moncada: I've never actually stopped completely like I've never had a year of sobriety. I've never had six months of sobriety. It was always some sort of drug, whether it was pills or heroin or or math or whatever I could get my hands on it one time, you know, I didn't care. But then

190
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:09.180
Misty Moncada: Then you know the last few years, it was just heroin heroin heroin and I just couldn't stop. Yeah.

191
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well,

192
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:18.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We spoke last you also said that you were going on dinner with your ex husband.

193
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.020
Yes, that go

194
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.450
Misty Moncada: It's good. We

195
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:36.900
Misty Moncada: We decided not to start any type of relationship because we're both hailing he's been sober like two years and I'm really new my sobriety. He's been pushing me to

196
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:49.410
Misty Moncada: To be better, but we just decided not to even pursue anything because we're both we both just need to get through our problems. First, but it was amazing. And he's been amazing support for me.

197
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How are you feeling about that decision.

198
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.230
Misty Moncada: How do I feel about

199
00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What about the decision.

200
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:01.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not

201
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:17.820
Misty Moncada: I liked the decision because I just broke up with a boyfriend that I had a you know and like, I'm still not over him and my ex husband has a girlfriend had ex girlfriend, he's still not over and

202
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.070
Misty Moncada: I don't want us to just be wanting to talk to each other because we both feel lonely, you know,

203
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:31.950
Misty Moncada: So the best thing for me right now is I'm still new in my sobriety and I don't want to. I don't want to mess that up because what if I

204
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:40.500
Misty Moncada: Getting to relationship is going to mess things up and I'm going to get frustrated. I'm going to want to use or it's just going to set me back and therefore I don't want that.

205
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:50.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell me you know as being me. I want to learn more about misty find out the best way for

206
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What are some of your best quality.

207
00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:10.200
Misty Moncada: I don't know, like I'm trying to find myself. It's been so long since I knew me like I don't know what my likes or dislikes. Um, I know that I want it. I don't know where I wanted to learn how to play the guitar.

208
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:24.240
Misty Moncada: I just don't know me right now. And that's just my big thing is just learning me all over again because I'm just still new in my sobriety. So I have to find me all over again.

209
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:28.680
Misty Moncada: I mean, the old me

210
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:35.100
Misty Moncada: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Just the old me was a bad person. You know, so there's no likes about that, you know,

211
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:43.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That was going to be my question, you know, younger version of yourself with any quality about that.

212
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:51.210
Misty Moncada: Now, I was very violent I lived on I just the streets were for me.

213
00:30:52.320 --> 00:31:06.360
Misty Moncada: I was a violent person I was a victim of violent crimes um I indulged in that kind of lifestyle guns and knives and drugs and and Gang life. And I didn't care. So

214
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.240
Misty Moncada: For me, I can honestly say I enjoyed that at that time.

215
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.770
Misty Moncada: To me it was

216
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:21.450
Misty Moncada: It was it was what I liked it that time. But like, now I can say that I think it's embarrassing.

217
00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:23.760
Misty Moncada: I think that

218
00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:30.960
Misty Moncada: I look so dumb. You know, it's just, I'm glad that I'm not doing that stupid crap anymore.

219
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Violent crimes. I'm

220
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In your victim of violent crimes, because you did tell me during the

221
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Bio psychosocial you sold drugs. Correct.

222
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.360
Misty Moncada: Yeah I sold drugs and use drugs and then

223
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:59.400
Misty Moncada: I've been shot twice, and I've been stabbed one time and I stabbed two people. One time, so like

224
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:07.530
Misty Moncada: I first violent crime. I got off on the second one. He didn't show up to court. So is less retards you know so

225
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:17.550
Misty Moncada: Everything for me was like it was just violence, violence, violence drugs in the street life so living this life right now is

226
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.380
Misty Moncada: Um, I mean, I've lived it before. You know what I'm saying. But like

227
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:30.240
Misty Moncada: It's just, it's different. It's different, but I'm finding a pattern to cope with it and

228
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:31.800
Misty Moncada: And

229
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So someone that has

230
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The history of violent crime.

231
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What will be your worst fear.

232
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:55.800
Misty Moncada: Um, I don't know. I have PTSD of sharp objects lying around. So like I think my worst fear is it's it's crazy like

233
00:32:56.370 --> 00:33:10.740
Misty Moncada: Leaving something sharp where someone has access naked stabbed me like that's one of my worst fears right now and I got stabbed in 2008 and I still have PTSD bad, like when I wash dishes, I have to put the forks and knives away because they're sharp objects.

234
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:19.590
Misty Moncada: It's just, that's the only my biggest fear is it, I don't know, like, I don't know if I'll get over that.

235
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:39.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's a common recurrent when you have PTSD. It can be any sites, it could be smells. It could be as many people, places, or things that trigger bad experience that almost six years back to that present to that past situation.

236
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that what happens when you see sharp objects.

237
00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:55.860
Misty Moncada: Yes. And then also a Freshly Cut Grass reminds me of the smell of methamphetamines and I don't know why. So when I smell.

238
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:12.810
Misty Moncada: Freshly Cut Grass, I get nauseous. Because like I've been around people who cooked it and that's what it smells like. To me, so like that's a trigger on because I did heroin for so long. If I smell something sour, like vinegar or

239
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:28.020
Misty Moncada: salty, sour, it's a trigger from me, because that's what it smells like. When I would cook it on a spoon BEFORE I SHUT UP, it's a sour smell. So for me, those were those are triggers for me.

240
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:46.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's good that you've identified that I'm going along with what you mentioned with the PTSD. The way to help kind of reduce those events of you going back to incident where you were sad is allowing you to restore that

241
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:59.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So typically when we have memories there imprints in our brain of an experience when it's a traumatic experience. It doesn't go through the regular flow of going to the hippocampus.

242
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:17.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Been going through our meal frontal cortex so that it can just be stored as a memory and once it started as a memory. You can kind of retail the events like it happened in the past, but when it's something traumatic. It doesn't go through that same storage process. So it says forget the

243
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.570
Misty Moncada: Hippocampus

244
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:38.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It goes straight to the amygdala and the amygdala, it gets triggered. Right. So when it gets triggered and flooded with events that will be stressful. It doesn't store itself in the meal frontal cortex. It continues with the fight or flight response. So that will make sense as

245
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:51.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To why when you got stabbed in time you see a sharp object, you go into maybe the flight or fight or had been in your situation kind of Please reflect and

246
00:35:52.020 --> 00:36:05.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then, remind yourself that you're in a kitchen, you're in the present day. And when you continue to do that. Those grounding techniques. What it does each time it gives you a brand new opportunity to restore that past

247
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:05.880
Events.

248
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:13.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that over time you distance yourself from going back to the past and now my new yourself.

249
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:21.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I say all this to say that even though is a traumatic experience there is hope that while you still have these

250
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can reprocess it

251
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In your mind so that you're not as easily.

252
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going back to those flashbacks.

253
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.660
Misty Moncada: Right. Right. Okay.

254
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:41.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the reason why I asked about the fears is because a lot of those fears, they play out in our everyday life.

255
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:42.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You don't

256
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:43.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even know it.

257
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we can be triggered I'll share an experience with you when I

258
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was younger

259
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I had several different situations.

260
00:36:52.140 --> 00:37:03.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where there were just big dogs that would approach me and they would be barking and I would just be terrified and it was always when I was walking one time was when I was walking to

261
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.570
Misty Moncada: Have Emma's

262
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:12.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: House, there will be a group of dogs and these were rough dogs. Remember those like chain link fences, because back in the day guys weren't living in houses like

263
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.520
Misty Moncada: They were outside dogs.

264
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:23.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so I was walking and a gang of them just kind of surrounded me and my younger brother, which is barking and

265
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My dad had to run out.

266
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then they all, you know, please, then there was another situation. I was

267
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.150
Misty Moncada: Lucky

268
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:43.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was like an open field and out of nowhere. A dog just came out of that field and just started barking and me and my brother died across a busy street so those experiences in itself.

269
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Cause my middle to be triggered. And so, missy. If I'm

270
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:55.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Thinking in a parking lot, if I'm walking and someone's jiggling their keys that sound immediately triggers.

271
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's a dog behind me, because the sound.

272
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:14.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Of the key. Wow. Most mirrors either a leash for change the color. So there's been times where I'm See I'm walking in the pipeline and somebody could be walking and running with their kids and their hand. I'll turn around so quickly.

273
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.060
Vital

274
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the way I do that, the way I

275
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:30.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: remind myself. Okay, calm down. Don't be fearful, as I have to take deep breaths and i i replay those past moments and I say, but right now I'm in the parking lot.

276
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right now I'm saying there is an adult.

277
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:45.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And granted, you know, some people would even say will try exposure therapy, they'll say surround yourself or go to a big dog and see how responsive.

278
00:38:45.420 --> 00:39:03.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you have a little relationship with a dog that's big, then maybe that will change the situation. Um, but sometimes immersing yourself in those situations isn't a requirement. It's just really just reprogramming your mind. But I give the example to

279
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:13.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Say that, even me as a therapist that knows the skills and know what to do. That sound triggers that response in me because of my amygdala.

280
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:23.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right because of just is there to protect us to say, hey, something's going on run fight to check the date to touch yourself.

281
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.500
Misty Moncada: Right.

282
00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.130
Misty Moncada: And then with the pressure. Yes.

283
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:39.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Smells I would say you should carry something around that you can smell at any given moment to kind of replace the other smell.

284
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:54.660
Misty Moncada: Right and see. I like how you explain to you what triggers you because I get a better insight of, like, for me, I'm just like, I'm, I'm not calm about it like

285
00:39:55.650 --> 00:40:07.290
Misty Moncada: I know like during the summer when I smell the smell of the grass like I get like antsy and I have to get away from that smell and it's like everywhere in the air. Yeah. Um, so like I like how you explained it.

286
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:14.400
Misty Moncada: To me because, you know, in my mind, I'm thinking, am I the only one that has these issues. That's the way I feel

287
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:21.390
Misty Moncada: And and I feel like, Am I the only one in some time in the past, I would get embarrassed to explain myself to a therapist or

288
00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:33.930
Misty Moncada: Or counseling because I felt like I was the only one who had these weird thoughts and you know so I really like how you use yours and showed me that you had him because it makes me feel more comfortable. Yeah.

289
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:35.310
Misty Moncada: Yeah.

290
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:42.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're all we're all human beings that have experiences that have changed our perception on events.

291
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:55.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And some people I tell the story to it, their dog lovers, they can't even imagine. While be afraid of a good job. You know, they always say, well, he's such a sweet dog. Hello, I'm here to know him. Just keep him away from me.

292
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.000
Misty Moncada: So I'm

293
00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Myself, you know, I

294
00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:06.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have several people that will say, oh, he's a sweetheart. Well, he's a sweetheart to you, but he may not be a sweetheart. To me, it's still that imprint.

295
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:19.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That I see a big dog it registers trauma. I see a big dog it registers feel. Um, and, and I just need to and I continuously work through that experience.

296
00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:30.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I actually got a dog to kind of help me to get accustomed to pets and their behaviors and understand. So now I can walk past someone's walking the big dog.

297
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.590
Misty Moncada: I can walk past them without the same

298
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Level of fear that I had years ago.

299
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:44.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But that's because I had to do first. The replacing the thoughts and based on what you shared

300
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're already really good at that.

301
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:48.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With replacing the thoughts.

302
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.790
Misty Moncada: So you just need the additional rules.

303
00:41:50.850 --> 00:42:02.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: right not to just replace the thought, but then also we replaced the memory so sharp object or I like what you do you handle those first you put those objects away.

304
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:19.350
Misty Moncada: Yes, I've always done that, even when I was high or drunk. My thoughts of being hurt. We're 100% more in my mind like I'm when I'm high I feel

305
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:33.120
Misty Moncada: Like if someone's going to get me. I'm going to get them first kind of feeling so my thoughts on anything sharp were were crazy. Like now that I'm not high. They're still there, but they're not as a tense. So

306
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:37.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The ground.

307
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:38.700
Misty Moncada: So I'm doing it.

308
00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:39.450
Yeah.

309
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.960
Misty Moncada: I'm I am I'm doing the best I can. I'm proud of myself, I'm

310
00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:55.080
Misty Moncada: I'm proud of myself. I had a UA today for probation and I passed it like like for me that made me feel really good because

311
00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:15.870
Misty Moncada: In the past, it's like okay like I was on drugs and like for me to pass out UAE and my pod in the past when I was on adult probation, I would always run or be like, Oh, I'm dirty. So today, that was accomplishment for me being being having a clean your way. So, yeah, yeah.

312
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:26.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The lingering theme that I'm hearing you talk about is having pride, you, you're very proud of yourself. You know, this week in your accomplishments

313
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:36.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So think about that you recapping you reflect on your day come up with one takeaway one word that would describe your progress.

314
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:57.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you want to build more success stories that eventually you'll distance yourself from the identity of being that addicts that you know avoided her peel that didn't have any instruction didn't have any responsibility. A U shaped that identity with the new misty

315
00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.490
Misty Moncada: Them. Right, right.

316
00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:10.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, you know, the same way you did it with with the minds and the sharp objects is contrast so now you want to try to distance yourself from the old ones.

317
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:18.870
Misty Moncada: Also, I'm really happy because now I've been posting positive affirmations on Facebook, as well as a

318
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:35.670
Misty Moncada: More godly affirmations scriptures. I'm positive about the overcoming drug addiction and like I key. I'm like, had like a handful of people tell me that I'm inspiring them to get help.

319
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:45.060
Misty Moncada: So that made me feel good to like. And then also, when I went to go check when I went to metro how to my therapist. I told her that I was on this program.

320
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.820
Misty Moncada: And she wanted your guys's information. So if she ever had to help addicts come clean.

321
00:44:51.240 --> 00:45:00.420
Misty Moncada: She would help them so that made me feel good that my peels. Like, can I have that information and I gave her your guys's address and number and everything because I thought, Wow.

322
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:07.620
Misty Moncada: She could reach out to others, you know, and I'm glad I mentioned that. So it, but I know I gotta fix myself first. I can't just think I could fix

323
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:08.430
Everybody

324
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:17.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But what you're doing is you're building a relationship of accountability to. So when you're out there, you're posting things on Facebook.

325
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:32.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You're sharing information, but at the same time, it's almost like you're sending the message that hold me accountable, right, because if you can't tell your child, don't hit someone and you turn around right in front of their face and hit someone

326
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:42.960
Misty Moncada: That's what I told my mom yesterday or the day for Ashley. I was talking to my mom and I said, I have to lead by example and practice what I preach because

327
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:57.000
Misty Moncada: Like I post these positive things and then I told I was telling my mom that like I want to live by that and I just don't want to be a different person by. So, you know, I was just talking about that. The day before yesterday. Yes.

328
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what affirmation. Do you think you'll carry on for the rest of the week.

329
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:06.930
Misty Moncada: I'm

330
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.240
Misty Moncada: Positive

331
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:14.910
Misty Moncada: Encouraging I'm motivated

332
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:20.550
Misty Moncada: emotive motivation for me as a positive affirmation, um,

333
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:34.080
Misty Moncada: I know to me some variety of course you know sobriety, of course, and I got kind of upset the other day, because I had a friend who wanted to go to church with me and

334
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:41.760
Misty Moncada: And I haven't seen him in a long time. He's been sober off alcohol, two months. So we went to church and after church.

335
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:53.190
Misty Moncada: And he's like, damn, I wish I had some money. So to go buy something to drink and drink. And I was like, I've been sober and he was like, Come on. One little mini won't hurt so um

336
00:46:54.090 --> 00:47:04.500
Misty Moncada: I said, could you take me home because I he gave me a ride to churches vehicle. So today, I told him that I'm that I need to step back from being his friend because

337
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:16.590
Misty Moncada: He's, he's breaking my focus right now on things and I told because like, not only that, like, he's like, let me go pick you up so we can hang out and let's just have one drink and he keeps like pushing me

338
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:28.200
Misty Moncada: Or keep saying little things. And so today I told him, you're, you're just like, I'm not focused when I, when I talk to you and I got to kind of step away from our friendship. Right now I need to focus on me.

339
00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:37.200
Misty Moncada: So, oh, that just kind of bothered me because if he was my real friend, he wouldn't have done that crap and and he actually has been a real friend of mine for years, but

340
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:46.380
Misty Moncada: I, I just got so upset. Like why would you do that to me, you know, and I didn't explain that to him. I just said, I just got to step back for our friendship. Yeah.

341
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:55.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which was the last vision but you know miss the that addiction clouds judgment. So while he may have some good

342
00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:04.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Attributes as a friend. He's still so low in his recovery that he doesn't think in the right mind space.

343
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:13.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He doesn't use rational thinking so smart to distance yourself from him and to maybe be around people that you know

344
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:30.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't don't have issue with addiction or that had been very stable in the recovery for a long time because like it said in the video of the whole video, it's important to have those social connections and so that you can have that network of support.

345
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:32.280
Misty Moncada: Yes.

346
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.560
You were gonna say something

347
00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.550
Misty Moncada: You can say something setting out. Oh.

348
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Were you going to say something.

349
00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:46.890
Misty Moncada: No, no, I'm saying you were cutting out

350
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.480
Misty Moncada: Here you

351
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:53.340
Misty Moncada: Know, I think, I think I pretty much got everything else that I needed to talk about

352
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:58.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Who have you identified as your support. Right.

353
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:06.390
Misty Moncada: Um, my mom is a big support my big sister, my son.

354
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:12.720
Misty Moncada: Celebrate Recovery everybody at the church and my ex husband.

355
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:19.620
Misty Moncada: My brother in prison, he calls and he's, he's like, encouraging on the phone, um,

356
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.990
Misty Moncada: I feel like I've never had such great support like I do right now.

357
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:32.490
Misty Moncada: No, I, I have a lot of support right now and I'm just thankful for that. Yeah.

358
00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:48.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And what I would want you to work on for the next time that we meet is to end discover what your best qualities are. I want you to write down a list of what gives you joy.

359
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:53.280
Misty Moncada: So best qualities and what else well

360
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You said we want to give that some time he you

361
00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Were very clear when you

362
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:58.620
Misty Moncada: Said,

363
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:05.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, I'm still trying to identify me and so finding your best qualities might be the

364
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.210
Misty Moncada: Next step.

365
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:11.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this first, that would be identify what is you great joy.

366
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:22.290
Misty Moncada: So best qualities of mine, I could put in my journal best qualities of mine. And then what else, what gives you

367
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:23.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: great joy.

368
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:24.960
Misty Moncada: Okay.

369
00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:33.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So to answer the question of what gives you great joy. First she would have to have the awareness of what July feels like for you.

370
00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:37.980
Misty Moncada: And

371
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:40.890
Misty Moncada: Once you get those down.

372
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:49.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Once you identify what feels like for you. Then when you feel that experience. Again, you can write it down.

373
00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:52.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So before we close

374
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Think about

375
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.490
Misty Moncada: What is the definition of

376
00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:56.820
Joy.

377
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.560
Misty Moncada: And be happy.

378
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.270
Misty Moncada: I think that's my definition being happy.

379
00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:09.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What is happiness feel like in your body.

380
00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:25.950
Misty Moncada: I feel content I feel relieved when I'm happy like something was was done for me to feel that way. Um, I think that's how I felt.

381
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.950
