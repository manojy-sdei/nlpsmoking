Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's new since we last spoke

6
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.280
Brian Kern: Well, I gotta, I gotta prove front employment and

7
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.680
Brian Kern: I actually had they send me a debit card like I don't know how long ago was

8
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.840
Brian Kern: I didn't, I didn't know that I already had it.

9
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.410
Brian Kern: In the mail so

10
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.410
Brian Kern: Like one day I was looking on the site and saw that, like they paid me all this money over the past few weeks.

11
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.180
Brian Kern: And I was like,

12
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.080
Brian Kern: Yeah, and I got it in my head that I was like, it has to be here somewhere. I

13
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was like

14
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.260
Brian Kern: Why would they be paying money to this debit card. It's like I have it or

15
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.100
Brian Kern: You know, because I've been checking the mail for like it wasn't coming

16
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.980
Brian Kern: And eventually I found the debit card and it had, like, way more money than I thought it was gonna be. That was going to be on the on

17
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: During this time,

18
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.900
Brian Kern: Yeah, exactly.

19
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.070
Brian Kern: Nothing. Nothing else really

20
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.900
Brian Kern: You know, just

21
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.180
Brian Kern: staying home.

22
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

23
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Getting cabin fever yet.

24
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.550
Brian Kern: No, I mean,

25
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.340
Brian Kern: Yeah. Oh no, I'm just

26
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.990
Brian Kern: Yeah, I mean like before, all I was doing was going to work and come home. Anyway, so not really like been to stressful. Really, man.

27
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How this group.

28
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.070
Brian Kern: Was good

29
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.880
Brian Kern: Oh yeah, we talked about like somebody

30
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.000
Brian Kern: told me it was like talking about how they were like really trying to wean off of some blocks and because they felt bad about being on it.

31
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.020
Brian Kern: Are we talking about every single

32
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.250
Brian Kern: You know,

33
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.560
Brian Kern: Okay.

34
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Some people are under the impression that I'm you know their addiction is big. There's so many different

35
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Beliefs associated with it. You know, there's the just withdraw have the willpower to stop.

36
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm kind of like the A programs in April grams. And then there's this new research, which is medication assisted treatment.

37
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:43.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like the Suboxone programs. So, depends on what your take is and some people, you know, they come into the program, thinking that. Listen, I just want the support of medicine to get me to a place where I can

38
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:59.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Withdraw safely for a course of time over the actual opioids and hopefully I won't need this anymore. And some people come into the program with no plan to stop Suboxone they want to get out of state level goals.

39
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:12.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And not be off the program because they feel like this represents sobriety and some people just don't think that the Suboxone program equates to sobriety. What's been your take on

40
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The addiction man and what your responses to it.

41
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.550
Brian Kern: I mean my

42
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.500
Brian Kern: Take on it is. I mean, I don't plan on getting off at a time. So don't like us.

43
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.890
Brian Kern: Only because in the past when I've gotten off of it.

44
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.810
Brian Kern: Like eventually

45
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.510
Brian Kern: Relapse so like

46
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.520
Brian Kern: You know, right now. I mean, I feel like it's the safest thing to stay on.

47
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.030
Brian Kern: Maybe in the future that will gain right now. I definitely don't have any plans to get off at or mean off it or anything.

48
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: PTSD any anxiety triggers this week.

49
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.580
Brian Kern: No.

50
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.660
Brian Kern: No.

51
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.150
Brian Kern: No.

52
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.680
Brian Kern: No.

53
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.500
Brian Kern: All

54
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.300
Brian Kern: Good, yeah.

55
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.930
Yeah.

56
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:38.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So tell me what's been working for you from the sessions that we've been having what what are some things that you've taken into consideration that you've been practicing and then also what are some additional things that you would like assistance with

57
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.210
Brian Kern: Well, I'm in

58
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.840
Brian Kern: I'm in early in life phone little bit

59
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.540
Brian Kern: Yeah, just doing this, doing the meetings at night. A meetings.

60
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.160
Brian Kern: Yeah.

61
00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.280
Brian Kern: I have been trying to

62
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.110
Brian Kern: Be like more like

63
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.480
Brian Kern: A cognizant of, like, I'm feeling a certain time, you know, I

64
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.810
Mean

65
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you noticed anything in this new awareness and being more cognizant of your emotions. What have you noticed

66
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.000
Brian Kern: Not really. I haven't noticed, much

67
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, I've

68
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.490
Brian Kern: Been trying to try to be more cognizant of it.

69
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.840
Brian Kern: Oh,

70
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.440
Brian Kern: My gosh, I

71
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.890
Brian Kern: Don't really feel

72
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.150
Brian Kern: Much, much of a thing really

73
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.440
Brian Kern: You know, maybe like just

74
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.300
Brian Kern: Like all of your legal not yeah I'm not feeling anxious or

75
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.150
Brian Kern: Only. No, but I do try to like have like a certain awareness.

76
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.800
Brian Kern: Around it

77
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, so just being more aware of when the anxieties presented itself. And when it's not.

78
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that what I'm hearing you say okay

79
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.480
Brian Kern: Yeah, pretty much.

80
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:22.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, well, some of the things that I've been doing a treatment in the groups that I have is, like you mentioned having that being aware of your, your patterns of thinking

81
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:31.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And sometimes some thoughts are so automatic that we don't realize that they're actually cognitive distortions.

82
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Meaning very irrational ways of thinking and these irrational ways of thinking

83
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:50.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Can attribute to anxiety or relax. So what I've been doing, is teaching the different cognitive distortions, the clients and then having them track just that specific one.

84
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:58.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because there's several cognitive distortion on distortions. There's black and white thinking there's the jumping to conclusions there.

85
00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is

86
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:18.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Just like the spiraling concept, there is you know that filtering where you you refuse to see the good so it's like they call it the filtered on perception. So I want to share a video with you that talks about the black and white thinking it's also

87
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Known as the all or nothing thinking so

88
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:39.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going to play this video for you and let me know your thoughts. Before I get into the video do you find the videos helpful. I don't want you to feel that whenever we're in the session I play a video. Um, but just trying to figure out what you relate for that best

89
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well,

90
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.510
Brian Kern: Yeah, please. Oh.

91
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:59.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I was asking you, do you like being in sessions where we're just engaging in the talk. Do you like also watching the videos and they haven't discussion that after that, what type of teachings. Do you prefer.

92
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.430
Brian Kern: I mean either work doesn't matter like I like learning new stuff so videos or cool or not.

93
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay. So, no, no.

94
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

95
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:42.330
Brian Kern: Morning I tripped on the skateboard. And by mistake. I dropped my sweater in the same call the water was running. And I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible middle good very bad day.

96
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:52.110
Have you ever seen this book, Alexander and the terrible, horrible no good. Very bad day. Well, it's a perfect example of black and white thinking

97
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:13.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what is black and white thinking black and white thinking is a pattern of thought characterized by thinking in the extremes. Everything is always the worst day ever. For

98
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:20.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The very best day ever. You know, we think of things in their absolutes. It's a polarized way of thinking.

99
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:30.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it messes us up because it makes our emotions, more extreme than they need to be black and white thinking is also known as all or nothing thinking

100
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:40.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Interferes with our ability to have healthy emotions and relationships signs that you might be using black and white thinking is, if you use words like always, never

101
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:48.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Terrible ruined furious or you try to make things out to be worse than they were like, I mean, you might have actually had a bad day.

102
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:59.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But it was the worst day ever. Or some things might have gone wrong. And you might say nothing when. Right, right. So we're taking something and we're making it out to be.

103
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:12.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: More exaggerated than it already was now why does black and white thinking mess us up. Well, the way we think affects our emotions and if we're thinking in an exaggerated manner.

104
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:21.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Than our emotions are going to swing rapidly from one extreme to the other people with anxiety or depression tends to think in extremes.

105
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:29.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we can combat anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses by having more realistic honest or moderate thinking patterns.

106
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:41.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Black and white thinking makes the problem worse than it already was black and white thinking creates helplessness. If my husband is a complete jerk the biggest jerk in the whole world.

107
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:47.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then makes no sense for me to try and change myself or improve myself because nothing is ever going to work.

108
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:55.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See that black and white thinking in there and how that's going to contribute to problems in my relationships. Another reason black and white thinking messes us up is

109
00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It invites defensiveness, and others. So if you say to someone, you never do the dishes.

110
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:09.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're going to feel attacked, because that's not quite true. You're exaggerating how bad they are surely might miss doing the dishes and they might have forgotten to do this year. So they might have

111
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:21.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Intentionally not done the dishes that day or multiple days, but they never exaggerates how bad they are puts people on the defensive and it just invites arguing and debating.

112
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:30.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And fighting the more extreme the statement, the more likely the other person is to feel attacked if black and white thinking is so awful, then why don't we do it.

113
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:39.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now I work under the assumption that everything we do serve some kind of function right even if it's dysfunctional in the long run we do it for some sort of reason.

114
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:50.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And black and white thinking does serve a function. It just doesn't work very well. So black and white thinking helps us feel like we're the victim of our circumstances.

115
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:56.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which is kind of comforting. Right. Isn't it nice to think, well, poor me you know everything's out to get me.

116
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:04.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And black and white thinking excuses us from having to do the difficult work of taking action and changing ourselves so if

117
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:14.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My job is the worst job ever or my boss is the meanest guy ever did excuses us in our mind from having to take responsibility for our part of the problem.

118
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:21.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And working hard to fix it black and white thinking helps protect us from feeling guilty or accountable for our own actions.

119
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:30.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And this might feel more comfortable, but in the long run, creates more problems, black and white thinking also protects us from feeling vulnerable.

120
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:38.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So if we're thinking and extremes, like everything is awful. Then we have more excuse to just kind of hide in bed, you know, pull the covers over our head and

121
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:48.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you know wallow instead of actually experiencing those tender feelings that we might be having like hurt or sadness. Perhaps we're feeling guilty or

122
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:59.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, uncertain about the future black and white thinking is also very simple. It gets rid of the complex nuanced reality that we have to face every day.

123
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:09.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And it gets it gets rid of that complexity that we experience when we're interacting with another person because every human being is a combination of good and bad, but if we just

124
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:19.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know label them as being completely bad, then we don't have to manage a lot of that complexity that's involved in in relationships.

125
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:27.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now, well, these are some of the functions of black and white thinking and it does you know work in the short term to relieve us of a little bit of that.

126
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:41.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: discomfort in the long run. It's going to make us pretty unhappy if we consistently use this pattern of thinking in our lives, the more extreme our thinking, the more likely we are to be depressed. So saying things like, I'm a terrible person.

127
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:52.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or wow she has it all together. She is such a saint or no one's going to ever like me. No one wants to be my friend. These are simplistic statements.

128
00:14:53.100 --> 00:15:04.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That feed those negative emotions and create that feeling of helplessness, that is associated with depression, the reality of life is there is no perfect job. The perfect marriage, no perfect person.

129
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And by telling ourselves that someone is either perfect or awful.

130
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:18.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're creating more problems for ourselves, then there needs to be if we want to improve our emotional control. We need to challenge our black and white thinking

131
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So how do we fix it if we catch yourself engaging in some of these thinking patterns. What do we do about it.

132
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:34.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, number one, start to notice the signs of all or nothing thinking so look out for words like we talked about always never any type of exaggeration.

133
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What I like to call horrible ization or trying to make someone else out to be perfect number to

134
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:49.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Challenge your thoughts. Just because you're thinking, it doesn't mean it's really true. So look for a more truthful and more moderate

135
00:15:50.190 --> 00:16:01.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Way of thinking about each situation or person so that takes us right to number three which is we need to replace those thoughts with a more moderate view of the situation. So back to the dishes situation.

136
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:10.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Instead of saying you never do the dishes you big jerk say something like, okay, it bothers me when you don't do the dishes.

137
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:24.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I know that I also miss my chores. Sometimes, how can we work together to solve this number for an essential part of resolving black and white thinking means we have to increase our capacity to experience ambiguity.

138
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:38.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We need to increase our tolerance of complex situations, our ability to hold onto a little bit of discomfort, while we while we wrestle with a situation or a problem. Remember, life is beautiful.

139
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:50.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Difficult complicated joyful painful. In order for us to be able to fully live and and appreciate and enjoy life. We need to embrace all the complexity that is involved with it.

140
00:16:51.300 --> 00:17:08.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If we want to get healthier. It's not about just feeling better. It's about getting better at feeling so consider a couple of these questions. Can someone love you and still be insensitive. Sometimes, can you be basically intelligent and still do something dumb.

141
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:18.450
Brian Kern: Can experience be really hard, but still be beautiful, in some way, remember one of the main reasons people get depressed is because of how they perceive reality.

142
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:26.520
Brian Kern: When we change the way we look at things, the things we look at change when we're able to be more flexible and intentional in how we think.

143
00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:35.670
Brian Kern: That depression is going to be more likely to lift and we'll start to get feeling better, depression, often centers on one incessant thought

144
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:41.130
Brian Kern: Like no one likes me when we replace those negative thoughts with healthy thinking

145
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:49.950
Brian Kern: Then the depression has nothing to feed on changing the way we think is really quite difficult. We might not even notice that we're doing it. So try to reach out for some help.

146
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.080
Brian Kern: Ask others for their perspective on how you talk about yourself, or how you talk about situations.

147
00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:02.010
Brian Kern: Watch yourself for signs of this negative in black and white thinking or work with someone like a mental health professional.

148
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:11.430
Brian Kern: To change the way you think, by reducing or eliminating black and white thinking we can have much healthier lives. So I hope this was helpful. Thanks for watching, and take care

149
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:23.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The video

150
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.950
Brian Kern: Is definitely like

151
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.230
Brian Kern: I feel like

152
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.320
Brian Kern: I mean like

153
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.460
Brian Kern: Like, I don't think I necessarily think like that. But I do think like God are kind of like

154
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.210
Brian Kern: Early describe it like

155
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.300
Brian Kern: I guess sometimes I'm definitely guilty as they get

156
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:56.220
Brian Kern: More like yeah I think sometimes, uh, you know,

157
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:59.250
Brian Kern: It's like

158
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:07.200
Brian Kern: It's not really like all like really think think it but it's like just kind of how all like

159
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.940
Brian Kern: You know, like, I'll kind of like exaggerate.

160
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.300
Brian Kern: Stops myself, sort of like

161
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me an example.

162
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.000
Brian Kern: A good example.

163
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.530
Brian Kern: Like

164
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:34.650
Brian Kern: Earlier I was watching this like true crime thing okay like I get mad I this is gonna sound really stupid but I get. I get mad.

165
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.840
Brian Kern: When like

166
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.290
Brian Kern: Okay. Well, I guess I'll just say that was Washington, so like this, this woman.

167
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.500
Brian Kern: Like got convicted of like

168
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.760
Brian Kern: neg like something like negligent homicide.

169
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.890
Brian Kern: Man Like she literally got

170
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.180
Brian Kern: Got hot like she got like

171
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:04.140
Brian Kern: Program. She got probation for like 16 months. Right. And like I always get pissed when like people do like

172
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:14.010
Brian Kern: Like when people were convicted of like some really horrible shit and they get less time off for the nation than I did for some petty drug shit, you know, so I was

173
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:14.580
Like the thing

174
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:24.090
Brian Kern: You know, like he likes literally like, people always get like last time that I did for like really terrible thing.

175
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.320
Brian Kern: I guess that's like example like came to my mind.

176
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.080
Brian Kern: When I was watching it, you know.

177
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

178
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.460
Brian Kern: I like it doesn't piss me off, honestly.

179
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.060
Brian Kern: Yeah, so it's like, things like that. I don't know, like

180
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.200
Brian Kern: I don't like i don't think i think like all the time.

181
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.160
Brian Kern: Like, I think it's just surely bad

182
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.820
Yeah.

183
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And see, that's the complexities of

184
00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: cognitive distortions, is that

185
00:20:53.130 --> 00:21:00.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We all the different types that I show you, you or discuss with you, you'll see there's certain time to

186
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do that.

187
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:08.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because I am also guilty of doing black and white thinking every man, woman, as well, because

188
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:14.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like was mentioned in discuss this actually serve a function for us some time.

189
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:22.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To move either while and whatever extent or experience that we have, or to feel as though

190
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:33.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know that it's not fair, this injustice, because you probably already had this underlying feeling of injustice, when you were serve that term for

191
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.350
Brian Kern: Your crime, you

192
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:41.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: probably already have that initially what I did is not bit. This is fine, you know, and so anytime

193
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:55.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know this plays out. It may resurface again because this has been an underlying theme for you. It's probably like people that have sick children you know or have some type of chronic illness, you know,

194
00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:04.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because that is in summer, but for them, they may get frustrated when they have finds that their kids really even catch a cold.

195
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:16.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, but their child is in and out of the hospital and so they may have that trigger to like you, like, you know, how come all these children are born healthy, but I have a sickly child.

196
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:23.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It serves as a function because it makes you feel like there's some type of injustice and this isn't fair.

197
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:37.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And sometimes we find comfort in finding the injustices. We feel righteous in a sense that we've we've been serving in justice and how do we do, right. So, it serves as a function

198
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

199
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:49.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Lots of people do it. Some people use black or white thinking in arguments with friends or with spouses and then you always you never like the example she gave

200
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the video so

201
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You'll see different things.

202
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That resonate for you at different times.

203
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:05.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The one that I find very interesting is the one that's jumping to conclusions and I'll put I'll play that the next session.

204
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:19.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But we watch the video you think, Oh, this is so far fetched that this person would think that one simple text. So once a full response for me to this so that when you really reflect, you think, well, how many times

205
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:29.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How I proceed someone's behavior as a direct result of me. You know that, oh, this person is doing this because of me.

206
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:47.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so with that, with these cognitive distortions. It's this internal dialogue that we have with ourselves. Whenever there's some type of conflict or whenever there's an underlying trigger that night rise up, but I like that is not there because

207
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:54.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I could see how black or white thinking will arise when you feel like there's been a certain injustice or

208
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anything else that stood out for you in the video.

209
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:05.910
Brian Kern: Nothing I can think of.

210
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:06.720
Really

211
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So one thing that I took note of is how she says that

212
00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:20.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We have that. Like I said, the black and white thinking serves as a function for us. So sometimes we have

213
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Devotional habits.

214
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That serves as a function for us. So can you identify a

215
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Dysfunctional habits that you may have that actually serves as a function for you.

216
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.000
Brian Kern: Um,

217
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:45.450
Brian Kern: I mean one like when I was getting high. And I was definitely like a dysfunctional.

218
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.980
Brian Kern: Habit that definitely served a

219
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:47.790
Purpose.

220
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was that function for you.

221
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.480
Brian Kern: Just to basically relieve stress and anxiety. Yeah.

222
00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh, you're facing of coffee.

223
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.960
Was addiction.

224
00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.640
Brian Kern: Oh no, I'd have to think of like other ones.

225
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:11.610
Brian Kern: Not really sure.

226
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:32.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But that was a very good one. And a lot of people don't identify the significance of how the addiction really was that coffee. And the reason why it. Some people may think really does that really, but some people don't realize that they're trying to cope from and

227
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:39.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's very difficult for them to identify the triggers that they have to their addiction.

228
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the significance in the reason why it's important to know that like exponentially in the last session is

229
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:56.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Once you have the awareness of this is a trigger for me. Now you can put some things in place to avoid it. So that's why x i checked in earlier and said, you know,

230
00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:10.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have you felt anxious I was the PTSD and you said, I've been actually pretty good. But what I'm curious to know is what was different. How come he didn't present itself this week.

231
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.430
Brian Kern: I don't know, I guess.

232
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.700
Brian Kern: I've just been like

233
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.010
Brian Kern: More

234
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:29.460
Brian Kern: Like I guess for last sort of, I don't know. I mean, I've just been like even busier like having way less idle time

235
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.470
Brian Kern: You know, I mean,

236
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.180
Brian Kern: I've been like, you know, journaling my phone.

237
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.400
Brian Kern: Off. That's like a big new one. I guess I think that's kind of hoping

238
00:26:45.660 --> 00:27:02.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you think, by any chance, you'd be more aware of what causes you to be ancients when the anxiety visits. Do you think that lends any credence to why I invited me to insulate itself this week.

239
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.970
Brian Kern: Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

240
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:13.500
Brian Kern: I think this is like being more like that is like helping. Yeah.

241
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:24.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the reason why I ask is because the way our body functions. Right. I always preach about the awareness. Awareness. Awareness.

242
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:33.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And sometimes we don't understand the significance. But the awareness is actually allowing your brain to have new rewire

243
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.340
Brian Kern: So,

244
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:44.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The interesting thing about the brain is that it developed from the bottom to top out from top to bottom. So as infants.

245
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:54.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: First part of my brain that develop was just like that since we need a hunger, I need to pee. I need to pull those things developed connected with them off.

246
00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:07.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But as we transition into adults. There's other things functions and layers that develop. And the last part of the brain to develop is actually the top the prefrontal cortex.

247
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:23.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that part of the brain does the work in helping us to have a rational brain and helping us to really stop reflect and think of the best outcome versus responding to our initial in the reaction. So,

248
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Having this awareness.

249
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:31.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For since you're playing that whenever anxiety presents itself, rather than going below road which is

250
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:39.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Ok I sent it in my alarm is going to process it through them at the love, which is the Renaissance fight, flight, freeze.

251
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:46.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then immediately just send it down to the hypothalamus and when you saw those stress hormones. That's the low road.

252
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:58.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But when you have the awareness. It forces, your brain to take a hike in that I will takes a little longer in the processing, but a significant because

253
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:19.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When your body has a sentence through the llamas instead of going to the amygdala and then stress hormones, it goes to the amygdala in the middle of says this time. Okay, I sent a threat for let me send it. Let me send it to the hippocampus and allow it to process it categorize this

254
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.030
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is this a real threat.

255
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:35.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was a perceived threat and then from there was the hippocampus process and then puts in different categories is since it then to the prefrontal cortex to say, all right, Coach, Brian, figure out best outcome in a situation

256
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:59.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So with your PTSD and trauma. Do I make the logo is always sending you different signals, there's a threat threat, how we respond because people that haven't experienced trauma when they have a threat response. Once the threat is gone, they calm down your body goes back to all

257
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:01.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The work that way.

258
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:14.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's constantly in that fight or flight that the middle is likely to stay on is no point in me to turn it off because we're always on the threats and we always want to be prepared. You always want to protect

259
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:28.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But now we're taking the higher Road. The higher road represents that awareness that you can the Mykola says maybe turn off for a little bit. Now, because it seems that claim is always in distress.

260
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:30.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And Becky saying

261
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:40.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I've been a little more calm lately will relax staying busy. I'm noticing some good things working out me getting money now and unemployment.

262
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:52.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Money, all of them even expected is waiting for me those things and signals to the brain to tell them Abdullah, it's okay. Brian is saying you could turn off.

263
00:30:54.150 --> 00:31:06.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Having that awareness mind is so key and I will challenge you that once you have the awareness to get curious as to why am I so call it feels good. What did I do right

264
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because then you continue to do those things.

265
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:21.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that next week, something happens, you don't tell send the signal to the amygdala turn all the way on again because

266
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I don't, I don't want to go the highway.

267
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.880
Brian Kern: Does that, yeah.

268
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.120
Brian Kern: Yeah, it makes sense. Okay.

269
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:36.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in this journey of sobriety.

270
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:51.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's always going to be this curiosity that piece itself is just an ongoing journey of curiosity about learning about don't ever get bored so over get overwhelmed with it.

271
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: being committed like excited

272
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To learn the ways of checking in with yourself.

273
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:07.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even in most days of business, take a pause when you feel like, Man, my big dilemma is on and there's no turning it off.

274
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You also want to be curious, what is going on, why

275
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:21.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Time when you felt like your amygdala was always on it was enough. What was going on for you at that time.

276
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.550
Brian Kern: Something like that and Gail

277
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.610
Brian Kern: Yeah.

278
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:41.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

279
00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:42.330
Yeah.

280
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:49.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Part in your amygdala. That's the big fear of big dogs.

281
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:59.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can be walking down the street and someone struggling their teeth, I immediately think, be rationally those key dangling

282
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Early adult color.

283
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:05.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And there's a big Pitbull coming after me and I can just be in my driveway.

284
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I hear it and it

285
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But remember what I said about the Columbus and the

286
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The sound.

287
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:24.720
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The sound rather I live in my little goes back to when Jessica was young and there will be songs that were chasing their idols colors.

288
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:37.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So my door that as the way to protect Jessica is whenever she hears that sound to turn on the middle so she feels a threat, and she goes into flight because I'm I'm running.

289
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:39.300
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm running.

290
00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.220
Brian Kern: Yeah yeah

291
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:50.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: very embarrassing story. I was leaving work and some lady. She was in a parking lot and she's ready to her car. And she had a key, though.

292
00:33:51.030 --> 00:34:01.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I heard it and turn back, one must again for a look like I was going to find the show notes so scared. And I had to apologize and say, Oh, I'm so sorry.

293
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:07.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I automatically assume those a big dog coming after me and I was like,

294
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:13.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the city. Like where would a dog just be running the Michaela has no rational innovation.

295
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So you have to do the work to identify what those sounds are

296
00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:23.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So now more aware when I'm walking now that if I

297
00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.210
Hear this

298
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:42.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To Matt me think big dog but to just looking look around and explore my environment to really assess for safety, but before having that awareness and the connection of the sound and never looked around, I just immediately one or two big dog go

299
00:34:47.250 --> 00:35:05.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To you identified that when you're making a little was turned on. It was these was the homelessness setting. It was in prison, was there ever a time where it wasn't those type of threatening surroundings. It was home work that you felt like you're making a little wrong.

300
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:19.110
Brian Kern: Really, I mean, it was like always on. Yeah, I mean, definitely, like what I'm like walking around and

301
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.340
Brian Kern: Things like that, like, you know, again,

302
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

303
00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:37.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's more site is there sounds. So I think it sounds like when we think about synthesis more site for you. Are there any sounds a touch and smell.

304
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:46.710
Brian Kern: Cuz I mean when the machete attack happened, I was asleep. You know, I kind of like woke up.

305
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.740
Brian Kern: And I think it was all happening so

306
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.300
Brian Kern: Nothing like nothing. I'm like, aware of at least. Yeah.

307
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:11.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So good in the imagery resources that I taught you last session or two sessions ago would be real well for you the next time that you're in an environment that you sent through your site can be possibly threatening.

308
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To go to that imagery resource of you end up with a grain Jeep Cherokee

309
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:30.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, yeah, I'm just imagining that the whole lecture Mandela know that this isn't a threatening place mean you still want to have the awareness and be cautious, but

310
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:39.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When you feel that the major is finding again those signals to your brain must take the low road instead of the higher realm.

311
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:44.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That you go to that image in place so that you can ground yourself.

312
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Any other thoughts about about

313
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.360
Brian Kern: Yeah, so

314
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:08.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What about the emotion chart. And we talked about did you give any thought about that, about the emotion. He felt throughout the week.

315
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:21.270
Brian Kern: Oh yeah me. I looked at it, you know, it's just I think sometimes it's hard for me like really identify you know

316
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What makes it challenging

317
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.530
Brian Kern: This is like hard to

318
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.060
Brian Kern: Like really just, I guess, but like

319
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.130
Brian Kern: Like, my head is like kind of like just

320
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.330
Brian Kern: Just like I'm either anxious or on hot

321
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.350
You know, I mean,

322
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.160
Brian Kern: Like, that's like just the easiest thing.

323
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.080
Brian Kern: So,

324
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.990
Brian Kern: When it comes to like other

325
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.600
Brian Kern: Promotions I guess is

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:08.580

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.790
Brian Kern: Know you know i mean

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Other emotions aside from anxiety.

Brian Kern: Just kind of thinking about

369
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:11.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Think about that. And then think about any times where you feel like your amygdala is on
