00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.460
Isaak: Hi.

2
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.870
Hey,

3
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.760
While

4
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.690
Isaak: It's been a while. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's been crazy now though. I mean,

5
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.560
Isaak: Yeah, it's all this stuff going on.

6
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.020
Have you been

7
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:36.930
Isaak: I've been good most part I haven't went any lower Ivan tapered further because all this stuff started happening like the lockdowns and stuff so I've just been staying where I am. But surprisingly, I mean, I'm okay. You know, like with everything going on.

8
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:52.890
Isaak: Yeah, I am. My mom came to town and she stayed for a few days or whatever. And she's guess she's she went back to her house, whatever. But she's coming back down. She's all freaked out right now with all the stuff going on. So,

9
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.400
Isaak: Yeah, we're just kind of just all sticking together right now and stuff. Yeah, crazy, isn't it.

10
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.070
Okay.

11
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.760
Shawn Phalen: What do you have, do you have anything you want to go over

12
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.380
Isaak: Here, hold on.

13
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.350
Isaak: Sorry, except came in the room. I was in or whenever I wanted to be more quiet or whatever. Yeah.

14
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.480
Isaak: Yeah, I mean,

15
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.620
Isaak: I mean, I can't really think of like anything off the top my head, really. But, I mean, I don't know, things have just been kind of crazy because, I mean, my mom.

16
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.940
Isaak: Has been here, so like I don't know this, this House isn't very big, so her and her boyfriend are here and it's just like, I don't know the lockdown.

17
00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.830
Isaak: Just causing like a lot of us to just kind of bump heads, you know, a cheap. She just got clean herself to so like there's that factor. So he's been kind of

18
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.910
Isaak: But I've just been trying to be there for right now, you know, and the best way. And, you know,

19
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.420
Shawn Phalen: How long has she been clean

20
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:24.270
Isaak: I'm like, maybe a month. So like, yeah, she she used math, though, or whatever, like, yes, she never got into like heroin like me or whatever but

21
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:34.140
Isaak: But yeah, I know I've been trying to be supportive of her and stuff. And yeah, I mean you the other day, or whatever. I was kind of mad at her because she

22
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:43.770
Isaak: Like she's been clicking, but she still had drugs on her. You know what I mean, like she she got kind of like little buzz because she's drinking. She's drinking while

23
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.680
Isaak: She's getting off math, but I mean, she doesn't have like an alcohol problem. And I told her, it's not a good idea to do alcohol because you especially when you're trying to get clean because it could like

24
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.370
Isaak: I don't know. It can make you mess up, you know what I mean like that. I mean, that's what to do for me. You know what I mean. So

25
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:09.030
Isaak: But, but, I mean, aside from that, though she ended up telling me and I'm just like, so we end up getting like this big fight but I made her I I'm kind of happy though because

26
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:20.340
Isaak: I made her throw it away like cheap, you know, I mean her and her boyfriend were talking and then she came out and then she flushed down the toilet in front of me. So I was like I was really proud of her though so

27
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.320
Isaak: I mean,

28
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.170
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so she actually had meth on her and she's trying to get clean

29
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.840
Isaak: Yeah, as she just like she said it was kind of like a safety thing and I tried to explain from like

30
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.730
Isaak: Why I kind of get where she was coming from. But at the same time, I had to tell her, but like, that's

31
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.230
Isaak: If you really want to get clean you you can't have that mentality. You know, I mean, you don't hold on to it. That's just, you know, that's

32
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.200
Isaak: Self up to fail. You know what I mean, like,

33
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:59.040
Isaak: So, I mean, I'm glad she actually did it. You know, I told her, she's probably going to feel better now. I mean, I know it's scary. These. It's kind of like a safety net, but at the same time, though, it's

34
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.950
Isaak: It's gonna free you too, because like me it that's got to be like in the back of her head. You know what I mean, like she has it honor that's talking to help

35
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.810
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so it's kind of interesting how you're having to be the parent

36
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:31.080
Isaak: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's kind of weird like, unfortunately, I feel like that's, I mean, I know I wouldn't have been like the parent, but like I just feel like over the past like few years like I matured more than her. It's weird. You know what I mean, it's like

37
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.190
Shawn Phalen: Yeah. So how long has she been on drugs.

38
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.090
Isaak: I'm probably like 15 years

39
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:58.980
Isaak: Yeah, they did she is when you were little, um, yeah, she started she mainly started because we got like in this bad car accident, like in the rain and this lady got hit, and like you know wasn't her like her fault it was an accident, you know, and like that really messed her

40
00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.250
Up.

41
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:11.520
Isaak: Yeah, after the accident is when she started using drugs. Yeah, it was probably like around us five. So maybe closer to 20 years

42
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.670
Isaak: Yeah, but I mean I'm proud of her though and like you know i'm glad she's coming back to

43
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:29.640
Isaak: Because I know her house can probably be kind of triggering to especially cuz she lives like in the middle. Nowhere, so there's less things to do but there's really nothing to do right now because this corn teen but

44
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.300
Isaak: You know what I mean. But, but, I mean, I'm, I'm just glad she's going to be down here, family, you know what I mean. So

45
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.560
Shawn Phalen: So your grandparents raised you right

46
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.030
Isaak: Yeah yeah

47
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.710
Shawn Phalen: So any. What's it like having your mom in house. I mean, that's

48
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:59.790
Isaak: That's fine. Well, I mean, it's like I said, I mean I'm just trying to be supportive. I mean, it's good. We've always kind of been more like brother and sister. You know what I mean.

49
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:12.030
Isaak: Just because the living situation like in my grandparents raising me. So, I mean, it's good. Like, I mean, honestly, I miss it. She's not here right now because she's going to come back in a few days. So, but yeah.

50
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.450
Isaak: I mean, it's not bad. Okay.

51
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.330
Shawn Phalen: So you would say that you have a good relationship with her.

52
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.140
Yeah.

53
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.770
Isaak: How have you always had a good relationship with her, though. Um, well lately. It's, it's gotten a lot better.

54
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:43.350
Isaak: We didn't really have the greatest relationship like for a good majority of my life. But in the past like year so it's gotten a lot better. Like, especially like input. I live like

55
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:56.730
Isaak: With her for like maybe like a year so like I mean it was starting to get better than even though I was like still like we're yeah it's gotten better though. But yeah, used to be really bad.

56
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.360
Isaak: So what about her boyfriend.

57
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:09.780
Isaak: Yeah, actually. I mean, I think he is good for because you know he's not, he's not using drugs. You know what I mean like he's kind of

58
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:22.380
Isaak: He's probably my mom's boyfriend that it feels like she's not taking care of him like she always would give people that were just like losers. You know what I mean like that would fucking just like take advantage of her

59
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:31.650
Isaak: Were like just need money from her and drugs or whatever the fuck. So it's that there was someone that can support her to, you know,

60
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:41.820
Isaak: Does your mom work. Yeah. Yeah. But right now, she's off for 90 days because of the essential business thing.

61
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.660
Isaak: Yeah.

62
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.980
Isaak: Um, well, he works out of school. So no

63
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.720
Isaak: But they play. They can collect unemployment right now so

64
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.610
Isaak: crazy, isn't it, yeah.

65
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.670
Shawn Phalen: So when you when you

66
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.200
Shawn Phalen: How long is she going to stay for. Do you know

67
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:19.890
Isaak: I'm sure, but probably a few weeks, at least I'm guessing you know I think it'd be good for her to just be here in like the early stages of, you know, getting her sobriety back so

68
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:27.210
Shawn Phalen: So have there been any has there been any conversation about if she were to relapse. So she's in the house, you guys.

69
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:39.750
Isaak: Um, no, not really. I mean, she she relapsed like a month ago, like, you know what I mean. Because I said she's been clean for like MONTH, BUT SHE TRIED like a few weeks back, you know,

70
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:46.950
Isaak: Like, but she relapsed when she went somewhere or whatever before all this stuff really happened, you know, but

71
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:53.100
Isaak: I mean, she told me about it, you know, which I, you know, was cool, like, you know, because I feel like you trust her. And like

72
00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:00.570
Isaak: She usually she would never say anything like that when she's tried in the past, you know, like, so I feel like she's more serious about it, you know.

73
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:12.840
Isaak: Just because of that alone and the fact that, you know, we're throwing away the drugs and shit. So I mean, and because their boyfriends probing and be with her to I'm I feel pretty secure and good about it.

74
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.950
Isaak: But yeah

75
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:25.800
Isaak: But, um, other than that though. I mean, things are all right. I mean, just trying to, I'm just trying to keep myself from going crazy.

76
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.510
Isaak: You know, with everything else going on. Of course, but yeah.

77
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.130
Shawn Phalen: No. Are you bored.

78
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.190
Isaak: Yeah, it's easy to get forward and that's for

79
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:45.150
Isaak: But thankfully I mean I have stuff like this. I like to exercise. So I have a lot of like I have a treadmill and I have like this. The stationary bike and stuff at the house so

80
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:56.850
Isaak: So I'm able to like still do some of the things that I've done, but it's just sucks because like I live with my grandparents. So like, and I know they're like at risk. You know, like, because my my

81
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:05.310
Isaak: Pop or whatever. Yes, as my he's like a little overweight and he has diabetes. So like this virus probably wouldn't be very good for him to get

82
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:17.670
Isaak: And my grandma. She's in the age range where it's bad. So, so like I haven't had, you know, I'm not like seeing my friends or anything like my positive friends. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

83
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.930
Shawn Phalen: I know that's just kind of a chap to do right now, you know, just, yeah.

84
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.960
Isaak: At least for the next month, you know, they're

85
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:31.830
Isaak: You know, they're trying to flatten the curve on this thing. And there's yeah you know the next two weeks, we could see a

86
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.390
Shawn Phalen: Lot like a spike.

87
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:45.150
Isaak: Yeah, reading that if there were saying something like, it's gonna probably peak. Pretty soon and like good as bad as it's going to get. And then it will probably like start to calm down a bit, so

88
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:53.580
Isaak: Exactly. Yeah. So this is a really crucial time and as boring as it can be. And yeah, you know, like crazy.

89
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:58.980
Shawn Phalen: And so have you had cravings. I mean, how are you doing with

90
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:10.050
Isaak: Um, well. So far so good. You know, I'm if I felt I feel like I was tapering still, it probably wouldn't have been good time like because I the dose that I've went down to

91
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:24.270
Isaak: I haven't really know too many like cravings really at all, but like I know I might start to feel that way. Or I might start to feel a little under the weather. If I keep going lower. So like, that's why they'd where I am, because I'm okay. Still, okay.

92
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:44.040
Isaak: So, like, how much are you taking. Now, how did you um 12 total a day like so I take like eight morning and four in the afternoon, and what will you take him before I'm 16 so I've only dropped like four okay well that's still good, you know. Yeah.

93
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.240
Isaak: Okay, and you're still doing the groups. Right. Yeah.

94
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.850
Okay.

95
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.260
Isaak: All right, that's good, you know. Yeah.

96
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.560
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, so basically everything on hold right now.

97
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:05.610
Yeah.

98
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:14.880
Isaak: Yeah, yeah. It's kind of scary, too, because, like, hold on. Never. I went to check in, or whatever to my

99
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:21.510
Isaak: My group, the other day there was like a leading time and I never seen that before. So I don't know if it had to do with like what's going on or not.

100
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:32.850
Isaak: Like you're freaking out because I usually like to check into my groups like to get the the meeting id like 10 minutes before and it's like saying waiting time 10 to 15 minutes so I was like Oh shit, you know,

101
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:34.830
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, no.

102
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.260
Shawn Phalen: I've been hearing that

103
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.590
Shawn Phalen: People are having to wait.

104
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:41.610
And yeah.

105
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.620
Isaak: It is taking a little bit longer for people to get on

106
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:47.790
Isaak: Yeah.

107
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.840
Shawn Phalen: They're just keep checking in, like 10 minutes earlier because

108
00:13:52.020 --> 00:14:00.480
Isaak: Yeah, I've just doing that, like up. Now, I know. So I'm just gonna write a check in earlier. Yeah, absolutely. So then I'm

109
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:09.630
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so with your mom coming back. You know, I would just encourage you to

110
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.560
Pay attention to

111
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:25.380
Isaak: You know, if you start to get triggered by her just by oh yeah you write something she says, or

112
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.580
Shawn Phalen: It can be memories from when you were a child.

113
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:35.580
Isaak: Yeah, yeah. I've been you've noticed, things like that. Yeah.

114
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:45.210
Shawn Phalen: And and then I think you have to have some kind of a plan if she were to somehow bring checks back because that is a

115
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:55.830
Isaak: Yeah. Well, no, I've been, ya know, I've been talking to my grandma about it to. You know what I mean. Yeah, so I get on the same page about you know her, and being here and stuff.

116
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:15.600
Isaak: I think that's a really important conversation to have with Grandma until. Yeah, you need to have those conversations with her because your mom can easily get more drugs right when she comes. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we're not done here. Yeah. Yeah. And

117
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.980
Shawn Phalen: And so I think you have to have a, you know, continue to have conversations with grandma.

118
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.980
Because, you know,

119
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:25.860
That's

120
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.620
Isaak: That's not okay. Oh, I know it. Yeah.

121
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.810
Shawn Phalen: That's not okay for you and it's not okay for grandma.

122
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.910
Isaak: Yeah, no, I know, I know. Thankfully, like, I mean, I don't really have like a problem like why mean

123
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:52.140
Isaak: I still don't want to see see any of it. You know what I mean. But I mean, I'm not really like into the math anymore like

124
00:15:52.620 --> 00:16:00.090
Isaak: I near like the end of my, like, the reason why I kind of jumped like boats here and like move to like heroin was because like
