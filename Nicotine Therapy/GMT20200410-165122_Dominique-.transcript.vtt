Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Gosh, times fine too. I feel like we just met, and it was two weeks ago already how how's it been

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.300
Dianna Jaramillo: For the last two weeks, um,

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:04.050
Dianna Jaramillo: I guess, pretty much the same. I mean, I started getting together a few little things for to do the altars, you know, for my mom and dad like we talked about and I haven't put anything up yet, but

14
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.760
Dianna Jaramillo: Other than that, it's just, it's sort of been the same with everything.

15
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.040
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm, um,

16
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.990
Dianna Jaramillo: Well, I mean, I find me talk to my, my dad a couple days ago.

17
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.920
Dianna Jaramillo: Right before law my birthday. Actually, yeah, it was on my birthday on the seventh and um

18
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.330
Dianna Jaramillo: And it was awesome. It was really nice. It was like everything was just great like normal. And, you know, like my dad was my dad and

19
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.650
Dianna Jaramillo: totally comfortable conversation, you know,

20
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.540
Dominique Pozo: Interesting and

21
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.740
Well, because

22
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.630
Dominique Pozo: The last

23
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.980
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that I heard it. Yeah. It wasn't like that. So it just

24
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.990
Dominique Pozo: It was just fine. Did you guys

25
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.650
Dianna Jaramillo: Did you

26
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.680
Dominique Pozo: Talk about that. No, you just let it be as it was. Yeah.

27
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.330
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, we just kind of let let things be, I think it was just more about my birthday. Well, his birthday is the day before my

28
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Birthday.

29
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:18.270
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes. So, and we used to do something every year, go to dinner, whatever, to celebrate it. You know, so I think we're both just thinking about that. And so it was, it was just fighting happy conversation, you know,

30
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.830
Dominique Pozo: Oh good, and

31
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.110
Dominique Pozo: Did you let him reach out to you.

32
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.620
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Yeah, he did. First thing in the morning.

33
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.180
Dominique Pozo: Oh,

34
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.330
Dominique Pozo: I bet that's all good, just

35
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Hearing

36
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.080
Dominique Pozo: You know, hearing what you've been going through with them both your mom and dad. I imagine that felt good.

37
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.310
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, I did. Of course I didn't hear from her from my mom, which is

38
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:52.110
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, that sucks, but I'm getting more and more used to it. I think I did hear from my sister. Actually, I've only talked to her like twice in the last five years.

39
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.770
Dianna Jaramillo: And they both

40
00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:03.840
Dianna Jaramillo: They both times. I talked to her were like in the last month, I guess, or so and and she talked to her. She texted me for my birthday.

41
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.430
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. Oh, wow.

42
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.270
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Yeah, so that was nice to hearing from

43
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.860
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, just hearing from family here and there's nice feels great.

44
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.170
Dominique Pozo: I don't think I remember you sharing that you have a sister is she from your mom and dad, she has like a full blood sister or half sister.

45
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Half yeah half for my excuse me.

46
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.730
Dianna Jaramillo: God bless you.

47
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.720
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay. Is she an older sister. Yeah, she's just over a year older. Uh huh. Okay. Yeah.

48
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.760
Dominique Pozo: Well, so

49
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.050
Dominique Pozo: That's I'm happy to hear that your dad reached out. I know that that's, yeah, that's been a big ache for you.

50
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.400
Dianna Jaramillo: Around your day. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, it's it's weird because there's even when we talk. There's that underlying

51
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.150
Dianna Jaramillo: Theme. You know that underneath the surface conversation, there's that.

52
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.620
Dianna Jaramillo: That weird thing. And it's, I don't know, it just I think about, you know, am I ever even going to see him again.

53
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.020
Dianna Jaramillo: You know cuz he's late

54
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.600
Dianna Jaramillo: Late 60s now and

55
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:20.370
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, I just got to kind of let it be. I can't really dwell on it too much, and just drive me crazy. So I don't know, whatever.

56
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.600
Huh.

57
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:32.040
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. And what I what I'm remembering to is you know you, it seems to me, and what from what I hear that you've reached out multiple times very vulnerable. He and

58
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.260
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, there's a kind of a self preservation piece of not wanting to do that.

59
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.990
Dominique Pozo: At least right now because I

60
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.930
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

61
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.750
Dominique Pozo: I can imagine sharing with him like, Gosh, I

62
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.640
Dominique Pozo: I feel afraid. Sometimes, that I may not see you again, but

63
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.620
Dominique Pozo: You know, if you're not met with that vulnerability back it's it's almost like re wounding

64
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.870
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, exactly. And he's not. I think I said this before, but he's not a real super like emotional

65
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:16.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, you know, touchy feely lovey kind of person he's he's real dry and and just kind of always the same. Always level always the same.

66
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:27.900
Dianna Jaramillo: You know doesn't cry doesn't really LAUGH He's just always in the middle, you know and and in these very, very non confrontational.

67
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:40.050
Dianna Jaramillo: So he doesn't really like to talk about deeper stuff that might potentially cause a disagreement or anything like that. He kind of, you know, shy away from all of that.

68
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.920
Dianna Jaramillo: So I think, you know, that makes it hard to

69
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.530
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. And as you're speaking. I'm really curious about his chart because even while you're speaking I'm

70
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.070
Dominique Pozo: Thinking

71
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.730
Dominique Pozo: All right. Her Mercury's and Pisces, which I checked out.

72
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.160
Dominique Pozo: Or Mars is in Leo, which is like, you know, that's a lot of fire to bring

73
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:08.220
Dominique Pozo: Forward and your moons in Capricorn, which is, and I'll pull up your chart, but I was just as you're speaking. I was thinking, I wonder what the dynamic is between their charts.

74
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.800
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, no kidding.

75
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.610
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, you can do. It's called sinister. You can do two charts and see how they line up or not. It's pretty

76
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.210
Dominique Pozo: Long

77
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.610
Dianna Jaramillo: But what's cool what

78
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.470
Dominique Pozo: Do you want to take a look at your chart, we can

79
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.980
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

80
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:36.570
Dominique Pozo: Show you what I'm talking about. Because I think it's what's helping you to not like some of the aspects I see or what I think is helping you to not take things on to, to, to, like, you can move through it.

81
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.410
Dominique Pozo: And it's something nice.

82
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.690
Dominique Pozo: Here with your moon in Capricorn. Do you know much about the type of Capricorn.

83
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.920
Dianna Jaramillo: No, no. Not a whole lot. So

84
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:59.850
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so, so your moon when we wherever our Moon is placed in our chart. It's our emotional body, it's like all of our feelings, our emotions and

85
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:20.070
Dominique Pozo: And it has a certain kind of like signature and it's under yours is under the umbrella of Capricorn and Capricorn is an earth sign. It's a fixed earth sign. It's very like practical and it can be very logical and it doesn't, it's not swayed too much by the emotions. So I'm, I'm just

86
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Thinking. This is a big

87
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:39.150
Dominique Pozo: It's a strength for you in dealing with things like your mother and father when it really hurts. I, I see you also have the capacity to step, you know, step outside of your feelings and see it for what it is because that's what Capricorn Capricorn can be pretty dry, actually. And just like

88
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.590
Dominique Pozo: How it is

89
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.260
Dominique Pozo: And so I think it's a strength for you for sure because what you're going through is painful with your parents.

90
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.950
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. Wow, that's interesting.

91
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.030
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean do you resonate with what I'm saying, like, even though you're

92
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.110
Dianna Jaramillo: A you're a

93
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.710
Dominique Pozo: healer. I can feel it. I see it I witness it.

94
00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.970
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah

95
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:09.270
Dominique Pozo: What I see as a strength, potentially, is that you're able to assess the situation and not get lost in your emotions is that, do you

96
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.070
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, totally.

97
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:11.550
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh.

98
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.430
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that that makes that makes a whole lot of sense for me because I do, I, I kind of

99
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:31.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Step, step back away from whatever it is and and really assess the entire situation. Yeah, I mean, really, I've always been like that. That's really amazing.

100
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:41.160
Dominique Pozo: This is your moon. And what I love about Capricorn that one of the great things is one of the visuals of Capricorn. It's the goat on top of the mountain. And it's like,

101
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.360
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, it takes a lot of

102
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:55.800
Dominique Pozo: Strength to get up there and then once you once one makes it up there like a goat did and does. They have a view of everything below. And so what you're saying is it really lines up with kind of the visual image of

103
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.380
Dominique Pozo: That sense of Capricorn is he's the goat on top of the mountain with a big view of everything.

104
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.960
Dianna Jaramillo: Wow. That's crazy. That is so cool. That is really, really cool.

105
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.800
Dominique Pozo: I know I I love astrology. I feel like it's really

106
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.050
Dominique Pozo: Such a powerful way to look at

107
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.610
Dominique Pozo: At personality structures, you know, it is so so that's one thing that I just wanted to point out, that's a big strength to carry and i i think i just want to like

108
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:41.130
Dominique Pozo: offer you that to continue to carry with you as you move forward that even when as all of us, you know, we're impacted. We get emotional things hurt, yet you have this very natural ability to you know get up to the top of the mountain and assess it off with a

109
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.110
Dominique Pozo: With a wide view, you know,

110
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:55.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. That's, I love that. That makes so much sense to me. I love astrology, too, because it really does say so much, it just

111
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.580
Dianna Jaramillo: Sorry it sheds a whole lot of light on on who we are. I think early stuff.

112
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.940
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh my gosh. Sorry.

113
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.040
Dominique Pozo: That's okay. Yeah.

114
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.460
Baby

115
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.260
Dianna Jaramillo: Robert

116
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.980
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm sorry, go ahead. Dominique

117
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:15.510
Dominique Pozo: And

118
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.870
Dominique Pozo: So yeah, and that is totally opposite of like this is Scorpio here. This is Pisces.

119
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.020
Dominique Pozo: And this is cancer and you have some things there. We can talk about

120
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.940
Dominique Pozo: Them, but these are the water sign

121
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:29.580
Dominique Pozo: The

122
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.990
Dominique Pozo: Water signs they are

123
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.100
Dianna Jaramillo: Totally swimming

124
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.240
Dominique Pozo: In the emotions quite

125
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.220
Dianna Jaramillo: Often. That's like, that's

126
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.480
Dominique Pozo: That's their native territory. So anyways,

127
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.860
Dominique Pozo: Box that one and then another one I wanted to share with you was

128
00:10:52.830 --> 00:11:01.680
Dominique Pozo: Was I telling you. Oh yeah, your mercury in Pisces. This is one that that I wanted to share so team. Do you know much about mercury and what mercury is all about.

129
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:13.230
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm not. I mean, I used to. I went over a lot of this stuff. I was super into it when I was a teenager, you know, but I don't. I don't remember a whole lot of it.

130
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:20.790
Dominique Pozo: Okay so Mercury is the Sun, Mercury is the God that has the little wings on his feet.

131
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.260
Dianna Jaramillo: He on his shoes.

132
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.690
Dominique Pozo: You know, there's that and

133
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.060
Dominique Pozo: And he teacher versus the

134
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.910
Dominique Pozo: The upper world and the underworld. So he's like a

135
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.400
Dominique Pozo: Messenger He goes, and gives messages.

136
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.020
Dominique Pozo: From the gods to

137
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.090
Dominique Pozo: The what's happening down below and

138
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.410
Dominique Pozo: If we look at that as a

139
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.270
Dominique Pozo: Metaphor like you know from our conscious to our subconscious Mercury's

140
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.380
Dianna Jaramillo: Traversing

141
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.990
Dominique Pozo: This whole area and it's all about information gathering communication.

142
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.370
Dominique Pozo: sharing of ideas.

143
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.450
Dominique Pozo: And your Mercury's and Pisces and Pisces is a very

144
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.270
Dominique Pozo: Imaginative creative

145
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.110
During

146
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.490
Dominique Pozo: Aspect, and so I

147
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.430
Dominique Pozo: I think it's a great balance. You know that you've got

148
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.570
Dominique Pozo: This part of you that

149
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.160
Dominique Pozo: Relates to the world.

150
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.310
Dominique Pozo: With so much creativity and

151
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:11.820
Dominique Pozo: From the

152
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:12.810
Dominique Pozo: Pisces in

153
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.310
Space.

154
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:25.020
Dominique Pozo: So it kind of balances out the you know that that more dry earth energy, there's this very strong signature here of your Mercury's and Pisces.

155
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh my gosh. That's crazy. Yeah, so

156
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.340
Dominique Pozo: These are these are strengths. I'm really wanting to highlight some strengths for you.

157
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.340
Dianna Jaramillo: Nice, how are you

158
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:45.300
Dominique Pozo: Do you have any questions, I mean another way that we can work with your chart is if there's an area that you feel kind of stuck in or or wanting some clarity around

159
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.020
Dominique Pozo: We can look to your chart for some guidance.

160
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.250
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh my gosh. Let's. That's awesome. Um,

161
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Geez, um,

162
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:08.760
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean, if I if I sort of thought about it. It's just different areas and different aspects of things that are happening with me. Um,

163
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.350
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, I'm sure I could come up with probably a ton of questions.

164
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.490
Uh huh.

165
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:26.760
Dominique Pozo: Well, you can think about it. We can do it next time, or if there's something up for you today. We can use it but I'm just glad that I looked at your chart I was able to see a few things in here. One more thing I want to tell you

166
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.800
Dominique Pozo: You have a grand trine which is

167
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:37.470
Dominique Pozo: It's really special. I have one in water, you have one in fire. So I'm going to track. I'm going to trace this here you've got this is a perfect triangle.

168
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:50.910
Dominique Pozo: From your. So this is from your Neptune to your son, and then it looks like it's close to your Mars here in in Leo. So, so you've got a strong

169
00:13:51.420 --> 00:14:02.130
Dominique Pozo: Fire is your ally like to be able to kick start things to motivate to inspire you've got that is a very natural strength that grand trine is it special. Not everyone has one

170
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.510
Dianna Jaramillo: And you have one owns

171
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.660
Dianna Jaramillo: A fire. Oh, wow.

172
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:22.260
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so this is a, it's a real natural gift of yours, and it's also sometimes we lean into it too much because it comes so naturally that we don't develop other parts of ourselves. So it's, it's something I wanted to point out to

173
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.620
Dianna Jaramillo: And what what like

174
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.220
Dianna Jaramillo: What does that do like how, how does that affect my personality. Like, what does that mean

175
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:40.140
Dominique Pozo: Well, it means that you have a natural kind of there's a there is a an innate motivation and you

176
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:52.350
Dominique Pozo: To get you know you can you can get through a lot. You can move through a lot. You've got the fire like I i don't know too much of your history around whether you've dealt with depression or, you know, kind of

177
00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:06.690
Dominique Pozo: Those yeah those experiences, yet I imagine with a grand trine and fire you could pull yourself out of a depression or a phone or, you know, if you're having a hard time, you will find a way out, because the firewall let you stay there.

178
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, that's really true, too.

179
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.910
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so that's

180
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:12.840
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay.

181
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.890
Yeah, okay.

182
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:26.820
Dianna Jaramillo: That's amazing. That's so cool. And that little circle that's there in the areas in the little area with above the Aries. Yeah, that what is, what is that

183
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.120
Dominique Pozo: Your son. So that's your sun sign

184
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.930
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh,

185
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.160
Dianna Jaramillo: Were you born

186
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.320
Dominique Pozo: So your sun sign is it

187
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:37.440
Dominique Pozo: Is and it's

188
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.510
Dominique Pozo: Right in the middle. It's

189
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.740
Dominique Pozo: Someone

190
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.930
Dianna Jaramillo: You're kind of breaking up a little bit.

191
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:52.920
Dianna Jaramillo: Can you hear me now.

192
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.440
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, you're a little bit frozen.

193
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.220
Dianna Jaramillo: Right now.

194
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.850
Dianna Jaramillo: I can see you. Okay, not pretty here.

195
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.800
Dominique Pozo: Okay, yeah.

196
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:24.510
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Well, one thing that I see here with your son right in the middle smack in the middle of of the areas

197
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:35.400
Dominique Pozo: quadrant here is that like sometimes if it's a little closer to Pisces. You're, you're still like coming into that Aries energy. It's not fully

198
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.730
Dominique Pozo: Like you're not fully inhabiting it, you're still moving from Pisces into Aries and then if someone's a little closer to Taurus.

199
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:49.110
Dominique Pozo: Then you know they're kind of on their way out of that super willful fiery place and they're moving more towards the slowing down, have an earth.

200
00:16:49.560 --> 00:17:00.120
Dominique Pozo: Energy, that's a little more sensual and that's the Taurus piece, but you're right in the middle. So I would say, your son is just like at its prime of Aries expression.

201
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.580
Dominique Pozo: Wow. Yeah.

202
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.510
Dominique Pozo: It's cool.

203
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.180
Dianna Jaramillo: That's amazing. I always knew I was special.

204
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.930
Dominique Pozo: I know these charts. They're very affirming and, you know, they

205
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.340
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely.

206
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.090
Dominique Pozo: I love looking at the chart and and really, you know,

207
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.020
Dominique Pozo: Focusing on the strength of a chart.

208
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:29.760
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. And, and what would be considered like a weakness with the chart or or

209
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:39.930
Dominique Pozo: Well, I want to, to actually I do want to show you one thing here. So this is your North Node right here. See this little thing that looks like a tea and then a little horseshoe

210
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:50.580
Dominique Pozo: Yes, so the North Node. That's where this is where your greatest growth could be in this lifetime. If you choose to to to move in that direction.

211
00:17:51.060 --> 00:18:00.900
Dominique Pozo: And what the North Node is where you're moving towards and where you came from, is really deep Pisces and Pisces that that is the energy of

212
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:08.970
Dominique Pozo: Creation and like, it's very big goodness it's expensive LIKE ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. It's very dreamy creative

213
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:22.530
Dominique Pozo: And you're what I would say from just looking at this chart if I didn't know you, I'd say, Wow, this person has a very natural ability to, you know, imagine and create and they're very comfortable in that realm and

214
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.560
Dominique Pozo: And there one weakness. Here is boundaries are a challenge, you know,

215
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.570
Dominique Pozo: And

216
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:46.590
Dominique Pozo: Really knowing how to how to set limits and a name that and and so the that's where you know someone, someone who's got a North Node in Virgo. They know Pisces. They're moving towards something new. Virgo is all about.

217
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.450
Dominique Pozo: Like you know honing in and really

218
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.690
Dominique Pozo: Getting specific and and

219
00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:05.070
Dominique Pozo: becoming very good at what I like one skill, not having an ocean of possibility but really honing in on refining something in their life or in their

220
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.820
Dominique Pozo: Community or

221
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.040
Dominique Pozo: Their life path, so I

222
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:08.580
Dianna Jaramillo: You know,

223
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:15.060
Dominique Pozo: What I love about looking at the North Node is that your work in this lifetime. If I were to read it through your chart.

224
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:29.460
Dominique Pozo: Is to really focus is to focus in on something and really get good at it, and it is you're offering the gift of when we really master, something is then we can share it. Then we become like the teacher, the

225
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:37.860
Dominique Pozo: We have something to offer so Virgo is all about service, how can one be of service in their

226
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.430
Community.

227
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:45.150
Dominique Pozo: And I think if you were to step into your highest expression, it would be to be of service.

228
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.020
You know, to

229
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:55.380
Dominique Pozo: To use all your creative capacity that you're really good at and to focus and hone it in as a gift to to your people.

230
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:01.560
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh wow, that's that is really something because I, I, I couldn't agree more.

231
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.020
Dianna Jaramillo: So I could not agree more.

232
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:22.050
Dominique Pozo: So that's so this is cool because the North Node. It's almost my, my mentor calls it your curriculum. It's your curriculum in this lifetime. Like what are you here to do and learn and hopefully ideally we fulfill that it's, it can be a very satisfying life if we really step into that.

233
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:28.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Wow. Wow. And that's why every time that I've

234
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Done something or like, you know, when I when I am

235
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:46.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Being of service in, you know, in any area of my life. That's why I felt so just it just made me feel so whole anything

236
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.070
Dominique Pozo: Oh that's great that's such a good acknowledgement, it really

237
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.590
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, he affirms that

238
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.290
Dominique Pozo: You know when you have moved in the direction of

239
00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.490
Dominique Pozo: Your note of your, you know, your souls curriculum that

240
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.780
Dominique Pozo: You do recognize like

241
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.650
Dominique Pozo: Okay, this is where I become whole. This is how I become whole

242
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:13.500
Dianna Jaramillo: Mm hmm. Really. Yeah, I felt it. I felt it many, many times and and while that's, that's amazing. That makes so much sense.

243
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:35.250
Dominique Pozo: And you have two very strong allies here so Saturn and Jupiter are also in Virgo near your North Node and these are great ones to have Saturn is like Saturn is the the energy and the archetype that can, it can keep a steady it creates schedules, it, it, it lives in the world of time schedule.

244
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:41.940
Dominique Pozo: Form creation, it's, it's like the get it done archetype. So you have

245
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:42.300
Dianna Jaramillo: This

246
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.130
Dominique Pozo: You have the capacity to do it.

247
00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.470
Dominique Pozo: And then, yeah, Jupiter is this huge expansive like

248
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:57.090
Dominique Pozo: They call it the fortunate, like the benevolent planet of for good fortune.

249
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.020
Dominique Pozo: And so

250
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:04.020
Dominique Pozo: I just, you know, I, I see this as you have you've got a lot of good fortune in this

251
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:09.180
Dominique Pozo: In this area of your chart. Like if you if you really apply yourself. I think you

252
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.210
Dominique Pozo: You would do so you will do continue to do so well.

253
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.990
Dominique Pozo: In well in moving forward in that direction.

254
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:17.940
Dianna Jaramillo: Wow.

255
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:19.530
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

256
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:20.280
It's

257
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.160
Dianna Jaramillo: Got it's just really

258
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.820
Dianna Jaramillo: That's that's really, really cool.

259
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.270
Dominique Pozo: There's

260
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.760
Dominique Pozo: A lot of strength there. That's what I see a lot of

261
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.560
Dominique Pozo: Strength there. Yeah.

262
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.110
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Wow.

263
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.940
Dominique Pozo: And then let's see challenges you want to eat. Did you ask about challenges.

264
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.470
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, okay.

265
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:57.660
Dominique Pozo: So two things I see already are Pluto. So Pluto is the planet of like death transformation. It's he's the ruler of the underworld and Pluto is in Libra in your eighth house and the Eighth house is about

266
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:08.190
Dominique Pozo: Is also about kind of death and transformation and the great mysteries, so there's there's a very strong

267
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.690
Dominique Pozo: Energetic in Libra which Libra.

268
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:23.190
Dominique Pozo: is ruled by Venus and it's all about beauty and harmony and I what I see here is that maybe you know there's

269
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:34.050
Dominique Pozo: There could be some disruption, like maybe when when you get into a harmonious flow. There's Pluto's always wanting you to grow. And it's like, don't get too comfortable here, we're gonna

270
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:41.700
Dominique Pozo: We're going to kind of knock you on your butt and smack you a little so that you grow so you keep growing. But it's not comfortable

271
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:43.560
Dominique Pozo: Right. No.

272
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:55.260
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, so, you know, Venus, which rules Libra. She's it's all about like beauty and love and harmony, but this Pluto doesn't jive with that. It's like

273
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.060
Dominique Pozo: You can have it for a little bit.

274
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.820
Dominique Pozo: But I'm going to start up. I'm going to start the pot, you know,

275
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.120
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh, weird. That's interesting.

276
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.990
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

277
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.610
Dominique Pozo: I don't know if that

278
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.490
Dominique Pozo: resonates with you at all. But I, I just see that

279
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.630
Dominique Pozo: There's a

280
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:18.600
Dominique Pozo: There's kind of a natural signature here around. There's in your lifetime, you know, you're going to probably be

281
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:33.270
Dominique Pozo: Pushed to keep growing and it's going to be tough, like there's a lot of descents that you'll take into the underworld, as far as like, okay, that needs to transform. So there's going to be a big rupture here some disturbing.

282
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:46.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Yeah, I know that that actually makes a whole lot of sense because that is very, very uncomfortable and in anything. I mean, oh my gosh. That makes so much sense. Anytime there's

283
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:57.000
Dianna Jaramillo: A CHANGE OR ANYTHING LIKE LIKE THIS. IT JUST skills. I think it just feels so much worse than then

284
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.840
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, but I just totally makes sense. It does.

285
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:08.670
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and I I think just maybe something to keep in mind as a possibility is that

286
00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.810
Dominique Pozo: You know when you're having a really harmonious

287
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.480
Dianna Jaramillo: Kind of fluid time

288
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.700
Dianna Jaramillo: To really appreciate, because

289
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:22.320
Dominique Pozo: Pluto's just around the corner, saying, okay, don't get too comfortable and

290
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:32.850
Dominique Pozo: I think, and I agree. I mean, if we can look at it at through, like, okay, don't get too attached to this recognize that change is always happening. It's just, it's really strong in your chart.

291
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.220
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, right.

292
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:36.840
Dianna Jaramillo: Exactly.

293
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.310
Dominique Pozo: So maybe that

294
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:39.360
Dominique Pozo: Oh, go ahead.

295
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:44.820
Dianna Jaramillo: Well, I feel I mean I guess I've become more comfortable with it because that's been the case.

296
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:49.650
Dianna Jaramillo: My whole life. Like there's these big just massive

297
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:57.540
Dianna Jaramillo: It just feels to me. Maybe, maybe not so much but to me it just feels like these huge changes and it's just like

298
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:03.750
Dianna Jaramillo: non stop like oh my gosh, if I if I could if I could even tell you. Oh my gosh.

299
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.030
Dianna Jaramillo: Man, it's been that way, my whole entire life. And it's exactly like that like I've sort of

300
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:26.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Come to learn from, from my own experiences that yeah, don't, don't get too comfortable like just enjoy it. When, when it's common when it's smooth and when it's nice enjoy it because the other. It's not forever. It's not going to be there forever.

301
00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.720
Dominique Pozo: Right, there's a real invitation to embrace change.

302
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.290
Dianna Jaramillo: In

303
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.150
Dominique Pozo: And I, and I see something else actually as we're looking so this is black moon Lilith.

304
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:42.840
Dominique Pozo: And this is something that's not always put into a chart, but I like to look at it and black moon Lilith is like

305
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.690
Dominique Pozo: She's the archetype of

306
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.020
Dominique Pozo: Like the High Priestess you know she was

307
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.510
Dominique Pozo: Cast out she was the part of, like,

308
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.160
Dominique Pozo: You know, you've got the mother Mary as an archetype, you know, the

309
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.260
Dominique Pozo: Good mother and then you've got

310
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:11.010
Dominique Pozo: The and then she's kind of like the prostitute. The black moon Lilith and she carries that that liberated feminine energy. And it's not that you're a prostitute, or that any of us.

311
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:12.750
Dianna Jaramillo: But it's right.

312
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.150
Dominique Pozo: That part of the feminine. That is, is liberated and has freed herself.

313
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:30.840
Dominique Pozo: And I see in your chart. But, you know, as you say, you know, you've you've learned over time to embrace change and and to recognize. Okay, this is, this is going to happen again.

314
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:31.560
That

315
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.540
Dominique Pozo: For strength.

316
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.960
Dianna Jaramillo: And

317
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:40.230
Dominique Pozo: You know, if it's if you keep cultivating that that liberated feminine energy

318
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:46.440
Dominique Pozo: It's it can become so strong, like almost like what's, what's the word

319
00:27:49.080 --> 00:28:03.390
Dominique Pozo: Just the wise woman like the there. I believe anyone to to step into this wisdom comes through this continual, you know, kind of death and rebirth and transformation. It's what

320
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.010
Dominique Pozo: It's what's really

321
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.370
Dominique Pozo: Feeding that wise part of yourself.

322
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.910
Dianna Jaramillo: Mm hmm. Wow. Yeah.

323
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.760
Dominique Pozo: That's cool at your black moon Lilith this there.

324
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.480
Dianna Jaramillo: That's so cool. Oh my god.

325
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.590
Dianna Jaramillo: That's all I'm so glad I got to see this.

326
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.670
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, this is cool. There's one more thing. This is another

327
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:36.510
Dominique Pozo: Piece that where we often find challenges the cairon. This is the Cairo on right here, the little k with a circle here.

328
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:46.200
Dominique Pozo: And cairon is the wounded healer. So he was one of the in the mythology. He was one of the Centaurs the half man, half horse that

329
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:57.450
Dominique Pozo: Would run around and Achilles shot him in in the in his heel there and cairon is now the wounded healer. So he

330
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.260
Dominique Pozo: You know he he kind of walked with a limp and

331
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:06.360
Dominique Pozo: It's this is we all have it somewhere in our chart. We all have our limp and

332
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.900
Dominique Pozo: So we're I'm just looking at the limp that

333
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:18.900
Dominique Pozo: That I'm seeing. So it's in the third house which is all about like siblings and

334
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:35.280
Dominique Pozo: I don't know if any of this will resonate but third house is about the siblings and it's also in Taurus which Taurus is about like home security money all of the kind of base fundamental

335
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.380
Dianna Jaramillo: Piece, it's

336
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:51.360
Dominique Pozo: It's the. It's like the realm of sensuality and pleasure in the material world. And so I don't know. Do you, do you feel like that that's been kind of a struggle in some ways for you or no.

337
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.430
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, oh yeah.

338
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.390
Dianna Jaramillo: Don't hold that

339
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.640
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, all of that. Everything, everything you just mentioned.

340
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.010
Dianna Jaramillo: Has been all all of it, the financial the

341
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.700
Dianna Jaramillo: Sibling the

342
00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.130
Dianna Jaramillo: Everything. Yeah, that's all of that has been like a

343
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:16.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Like a

344
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.390
Dianna Jaramillo: Weakness or a limp, for sure.

345
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:30.210
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. So okay, so, so the power of knowing where Olympus is to be extra vigilant like okay this is a place where

346
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.580
Dominique Pozo: I may struggle, you know, and

347
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.150
Dominique Pozo: Yet when I see what you have here with your North Node with Saturn and Jupiter in Virgo.

348
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:45.990
Dominique Pozo: Oh, and you know, I didn't mention also it's in the seventh house and the seventh house is all about, like,

349
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.450
Dominique Pozo: Your relationship community. So it's all about community.

350
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:53.490
Dominique Pozo: And connection.

351
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.530
Dominique Pozo: And so I think, you know, the more that you feed this, the more it will support your limp.

352
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.550
Yeah.

353
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.840
Dominique Pozo: Like getting on track here is going to make it much easier to be here with ease.

354
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.240
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. That makes sense.

355
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:16.080
Dominique Pozo: This is a natural thing. And I just, I don't know if this resonates. But when you say you had a hard time with your siblings.

356
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.220
Dominique Pozo: I think, too, because there's such a

357
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:33.600
Dominique Pozo: positive potential in the seventh house. You may create your own family that is not blood, but it's your, you know, a new family like through your friendships and, you know,

358
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:48.240
Dominique Pozo: Like you said your, your partner and his, his family. They're so kind with you that feeling may happen through the community that you grow and the family that you grow that may not be blood because your blood ones. This is where the limp is, you know,

359
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.910
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, that's, that's crazy.

360
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Seriously, God, I could not make more sense. Totally.

361
00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:04.920
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, yeah, that's crazy because like it's always been easier for me to have that those kind of close bonds.

362
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:21.540
Dianna Jaramillo: That were not blood related, you know, like, like my whole life. I was I was more connected with and and had a tighter bond with with people who I was, had no no relation to

363
00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:32.280
Dominique Pozo: Well, that's where, that's where your Jupiter comes in, have the good fortune I that makes so much sense. And it's really validating that there's good fortune in your community, you know, with the friends that you

364
00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.800
Dominique Pozo: Seek out and that you choose to to really feed those and nurture those friendships.

365
00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:44.190
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I think that's I'm sharing this because it could be a place to keep focusing, you know,

366
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:47.520
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely.

367
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.960
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, it's like, like you just mentioned to with my boyfriend and his family. It's like

368
00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.830
Dianna Jaramillo: That's. Yeah, that's definitely something I would

369
00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Just want to protect and

370
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:02.370
Dianna Jaramillo: Nurture and

371
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.630
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, keep

372
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Just close to my heart because it just is very, very special.

373
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.360
Dominique Pozo: To me.

374
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.970
Dianna Jaramillo: That those relationships. Yeah.

375
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:16.620
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, that's that's hopefully these are some good

376
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:28.200
Dominique Pozo: Maybe like guide posts on as you move forward, like how you can direct your energy, a little bit and your American

377
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.960
Dianna Jaramillo: Rightly. Yeah, exactly.

378
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:33.510
Dianna Jaramillo: Well,

379
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:42.360
Dianna Jaramillo: And what are those ones right right there past. Where's that the first

380
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.160
Dianna Jaramillo: House there.

381
00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.930
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, the first house. These two

382
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.380
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so let's see. So this is mercury. The mercury in Pisces. That's what

383
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.520
Dominique Pozo: I was sharing with you earlier that like you're

384
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:05.910
Dominique Pozo: You're in native ways of communicating and, you know, thinking and then connecting the dots and sharing information that comes from

385
00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.710
Dominique Pozo: The energy of Pisces, which is very creative. You know, it's very feeling

386
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.360
Dominique Pozo: Not feeling based

387
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:20.040
Dominique Pozo: And sensitive, there's a real deep sensitivity and and I get that from you, like when you communicate. There's a lot of warmth and sensitivity there.

388
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.240
Dianna Jaramillo: Mm hmm. Um,

389
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:32.910
Dominique Pozo: You know, which is way different than Capricorn Capricorn is pretty dry like you don't i don't typically feel that much warmth from Capricorn, which is helpful because your moons in Capricorn.

390
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:44.550
Dominique Pozo: And you're feeling running is like the essence of it is here, but your way of relating and communicating has has a little more relate ability to it from the Pisces.

391
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.210
Dianna Jaramillo: Life, you know,

392
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:51.900
Dominique Pozo: And then this is Pallas Athena. This is an asteroid and Pallas Athena, she's

393
00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.150
Dominique Pozo: She's like the

394
00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:01.350
Dominique Pozo: The Independent Woman That is the she's the archer Athena's the Huntress

395
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.180
Dominique Pozo: In mythology.

396
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:24.120
Dominique Pozo: And she's, she's very on her own. And if I were to think about that. Well, it's in the first house which is ruled by Mars. Mars is is super solo, you know, he's the warrior. She's the she's the warrior s. And I think there's what I would say with when I think about that and it's in Pisces.

397
00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:28.020
Dominique Pozo: I think there's a capacity to really be independent.

398
00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:30.930
Dominique Pozo: And

399
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.350
Dominique Pozo: And there's still

400
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:50.970
Dominique Pozo: There's still a softness, though it's not it doesn't, it's not in a fire sign or an earth sign. It's very, it's soft. You know, there's like a an independence, but it's not really edgy or hard, you know,

401
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:58.890
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Right. Yeah, that's, that's true, that's definitely true. Like, I totally can relate with that for sure.

402
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.430
Dianna Jaramillo: Interesting.

403
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:12.330
Dominique Pozo: Let's see one. We haven't touched on is, um, you're honest you're honest is

404
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.190
Dominique Pozo: So you're honest is kind of the god of like

405
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:24.060
Dominique Pozo: Is not conventional and wants to break the structures of of

406
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.870
Dominique Pozo: You know, like if society has certain

407
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:35.010
Dominique Pozo: Beliefs about how things need to be you're honest goes and blows it up and it's like, no, we're going to do this differently and

408
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:48.300
Dominique Pozo: you're honest is in Scorpio with you, which is a water sign so but Scorpio is the deepest of the water signs and is is there's a lot of power here. It's got a different energy than cancer and Pisces.

409
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:55.140
Dominique Pozo: And it's in the ninth house the ninth house is all about like philosophies and

410
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:03.330
Dominique Pozo: Not really. Not really religion so much but more like just spirituality and philosophies and

411
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.950
Dominique Pozo: I don't know if this resonates. But what I would read from this is that

412
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:28.950
Dominique Pozo: Maybe when it comes to life the way that life should be or needs to be. You don't really subscribe to that so much. There's a strong kind of independent thinking that goes pretty deep around like your belief systems, it's not

413
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.940
Dominique Pozo: Not really. Conventional is that

414
00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.160
Dianna Jaramillo: Huge

415
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.360
Dominique Pozo: Huge. Uh huh.

416
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:45.210
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that's, that is, yeah. Huge with me. I've, I've always always been like that too. I always felt like

417
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, this isn't the way it should be. And so I'm not going to do it that way.

418
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:56.100
Dianna Jaramillo: Even though that's, yeah, that's the way it is, you know, and that's how pretty much everybody does it.

419
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:03.630
Dianna Jaramillo: If I'm not. If I don't feel it and i don't i don't agree with it. I'm just not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it that way at all.

420
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.160
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, and that's

421
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:10.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Totally. That's amazing. Oh my god.

422
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:24.480
Dominique Pozo: Scorpio is very intuitive. That's what I love about Scorpio Scorpio is got this capacity to see like Scorpio can see through all of the stories and the BS and

423
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.670
Dominique Pozo: Can just has this like laser vision.

424
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:36.300
Dominique Pozo: And that's a real strength here and and you know there's, I would imagine. And what I'm hearing from you to like you really trust yourself, you have the vision. You can see it and

425
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:43.860
Dominique Pozo: You're going to make the choices and kind of break the status quo, because you you have a deep sense of knowing what's right for you.

426
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.750
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely.

427
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.390
Dominique Pozo: So that's another kind of affirmation to to just

428
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.340
Dominique Pozo: Like keep affirming

429
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:59.310
Dominique Pozo: That you may do it different. You may not live the way that you know your dad lives or your mom lives.

430
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:04.950
Dominique Pozo: And that you have your own philosophies about how what's right for you, you know,

431
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:13.830
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, definitely. And and and it's funny because both my parents are super. I'm like,

432
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:30.240
Dianna Jaramillo: By the book like they both did everything right and by the book and the way they do you know we're we're taught and raised that this you do it this way you do it this way you do it this way. And that's what you do. And that's what they both did

433
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:33.030
Dianna Jaramillo: And I am I could not be more opposite

434
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.080
Dominique Pozo: From now I'm

435
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Really, I'm like, the total opposite. That's amazing.

436
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:41.550
Dominique Pozo: It is amazing. Well, your child really says it i this is this is why I

437
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:48.240
Dominique Pozo: You know, I mean, astrology is kind of like some people may be like, What are you, you know, how can you read a

438
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:57.990
Dominique Pozo: Character structure through this through the planets. Although, you know, in talking with you. I have a sense of you, but I don't know you that well yet and rainbow.

439
00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.090
Dominique Pozo: Rainbow these and to hear that.

440
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.120
Dominique Pozo: Gosh. Yeah, that's really right on. It's pretty awesome.

441
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.680
Dianna Jaramillo: That's, that's, it's incredible. It's really incredible how

442
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:21.030
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean your date and time and place of birth and I mean like you're just it just like it says everything about you. It says, Who will be who you are.

443
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:33.960
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean, that's, you know, your potential what what what you have the potential to be if you if you sort of, you know, listen to this chart in and make certain choices.

444
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.960
Dianna Jaramillo: It's just incredible. It's

445
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.650
Dianna Jaramillo: Really fascinating. It really, really is.

446
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:42.570
Dominique Pozo: Totally um

447
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:48.660
Dominique Pozo: There's one more thing as you're speaking that popped out to me and I really I don't

448
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:59.550
Dominique Pozo: I like to look at charts and wait for the planets to jump out and and be like, hey, look at me, and Mars. Just kind of jumped out and I think

449
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:11.820
Dominique Pozo: One more strength. I'm seeing is your Mars in Leo and Leo is a fire sign fire. You know that that goes really well with Mars because Mars is like, you know, get it done.

450
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:20.850
Dominique Pozo: That strong will yet Leo is so heart based Leo is just like such a giver come this there's a warmth and Leo that's

451
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:32.520
Dominique Pozo: It's different than like areas is more the warriors Sagittarius is kind of really just on his mission with the arrow shooting in a direction and the vision can get a little tunnel vision, sometimes but Leo's

452
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:43.890
Dominique Pozo: It's super warm and expressive and and like really values, love, and it's got that inner child caught the divine child is

453
00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:45.780
Dominique Pozo: Wrapped up and Leo energy to and your

454
00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:51.990
Dominique Pozo: Your Mars is there. And so I think maybe one, one last thing I want to say is that, you know,

455
00:41:52.680 --> 00:42:02.910
Dominique Pozo: At least from what I see in your chart, the way that you express your will, in the world is warm. There's a lot of words there. And that's a strength. You know, it's, there's, there's a lot of fire.

456
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:11.250
Dominique Pozo: In your kind of a way that you can move through the world. But there's also a lot of, you know, care, and work with that so

457
00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:13.830
Dominique Pozo: That's another strength. I'm seeing

458
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.640
Dianna Jaramillo: Wow. Yeah.

459
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.080
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know.

460
00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.400
Dominique Pozo: Does that do you can you do relate to that is that feel

461
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.820
Dianna Jaramillo: Totally completely. Oh yeah, definitely. There's

462
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:35.370
Dianna Jaramillo: All of that. Yeah, everything you just said and and honestly like sometimes I feel like that can be I'm

463
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:41.880
Dianna Jaramillo: Kind of a not like a weakness or a fault but um

464
00:42:43.500 --> 00:43:00.870
Dianna Jaramillo: It can just, it can be it can be taken like yes like weakness. Because of that, that warm caring because I really do have that very, very strong. And I always have. And I'm like that with with everybody, you know, I mean, unless they give me a reason to not be but

465
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:07.290
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, that's just naturally how I am and how I move through the world and

466
00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.250
Dianna Jaramillo: And but it can be looked at, like, I'm

467
00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.890
Dianna Jaramillo: Like weakness like

468
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.340
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, like, because I don't know.

469
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:23.820
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know. I know what I mean. But I can't, I can't figure out really how to say it.

470
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:28.140
Dianna Jaramillo: Like people just look at that, you know, like I'm

471
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.380
Dianna Jaramillo: Like

472
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:37.050
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean, it can be good and it can be bad because there's some people that really

473
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.780
Dianna Jaramillo: Have

474
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.620
Dianna Jaramillo: Like a positive reaction to that in me.

475
00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:54.660
Dianna Jaramillo: when when when they feel that are they sense that warm, kind of caring thing. There's, I mean a lot of people do. But then there's other people that it's like they really, really don't like that about me.

476
00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:59.760
Dianna Jaramillo: And that's kind of the way it's always been like I feel like most people

477
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:13.080
Dianna Jaramillo: It's like most people don't really get give me a chance to get to know me at all in. It's like they either really like me right away from the beginning, or they really, really can't stand me right away from the beginning.

478
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:23.970
Dianna Jaramillo: And that can be hurtful. So like that whole warm caring thing can kind of turn around on me. I think and and end up where where it's kind of hurtful.

479
00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.420
Dianna Jaramillo: Because I am so naturally one

480
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:28.530
Dianna Jaramillo: And

481
00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:34.170
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, try to be kind to everybody, but it does end up hurting me sometimes.

482
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.450
Dianna Jaramillo: You know what I mean, like, it's, it's a good thing, but it's

483
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:47.280
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, I feel like I wish I could change a little bit of that and be a little bit more like

484
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.990
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know what the word is

485
00:44:53.640 --> 00:45:05.250
Dianna Jaramillo: Like maybe more assertive, maybe that that would help if I was just more assertive, instead of just being too nice like so nice all the time like a people pleaser.

486
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.410
Dianna Jaramillo: You know,

487
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.310
Dominique Pozo: Well, your son is in Aries. I mean,

488
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:17.820
Dominique Pozo: What really what you have the capacity to radiate out is more that assertive.

489
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:29.160
Dominique Pozo: Nature yet what I what it keeps coming up as you say that is to really draw on your moon energy here, which is that is your emotional body and

490
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:46.800
Dominique Pozo: Maybe, maybe, here's something to think about as try not as an experiment. It seems like it's very natural for you to move through the world without warm yet. I would also see what it feels like to carry that warm climb the mountain look with perspective and be very discerning

491
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.260
Dominique Pozo: Around the area where you give that warm

492
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.120
Dominique Pozo: Because you don't have to give it to everyone.

493
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:52.230
Right.

494
00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:02.310
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, yeah, that, that's it. That's the thing is, it doesn't yes and and that's that's the hard part for me that's the part that I don't know how to

495
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:16.530
Dianna Jaramillo: Do yet. I want to learn. I definitely want to learn. I want to get there. But yeah, it's like I just, I do. I just automatically give that to everybody and and I could definitely be more discerning about who

496
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.740
Dominique Pozo: You are. And that's where the lack of boundaries comes in your

497
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.810
Dominique Pozo: Yes. Your Mercury, which is the

498
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:26.370
Dominique Pozo: Connector the communicator. It's naturally like I can do it with everyone.

499
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.870
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes, yes.

500
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:30.420
Dominique Pozo: Huge. It has no boundaries.

501
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:41.730
Dominique Pozo: And do the actually where you're moving towards your North Node is Virgo, which is definitely like a refining honing in being very discerning and

502
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:57.270
Dominique Pozo: And thinking, you know, thinking a little more, and you've got this moon in Capricorn, which is so helpful. It's, I think it takes slowing down because the divine child Leo's the divine child the divine child just like there's nothing

503
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.590
Dominique Pozo: Nothing's gonna stop it.

504
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:02.490
Dianna Jaramillo: And yeah.

505
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:12.270
Dominique Pozo: This is a child energy Virgo is more of the adult Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, which is the archetype of Father. This is the most paternal

506
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:17.190
Dominique Pozo: Signature in the chart. So you yeah I think as you say it's

507
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:18.270
Dominique Pozo: Something growing

508
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:30.480
Dominique Pozo: I think growing into these more more adult parts that are going to, you know, consider a little more and and think and make choices from the top of the mountain, you know,

509
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.700
Dianna Jaramillo: Wait, yeah. Wow.

510
00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.010
Dianna Jaramillo: Amazing.

511
00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:42.060
Dianna Jaramillo: This is all being just blows my, my whole little mind.

512
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:43.980
Dominique Pozo: Oh,

513
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.070
Dianna Jaramillo: Wow, I mean,

514
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:57.600
Dianna Jaramillo: For every single part of that to really resonate with me and to really i mean i just i understood every single thing we talked about made so much sense.

515
00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:10.080
Dianna Jaramillo: Awesome just yeah but just to know, you know, like there's this this guide right here. It's like a, it's a, it's like a guide. It's like our own very, very personal little guidebooks

516
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:15.960
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, oh yeah, this is our character structure. I mean, I've been looking at my chart for a long time and

517
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:21.270
Dominique Pozo: Still, I will still look at it like if I really sit with it and I'll see something new.

518
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.440
Dominique Pozo: So I'm going to

519
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:25.860
Dominique Pozo: Email this to you so you can look at it, it's a map.

520
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.480
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, to. Yeah, right.

521
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:33.900
Dominique Pozo: And then down here. It'll give you all the aspects and these are things you can look up on your own, because it can go very deep so

522
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:34.890
Dianna Jaramillo: It'll tell you

523
00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:45.480
Dominique Pozo: And I'll show you how to read it very simply like Mars right here. It trains your son, which is a trine is a very sweet aspect. It's like

524
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:47.880
Dominique Pozo: Mars and Leo.

525
00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.740
Dominique Pozo: And and your son and areas they really complement each other and

526
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.800
Dominique Pozo: And you can look if you look online. What is Mars.

527
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.820
Dominique Pozo: Trying sun.

528
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:05.910
Dominique Pozo: Mars and Leo Chinese sun in Aries. What does that mean you can look that up. And then here's like a more difficult thing like

529
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:09.690
Dominique Pozo: Let's see, let's find a square

530
00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:26.640
Dominique Pozo: So okay, so mercury and mercury in Pisces. I know that's Venus. Excuse me, Your Venus is in Gemini your Venus is squaring your Mars, so that's that's going to be a more challenging thing that you can look up like what does that mean squares are

531
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:28.650
Dominique Pozo: There's a lot more resistance there.

532
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.290
Dominique Pozo: opposition's these. This means an opposition is little circle with a line.

533
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:35.190
Dianna Jaramillo: So you've got

534
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.140
Dominique Pozo: Like mercury opposes your Saturn. That's another hard aspect. So

535
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.480
Dominique Pozo: So these are you could get really deep with

536
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:45.090
Dominique Pozo: Looking at the aspects.

537
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.470
Dominique Pozo: So I'll send that to you.

538
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.850
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh, awesome. So cool. Oh my gosh.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:50:00.090

540
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.220

541
00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:03.060
