00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Michelle.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, hi. I can hear you. I can't see you yet.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn your video off. Let's see if we can. Oh, there we go.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, oh we so you are

5
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: First of all, good morning to you.

6
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And you are on little sleep is that kind of the message. I'm getting

7
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.840
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, she's um well one of the motivation of this one on this side, but we don't register for and he just having a hard time at night.

8
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Baby

9
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.510
Yeah.

10
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.430
Rochelle Martinez: Yep.

11
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what

12
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We started last week, not last week, last time we met, we go down and cons of interaction, for sure. How are you doing around

13
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: We can talk as little or as much as you want around pandemic topic. I really like to pace with people. Um,

14
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What's coming up for you around that topic.

15
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.360
Rochelle Martinez: Very much, David. That was not a mom.

16
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.820
I think

17
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.110
Rochelle Martinez: Everything. No one has mode out but um

18
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.090
Rochelle Martinez: I guess this by getting in routine that doing all the necessary steps to

19
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.960
Rochelle Martinez: Being cannot out a little bit like

20
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

21
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.440
Rochelle Martinez: During show you could do but

22
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.560
Gwenevere Abriel: What about how your mom and grandma are feeling

23
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.120
Rochelle Martinez: Well, my mom doctors have come down with that one was in ICU and one

24
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.400
Rochelle Martinez: To recover it at home. So this is a little good every day. Do not even because

25
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.560
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

26
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.900
Rochelle Martinez: To happen.

27
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You're keeping it sounds like you're saying you're keeping

28
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: A sort of healthy perspective on you're doing everything you can. And

29
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.700
Rochelle Martinez: That's what I'm doing. Okay.

30
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll know when it goes overboard. In other words, when that's not working anymore.

31
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where we register signs that we have red flag sort of emotional experiences when you're losing sleep from overthinking

32
00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: When you notice you're overeating under eating irritable with people. Those are pretty common signs that our mood that we've got something kind of behind the scenes going on, you're really going to want to take a close look at that, or any of those happening to you.

33
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.100
Rochelle Martinez: Know,

34
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. I'm so glad if they do, let's address them right away. Okay, have compassion for yourself. Realizing okay I'm probably getting wrapped up in my, what if worst case scenarios.

35
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm running them too often, I'm feeling it with more supportive evidence of my worst case. What if we got to interrupt those negative. What if thoughts go over to

36
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I'm doing everything I possibly can. And I'll address anything that comes my way I will address it in a moment right now is there's something urgent, I need to address. Yes.

37
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.680
Gwenevere Abriel: The baby. Okay. Am I sleeping. Am I eating that's kind of the basic sequence. You see, it sounds like you're kind of doing those kind of things.

38
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

39
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.450
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah yeah

40
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you creating time for still walking outside some physical exercise. What are you doing to still stay in motion, and not just cooking cooked up in in the place

41
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.500
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I mean, the kids go for a walk in the afternoon.

42
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.300
Okay.

43
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And the kids still don't know what's up right

44
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.350
Rochelle Martinez: Well, my nephew, he's already

45
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.780
Rochelle Martinez: Going on TV and everything so he knows

46
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.050
Rochelle Martinez: coronavirus

47
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.120
Rochelle Martinez: Clean, but he's not

48
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:54.570
Rochelle Martinez: It's not sure where he's nervous about it, or where he losing sleep or anything like that out of it you know they made me just

49
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.530
Rochelle Martinez: See what's going on is no

50
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.390
Rochelle Martinez: Typical kid.

51
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything else

52
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: surprise you that given. Remember, let's do some some reinforcement of how far you've come right just going back a couple years right

53
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And you imagine that you would ever feel like you do right now, which is, I got this right.

54
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.730
Rochelle Martinez: Not it took it's taken a minute to like

55
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.400
Rochelle Martinez: Even just

56
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.320
Rochelle Martinez: Chill. My nephew and just like everything. You know what I mean, they get any

57
00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:04.560
Rochelle Martinez: More like I just felt overwhelmed with everything and like now I don't feel like that. Like, like you take it as a column you know the meaning

58
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.310
Rochelle Martinez: Learn how to deal with it at the moment.

59
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you see that you have more stressors.

60
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about it. Don't you

61
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.060
Yeah.

62
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that something less really honor how powerful the mind is and that when we're not catastrophizing something when we say, you know what

63
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have to think about everything all at once. I'll just face the thing right in front of me. I have the skills. I'll just handle it when it's right in front of me I have trusted myself of self regulate I'll be okay. It does no good to pile them up and put out worst case scenario.

64
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Just doesn't

65
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.830
It overwhelming.

66
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That's really neat. I appreciate you letting me go there for a second because it was neat to witness you saying today.

67
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

68
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Because remember, like, I've got little stories in my head of, you know, what will it be like if I have to go to the pharmacy, you know, what will it, I might have to have a medicine. My someone else's medicine to the card near me. Well, I use it like

69
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, a Benz, whatever. You know what I mean.

70
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.790
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

71
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you look now take a look and really honor

72
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What can be right there in front of you and you still maintain a sense of self efficacy and poise and you manage it.

73
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.930
Rochelle Martinez: crazy it's crazy. The way your mind works.

74
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.500
Rochelle Martinez: And the way you just go with it and

75
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.350
Rochelle Martinez: If you come late, not a question to

76
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:05.940
Rochelle Martinez: You become accustomed to your surroundings and what's going on and you learn how to deal with the night without panic without

77
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.250
Rochelle Martinez: Fear and without so you just

78
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.790
Rochelle Martinez: Know how to deal with it and

79
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.110
Rochelle Martinez: Crazy.

80
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And so now you know when you run across people that doubt themselves right when they're faced with difficult obstacles and they're wrapped up in the mindset of what if this horrible thing happens.

81
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a lived experience of saying, I've been there and we have to shift our mindset. We have to shift it to thinking about other things having a what if scenario. That is what if

82
00:09:50.460 --> 00:10:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I turned out to be an even better than person than I thought what if I'm an amazing Mother. What if it turns out I'm an amazing daughter and friend and woman.

83
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we spend time over in those what ifs instead of our automatic fear activated, right, the amygdala working. What if the worst case scenario. Instead, what if we turn our attention to those other ones. It takes effort.

84
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But it has a positive outcome. And it doesn't make you naive and it doesn't, it's not going to turn you into a sucker where people are and take advantage of you, it means you're going to have a happy day

85
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have back to back, peaceful days. Who wouldn't want that.

86
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't. You didn't become a soccer. Did you did. Did anybody knock on the door and swindle you out of something

87
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:41.850
Rochelle Martinez: Nope.

88
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: No, see that that ability which is is

89
00:10:47.760 --> 00:11:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Our oldest part of our brain, the one that keeps us safe. The one that sees constantly vigilant. Right. It's that limbic system response that reptilian brain it's like okay, is this dangerous it's dangerous, but that part of the brain way at the base of our of our brain.

90
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Only does that we've got a key in other parts of our brain that are more evolved. We've got to counter those automatic initial fear responses with more evolved thinking and you're doing it.

91
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.580
Rochelle Martinez: About it that way.

92
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

93
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.600
Rochelle Martinez: Good. What do you need

94
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.600
Rochelle Martinez: And the bottom of the fridge. On the bottom shelf, all the way to

95
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.680
Rochelle Martinez: The bottom, bottom

96
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.800
Rochelle Martinez: To the baby.

97
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

98
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What milligram dose. You got these days.

99
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.460
Rochelle Martinez: I'm done the same 1.7

100
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I'm assuming, you'll stay here for a while, while you're on your own. So, yeah, okay.

101
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like a pretty safe dose.

102
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:42.030
Rochelle Martinez: About going down, but it wasn't. What's up, gentlemen. It was with the doctor before that they said that maybe you should set the tone.

103
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.600
Rochelle Martinez: For pain management and not going any lower

104
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.230
Rochelle Martinez: But maybe

105
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.950
Rochelle Martinez: If I said to him, that that would be a

106
00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:02.880
Rochelle Martinez: Better reason to relapse back your head, you're like oh nice to take on the lower type shit, you know, to me,

107
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That is all the same.

108
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all craving. That's all trigger. That's all that same high risk stuff that thought you just had that's addictive thinking. So it sounds like what do you know the name of the doctor was it Tracy Jackson, who do you think

109
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.670
Rochelle Martinez: I remember watching this, but you know what, I, I still don't think

110
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.780
Rochelle Martinez: Like that, like that addictive behavior so that

111
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:39.630
Rochelle Martinez: Quick note on your lower let me miss a couple days of Madison to Boston and I take one type shit you're not. I mean like before.

112
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:53.310
Rochelle Martinez: That was the hardest part of my brain, saying, oh, you could go three days without us on a good enough. Those and you could do drugs or whatever and then come back in three days, and we'll start again. Do you know to me.

113
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:54.030
Like

114
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.610
Rochelle Martinez: I don't that part like I haven't thought about that, like,

115
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.890
Rochelle Martinez: Like even just in general that and so long that it

116
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.170
Rochelle Martinez: Has enough my mind because I know I'm an addict and I really love that anytime, but

117
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.820
Rochelle Martinez: I just don't feel the need to shut down.

118
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.530
Rochelle Martinez: That that that sense of

119
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.680
Rochelle Martinez: Of using doesn't excite me the way it did before, like before I was just like the whole

120
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.830
Rochelle Martinez: The whole setup like

121
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.460
Rochelle Martinez: Having to go find them just like everything that was just excitement that you'd get doing it and make no

122
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.980
Rochelle Martinez: I don't know that same thing

123
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing a great job.

124
00:14:50.640 --> 00:15:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So, what I am interpreting what you're saying is the following the voice that you hear is yours, it's you. Those are your thoughts. Those are the healthy authentic, Rochelle.

125
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That in her life she's looking at the next thing in front of her and solving problems. She's just enjoying her life appreciating things as they come.

126
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: When I'm hearing you say is the voice right which is a thought. But you know how I like to

127
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.510
Kind of separate the voice.

128
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You haven't been hearing from her it in a long time. So I'm thrilled that means your voice. You are loud and strong and confident

129
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: An automatic maybe even and that's cool.

130
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:44.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

131
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:45.900
Yeah.

132
00:15:47.760 --> 00:16:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And that literally tissue that you grew because you did the hard work, initially you had to do the thought stopping until the addictive voice shut the F up

133
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you had to push it out. And maybe that initially was that that negative one and you pushed it out.

134
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you grew tissue and another part of your brain.

135
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And now when there is a distress that happens in the body. Something gets anxious or physical pain or there's

136
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: sadness or there's excitement. Guess what you're now because you've over and over and over met it with healthy solutions and getting in your life in a healthy way. You now have grown brain tissue literally synapses in your brain.

137
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And that is now becoming the eight lane highway that you think of first

138
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.380
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

139
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.570
That's exciting.

140
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:44.880
Rochelle Martinez: Give me one minute.

141
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted to kind of highlight something. I don't know if it would interest you.

142
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You may have already checked it out, but I wanted to just kind of

143
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Show you this is an easy, you know, as you continue to sort of develop the self, and this is a really little book.

144
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: They can continue your journey sort of independently.

145
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It's called The Four Agreements, I know Dr. Gabrielle has brought it up, and I've had a group topic around it.

146
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'll show you.

147
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's kind of fuzzy. I'm going to find another version.

148
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'll read it out loud, and then I'll find a better version. So they basically there's four agreements that this book proposes as sort of a way of living, let's say, but what I look at them is a place to explore a personal growth.

149
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: The first agreement and really you're making it with yourself, is be impeccable with your word.

150
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:59.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Speak with integrity say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself like you know that negative self talk or to gossip about others use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.

151
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And second, one over there on the right, the purple kind of periwinkle color don't take anything personally. Interesting. Let's see what it says nothing others do, is because of you, what others say and do is a projection of their own reality their own dream.

152
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:29.430
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others. You won't be the victim of needless suffering.

153
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that make you think about that one.

154
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.630
Rochelle Martinez: That just like what I'm like

155
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.150
Rochelle Martinez: How I'm dealing with stuff now. Like, I'm not taking things personally like

156
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:53.220
Rochelle Martinez: Like example my grandma has a hard day at work or whatever. And she's coming. She's being

157
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.410
Rochelle Martinez: grouchy and a bit or whatever and

158
00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.030
Rochelle Martinez: I try to not take it personally I'm

159
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:06.750
Rochelle Martinez: Understanding that she's overwhelmed with work and vector. Second example of you know the meaning

160
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.250
Rochelle Martinez: You just would give her her

161
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:20.220
Rochelle Martinez: To give her her her space school showers whatever and just unwind and then we she wants to talk about it. We'll talk about it later after dinner, whatever. If not, then

162
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:26.340
Rochelle Martinez: We won't do you know what I mean. But just trying not to take everything so personally

163
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:33.900
Rochelle Martinez: Everybody has a bad day, everybody, not everybody life is going great. You know what I mean.

164
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's, that's exactly how you turn this concept into action. So you were able to in psychological phenomenon, you were able to see a separation between yourself and mom or grandma.

165
00:23:52.350 --> 00:24:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So grandma's actions opinions behaviors and what's coming out of her mouth is about grandma, let's say, or about mom, even if it's accusations labels judgment of you, it's still her opinion.

166
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You can separate you from who you are, identity, how lot right how you feel, what you actually think from someone else.

167
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a powerful tool.

168
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it gets more difficult to do that thing you just described.

169
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: When we're in an intimate relationship. Can you picture that

170
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:29.850
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

171
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but take pride in what you're doing now, but revisit. Hmm, how can I do this also with a daughter, how can I do this also with

172
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, because we also really need our kid right in a moment. They really have this perspective, you know, that might happen with with daughter or it might happen with a lover right happened in there where we need them to see us in a particular way.

173
00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

174
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's use that thing you did with parent with your own grandma with your own mom, you can use that same skill.

175
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: With someone where love is on the line right where all this, they have to see me as valuable and important in the way they're talking doesn't sound like they see me as valuable as an important

176
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And we push our agenda we push our opinion of ourselves and make them see us in a way that we like. That's where it gets difficult, but it's the same skill one you're using. You can also use this in sort of that romantic relationship.

177
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you picture the challenge that that might be

178
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:36.210
Yeah.

179
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, your smile.

180
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's painful. It's so hard to sit with. Wait a minute. I don't have a right to change someone else's opinion.

181
00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really, not at its core.

182
00:25:59.130 --> 00:25:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And they want

183
00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

184
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll, we'll try, you certainly tried. Right. I don't want to be seen as a bitch, or as a selfish or something right someone saw you some particular way in in like hearing about it like that.

185
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you've really really worked at maybe trying to get them to change your mind. I don't know if you have a story around how this

186
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:35.940
Rochelle Martinez: It was it's more like you were being selfish type shit. You know what I mean, it's

187
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:46.470
Rochelle Martinez: Just like a attitudes like attitude towards like that. Do you know what I mean like know my daughter had oh I think come off this weekend.

188
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.360
Rochelle Martinez: And

189
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:56.940
Rochelle Martinez: She was like, well, I need the car. And I'm like, nah. Well, I'm already gone. Do you know what I mean, you're, you're using get how fun

190
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:09.270
Rochelle Martinez: And she was accused of being selfish type thing nine being selfish. You know, I was gonna do this and because of that you I'm well, thank you. And I get home.

191
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You could have been really if you wanted to, you could have been very pissed off what she said.

192
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.220
Rochelle Martinez: Oh yeah, I could have dropped off at the top. Do you know what I mean.

193
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:30.090
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I could, I was a good. You know what I mean like I even let you were my dad gave me in a bad mood today. Can I get that.

194
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.010
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

195
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But your younger self. Couldn't you have gone to, are you kidding me, I'm taking care of your baby and you're calling me selfish, you could talk like what

196
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:55.170
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, like like that that can come out of my mouth, but I came out of a friend's mom that I was with you know what I mean. And I was like, dude, like you don't even know what responsibility is

197
00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:04.410
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I ain't even gonna are you today. No, but yeah. Have a nice weekend, hopefully when I get home.

198
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's but earlier. Do you remember

199
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: With let's say your acts where you had no tolerance for some for her maybe seeing you in a life that you didn't like

200
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's the one. There's real freedom and being like, whatever.

201
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't there.

202
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:38.550
Rochelle Martinez: And anything above them even more than sitting there and arguing with them about it this time, whatever, you know, they mean

203
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow, okay, but also respect in the self that when you do fall in love again because you will

204
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: No matter how hard you try to stay away from people I see you over there.

205
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This may come up. It is more challenging. Okay. It is

206
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Just knowing that it's the same skill, just remember back, I was able to do with my daughter. I was able to do it you know with with Mother and grandma separate my opinion of myself from what someone else's opinion of me is I can hold on to myself. I will not abandon myself. I will not

207
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the commitment. That's the agreement.

208
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why I'm showing this to you because it kind of encapsulates these concepts sort of neat and tidy.

209
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And it sounds like

210
00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You kind of already have big pieces of it. Let's take a look at the third one in the red. What about this third agreement.

211
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Find the courage to ask questions.

212
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And to express what you really want.

213
00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstanding sadness and drama.

214
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: With just this agreement, you can completely transform your life, what are they talking about here, find the courage to ask questions.

215
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: may switch this up.

216
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And to express what you really want.

217
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Communicate with others as clearly as you can.

218
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't make assumptions.

219
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I would I would change this to don't make negative assumptions, but

220
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe just hold on loosely to those assumptions you know i mean like

221
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You could be just as likely to be wrong about your assumption is right.

222
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take that first sentence.

223
00:30:54.810 --> 00:31:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: How, how are you doing those things. Ask direct questions express what you really want what you really want. That's a part, I wonder about you when you're

224
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:16.290
Rochelle Martinez: Out. Yeah, I think I'm getting like a little bit better at that. But I think they started like trouble doing that whole ask questions and

225
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.240
Rochelle Martinez: And expressing what I really want like I'm

226
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.880
Rochelle Martinez: Like, for the most part, I do, but there's still that

227
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.020
Rochelle Martinez: Still queer or

228
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.150
Rochelle Martinez: Where I don't like all this bite my lip and

229
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:46.860
Rochelle Martinez: Walk away. You know what I mean like instead. And it's not that I'm afraid of confrontation, it's just

230
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.930
Rochelle Martinez: There's some days you just don't want that confrontation. Do you know what I mean.

231
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:54.270
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

232
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you hear yourself just now. It's not that I don't want confrontation. It's just that I

233
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:05.490
Don't want. Yeah.

234
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.440
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

235
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: If, if some days it's not worth it. Right. And we get to pick our battles we get to decide, you know, is what I want worth fighting for it and things like that. But I guess my question is to you.

236
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.000
Gwenevere Abriel: When is it going to be time. Is it time. Is there something

237
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.160
Rochelle Martinez: I don't know. Okay.

238
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, when it shows up. Maybe you'll know because maybe you'll notice you're angry. Maybe you'll notice you're irritable. Maybe you'll notice you're sad, maybe your body will get sort of tight or anxious or not it up and then that might be a signal you know what

239
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it might be time to actually put some energy into what I want. Maybe I've been sacrificing in this area of my life and I want to have these things for myself. So just tune in, don't

240
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Concrete. We don't want to do any one thing all the time. Any, anything can be too much. We can overdo anything. Even the repression of our core needs, wants, and preferences ya.

241
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:19.650
Rochelle Martinez: Know, I've been taking time for myself every weekend I I said my my baby will my mom on Friday night, and I just

242
00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:21.510
Rochelle Martinez: Leave

243
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.210
Rochelle Martinez: Me back for the evening so

244
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:40.140
Rochelle Martinez: It's at the beginning, it was like a little hard to be like, Well, I just need this time no matter where the fuck I'm going, I'm just going to you know what I mean, like, I just need this came and like at the beginning your was a little bit like

245
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:45.000
Rochelle Martinez: All day long on Friday. Be like now just won't go

246
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:51.480
Rochelle Martinez: I'm thinking about 100 reasons why shouldn't go and

247
00:33:53.070 --> 00:34:00.780
Rochelle Martinez: Quite shouldn't do this, or whatever. But now it's gotten to where like, I'm like, it's four o'clock. Are you looking at awake it type shit.

248
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.970
Rochelle Martinez: You know, didn't mean like yeah

249
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That is a sign of this find the courage to ask questions to express what you really want. That's actually a piece of it.

250
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see the big he

251
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.420
Rochelle Martinez: Let me have somebody walking. She's eating.

Rochelle Martinez: sugary.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.810
Rochelle Martinez: I don't want my baby.

254
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.800
Rochelle Martinez: She started walking about two weeks ago, I don't want you agree.

255
00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Slimy

256
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Slimy

Gwenevere Abriel: She wants to share. She gives you the good stuff.

260
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.700
Yeah.

261

Rochelle Martinez: She's, she's tried to talk more

262
00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:00.780
Rochelle Martinez: She's walking. She's, she's not calling it all her teeth are fine meal coming out.

263
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.020
Rochelle Martinez: Getting her own little personality.

264
00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, enjoy those cheeks. I see.

265
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Teachable

266
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I like hearing that you've you've made some serious headway in

267
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Being able to to create time for you to unwind to refuel even if it's literally to sit and stare in space. I'm not kidding you don't

268
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to justify it, you get to just be doing nothing that's just fine. We need it. We need to rest our mind rest our bodies.

269
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:51.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really glad you're continuing to do that. Let's just take a peek. Just so I can have this full circle. Let's take a look at the fourth one.

270
00:35:53.010 --> 00:36:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: This last one, this for a great fourth agreement is your best is going to change from moment to moment, it will be different when you are healthy, as opposed to sick under any circumstance simply do your best and you will avoid self judgment self abuse and regret.

271
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Your best is going to change from moment to moment you see that when right when you're tired your best right now this morning you showed up anyone

272
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the knots. The best that's the same for everyone. We can't be perfect, whatever that that inner bar is of expectation we just do our best with what energy we have with whatever mood, we're in. Have we eatin, haven't we, this is just this is what my best looks like right now.

273
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts on that concept.

274
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:03.720
Rochelle Martinez: And now you're

275
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to change from moment to moment.

276
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep.

277
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It will be different when you are healthy, as opposed to sick under any circumstance simply do your, your personal best. Not mine not anybody else's and you will avoid self judgment self abuse and regret. Sometimes our best is just being awake during the day.

278
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And moving on cruise control and other days have more spontaneity and vitality and we're getting our walks done we're even doing some journaling, we're doing some reading are falling through with some of the bills or paperwork that we've been avoiding

279
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Then that's what our best looks like.

280
00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that thing you're doing where you're in the moment that one.

281
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that's that that part right there. So this is these are just the snippets of The Four Agreements, it's an actual little book. It's a little. It's like this is about that thick and it's this big. It's a tiny little book probably

282
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And I went to a couple hours maybe to read if you ever want to
