00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.990
Jo Delgadillo: Hot

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It was a little hot here in Florida.

3
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.000
Jo Delgadillo: My body like goes in shock.

4
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm gonna say you were having hot flashes to

5
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.570
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, so that makes it worse.

6
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.410
Yeah.

7
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Uh, how's your day going

8
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.600
Jo Delgadillo: Relaxing like

9
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's the change for you.

10
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.710
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, well, I'm trying really hard to

11
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.840
Jo Delgadillo: Just sit. He not do nothing. It's hard.

12
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.880
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, so

13
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.390
Jo Delgadillo: No, I just feel like I don't like stop.

14
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.890
Jo Delgadillo: Trying

15
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.940
Jo Delgadillo: To stop so

16
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.930
Jo Delgadillo: I don't know.

17
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.720
Jo Delgadillo: It's hard to sleep because my mind is shut up.

18
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.530
Jo Delgadillo: So I figured if I don't go crazy like during the day.

19
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.510
Jo Delgadillo: Maybe shut up at night.

20
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.240
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, sometimes it just depends on what

21
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.860
Yeah, what

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.300
Jo Delgadillo: The screws me over for the whole night day

23
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.150
I don't

24
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.400
Jo Delgadillo: Sir,

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How are you able to enforce calmness today. What did you do differently.

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.160
Jo Delgadillo: Oh, I've been coloring and painting.

27
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.130
Jo Delgadillo: What's arts and crafts.

28
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.990
Jo Delgadillo: Lots.

29
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So everything good with you about Gabriel. I'm sorry. I didn't know what happened. I was trying to catch up to speed.

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: During the group session, but it seems like you both cleared the air, but I wanted to know if there's anything you wanted to process.

31
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.270
Jo Delgadillo: One on one

32
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:15.780
Jo Delgadillo: I don't, I wonder if I missed because when I was missing. Like when I got back from California around all that time, like I did. I missed a lot because it took us a while to get

33
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.500
Jo Delgadillo: Back into routine. And I did. I missed a lot and I was still getting my two weeks worth of medication like to last for two weeks.

34
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.210
Jo Delgadillo: And now all of a sudden

35
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.590
Jo Delgadillo: She said that I missed. And I only got four days worth. Oh, I don't know what I'm being punished for is what I don't understand.

36
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.100
Jo Delgadillo: Like when I was missing. I didn't get

37
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.570
Jo Delgadillo: She didn't only give me

38
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.960
Jo Delgadillo: To get to the next like therapy session or group therapy like

39
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.630
Jo Delgadillo: But now she is all of a sudden, so I'm like,

40
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.810
Jo Delgadillo: What's personal like what I don't know what changed.

41
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I know she has been in a lot of the doctors. I'm now supporting the therapist by individuals session.

42
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Reaching the script and we because of the constant no shows. So that's not personalized to you, anyone that has an individual session.

43
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's encouraged to help out with the skills for the doctors are also bridging the prescription on. So that's a bright her health policy because personalized in

44
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, but yeah, I didn't know what happened because by the time I came to group.

45
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:35.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Last week, and I wasn't too late to like this had to be a very quick interaction, because I got there and doctor said you have left because you had to help with your son. So I figured, Adrian, you have checked in super early which you

46
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Have to do and you did everything with Perez. So by the time I logged in at the time you were gone. So I did not know.

47
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:52.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: what transpired. And I'm not trying to revisit it and if you're upset, but I want to know if there's anything I can help you with processing, whatever happened because I also know

48
00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:05.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even if you were having a challenge, we probably wouldn't want to discuss it openly in group. So if you want to process that we can we can spend some time talking about it right now. That's what you want.

49
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

50
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.620
Jo Delgadillo: It just felt personal

51
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.570
Jo Delgadillo: Me.

52
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:21.990
Jo Delgadillo: And she said that I missed and I can't, I can't think of anything. I miss unless you're talking about that, um, pain group that I was supposed to be a part of. But I guess I should have spoke up because I haven't been going but

53
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.240
Jo Delgadillo: I was told that it wasn't. I didn't have to go. It was just something she offered me. Yeah.

54
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, because I'm looking, I'm yeah you've been pretty consistent. We're

55
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Coming to group them to see

56
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: March.

57
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Been pretty consistent with coming. So I'm not sure.

58
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.290
Jo Delgadillo: I'm not either. That's why it

59
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.230
Jo Delgadillo: Or maybe she was confusing me for somebody else because she's done that once before. When I first started

60
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.560
Jo Delgadillo: And I cried like he got me upset and other people have stood up for me because he wasn't the same thing with her. Now it's like

61
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.650
Jo Delgadillo: It just, it, you have to watch what you say.

62
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.380
Jo Delgadillo: I feel like when I talked to her.

63
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.770
Jo Delgadillo: She kind of snap say not really stops every week just makes me feel bad about myself. And I do that enough for myself.

64
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.920
Jo Delgadillo: For her to do that. It just sucked.

65
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

66
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.070
Jo Delgadillo: And it ruined my whole week because I couldn't get I knew we were going to talk about. And I'm glad she brought it up because

67
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.110
Jo Delgadillo: It messes me all week long.

68
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.320
Jo Delgadillo: And everybody was just like, once you just talk to your therapist about it and

69
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.350
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't even know she knows and he didn't know

70
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:45.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe to tell you know I didn't know. So I wasn't trying to distract from the group, but like I feel like there's so much that's going on right now. And I don't even know what's happening.

71
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:53.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's why I had to interject if she didn't bring it up, would you have felt comfortable to address that, you know,

72
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How that conversation affected you

73
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.430
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I would have just I'd rather talk about it then not because I know me.

74
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.380
Jo Delgadillo: Like if I didn't know the answers from him out in my head, I feel it in like oh my oh

75
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.910
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, and now

76
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.440
Jo Delgadillo: That affects me for some not.

77
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So good, you brought that up because how I was talking to a group about

78
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:29.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The irrational thinking and how last week we talked about the black or white thinking next group, we're going to talk about jumping to conclusions and that is one of the distorted.

79
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:36.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: thought processes to so what you said with you fill in the blanks. That would have been doing the jumping to conclusions.

80
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:48.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's all of us have these thinking errors that you know kind of leads us into ways that causes us to spiral. Because typically, when we fill in the blanks.

81
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's not for the better. So I'm glad you guys were able to process that.

82
00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:03.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I would empower you. As I empower all the other patients that that there's something that said, you know, to just be able to have that open dialogue.

83
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:20.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There is a way in our trust that you can have that dialogue respectfully. Some people need a little more skills to be able to navigate conflict and how to how to have a discussion, but I've seen you in enough settings to know that you would find a respectful way to have that conversation.

84
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.060
Oh, I just

85
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.290
Jo Delgadillo: Like

86
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.710
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

87
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.550
Jo Delgadillo: You're screaming and yelling, but I do, I do have go a lot. One thing, but only one I'm pushed to it.

88
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.410
Jo Delgadillo: The caustic call until

89
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.530
Jo Delgadillo: It's happening in some kind of way, especially when I'm just trying to talk

90
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.270
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, it's a lot but

91
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.890
Jo Delgadillo: I've learned to just try to walk away because sometimes it's not worth it. Especially when someone's mad.

92
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:41.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and I'm

93
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.930
Jo Delgadillo: Going to talk to them.

94
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.990
Jo Delgadillo: I'll wait until they're not mad, even if James days.

95
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When

96
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.560
Jo Delgadillo: I can always feel when it's the right time, they want, it's not

97
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, so in a group, you felt like it was not the right time.

98
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When it initially happened to address it.

99
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.660
Jo Delgadillo: No, I wasn't. I had to leave like we were. That's why I told her I couldn't

100
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.730
Jo Delgadillo: Because the plan was for me to take a load there and then Mercedes was gonna stay in the house and do the thing there while I did my group.

101
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.600
Jo Delgadillo: But instead, when we got there. The key that they gave us. We couldn't even get in

102
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:21.720
Jo Delgadillo: So we sat out there for like 20 minutes and we finally got ahold of the guy. He said it would take at least an hour. I'm like, I can't leave a pregnant girl side with all the stuff I can do like

103
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.650
Jo Delgadillo: There's no way

104
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.340
Jo Delgadillo: So that's what I was like, let me call and tell them I haven't missed in a while so

105
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.810
Jo Delgadillo: I figured it'd be okay. And she's just she got four weeks left. I can't couldn't have just left her out there and you had to wait.

106
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.470
Yeah.

107
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:44.820
Jo Delgadillo: And she had the babies with me. So always like it. Nothing worked out the way it was gonna. She's like, but you knew about this sounds like, yes, but I got so worked up I

108
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.950
Jo Delgadillo: was hard to explain myself.

109
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.420
Jo Delgadillo: Because she wouldn't let me talk and when she does. It's just to hear what I'm saying. So

110
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.840
Jo Delgadillo: I just stop talking when I start talking. That's just because you're

111
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.320
Jo Delgadillo: Not here.

112
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.730
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I just

113
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.550
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't. I do. I just

114
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.930
Jo Delgadillo: Keep trying. And I usually do.

115
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:07.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Did you feel after after that exchange. Did you still feel that you have made the right choice or did it.

116
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.370
What did you feel

117
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.470
Jo Delgadillo: I feel relieved

118
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:17.700
Jo Delgadillo: Like I did something for myself, even though I was getting them out of my grandma's house I sorry I didn't tell her I should have said, I get a room like

119
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.790
Jo Delgadillo: We've been living in living room and my grandma's house this whole time.

120
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.440
Jo Delgadillo: So it's yes I should have said that. And then she would have been like, oh, okay, I get it.

121
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:26.790
Jo Delgadillo: Was

122
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I wanted my basic needs met at this point.

123
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.610
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, yeah. So now the girls have a bad now we ever had. And we had the room. And yeah, it's

124
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.610
Jo Delgadillo: I should have said that, but I got worked up and I didn't

125
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.450
Jo Delgadillo: That's why I was like

126
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.440
Jo Delgadillo: What you said that you should probably would have understand a little bit more

127
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That both of you were coming from a place of okay let's prioritize

128
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We want group members to prioritize the food.

129
00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:05.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We're not just we're getting on medication, but we're also getting therapeutic skills, we're getting the connection for building relationships and we're getting a sentence in this setting so that we can have long term sobriety.

130
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:16.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you're thinking, Wow, this is important to me. I have to prioritize my basic needs of living arrangements and that has been a primary stressor, for you, for like months now.

131
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:30.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes, see why. And I actually respect that you didn't just blow us off, you still came in earlier, try to check in and explain everything versus just not showing up. Um, but you can see how

132
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:49.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All of us, we have a perception in mind, we have a certain agenda. It's hard to see past that becomes like a filtered lens and and I'm glad that she noticed that after the fact, not in that moment, but she came and she worked it out because it seemed that it was bothering her to

133
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.690
Jo Delgadillo: Deliver already

134
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

135
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.960
Jo Delgadillo: I seen it in her like she gosh I'm

136
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:00.750
Jo Delgadillo: So,

137
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

138
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.340
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I was thankful. She brought it up.

139
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's a good exchange for other group members to see this is how

140
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:22.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Communication works. You know, there is no perfect relationship there may be some times I will send you some group members with comments that I've mentioned. And I'm like, well,

141
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think because I have a soft spoken voice I can get away with things but

142
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:36.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's not true. So I have to be careful to with my sarcasm. I have to be careful with, you know what I say and what the delivery is

143
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:46.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Every relationship has a potential to hurt like that black or white thinking video where they say, is it possible for someone you love to also hurt you.

144
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:57.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Definitely it's possible. That's the course of a relationship. So I was, I'm happy to see her demonstrate what you know the skills that we want the group members to get

145
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:07.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That even if there is an uncomfortable exchange in communication, there's a way to repair it. It just takes that person coming back and asking, hey,

146
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:18.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When I said this further that you know look like for you when, how could we fix this. And this is what I was thinking. And just being in that safe space and sometimes it does take time.

147
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:29.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To go back because like you said, if you try to continue to express your point in that moment, she probably wouldn't have resonated with her because she had her perception, you know,

148
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:37.770
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, and I seen a shutdown. Yeah, that was my grandma right now. I think that's why I'm so thankful that she brought it up.

149
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.240
Jo Delgadillo: And we talked about it just

150
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.340
Jo Delgadillo: My grandma hates on me a lot now.

151
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.030
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, like she's being so mean to me.

152
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:53.880
Jo Delgadillo: Everything I do if I clean the kitchen. Oh, you didn't do this. You didn't do that. Oh, finally, you did something. I'm like, what do you think does everything around here.

153
00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:02.400
Jo Delgadillo: I don't, I don't know. It's never, ever, ever. Good enough. And now that we're staying with her. It's not. It's just, she never stops.

154
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The quarantine is making her irritable and she takes it out on the

155
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.490
Jo Delgadillo: Internet a little

156
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:14.310
Jo Delgadillo: My guys I see the signs there she's she'll repeat herself. I think her earrings going to

157
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:23.940
Jo Delgadillo: And I love it because I'll say something and if she's not looking at me if I turn my head mean she'll say, she'll say some crazy stuff too. And I'm like,

158
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.630
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't say like, this is what I said and she

159
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Was like

160
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.150
Jo Delgadillo: I won't argue with

161
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.130
Jo Delgadillo: Walk away and I guess she's

162
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.990
Jo Delgadillo: She's so mean to me lately.

163
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.810
Jo Delgadillo: When she talks to me. I think she can feel

164
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:47.130
Jo Delgadillo: That I'm not mad at the feeling, but she she could feel it, because she's kind of cold two or three right now.

165
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.350
Jo Delgadillo: And it's because I feel that she's not she doesn't like me, but

166
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right now.

167
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:08.250
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, it is. And I know it's just everybody's quarantine. She wants to go out, she done bought herself birds, just to make an excuse to go to pets heart so I took her mother suffered and now she wants to go by a turtle. I'm like,

168
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Oh my God, yeah, Grandma.

169
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.240
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, she's

170
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.730
Jo Delgadillo: She's bored because she has a mess.

171
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:22.290
Jo Delgadillo: And then birds their seeds like all around their little their cage in their area.

172
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.890
Jo Delgadillo: And my grandma.

173

Jo Delgadillo: And dirty. So I'm like, you know, she's bored.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.610
Jo Delgadillo: And now she wants a turtle.

175
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.450
Jo Delgadillo: And she said, as for the girls. I'm like, Mm hmm.

176
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.650
Jo Delgadillo: Because they didn't come, bring it up to you brought it up. Yeah, I know.

177
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:54.780
Jo Delgadillo: So I've been picking and choosing to let her go like, do things, but I finally got her new mask and she had an anxiety attack wearing it because she was closed up and I can see it in her face only and I know my grandma. Like I know just by her talking. I know.

178
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I can hear, she's in pain.

179
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.040
Jo Delgadillo: If something's wrong. And she could do the same with me.

180
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's

181
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.950
Jo Delgadillo: kind of creepy sometimes but

182
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Still, this tension.

183
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.740
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Emotionally intertwine

184
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:08.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or yeah

185
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.210
I see.

186
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.520
Jo Delgadillo: What's wrong, she's like

187
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.910
Jo Delgadillo: I just don't feel right now. It's like, what's wrong. She's

188
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.900
Jo Delgadillo: She's like the mask the mask.

189
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And I'm saying

190
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.210
Jo Delgadillo: She just wasn't action. Right. And then I was like, you're at. It's an anxiety attack.

191
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.880
Jo Delgadillo: Like, let's just go

192
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:35.460
Jo Delgadillo: In and pay for everything. And I told my son's birthday. For the rest, and I'm taking her to the current soon as she took mask off she was fine.

193
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.120
Jo Delgadillo: It was the math. So now I'm like, now I have to find new maps.

194
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.750
Jo Delgadillo: One with those little breather things on it.

195
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.570
Jo Delgadillo: She's still the nice it

196
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.320
Jo Delgadillo: But I seen it.

197
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.890
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So,

198
00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:54.330
Jo Delgadillo: I'm like, not again. Nope. So I gotta find them new mass before she can go out

199
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.730
Jo Delgadillo: Hopefully they're saying that this thing.

200
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:02.250
Jo Delgadillo: Is they're gonna let everybody start like coming out and opening business again on the first that true

201
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's what I heard here in Florida.

202
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:06.690
Jo Delgadillo: A scary though.

203
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It is

204
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I've already seen a difference like before, if I would go walking, people would have a math.

205
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:24.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I have not seen anyone wearing a math. And I'm like, people are already going back to normal. And there's been nothing really put in place to keep the faith.

206
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.670
Jo Delgadillo: And the numbers haven't changed.

207
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:28.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

208
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.570
Jo Delgadillo: But there's no difference. It's

209
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.820
Jo Delgadillo: Still scary scares the crap out of me.

210
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.450
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I'm not ready. Not at all.

211
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:44.340
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I know and it's scary in and you have to vulnerable side you're young babies and then you're older, Grandma.

212
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:55.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And you both have strong personalities and are used to being leaders in your own right, because she raised you she was like that then nurturing and supportive figure

213
00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:08.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And in your household. You're the one that gets it done so that control and that power dynamic, it must be hard for your grandma to relinquish that when this has been her role for so long.

214
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:24.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And now being vulnerable enough even like you said she wouldn't even admit that the mass. She was the imposter phobic and it was scary for her to kind of say that because it was being vulnerable and relinquishing that power that she so accustomed to having

215
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.100
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

216
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm happy to you being patient with her, but I know it's hard to

217
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.550
Jo Delgadillo: It's very hard.

218
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To use that

219
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:39.000
Jo Delgadillo: Especially because I want to sit and talk with her, but she gets offended or anything that I say

220
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Much. You can say whatever she wants to me.

221
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:52.110
Jo Delgadillo: But I'm not allowed to say it back. So I just keep my mouth shut. And I don't know if it's gonna be like that forever, but I don't. The way I'm feeling towards her. I don't want to keep filling that so

222
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:57.630
Jo Delgadillo: I gotta figure out a way to sit down and Oscar is it me or is it just because

223
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.690
Jo Delgadillo: We're both living in the same house trying to do our own thing and it's your house. Like, I get it.

224
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.500
Jo Delgadillo: To my

225
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.690
Jo Delgadillo: House and I didn't say anything because you're my grandma.

226
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

227
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:15.090
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't say that one thing, even though I didn't like what she's doing her dog would be on the house. I didn't say nothing, because that's my grandma.

228
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:21.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, we'll try that. I feel I need understand examples that we use, you know,

229
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.880
Jo Delgadillo: I did. I tried it the other day in the backyard.

230
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.790
Jo Delgadillo: She started with how she felt so I listened to listen to when I returned talk about myself. She didn't want to hear it.

231
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.600
Jo Delgadillo: I tried to tell her how much I was learning about myself.

232
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:44.310
Jo Delgadillo: Doing group therapy and regular therapy with you and she don't talk about it. She started talking about herself and her husband and when she tried to go to therapy with him how horrible it was and

233
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:50.130
Jo Delgadillo: He she just never let me talk about yourself. It's always turns it talks about herself.

234
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:58.440
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. Do you think that's because she's self absorbed or because she's afraid to hear about what's really going on with you.

235
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.270
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, cuz she can't fix it.

236
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.820
Jo Delgadillo: She, she's fixing everything for me.

237
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.380
Jo Delgadillo: My whole life.

238
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:17.670
Jo Delgadillo: If I especially with money like it was just throw money at me constantly needing this needed that even if I didn't want it. She didn't want me to have to struggle for nothing in life, ever. And now,

239
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.400
Jo Delgadillo: I when I got with with now.

240
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.610
Jo Delgadillo: I like the struggle because it taught me a lot like

241
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.410
Jo Delgadillo: Not everybody has that easy life and I wanted that I don't want my kid scrolled away. I didn't

242
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.920
Jo Delgadillo: I wasn't just like them. Now she just I don't think she likes it.

243
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.280
Jo Delgadillo: You know, I'm okay with living the life that I live.

244
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.290
Jo Delgadillo: It. She's like I raised you better. I'm like,

245
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.810
Jo Delgadillo: Just because you raised me better doesn't make me think.

246
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.180
Jo Delgadillo: I don't want to think that I'm not

247
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.900
Jo Delgadillo: I don't want my kids to think that either. I don't think

248
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: She like your spouse.

249
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.090
Jo Delgadillo: She loves him.

250
00:19:55.470 --> 00:20:06.180
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, she at first she didn't but we've known each other for seven years now. Yeah, yesterday was an 11 year anniversary. So she's taking away that like

251
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:19.500
Jo Delgadillo: It's, it's been different roles. He's played in our life she's known for a long time, but being with me. He's the only person only man that I've ever been with it took care of us and pay our bills.

252
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.420
Jo Delgadillo: Or her having to pay our bills.

253
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.900
Jo Delgadillo: Or parent and some of her pay my truck payment like

254
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:32.010
Jo Delgadillo: He's the only one that's actually stepped up and was a dad to my kid and actually did the right thing.

255
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.920
Jo Delgadillo: He didn't run when bills were do

256
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

257
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.140
Jo Delgadillo: She respects him for that.

258
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Video. I want you to watch

259
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: About setting healthy boundaries and then the we talked about it often but I'm

260
00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Always good to hear it from a different perspective.

261
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then sad face. Oh, this looks crazy. When I hit the share so

262
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:21.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How to set them how to hold them and how to manage them, especially with the people closest to us like our children or our employees or bosses. Well, today we're going to talk about the number one most common obstacle to holding good boundaries.

263
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:38.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The most common misunderstanding about boundaries is that setting or holding a boundary is mean harsh or bad that by setting a boundary

264
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:51.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We have to be mean to someone else and people who believe this kind of have in the back of their minds have this idea that in order to set boundaries. You kind of have to balance out. Being kind, Being mean to someone

265
00:21:51.780 --> 00:22:05.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: While still loving them, I mean. No wonder people shy away from holding boundaries because no one wants to be mean. So let's look into this a little bit more people often associate saying yes or giving someone something

266
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:16.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With being kind and loving and they associate saying no, or being being firm director harsh with someone has being unkind or hateful

267
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:32.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, let's let's look into this a little bit more closely because that is not a fair Association. We can say yes with love in our hearts, or we can say yes with hate in our hearts and we can say no. With love or hate in our hearts. So let's take a look at this chart.

268
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:45.210
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: On the top of this chart, we can see two categories, being loving and being hateful or resistant. Right. So where is our heart when we're doing a certain action.

269
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:55.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And is called the way of being by the Harbinger Institute and it's talking about our deeper motivations or our intentions are they selfless or selfish.

270
00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:03.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And on the left side of this chart. We're talking about soft or hard behaviors. So what type of behaviors we're talking about

271
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:09.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now it's easy to think of the soft and loving behaviors saying things like, yes, I'll listen to you.

272
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:19.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or yes, I'll give you that toy that I know you've been wanting for a long time. Or yes, I'll let you go visit your friend because I trust you and I believe that you're going to be where you say you're going

273
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:31.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's the soft loving corner of this chart at the bottom right corner are the hard behaviors with a resistant or hateful heart. Right. And these are easy to understand as well. So let's take a look at them.

274
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:40.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They're screaming, yelling holding a grudge any kind of physical violence, right. These are hard behaviors that come from a selfish angry or hateful place.

275
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:46.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Trying to force someone to change saying no, just because you're mad at someone right

276
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:53.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So these the two opposite ends of the spectrum. And people often think that's kind of the only way to do it. If we say yes we're being loving it was a no. We're being hateful

277
00:23:54.270 --> 00:24:00.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well, let's talk about what it looks like if we're saying yes, if we're being soft having gentle behaviors.

278
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:07.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: While holding hate or selfishness in our hearts. What does that look like there's a called soft resistant

279
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:16.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So let's think of a parent who doesn't want to deal with their kid anymore. They might say, Sure, yeah. Go watch TV. I just don't want to deal with you right now is what they're saying in their heads.

280
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:25.650
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or a parent in the grocery store, they're checking out there's candy in the aisle, the kid starts screaming or asking for candy.

281
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Parents says yes, not because they think it was good for the child in this situation.

282
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:38.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But because they just don't want to hear the kid screaming, they're uncomfortable with the way other people look at them day for their own discomfort are saying yes to the child.

283
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:51.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That's considered soft resistant right so giving in in a selfish way. Here's another example, think of two people who are dating. And the one says I love you and the other one says I love you too.

284
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But they don't really mean it. They're actually planning on breaking up with that person.

285
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:05.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But they don't want to, you know, have to have an awkward conversation or an uncomfortable conversation. So they just kind of avoid it.

286
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:14.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Maybe they break up with the person through text message or just stop stop talking to them all together. Now this isn't because they're trying to be kind or loving to that other person.

287
00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:24.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's because they don't want to feel that discomfort. So to protect themselves, they're just being all soft and sweet but in their heart in their mind they know they don't want to be with this person anymore.

288
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:31.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now it's perfectly. It's not hateful to break up with someone, but it is selfish.

289
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:38.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To not be upfront with them to protect yourself from feeling that discomfort. A couple more examples like being passive aggressive or

290
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:48.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Sucking up to a teacher you know you're treating them really nicely to get something from them. These are all examples of being soft resistant. Now let's go to the other corner of this box.

291
00:25:48.960 --> 00:26:05.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How is it possible to be hard with your behavior, while still being loving. I mean, I'm going to ask you right now. Is it possible to go shove a little kid, like right into the road and gets all scraped up hit them hard maybe right is, could that ever be a loving behavior.

292
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:13.980
Well, yes. If a car is coming right. If a car is coming to hit this kid and you push them out of the way the car and they get skinned knees.

293
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:24.240
As the most loving thing you can do for them in that moment. Now I'm obviously not advocating physical violence, but I'm saying that almost all behaviors can be done from two different places.

294
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:36.900
From a loving selfless place or a hateful selfish place so saying no more TV. Yes. You must brush your teeth. No, you can't buy that toy right now.

295
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.380
These are always to lovingly help provide a positive future and discipline for a child.

296
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:51.510
If they're coming from a place of love. I once had this boss's name was Shane Gallagher, who's amazing and he told me a story about a time when he fired someone

297
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:59.130
With so much love and concern for their future that they thanked him afterward and said, I just really appreciate you looking out for me.

298
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:11.910
By firing me right he fired someone out of love for them. And it was because you know the job just wasn't the right place for them to be. They weren't able to do a good job for the other people there they needed to be somewhere else.

299
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:23.910
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So this is the hard loving side of things. I hope that by taking a look at this. This chart were able to let go. This this false idea that

300
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:35.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Saying no it's just this mean thing we have to do and balance out with, you know, being nice saying no can be one of the kindest most loving things we do for someone

301
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:45.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People respond more to our intentions, then whether we're saying yes or no. I mean, working in residential treatment. I've seen two different staff.

302
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:52.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Tell one child and treatment, the same rule, you have to XYZ and the other stuff saying you have to XYZ

303
00:27:52.680 --> 00:28:00.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the child says yes to the one and no to the other, because the child can tell where is that staff members heart in the time they're telling them that rule.

304
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:06.690
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So it's less about rules than it is about where your heart is when you're enforcing them and setting those boundaries.

305
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:17.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People will feel when you're saying no to them they can feel that you care about them. When you do it. Some people might get confused by this thinking that what I'm saying is we should let people walk all over us.

306
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:26.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or we should allow people to take advantage of us or we should never really, you know, do anything harsh to someone else and that's absolutely not what I'm saying.

307
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If someone's mistreating you. Is it really in their best interest that you don't put your foot down.

308
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:41.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No. In general, the reason people don't set boundaries is because they're afraid of being mean they're afraid of feeling guilty or they're afraid of feeling scared.

309
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:49.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So these are the reason they're not setting that boundary is not for the other person. They're not trying to be kind to the other person for trying to prevent themselves from feeling uncomfortable.

310
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:59.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It's it's selfish setting boundaries with someone else or telling them no can be the kind of thing we do for them and the most honest thing we do for ourselves.

311
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.460
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But to do it. We have to allow ourselves to experience our emotions.

312
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:13.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Now remember, the way we get healthier is not just about feeling better, but it's about getting better at feeling so we allow ourselves to feel a little bit of discomfort, as we set these boundaries.

313
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:20.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And we're going to get a lot better at it. So just to sum things up. Let's let go. The idea that setting boundaries as mean

314
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:34.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And focus instead on where our heart is when we're making these choices about boundaries. Right, let's focus our intentions and being kind, loving and seeing what the other person needs. I hope this was helpful and thanks for watching.

315
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:54.090
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah. Cuz that's like, for example, my daughter, or did you hear what I said on group. The other day about the way my five year old actor when it comes to her doing some work.

316
00:29:54.450 --> 00:30:05.100
Jo Delgadillo: Yes. She hurts yourself. So I do. I have been giving in just because I'm just like, she's not going to do it. Okay. It's silly. Go to the negative part. Well, the other day.

317
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:12.570
Jo Delgadillo: I was like, you're going to do work. I SAID IT CALMLY, she is just like, no, I don't want to nothing. You're going to do it.

318
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:22.590
Jo Delgadillo: I didn't like acknowledge what she said, or anything. And instead of like freaking out getting frustrated. I was like, here, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna do this, that, and then you're done. She did it.

319
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.500
Jo Delgadillo: And now I can't get her to do anything else.

320
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.990
Jo Delgadillo: And I tried that exact same. And I think it's because like even into any chance. I don't know what I have

321
00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:39.360
Jo Delgadillo: On whatever I think I've done that so much now being nice. And just telling her you're going to do this and that and then you can do this.

322
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.760
Jo Delgadillo: And it did work, but now it's not

323
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.400
Jo Delgadillo: Can I gave it so much.

324
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:54.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. So now, because there were so many moments where you gave in have to now create one moment where you don't and like you did in that loving voice and maybe explain to her.

325
00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:06.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You. I know it's something that you don't want to do right now but you know this is something. Sometimes we have to do things that we don't really enjoy it a moment but know that it's you know far better

326
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:17.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And kids like hearing that adults book the same things, even at a young age. So give an example of a time that you had to do something that you really didn't want, but how it helped them.

327
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:28.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, you know, something like that. They also hired by me guys, you know, wanted to eat. So I made x y&z because I knew that you guys wanted food.

328
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:37.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So saying that, yeah, doing work, no one really wants to do it. But at the end of the day, I shouldn't get smarter and different things like that.

329
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:48.330
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And also create that structure is she knows that when she does her work from a certain time to a certain time, that that's what's going to happen. And there's a certain time will she'll get a snack.

330
00:31:48.750 --> 00:32:03.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or she'll get to play and she goes back to it helped me hard to find that structure because with not being in school. I could imagine. And you being pulled in so many different directions. It might be hard to keep that structure consistent

331
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:10.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yes. So giving her that consistent structure and maybe even put in the time. But when this goes off.

332
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:25.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You'll be able to get up, you can play for 10 minutes and then go back to this and setting those timer so that she has those rewards should have some type of sensory indicators of what our responsibilities are. And when it's time for her to relax.

333
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:33.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: This is a good teaching time for our kids to understand there's a balance between responsibilities and relaxation

334
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:44.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If we have too much responsibilities and no relaxation, then we're exhausted, mentally, physically, we're anxious. If we have too much relaxation and not enough responsibilities.

335
00:32:45.060 --> 00:33:03.420
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then when that responsible adults and it's hard to get us motivated and people will look at us as lazy. So, you know, at her age and her development, there's a way to teach her these skills so that you know you don't have to be fighting a teenager, you know, later explaining the same principles.

336
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:17.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So what were your path where they said that sometimes when you don't establish boundaries that your own selfishness of being uncomfortable and say, you know, what were your thoughts on that.

337
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.470
Jo Delgadillo: That was like spot on.

338
00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.120
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, cuz I do, I do feel guilty or I'm being mean.

339
00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:36.300
Jo Delgadillo: Mm hmm. And I sometimes people say that, oh, you're not gonna like my son are constantly had to tell him no cuz I'm done being a slave, do this, do that do this I'm gonna like, hey, can you help me do this.

340
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.910
Jo Delgadillo: Oh, in a minute and and never gets done.

341
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.040
Jo Delgadillo: So I've been saying no, a lot lately and

342
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.120
Jo Delgadillo: You don't like it but

343
00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:47.700
Jo Delgadillo: I don't know why are you. Why are you actually like that. Why are you mad. It's always. Are you mad like

344
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:48.510
Jo Delgadillo: No, I

345
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.530
Jo Delgadillo: Just said no.

346
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

347
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.850
Jo Delgadillo: And he doesn't like that because he's used to be giving them a reason I haven't been given a reason

348
00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:11.670
Jo Delgadillo: Why, why, and I'm just like, no, and I'm just gonna continue to do what I whatever I'm doing and driving them crazy, but he just stopped with the please, please, please, I'll do this if you do this, I'll do all this for you just do this. And I'm just like, no.

349
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.730
Jo Delgadillo: He hasn't been doing that because I'm just leaving that no

350
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:23.370
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah we me and why are you mad. I don't acknowledge what are you saying, so it's just it's working now because

351
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:34.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: He's been playing out with your five year old and your, your adult fun so that in establishing those boundaries like kind of the same lessons but just in different language.

352
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:35.130
Jo Delgadillo: Than

353
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:42.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me saying no is the best way I can love you right now. I hope you to develop into being a responsible adult

354
00:34:43.260 --> 00:35:01.320
Jo Delgadillo: And he is. He's really good. He got a job you got them house like she's about to get a vehicle and like I'm proud of him. He could have just sat on his ass and did nothing because it's not doing as good but yeah he loved her, and he knows he has. He's gonna love that baby, yeah.

355
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:10.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your mom. I'm sorry. Grandma with the boundaries boundaries that she establish with

356
00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:11.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: With me

357
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.520
Jo Delgadillo: Let me know.

358
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.810
Jo Delgadillo: What was my son.

359
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:25.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: My review with you because that that relationship with your grandma is so significant. So how does she establish those boundaries with you.

360
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.230
Jo Delgadillo: We kind of don't have any right now because we don't talk

361
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:38.250
Jo Delgadillo: Or she needs like the other day. She was like, I don't have enough money for electric bills are paid that just like that.

362
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:44.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But like in childhood, because she took care of you. Right. Yeah.

363
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:52.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Nothing foundries How did she set boundaries for you and was that your reaction. Like, why is she telling me no

364
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.050
Jo Delgadillo: She didn't let me do nothing, just because I was leading lady.

365
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:02.760
Jo Delgadillo: There was always that came out of her mouth was, I had to act like a lady, I was a lady.

366
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:13.800
Jo Delgadillo: Like all my friends were out there playing getting dirty, not me. I had to sit there are legs crossed action like a lady, my friends on the tree. I will be like in our conference room. My cousin's

367
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:22.410
Jo Delgadillo: Know, we're Mexican we got like 50 cousins. And I'm like, oh, my cousin's they're climbing trees. She's like, no, you have to act like a lady, I hate to do

368
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.960
Jo Delgadillo: That's why I don't do that. My girls.

369
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I

370
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.360
Jo Delgadillo: Did get the angel part of everything. Like, oh sure if me nuts.

371
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.710
Jo Delgadillo: Because everything has to be perfect and

372
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:41.310
Jo Delgadillo: I'm trying so hard not to be like that like instead of everything being constantly like clean and we drove myself picking everything up as they're making a mess. I've been living in until the end of the day.

373
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:41.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

374
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:47.070
Jo Delgadillo: And I'm not so in my head lately, but just little things that help here in there.

375
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What's going on my life. Okay.

376
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.050
Jo Delgadillo: Okay, yeah, I can find a charger.

377
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:39.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So in the video. She also talked about the yelling in that the yelling comes more from a place of

378
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:48.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anger or resentment, because you can't sell the boundaries and remember you saying bad, even though it's hard for you to say no you

379
00:37:48.840 --> 00:38:05.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know when you feel like your backs against the wall, you have no other resources, you start yelling. So how do you think establishing boundaries will help in your delivery. Do you think that if you had a savage more boundaries that you won't yell as often.

380
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:06.900
Yeah.

381
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:13.560
Jo Delgadillo: It's hard because been on quarantine and change everything.

382
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We communicate with each other is just

383
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.860
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, really tense. Everything is and

384
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:27.000
Jo Delgadillo: I understand why everybody is because we're locked up. We've never had this everything works for dollars new yeah

385
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.580
Jo Delgadillo: And it's harder to

386
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:41.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To practice the skill. Now, because what this is teaching us a you know a lot of the messages are kind of being a little more flexible having more grace be more understanding because

387
00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:53.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Since people have to be shipped to their place, you know, having these rigid schedules might be too much for the kids. So, you know, be a little more flexible. These are the messages. I've been hearing you know I'm

388
00:38:53.610 --> 00:39:00.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that it just seems like it's a more healthy and nurturing environment. But when all of this is over.

389
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:05.430
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Which relationship. Do you think you want to practice setting boundaries with

390
00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:06.720
My girl.

391
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What would that look like for you.

392
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.000
Jo Delgadillo: To bring the charger.

393
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:15.630
Okay.

394
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:23.640
Jo Delgadillo: Crap.

395
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.350
Jo Delgadillo: I don't

396
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.510
Jo Delgadillo: Get back

397
00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:28.980
Jo Delgadillo: There we go.

398
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.390
Jo Delgadillo: Okay.

399
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:40.950
Jo Delgadillo: With my grandma, the most is given to her for a lot to do. And then she treats you bad, like I don't do anything.

400
00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:46.050
Jo Delgadillo: Just such. So yeah, most founders agree with her.

401
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.200
Jo Delgadillo: Because I've got so tired of my son. When I before because he hurt my feelings. A lot

402
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.220
Jo Delgadillo: And then now that he's moved down. I've been telling them. No, but I started before then.

403
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.510
Jo Delgadillo: Telling him. No, no.

404
00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:03.540
Jo Delgadillo: We're he's starting to level out says realize oh crap oh

405
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

406
00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:13.830
Jo Delgadillo: I used to that because that's my baby. I gave him to everything I did everything for him and now he's he's got to step up and do things for themselves and now they are

407
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:23.970
Jo Delgadillo: He's like, mom, she needs for you to help her call this place. And I'm like, No she doesn't. Why she can do it on her own. She has to figure it out.

408
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.870
Jo Delgadillo: I'm parked right next to my house. I'm going to just pull over here.

409
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:28.230
Okay.

410
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.040
Jo Delgadillo: There's a post office next door. So I parked over here.

411
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:32.520
Okay.

412
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:35.730
Jo Delgadillo: Nobody's listening to the

413
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:47.550
Jo Delgadillo: Song for all my fabric. It goes dead. It was on 66% now it's our eight

414
00:40:50.310 --> 00:41:01.380
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, something's wrong with it. It hasn't been working when people call me. Well, let me answer it. When I get text messages doesn't even tell me, but I've had this one for almost three years and I don't want to get a new phone.

415
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.200
Jo Delgadillo: I don't want to have to learn it all over.

416
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.550
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Again, yeah.

417
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.490
Jo Delgadillo: Now I knew he was here last second.

418
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:20.910
Jo Delgadillo: Thank you.

419
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:25.920
Thank you.

420
00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.080
Jo Delgadillo: Everyone that works.

421
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:44.730
Jo Delgadillo: Area.

422
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:47.640
Jo Delgadillo: Right here.

423
00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:55.980
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Well with the boundaries with Grandma I know how you said like she doesn't listen. You just, you just let her

424
00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:04.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: See, and she says, Whatever she needs to be kind of shut down with Grandma, the boundaries may look like you know you're negotiating that and

425
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:17.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, she's not listening. Let me continue to speak up, because she's become accustomed to you being that listening ear and just that support and probably not recognizing some of the needs that you have as well.

426
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:25.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because she's a vulnerable population and because you said because I'm Mexican. Yeah.

427
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.770
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So the cultural implications with that to a, you know,

428
00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:45.060
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Hispanic cultures, something happens, we get older, you know, the you take care of us. It's the level of respect. I'm not really talking about feelings and emotions. It's just different with those cultures.

429
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:52.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So, you know, this is going to take some work for her to realize like, oh, I'm you have feelings to

430
00:42:52.860 --> 00:43:02.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know you have you have thoughts on this because it's a hierarchy and you know grandma's house like this protective a status.

431
00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:11.160
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where they really do no wrong. There's nothing wrong that can be said to them. And so the way that looks. It's just sharing more about yourself with home.

432
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:22.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: It doesn't have to be, you know, this is everything that you did that hurt me, but just checking in with her. I'm like how I love how you wanted to tell her about group, but she started talking about

433
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The experience you've had with therapy in the past and say,

434
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:36.660
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, listen, and be like, oh yeah. But what I really wanted to share with you is like, this is what I've been in group and this is back, and then you bring it back to her, but then teaching her how to have that flow of communication.

435
00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:49.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Going to need to practice it and have it modeled for her because I her age. That wasn't how the process of communication. When elder speak the youngest just listen. That's just the way it goes.

436
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.660
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, you don't talk about the problems you just fix it.

437
00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.340
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah. So yeah.

438
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:53.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

439
00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:01.650
Jo Delgadillo: When I was growing up, that's all we always had all of our family around and now I noticed the families on around like they used to be in the past like

440
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:09.870
Jo Delgadillo: I'd say like 10 years it's changed since my mom passed away. We know I noticed a difference in her. She's kind of like she's lost her so

441
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.240
Jo Delgadillo: Not everybody's around anyone

442
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:25.650
Jo Delgadillo: I know it hurts her because she's tired of defending us when we were younger we were all on drugs and she defended us. And now that we're not on drugs when my cousin still as she can denied all she wants, but I know he is

443
00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:35.220
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, but now she doesn't need to defend me and she won't let me say, hey, the person I was back then. Isn't the person I am now I

444
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:43.290
Jo Delgadillo: Work in Progress and I'm working my ass off to change who I am and I personally knew she won't let me speak up and I know it bothers her

445
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:53.610
Jo Delgadillo: When she goes to California, she tells me. Oh, they said this about you know how to defend you. And I'm like, let me defend myself. She won't let me. And I'm like, What are you saying to bring me up.

446
00:44:55.050 --> 00:45:09.660
Jo Delgadillo: I don't know. Is it positive, negative, but his issue, bringing me up in a bad way. And I don't. I just don't, I don't know. So like, why are they saying that stuff. Where do they get it from oh you know how the family talks on like the family can't talk. I don't talk to them.

447
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.660
Jo Delgadillo: And that's the reason why is because I

448
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:24.120
Jo Delgadillo: Was never ever ever allowed to defend myself even to this day. We had a big old family fight and for it went off for two months and I had no clue that I did anything

449
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:35.910
Jo Delgadillo: I supposedly I did all kinds of stuff to the song my aunts, and I didn't even know I did it wasn't even around them for two to three months. I wasn't around her and then I found out I did all this stuff. I'm like, wait, what

450
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:48.810
Jo Delgadillo: How come I didn't know this I everybody's like, you knew, and I'm like, if I knew that I would have said something I never knew anything about it. They're like, you know, you did this and that. I'm like, oh my god, people. How could I do this stuff when I

451
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.590
Jo Delgadillo: Didn't know

452
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:50.310
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

453
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:56.310
Jo Delgadillo: You still won't let me defend myself as she can defend me it's just white. Can you say stuff and I can't

454
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.640
Jo Delgadillo: The hierarchy. Yes. In that protects

455
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:00.210
Well,

456
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:13.530
Jo Delgadillo: Yes, that's so because I wanted, I know how to talk to people know like I want to be able to speak up and defend myself shouldn't have to keep defending me when I'm not the same person.

457
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But when I think of it as like

458
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm I see her that mom their true role.

459
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You think about it now.

460
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:31.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your kids get older and you're in a space and someone says something bad about your kids, you're going to defend it, and you're going to see it that it's your job to the

461
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:44.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You won't see it that. Okay. Now, what's his job and it's my little one stops to just pick up for themselves, you'll always see it in at the end of the day, no matter how old they get. They're my babies so

462
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:55.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Even though grandma's not showing love and the way that you want. What I'm seeing is the culture that as the generations that is her way.

463
00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:11.280
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so when she comes back to tell you that's kind of her way of saying, look at how I showed up. They talked about my baby and I defended her but you be an adult now is like, Wait, I don't want this burden for you anymore, let me stick up for myself.

464
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.760
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When she sees it as know I got this. I'm mama.

465
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:15.930
Jo Delgadillo: I can protect you.

466
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:28.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And probably for the non to that status, even more so the older she gets because there is not as much production, the order they get, they can't go out and work. They don't have

467
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:38.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Romantic relationships. So they're basing their life on memories and her memory is a be a protector and being that strong store for you.

468
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:48.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So any chance she gets she's going to speak up for you and defend you. That's probably something that you're going to have to learn to a set and realize like

469
00:47:48.450 --> 00:48:03.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Okay, because I think about it now as a mom end of the day, no matter how old they get someone talks about our boys and defending them. I'm not going to expect them to pick up for themselves and she's that nurturing thing that's going to live out of breath so

470
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:12.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I really don't think it's anything personal against you. The more I learn more about grandma and culture. I'm thinking it's more just

471
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:23.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Her and her listening to her experiences and dynamics that she can't speak life in a different way, just because of her agent and culture.

472
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:26.310
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, she's, she's so mad that she's getting old.

473
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:32.130
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, she does, she will tell anybody that I'll talk to her that she is it stopped.

474
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:38.640
Jo Delgadillo: She's like any year I'm 21 and out here on 73 and a

475
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.350
Jo Delgadillo: New Life sucks.

476
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.420
Jo Delgadillo: That she's getting old.

477
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.410
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Way, she can find control, she'll do it. So you did.

478
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:56.670
Jo Delgadillo: She does. Yeah, it's just it sucks because I want to get her out so bad. And now I can't because we're the where we live. Like, literally, I can see it from right here. We live

479
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:57.810
Jo Delgadillo: Next to senior center.

480
00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:05.340
Jo Delgadillo: And she was about to start going there and now she can't close it down and it's it's a testing place now for approval, but

481
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:15.930
Jo Delgadillo: She was about to get out and it took me months to talk her into finally going right when I talked her into it. She's like over Thursday, and then the cobra, things started happening, we can let her out.

482
00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:23.880
Jo Delgadillo: She does not like going around people visit our she doesn't want nobody to come in her us like me the protector.

483
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.640
Jo Delgadillo: Want people coming in are bold, it's

484
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:28.320
Jo Delgadillo: Going to ruin things or or

485
00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:37.350
Jo Delgadillo: Just anything to start our peace or whatever. So it'd be a long time to get suckered into it. When this happens, I'm like, Great, now. And so I got to start over, but

486
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:49.770
Jo Delgadillo: I will. And I want her to get out and meet people and so she has her own people to talk to not just us as a nobody to talk to you. But her sister in California, but she's not here.

487
00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:50.610
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, I mean,

488
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.680
Jo Delgadillo: It was someone she can express yourself.

489
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.010
Jo Delgadillo: Fisher choose another

490
00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:08.970
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What do you think would, would she be open to this like what she'd be open. If you said, Grandma, would you want to join me for a session when they do you think that's something she would be interested in or you think that she doesn't he wouldn't want to do therapy with you.

491
00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.930
Jo Delgadillo: I think she would put something should just be a bitch about it.

492
00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:30.540
Jo Delgadillo: Just door. She's been treating me only just she doesn't have nothing nice to say to me, and I can't even it takes, but notice that my husband's been noticing what's grown let's deal with you. And I'm like, I don't know, just you picked on everything. I don't know, but I can ask her to

493
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:41.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do it will be the same thing with you. She would check into virtual clinic and maybe just hop on her side consents that it's okay for her to participate.

494
00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In the therapy session.

495
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:59.730
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Cool and are now what have you kind of just talk about, you know, the progress that you've made some of the things you've learned and then I can talk about like communication with the thing that we're working on and establishing boundaries and see

496
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:01.200
Jo Delgadillo: For me,

497
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:07.140
Jo Delgadillo: Yes around her. Your, your cuz I like I like I was all I will

498
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:08.850
Jo Delgadillo: Remember,

499
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and I

500
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Don't want to it's perfectly fine. She doesn't have to participate.

501
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Not something that I feel is

502
00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:23.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You have to do the therapy. But if it's something if there's a way I can support you, because she's such an important figure for you.

503
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:34.590
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, I could meet mediate that conversation between you guys and get her born to your world. This is what Joe has been doing. So it's just something to think about.

504
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:44.100
Jo Delgadillo: Because that's what I was trying to tell her, when I was talking about. They're both trying to her. I've learned a lot about myself and I didn't get that far. But I have learned a lot about myself.

505
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:49.020
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah, the things that I do and why I do it. And I was trying to explain that to her and

506
00:51:49.560 --> 00:52:02.700
Jo Delgadillo: She's was I. Oh, and I've been this and then I'll ask her what did you say this like not even maybe a next stage like I didn't do that or I didn't say that, and everybody's just like yes you did but normal speak up in

507
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:14.010
Jo Delgadillo: A while. I think she might be because her parents had Alzheimer's dementia. So I don't want, I don't want to say I'm starting to see signs of

508
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:18.810
Jo Delgadillo: In but it scares me because I, I, I started to see it like

509
00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:28.890
Jo Delgadillo: Just she is getting older, she's more stressed out and I just I want to chalk it up to stress, but it's a possibility that you could have a do because most of parents had it.

510
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:29.550
So,

511
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:40.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Cute. When we will be helpful for you to remind yourself is this is not personal. This has nothing to do with me. So that, and it may seem hard because

512
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:48.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The attacks are coming directly towards you, but you know that people tend to take out their aggression from the ones that they love most of the ones closest to

513
00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:56.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So she just trust you enough to know that she can be the worst version of herself is still get the best version of you.

514
00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:02.640
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's why she does it. So not that she picked an advantage. But this is just our outlet

515
00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:11.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so the best thing you can do, because we can't change other people. We can definitely change how we respond to it and realizing this is not about me.

516
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:17.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And maybe say it out loud. She says, I'm thankful to you, but this has nothing to do with me.

517
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:31.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then, and then maybe show for seeing those little those little statements of wow, okay. What is what is don't mean by that maybe the more she hears it, she'll realize, oh, she's saying that because I'm being mean.

518
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:43.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, maybe simple like that the jump to do rather than directly asking her, like, Hey, what's going on between us like that may not be a conversation or death that she wants even get into

519
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:50.580
Jo Delgadillo: Your yeah and I don't want like she she cannot wake up tomorrow morning. And then this is the last thing I had to return.

520
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:51.060
Jo Delgadillo: Yeah.

521
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:56.340
Jo Delgadillo: Well yeah, I don't want that. So yeah, sitting. I'm gonna I'll talk to her, see if she'll do it with me.

522
00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:58.860
Jo Delgadillo: What I know that

523
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:06.180
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, we can do that. I just she has to go to virtual clinic and sign the consent to treatment so that she can participate in a session.

524
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.170
Okay.

525
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:15.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: All right, so I'll look out for your email about what that conversation was like, and when you want to schedule the next one. Okay.

526
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.930
Jo Delgadillo: Okay.

527
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.460

Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Me email back to April to let her know, You showed up. Okay.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:37.050
Okay.

536
00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:01.470
Ryan Morrow: How are you

537
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:02.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: How are you

538
00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.200
Ryan Morrow: I'm good, thank you.

539
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:10.410
Ryan Morrow: Good. Actually, I'm

540
00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:11.910
Ryan Morrow: Kind of lazy.

541
00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:16.980
Ryan Morrow: Past couple of weeks because I haven't been working so laid off right now.

542
00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.080
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, I remember you mentioned that to me.

543
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:20.280
Yeah.

544
00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:30.000
Ryan Morrow: But other than that, I'm staying on top of everything that I can do the best that I can. Yeah.

545
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:40.230
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can do during this time, were you able to, I know you said you were probably going to access a neighbor or someone's on an in house jam.

546
00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:43.950
Ryan Morrow: Oh yeah, nah.

547
00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.680
Ryan Morrow: That they'll kind of fell through. So I'm just waiting for the gym. So come back up.

548
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:55.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When are they saying that's going to happen with their time in Florida, so I know

549
00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:59.670
Ryan Morrow: Probably like okay Friday. They're opening up

550
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.070
Ryan Morrow: Restaurants and stuff.

551
01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And then I think they're going to give hair salons.

552
01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.770
Ryan Morrow: gyms and stuff like another week or two.

553
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.070
Ryan Morrow: From Friday. Okay.

554
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And did

555
01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:15.600
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I give you an expectation of when

556
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:18.270
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You can go back

557
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:22.230
Ryan Morrow: Now they've already called a couple of guys back to work.

558
01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:24.120
Ryan Morrow: And

559
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:33.090
Ryan Morrow: And when I talked to my boss last week, he told me that I was on the list to get called back but they haven't called me it

560
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:40.890
Ryan Morrow: So I don't really know yet, but I I did get my unemployment and I'm pretty good amount

561
01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:52.110
Ryan Morrow: A week or every two weeks. And so, uh, so I do have that to help me out until I either go back to work, or find another job.

562
01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah, and much better spirits that when I saw you last

563
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.350
Ryan Morrow: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I actually, I got a vehicle, a couple days ago.

564
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:09.390
Ryan Morrow: And so, um, so that's got my my spirits lifted a little bit

565
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:15.570
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Anything that kills significant to talk about in session today.

566
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:17.850
Ryan Morrow: Um,

567
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.470
Ryan Morrow: No, not really.

568
01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:29.340
Ryan Morrow: I feel pretty good. I'm ready. I mean, obviously, I'm ready to go back to work and in the gym. I'm getting sick of being stuck in the house all the time.

569
01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:35.100
Ryan Morrow: But spiritually mentally and physically I feel pretty good.

570
01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:37.980
Ryan Morrow: Overall,

571
01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.840
Ryan Morrow: I haven't had any problems.

572
01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:50.190
Ryan Morrow: Like with relationships and stuff. Um, I went and saw my family. The other day when I got my vehicle and a couple days before that I went to close.

573
01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:53.760
Ryan Morrow: To pick up my prescription

574
01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:57.600
Ryan Morrow: And and then two days later I bought a vehicle.

575
01:01:57.930 --> 01:02:07.530
Ryan Morrow: And went back to take it on the highway because love is only on 90 miles away or close to love. It is only 90 miles. So it's like an hour and a half drive

576
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:12.000
Ryan Morrow: And so the other day when I got my vehicle. I drove down there just to see how it

577
01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:14.850
Ryan Morrow: Did on the highway and to some my mom as well.

578
01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.700
Ryan Morrow: So, so, yeah.

579
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.560
Ryan Morrow: And then I talked to my kids.

580
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:26.100
Ryan Morrow: Once or twice a week.

581
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Refresh my memory. How many kids do you have

582
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.570
Ryan Morrow: Two that are 2425 I think

583
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.530
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I had when I was really young.

584
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:44.070
Ryan Morrow: And their, their names guy and my my son's name is guy and my daughter's name is Jocelyn.

585
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And how are they doing with everything independent

586
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.160
Ryan Morrow: I'm good, that they're, they both have babies and so

587
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.850
Ryan Morrow: They're doing really well under the circumstances.

588
01:02:59.070 --> 01:02:59.640
Ryan Morrow: So,

589
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:02.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I have a video I wanted to

590
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Play and secure your thoughts on

591
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:20.220
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where I'm starting therapy sessions with clients, just to kind of get your thoughts on what relationships look like for them and what our emotional relationships.

592
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:38.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Why your work environment feel so stressful and you come home from a meeting feeling like no one's understanding you are everyone's out to get you, or does your home feel like there's a lot of tension. Maybe you want your teenager to feel

593
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:46.410
Comfortable talking with you, but it's just not working. If any of these are the case for you. You might have a problem with emotional safety.

594
01:03:54.420 --> 01:04:06.090
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: creating an environment of emotional safety is essential for a productive workplace a healthy home and positive relationships. If you feel tense or like you're being judged all the time.

595
01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:10.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or if you create an environment where people don't feel listened to, or understood

596
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:17.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then your environment is not emotionally safe. Today we're going to talk about a few ways you can increase emotional safety in your environment.

597
01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:29.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Emotional safety is when people feel appreciated valued worthwhile when they feel like they can trust their environment to be fair and consistent and kind

598
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.000
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: In an emotionally safe environment people feel like they can share

599
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:48.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Their vulnerable and sensitive feelings without being mocked blamed or judged feedback and correction can be given in a calm safe and loving manner, people take accountability for their own actions without blame or defensiveness differences of opinion can be shared.

600
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:56.070
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And also accepted, people don't feel like they have to change to be okay in emotionally safe environments. There's a feeling of honesty.

601
01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:03.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And there's a feeling of clear and safe expectations, some of the indicators of an emotionally safe environment or you feel comfortable around each other.

602
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:12.120
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People don't feel like they're going to be attacked there tends to be open and clear communication when someone messes up

603
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:19.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: repairs are made quickly, you'll see an increase in Vulnerability and openness, where people are sharing their really sensitive feelings.

604
01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:27.540
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And people feel connected. Now, if you'd like to create an environment like this. You have to focus 95% of your effort on changing yourself.

605
01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:34.920
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because we are responsible for our environment and what we what we put out there and what we allow to come into our environment.

606
01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:47.100
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So most of your effort should be focusing on yourself. I say this because when I talk about emotional safety. I get a lot of people say, Oh yeah, the people around me. They're so dangerous. They're so mean there's attacking there so judgmental de de de

607
01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:53.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And they don't realize that by saying that and thinking that they're actually creating an emotionally unsafe environment.

608
01:05:53.670 --> 01:06:02.940
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or perhaps the people around them actually are attacking and dangerous, but they aren't taking any steps to create safety for themselves by setting healthy boundaries.

609
01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:14.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So when it comes to emotional safety focus on yourself. What can you do to create this the opposite of emotional safety is judgment blame attacking

610
01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:23.010
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: There's a lot of closed off emotions so people use anger instead of sadness or they express frustration.

611
01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:35.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Instead of, you know, expressing that they feel discouraged some other indicators of an emotionally unsafe environment is people are constantly giving advice. Instead of listening. We're constantly judging someone else or trying to

612
01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:43.350
Ryan Morrow: Change them if they don't agree with them in emotionally unsafe environments. People feel a sense of conditional love that means well I love you.

613
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:53.520
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you change or I love you when you're good, but not when you're bad and that creates this constant sense of insecurity now on the receiving end of that.

614
01:06:53.910 --> 01:07:01.530
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: People who are constantly feeling like they aren't good enough or questioning their own self worth are going to project that on other people.

615
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:10.470
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So that's something that needs to be worked on in order to create a feeling of emotional safety other indicators of an emotionally unsafe environment are yelling

616
01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:21.960
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Threatening or obviously any physical violence that creates, you know, a completely unsafe environment defensiveness blame using voice tone or a lot of attitude.

617
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:26.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: also contribute to negative environment, as do passive aggressive statements.

618
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:40.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: One of the most common indicators of an emotionally unsafe environment or using things like personal attacks. So instead of saying, I don't like it when you forget to do your tour. You think you are the laziest person in the world.

619
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:47.820
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, attacking their character just calling them a lazy sob. The other thing that's a big indicator of emotionally unsafe environments.

620
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:53.580
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is when the rules are boundaries are standards are constantly changing. People don't know what to expect.

621
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:59.250
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Or when there's a feeling of walking on eggshells like if you say the wrong thing, that person is going to blow up. Or if you

622
01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:05.610
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: If you do the wrong thing, that person is going to be offended. So those are all indicators of emotionally unsafe environments.

623
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:12.240
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: We can actively create an environment of emotional safety by working on ourselves, we create an environment of love.

624
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:18.840
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Where we aren't trying to change other people, but rather we put our focus on trying to understand them and listen to them.

625
01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:31.350
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: When the time comes for correction. We are consistent firm clear and fair we're honest with people and we share our, our vulnerable emotions like Sadness or hurt.

626
01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:40.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Instead of only expressing secondary emotions like frustration and anger, we create internal safety by building ourselves up and

627
01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.320
Ryan Morrow: You know, ending on offended not taking offense by what

628
01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:50.670
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Other people say, we also got to make sure never to use the word emotional safety as a way to badger or try and change someone else.

629
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:58.170
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So going up someone's in you're creating an emotionally unsafe environment is not going to be helpful if the environment is actually unsafe.

630
01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:10.800
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then what we need to do is set boundaries around other people ask for change. Invite change and when necessary leave to create emotional safety we always have to focus on what's within our own realm of control.

631
01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:20.130
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So we focus on changing ourselves instead of trying to change other people, if we're in an emotionally unsafe environment we're less likely to create change by asking someone else to change.

632
01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:37.560
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Then we are by setting clear, consistent and firm boundaries. It is fair to ask other people to change to make requests and to, you know, tell them how they're affecting you. But it is rarely fair or helpful, but to expect that someone change or to demand.

633
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:42.240
Ryan Morrow: That they change in order for you to accept them. This creates a feeling of powerless in yourself.

634
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:55.140
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you're demanding that someone else change in order for you to feel okay we can take back our emotional safety by focusing on our own sins and creating clear, firm and consistent boundaries with others. Thanks for watching. I hope that was helpful and

635
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.420
Ryan Morrow: I really liked it.

636
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:07.470
Ryan Morrow: My thoughts. Some of the stuff that she said I could relate to

637
01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:12.390
Ryan Morrow: On both on both ends. Sometimes I'm pretty consistent.

638
01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:16.200
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I said, what was that thats related to

639
01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.400
Ryan Morrow: Sometimes I

640
01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:23.490
Ryan Morrow: Go on the defense.

641
01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:26.010
Ryan Morrow: Real quick.

642
01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:31.440
Ryan Morrow: Maybe when someone's trying to give constructive criticism or advice.

643
01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.940
Ryan Morrow: I might feel like that person.

644
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:38.610
Ryan Morrow: It's none of their business.

645
01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:39.630
Or

646
01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.860
Ryan Morrow: They don't know me well enough to be given me advice on

647
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:47.940
Ryan Morrow: That particular subject.

648
01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:49.620
Ryan Morrow: That don't know enough about

649
01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.540
Ryan Morrow: You know what

650
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.070
Ryan Morrow: My circumstances are

651
01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:54.570
Ryan Morrow: And so, uh,

652
01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:00.750
Ryan Morrow: So on one side, like I i know where my wrongs are

653
01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:04.260
Ryan Morrow: But at the same time. Like sometimes people

654
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:12.390
Ryan Morrow: Don't realize that they are stepping into a boundary that they don't really station be

655
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.190
Ryan Morrow: Stepping into

656
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.190
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What was the last time you experience that

657
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.730
Ryan Morrow: Just the just the other day talking to a friend of mine.

658
01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:26.940
Ryan Morrow: So,

659
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.260
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So I heard you say that

660
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:34.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The person doesn't know me like that to kind of

661
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.120
Ryan Morrow: Yeah.

662
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.770
Ryan Morrow: I'll kind of all kind of give a go into detail.

663
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.770
Ryan Morrow: It's a girl that I had been talking to

664
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.670
Ryan Morrow: dating a little bit here and there, whatever. And you know, she doesn't really know like

665
01:11:53.130 --> 01:12:12.960
Ryan Morrow: A whole lot about my, my personal situation she knows a little bit about, you know, like I'm in recovery and stuff. And so anyways I I bought a vehicle, the other day and I was telling her that I needed to get you know my own place now. And I was gonna focus on that and

666
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:23.130
Ryan Morrow: Like she doesn't know like how much money I make don't make or what I O or don't know as far as budget wise.

667
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.110
Ryan Morrow: And she started telling me you know, we'll just be careful. Don't get in over your head and

668
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:30.180
Ryan Morrow: Like, I understand, like,

669
01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.290
Ryan Morrow: Where she was coming from. And she was trying to be

670
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:52.170
Ryan Morrow: You know, get friendly advice or whatever. But I kind of I, kind of, I was kind of offended because I didn't feel like it was her place to be giving me advice about something that she doesn't really know that much about

671
01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:55.290
Ryan Morrow: And so I was kind of, I was kind of rude to her.

672
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:00.510
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Play out

673
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:05.250
Ryan Morrow: Well, she ended up hanging up on me and

674
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:05.880
So,

675
01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:07.890
Ryan Morrow: So, yeah.

676
01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So do you still feel like you

677
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:17.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: regrets about the outcome of that conversation, would you have done.

678
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:20.550
Ryan Morrow: No, not really. Um,

679
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:28.230
Ryan Morrow: I mean, I could have been more blind and just been like, hey, you know what, like we're not boyfriend and girlfriend.

680
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.630
Ryan Morrow: Um, you don't really know

681
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:38.550
Ryan Morrow: That much and I mean I told her I was like, you don't know how much money I'm making right now, we're not making you don't

682
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:47.550
Ryan Morrow: Know what bills. I have or don't have. I was like, understand where you're coming from. And of course, you know, I just kind of felt like she was trying to mommy.

683
01:13:47.880 --> 01:14:01.230
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, no. And I was like, you know, I, I appreciate the advice, but I'm fine, like I know what I'm doing. I'm a big boy like you know so and I understand like my wrong in that I could have

684
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:08.550
Ryan Morrow: I could have handled it in a friendlier way. I probably got went on the defensive

685
01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.310
Ryan Morrow: Pretty quick because I do that.

686
01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:12.150
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I think

687
01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.850
Ryan Morrow: Be a lot of a lot of that is because my dad.

688
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:21.870
Ryan Morrow: Was always talking down to me and tell me know like you know just negative all the time.

689
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:25.140
Ryan Morrow: And so I think that

690
01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:39.930
Ryan Morrow: Unless it's my mom or my sister, someone who I respect love, care about, um, when they, when they do that, it's okay. And I, I either lists and and

691
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:47.490
Ryan Morrow: If it's something that that we agree with them. I'll still, you know, yes. Thank you. I appreciate it, you know.

692
01:14:47.790 --> 01:15:05.070
Ryan Morrow: I'll still be respectful and nice about it. But if it's somebody that I don't feel like like I don't trust. I'm on that. I'm not in that like a close to a relationship with you know I'm I kind of, I kind of take it personally. And I've kind of felt like

693
01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.090
Ryan Morrow: She was a attack me in a, in a way, in a sense.

694
01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:12.780
Ryan Morrow: Like trying to tell me how to live my life. I guess you know I

695
01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:13.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

696
01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:22.920
Ryan Morrow: Been. And the thing is, is it's like I'm in recovery. Right now I'm having to start my life over from nothing from nothing, basically.

697
01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:29.010
Ryan Morrow: And I have a little bit of help. I have a friend of mine here in Lubbock that's helped me out a lot.

698
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:47.130
Ryan Morrow: Um, but other than that, like, I don't have anybody any family members, giving me money financially or anything like that. So anyways, so you know, like there's, you know, you have to have three essential things a job, a place to live in a vehicle to, kind of, you know,

699
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.560
Ryan Morrow: For life to happen and

700
01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:54.510
Ryan Morrow: I have. I just got laid off. So I'm not 100% sure on the job.

701
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:59.190
Ryan Morrow: But I just got a vehicle and I need to find my own place right

702
01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:10.710
Ryan Morrow: And and so uh you know when I can understand if she was telling me that if I told her I went bought a dirt bike and some guns or

703
01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:12.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know a bunch of clothes likes

704
01:16:12.810 --> 01:16:26.250
Ryan Morrow: You know, whatever. But after I told her I went got a vehicle. And now I'm going to get my own place you know two things that I have to you know need and have to have she's trying to tell me

705
01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:33.390
Ryan Morrow: You know, to be careful and don't get, you know, and so anyway I just, I don't know.

706
01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.920
Ryan Morrow: I just felt like she was stepping into a

707
01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:44.670
Ryan Morrow: Place that she shouldn't even, you know, she should have just been like, oh, that's cool, you know, whatever, you know,

708
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:47.430
Ryan Morrow: I'm happy for you. That's what most

709
01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:57.930
Ryan Morrow: People that because you know most people realize that our thinking logically or, you know, down to earth.

710
01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:01.830
Ryan Morrow: Um, they know. Like, who

711
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:04.950
Ryan Morrow: They are and they know a boundary

712
01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:05.970
Ryan Morrow: They know

713
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.450
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Like

714
01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:17.190
Ryan Morrow: You know, like, I know that. Like if someone that I don't know very well tells me they just went and did that I'm not gonna tell them, we'll just be careful, you know, don't you know it's not my place.

715
01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:22.440
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, hey, I'm happy for you, man. I hope everything works out, you know, that's awesome.

716
01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:24.720
Ryan Morrow: You know, I mean, and so

717
01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:33.360
Ryan Morrow: So yeah and and if she were sitting here listening to that she she would she she probably wouldn't know how to receive that

718
01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.430
Ryan Morrow: She would probably take offense to it.

719
01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.020
Ryan Morrow: And think that

720
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:50.520
Ryan Morrow: That I that it was all my fault or whatever, you know, so I don't know, I just thought that was a good example of from what she was some of the stuff she was talking about.

721
01:17:50.520 --> 01:18:04.110
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it is because what I'm hearing the core is that you are taking private ownership and your ability to be self sufficient and that relationship plays a critical key and advice, giving

722
01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:18.900
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And she hasn't built that relationship to be in a position to give any advice or insight, but at the same time. And what did she be supportive of someone that you said is trying to be self sufficient.

723
01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:21.660
Ryan Morrow: Right.

724
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:31.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And the emotional safety, I could see the connections, because with the relationship is ok we start seeing those red flags up. Okay, lack of support.

725
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:48.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Um, and, and you're going to be a little more aware of critique because of what you said the relationship in dynamic with your father. So you're more aware of it and if she did experienced that in her childhood or in her upbringing. She may not think that it's such a big deal.

726
01:18:50.460 --> 01:19:05.370
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: But I'm pretty sure in the conversation, you were given her subtle cues that okay or advice wasn't wasn't going well. Um, and did she react to it. Was she understanding when she heard her viewpoint, or did she also just become defensive

727
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And thinking she gave up on it.

728
01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:20.700
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I mean, yeah, she didn't like me telling her that it wasn't her place or her business to be telling me because you don't know my situation.

729
01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:24.720
Ryan Morrow: And she didn't like that I was telling her that. And so

730
01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.770
Ryan Morrow: She hung up on me.

731
01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:27.240
Ryan Morrow: And told me that I heard her

732
01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:27.900
Feelings.

733
01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:32.940
Ryan Morrow: She sent me a text and so anyways.

734
01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:39.480
Ryan Morrow: This is a, this isn't a person that I'm going to be in a relationship with

735
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:46.140
Ryan Morrow: Or anything like that, you know, saw it doesn't bother me, mostly at all. It was kind of just like

736
01:19:46.650 --> 01:19:47.910
Ryan Morrow: Whatever, but

737
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:50.430
Ryan Morrow: Maybe me was

738
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:52.500
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: No.

739
01:19:53.490 --> 01:20:00.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I agree with your viewpoint, I could say maybe a delivery could have been different. But the core of what you're saying is definitely accurate.

740
01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:04.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Be more supportive and listening, rather than

741
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:09.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: For taking what someone does what feels sufficient for them.

742
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.890
Right.

743
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:16.260
Ryan Morrow: Yeah. Yeah, I mean I wouldn't if she would have told me

744
01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:30.090
Ryan Morrow: Like she's going through a divorce. And so her financial and then all the stuff going on her financial situation is is upside down as well and you know if she told me I just went bought

745
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:36.030
Ryan Morrow: 10 cars and a house, I'd be like, hey, that's cool. Awesome. I'm glad for

746
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.630
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You

747
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:39.840
Ryan Morrow: You know I it's not none of my business like

748
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:43.740
Ryan Morrow: To tell you, hey, you might be getting in over your head or whatever.

749
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:45.480
Ryan Morrow: You know,

750
01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.500
Ryan Morrow: That's my way of thinking I I know everybody else doesn't think that way, though.

751
01:20:50.430 --> 01:21:04.620
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is it possible, because the fact that she's gone through a divorce and our financial situation is uneasy. Is it possible that she was projecting her own fears of her financial insecurities on you probably saw her advice was helpful.

752
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:10.050
Ryan Morrow: Well, yeah, she just had to give her her truck back to her husband.

753
01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:14.040
Ryan Morrow: Because he's the finance the guy that you know bought it.

754
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.700
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Mm hmm.

755
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:18.600
Ryan Morrow: And so she had to hand that brand new truck back to him.

756
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:20.490
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And her

757
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:24.180
Ryan Morrow: grandma gave her a Ford Explorer.

758
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.880
Ryan Morrow: That's, you know, older but it's still nice

759
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:32.160
Ryan Morrow: And she's having to drive it and I think she kind of felt like

760
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.170
Ryan Morrow: You know, not jealous it all.

761
01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.090
Ryan Morrow: But, you know,

762
01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:45.570
Ryan Morrow: Like it was hard for her to be happy for for me whenever because she's going through what she's going through

763
01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:46.440
Yeah.

764
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:47.850
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah.

765
01:21:51.150 --> 01:22:00.990
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I see that. And I can see the slip that she would make and thinking that she was to be in support of but in reality he just living through her own fears and her current situation.

766
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:07.860
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: You know, telling you to be careful with because people are thinking I should have been more careful. I should have been more prepared and self sufficient.

767
01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:17.940
Ryan Morrow: Right and and the funny thing is, is she, she tells me I don't care what because we're not together, you know, we're not we're

768
01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.210
Ryan Morrow: You know, just like an open friendly relationship.

769
01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:33.570
Ryan Morrow: And she always tells me I don't care what you do or who you do it with or, you know, you know. You're a big boy, blah, blah, blah. But then like she wants to give me her opinion and our two cents.

770
01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:34.650
Ryan Morrow: All the time.

771
01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.220
Ryan Morrow: So it's like, obviously, you do care or

772
01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:43.890
Ryan Morrow: You wouldn't be and she don't understand that I try to explain it through you're contradicting yourself.

773
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:53.100
Ryan Morrow: And so anyways, yeah, this is, this isn't a girl that like, you know, our red flag that one light real quick.

774
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:54.870
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah yeah

775
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:56.820
Ryan Morrow: So anyways,

776
01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:03.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: What relationships do you feel like they get you. They understand

777
01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.950
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: what your needs are, past and present.

778
01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.530
Ryan Morrow: Uh,

779
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.510
Ryan Morrow: Well, I mean, I'll always my mom and sisters

780
01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:32.940
Ryan Morrow: Are always supportive and they're always real with me, you know, they'll be happy for me, you know, if I go and buy something, but, you know, my mom you know she'll be like, Hey, you know, be careful.

781
01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:33.960
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, and it served

782
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:36.510
Ryan Morrow: As her place to, you know, for her to tell me

783
01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:43.890
Ryan Morrow: You know, be careful. Don't get in over your head, you know, you just got this. Good job, but don't go out and try to buy the world yet.

784
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:46.470
Ryan Morrow: And I'm really impatient.

785
01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:51.270
Ryan Morrow: And I want everything now. And so I go out and I

786
01:23:51.450 --> 01:23:57.720
Ryan Morrow: Try with everything that I have to make things happen sometimes sooner than they're supposed to.

787
01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:13.500
Ryan Morrow: And so so anyways. Like, you know. Yeah. So my mom and my sisters are always honest and real with me always happy for me, regardless of if I if I even if I shouldn't have bought it or did it.

788
01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:20.670
Ryan Morrow: But, you know, they'll, they'll also give tell me like real real advice, you know, they're not. They don't sugarcoat anything

789
01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:22.680
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, and my

790
01:24:22.710 --> 01:24:34.170
Ryan Morrow: My dad I I don't really have a relationship with him right now. I haven't talked to him in two years, we've we've had our, our, up and down. This has been since I was a kid.

791
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.470
Ryan Morrow: Relationship and so

792
01:24:37.650 --> 01:24:42.420
Ryan Morrow: Um, other than my mom and sisters, um,

793
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:47.130
Ryan Morrow: I mean, I have a couple of guy friends.

794
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:50.670
Ryan Morrow: That are the same way.

795
01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:51.960
Ryan Morrow: You know,

796
01:24:52.860 --> 01:25:06.960
Ryan Morrow: Usually my guy friends. They don't even step into that, hey, you probably should be careful, or you probably shouldn't that are always just like, Hey. You're a big boy like I'm happy for you and they might be thinking in their mind.

797
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:12.750
Ryan Morrow: You know, he probably shouldn't have done that. Or he probably you know needs to not

798
01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.120
Ryan Morrow: Or whatever, you know, but

799
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.530
Ryan Morrow: They still I they they respect that boundary and they don't

800
01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.590
Ryan Morrow: You know, really go there with me.

801
01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:33.600
Ryan Morrow: So I so I mean they and they probably should, you know, to a certain point, like, you know, you want your best friend, to be able to

802
01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:48.000
Ryan Morrow: Hold you accountable and give you constructive criticism and also you being able to receive it on the other end as well. Um, and, as far as like intimate relationships go

803
01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:58.440
Ryan Morrow: Like currently like I'm just dating. I have I have, you know, girl like not girlfriends. But girls that I talked to and stuff.

804
01:25:59.850 --> 01:26:15.600
Ryan Morrow: But the girl that is helping me her and love it, you know, she understands like my circumstances, my situation she knows me like I'm open with her about all my business, whether it be dating financial stuff.

805
01:26:16.110 --> 01:26:17.400
Ryan Morrow: And so like

806
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:29.250
Ryan Morrow: I'll let her, you know, tell me, you know, Finn and whether I agree or not, like, you know, like will argue our way. Maybe not like argue argue, but

807
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:32.130
Ryan Morrow: You know, we'll go back and forth, maybe a little bit

808
01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.180
And

809
01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:39.270
Ryan Morrow: At the end of the day, like I know where I'm wrong, and where I'm where I'm right. Yeah.

810
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:47.400
Ryan Morrow: So anyways, so yeah, I don't really have besides my mom and sisters. I don't really have

811
01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:50.130
Ryan Morrow: A wife, you know, to

812
01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.630
Ryan Morrow: Help me in that area.

813
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:52.890
Or

814
01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.020
Ryan Morrow: Really, I don't really have any like close guy friends.

815
01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.590
Ryan Morrow: To help me in that area. So

816
01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:04.260
Ryan Morrow: And a lot of that has to do with

817
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:08.340
Ryan Morrow: My addiction, like I've ran a lot of people off.

818
01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.560
Ryan Morrow: Burn, burn bridges and

819
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:14.160
Ryan Morrow: So, you know, you know how that goes.

820
01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:14.700
Yeah.

821
01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:16.740
Ryan Morrow: So,

822
01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:21.060
Ryan Morrow: I was just gonna say, so I don't really have a

823
01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:24.270
Ryan Morrow: Whole lot of people. And I'm really close with

824
01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:32.280
Ryan Morrow: They can call me or that want to call me and talk to me about stuff and

825
01:27:33.150 --> 01:27:35.970
Ryan Morrow: give me advice or whatever. Yeah.

826
01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:37.110
Ryan Morrow: Plus I'm 40

827
01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.090
Ryan Morrow: And so

828
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:42.600
Ryan Morrow: You know, people kind of feel like

829
01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.170
Ryan Morrow: You know, you should be

830
01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:48.930
Ryan Morrow: Able to hold yourself up.

831
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.480
Ryan Morrow: And your, you know,

832
01:27:51.540 --> 01:28:00.930
Ryan Morrow: Take care of your business. And whatever you do, is on you and you know. So usually people in general, you know,

833
01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:04.830
Ryan Morrow: I guess.

834
01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:14.400
Ryan Morrow: For the most part, you know, expect you to be able to make good and bad choices or, you know, work your way through them.

835
01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.800
Ryan Morrow: Yeah. So anyways,

836
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:29.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Yeah. So, good point. But I heard you mention, um, with that relationship and even different things that not having that place.

837
01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:35.790
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To get that feedback and even the best friend, as you were talking, I saw you reflect the light well

838
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:51.930
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I wonder why he doesn't. It's almost like that's what you're processing, as you were discussing what qualities or characteristics would it take for someone to have that place or that position where they would get feedback in the feel like, yeah, they have the right to to offer that to

839
01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:54.390
Ryan Morrow: A

840
01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:12.510
Ryan Morrow: I, I, I'm not sure if I totally understand you, what you what you're asking or telling me, but um I think first and foremost people in my circle the know like what I'm what I've been through. I'm going through

841
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:15.090
Ryan Morrow: They have to see.

842
01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:17.640
Ryan Morrow: Me making good choices.

843
01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.770
Ryan Morrow: And doing the right thing. Okay. And my sobriety.

844
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:30.660
Ryan Morrow: And they have to see that for a while before they start trusting me and before they want to get close to me again.

845
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:32.220
Ryan Morrow: You know what I mean.

846
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:36.000
Ryan Morrow: And so, once that's established hopefully

847
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:41.790
Ryan Morrow: This is the last time that I ever have to you know put everything back together.

848
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:47.760
Ryan Morrow: That I think people will be more up to like want to get closer to me.

849
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:51.810
Ryan Morrow: And yeah yeah and give me feedback and stuff.

850
01:29:52.110 --> 01:30:03.030
Ryan Morrow: But as of right now, you know, everybody kind of has to step away from you and let you work things out on your own through counseling and through outside sources.

851
01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:04.950
Ryan Morrow: Because once you once you've uh

852
01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:15.990
Ryan Morrow: You know, piss people off and burn bridges and you know you people don't trust you and they kind of feel like they have to step away from you and lets you you know figure this out on your own.

853
01:30:17.490 --> 01:30:18.270
Ryan Morrow: You know, so

854
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:28.830
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: That that example covered a lot of the questions that I had

855
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:42.480
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Initially I was gonna ask who makes you feel appreciated. Like they said in the video. So would it comes to significant figures again mom and sisters that make you feel appreciated.

856
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:44.580
Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I mean it.

857
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:54.540
Ryan Morrow: There are the three people in my family, whether I'm not sober sober that stand by me, you know, as much as they can.

858
01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.290
Ryan Morrow: Until they have to step away. You know, they will

859
01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:00.060
Ryan Morrow: But

860
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:04.110
Ryan Morrow: my step dad, he's kind of

861
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:21.900
Ryan Morrow: Got a grudge against me and I don't know if we'll ever totally work that out and me my real dad happened spoke in two years and that's on a whole nother doesn't have anything to do with drugs or anything. It's just my dad being the way that my dad is

862
01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:27.810
Ryan Morrow: My sisters don't really talk to them either. So anyways, um,

863
01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.330
Ryan Morrow: So, um, what else, what else were you asking

864
01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:51.750
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I just asked who makes you feel appreciated. So mentioned Connecticut relationships mom and your sisters and what I'm hearing is that not only

865
01:31:52.680 --> 01:32:01.290
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Do you need an emotional safe environment you're also trying to create emotionally safe spaces so that others can feel comfortable with you again.

866
01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:03.060
Ryan Morrow: Right.

867
01:32:04.230 --> 01:32:12.810
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And so other than being in the program, doing what are the things have you been trying to do to create that emotional safety for others.

868
01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:17.040
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: To sobriety.

869
01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.520
Ryan Morrow: Well, I, yeah, I mean,

870
01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.730
Ryan Morrow: Because, like, okay, I'm 40 years old.

871
01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:30.990
Ryan Morrow: And I live in a town that I just moved to, you know, a couple of months ago, I don't know anybody here really

872
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:42.180
Ryan Morrow: And so I'm starting my life over from scratch. And I'm kind of starting my my relationships over from scratch, for the most part, um, as well, like

873
01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:55.800
Ryan Morrow: I don't know all of my guy friends back home, you know, they're married, they have families and they have their own problems. And, you know, I'm not like I don't have hang out you know best for you know like I'm not

874
01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.310
Ryan Morrow: Even when even if our sober. You know, like

875
01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:05.490
Ryan Morrow: I I'm at the point in my life where we're i don't i don't really have that, you know, it's family.

876
01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:08.670
Ryan Morrow: And, you know, maybe a girlfriend.

877
01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:16.770
Ryan Morrow: And that's pretty much it, though. I mean, you know, like right now as far as my family's concerned.

878
01:33:18.330 --> 01:33:21.750
Ryan Morrow: As long as my mom and my sisters and my nephew's

879
01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:33.210
Ryan Morrow: Love Me and are, you know, happy for me and and support me I'm totally content with that, like, I don't really my step dad and my dad. They can do whatever they want to do.

880
01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.860
Ryan Morrow: That doesn't really bother me. One way or another.

881
01:33:40.410 --> 01:33:43.050
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: So your kids you do as an emotional

882
01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:44.880
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: They figure

883
01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:49.140
Ryan Morrow: Uh, yeah, yeah. Um,

884
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:51.810
Ryan Morrow: They they've never seen me on drugs.

885
01:33:53.970 --> 01:34:09.930
Ryan Morrow: They've never seen me high or or or anything. So, uh, my kids are at the point of their of their life where they just want to see me good and and you know like when I talk to them would just talk as friends, basically.

886
01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.260
Ryan Morrow: They understand like

887
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.580
Ryan Morrow: We

888
01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:23.550
Ryan Morrow: That me and their mom had them when they were when we were really young and things, you know, you know, could have

889
01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:44.190
Ryan Morrow: Been a lot different. If the circumstances were different, but because of the age. And they moved away right after that they were the second my daughter was born. And so I didn't. I wasn't able to have a relationship with them for for a long time.

890
01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.840
Ryan Morrow: And a lot of that was my fault because I kind of built a wall.

891
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:49.770
Up.

892
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:54.930
Ryan Morrow: And just, I wanted to live my life and party and have fun.

893
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.490
Ryan Morrow: And

894
01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.490
Ryan Morrow: So until like

895
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:15.240
Ryan Morrow: Three or four years ago. And when I I went to a program called teen challenge and I stayed for 15 months and graduated and that's when I met my kids like really for the first time.

896
01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:35.280
Ryan Morrow: And I had talked to them on the phone and stuff before that and had some kind of relationship with them at least a little bit but um anyways. After I graduated there I met them for the first time, and I started talking to them and having like more of a relationship with them.

897
01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:49.980
Ryan Morrow: But really, not like a father, son, daughter relationship, but more of because I don't feel like I hold that over them. Um, they call me, Dad. But, you know,

898
01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:52.650
Ryan Morrow: I haven't really been a father to them. I mean,

899
01:35:52.770 --> 01:35:54.120
Ryan Morrow: In all honesty.

900
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:55.380
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And

901
01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:57.900
Ryan Morrow: They understand that and

902
01:35:59.070 --> 01:36:19.890
Ryan Morrow: They're okay with that. They just want me to be be good, you know, sober and and they want they they want to be able to see me on the holidays and whatever and meet them, you know, certain times of the year, because they live in Fort Worth, and I live in Lubbock or Clovis So anyways, I mean,

903
01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:30.630
Ryan Morrow: I would say, besides my mom and sisters. That's the most important thing that I need to focus on as far as relationship goes is my relationship with my my kids.

904
01:36:33.690 --> 01:36:40.680
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Is that, is that because you said what your kids want from you is that what you're wanting to are there.

905
01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:41.100
In

906
01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:44.400
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Your father

907
01:36:45.450 --> 01:36:46.110
Ryan Morrow: Do what now.

908
01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:51.780
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Because you said you know they I was unable to be a father to them.

909
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:58.020
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: Right, so some people would struggle with remorse or anything about that.

910
01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:00.540
Ryan Morrow: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I definitely do.

911
01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.270
Ryan Morrow: I feel bad that that I was selfish.

912
01:37:03.690 --> 01:37:14.730
Ryan Morrow: And I wanted to go and party and have fun and and I could have after I turned 18 I could have when sought them out and tried to be a dad.

913
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:28.650
Ryan Morrow: But because of what happened with me in their mom and other circumstances. It's not that I didn't want it why want anything to do with them. But I did want

914
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:45.210
Ryan Morrow: I wanted to live my life. And so I was very selfish in that. And so I didn't make any effort. I figured, after I graduated high school, I figured I was at

915
01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:53.910
Ryan Morrow: I figured I was that up in a place where you know what, like it's going to leave well enough alone.

916
01:37:55.230 --> 01:38:02.250
Ryan Morrow: And then I got hooked on drugs 20 456 whatever it was. And so at that point.

917
01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:12.630
Ryan Morrow: You know, I felt horrible about the situation. I knew that I messed up that I should have been a dad and at least tried you know even though I was young.

918
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:26.760
Ryan Morrow: But I just figured, you know what, it's better they're better off without me. Because at that point in my life. I felt like I just I screwed up my whole life forever and that I was never going to be able to be a good father

919
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:39.900
Ryan Morrow: But then I talked to them when I met them and they were like, You know what, we forgive you. We don't have any grudge. Um, we just want to, to have a good relationship with you and for you to be it'd be okay.

920
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:42.930
Ryan Morrow: So, so, yeah.

921
01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:48.390
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: I'm sort of possibilities with that relationship.

922
01:38:49.170 --> 01:39:03.780
Ryan Morrow: Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, exclude like both my, my dad and step dad. Um, yeah, I don't. That's not even an issue. Um, I guess when it comes to relationships. I need to focus on my kids. That's, that's number one. Yeah.

923
01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:07.320
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: The ones that you know is a possibility. Yeah.

924
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:21.360
Jessica Bailey-Pierre: And that's a good mindset to have because some people get so fixated on the relationships that they know it's like beyond repair at this point and it just continues to produce more guilt, shame, and it just needs to that addiction relapse.

925
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:26.700
Ryan Morrow: Right, and they see if if my son and daughter light bad mouth me

926
01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:35.280
Ryan Morrow: And called me and cursed me or set bad things about me, then it would really hurt me a lot more than it has

927
01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:38.970
Ryan Morrow: The only pain that I've that I've felt his pain.

928
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:47.580
Ryan Morrow: Of my own shame and guilt. They've done nothing but show me love. They're all through everything.

929
01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:58.890
Ryan Morrow: So, so, yeah. They're really good kids and they were brought up. Good. I'm in a Christian home and they understood the

930
01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:14.130
Ryan Morrow: Way. My dad was with me and that I had a hard life growing up and I took a bad path and ended up in some bad places and things happen. So I'm basically they just want the past to be the past and to have

931
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:17.790
Ryan Morrow: From from this day forward, you know, a good

932
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:21.060

Ryan Morrow: Yeah, I just wasn't, it wasn't good, you know, and so when she picked up and left. I was so like upset with her that I didn't, I couldn't. I probably kind of held held it on out on guy. And Jocelyn to

939
01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:05.850
