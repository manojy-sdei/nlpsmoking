Galaxy J3 Orbit: So,

39
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.780

40
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.740
Galaxy J3 Orbit: Well, at first I was

41
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.740

43
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:38.430
Galaxy J3 Orbit: I was getting in trouble for, you know, a droid striking and stuff like that. So I decided that I would do opioids because of my body they got out of your system at three days. So I was getting away with it with my of juvenile probation.

44
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:51.420
Galaxy J3 Orbit: So that's really what started it. I, you know, I've always had to use up to for my panic attacks and you know basically self medicating
