96
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.390
I'm

97
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: on offer.

98
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.770
sophie conley: Yeah, I think, about three years ago.

99
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.060
sophie conley: Is when I

100
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.920
sophie conley: Started

101
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it's the same therapist, so they know

102
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.730
Okay.

103
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

104
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.410
sophie conley: Yeah.

105
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.940
You know what's going on.

106
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you have the therapist doing that and then

107
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:32.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cocaine thing got out of hand now but but on and off with alcohol. You had mentioned right

108
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.670
sophie conley: Yeah.

109
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:45.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Tell me about alcohol. Did you feel like that because that was the first thing you started and marijuana. Do you feel like alcohol was problematic for you to like

110
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.040
sophie conley: Yeah, I'm

111
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.040
Dr. Belis Aladag: Into like more than two, three drinks in one sitting.

112
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.840
sophie conley: Um, when I first started, I

113
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:06.060
sophie conley: Definitely drink a lot, but it was more like how often I was drinking. Okay, and then

114
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.020
sophie conley: On and off like throughout high school

115
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:18.150
sophie conley: I was like, just drinking too much and like drinking too often. Okay, and

116
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:28.050
sophie conley: It would be I will kind of be on and off and then like as I started to smoke more I drank less and

117
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.680
sophie conley: Like that, like switched back

118
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:32.730
Back.

119
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then the cocaine. Yep. Okay.

120
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: All right.

121
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:53.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yeah, I would say, it sounds like you had you have those three three substances, I would say you have a use disorder with all three, you know, in varying degrees.

122
00:10:55.170 --> 00:11:04.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: And each one has different qualities. So the consequences of use of this or that is also dependent on like what chemical it is to write

123
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: So cocaine of, you know, well,

124
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:25.890
Dr. Belis Aladag: Alcohol can kill you, as well. But cocaine can kill you quickly because of the heart, heart attack problem stroke problem, you know, then then also the purity. We don't know what's in it. Sometimes there's other things in their content.

125
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:36.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: And stuff and people use fentanyl and you think you're doing, you know, it's just so, so there's so many reasons why that is a super dangerous chemical right to be using

126
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:48.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Alcohol is also very dangerous and very toxic, but usually it takes some time to build up, you know, it takes its toll on you. And it hits you, but

127
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's a little bit

128
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Less imminent. You know what I mean.

129
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.630
Yeah.

130
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:04.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: All right, and then the marijuana marijuana can be detrimental as well. I mean, you already saw that you're like, it was becoming a problem.

131
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you feel like it was, it's the, the fact that you

132
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:22.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: Want to escape something that's problematic for you, like, what, what was when you were smoking the pot and you were feeling like it was out of control what was going on, like, why did you feel that way. How

133
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.460
sophie conley: I would just be like,

134
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:42.090
sophie conley: A slave to my lead. You know, like constantly like feeling like I have to go back and smoke and like, yeah, clear my head, I guess. Get away, and I will also be smoking it with tobacco. So that made it like even more addictive. I think

135
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, of course.

136
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.340
sophie conley: Yeah.

137
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. Do you smoke cigarettes right now. Any nicotine.

138
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.710
sophie conley: I don't smoke cigarettes, but I use like the pens.

139
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Of it. Okay.

140
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:55.140
So,

141
00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:08.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, they've been so beeping. I mean, obviously better than tobacco in a lot of ways, but in another sense. I'm sure you've heard of the recent like pneumonias and things that are popping up. Have you heard about that.

142
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:18.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's it's it's not, it's still like the stuff that you're vaporizing into your lungs is still a chemical

143
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:34.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, and they're there might be cancer causing agents in there. You know, so it's still something that we can work on later if you don't feel like that's something you want to focus on right now, but it would be great if we can get you off of that as well.

144
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:41.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, we can utilize like nicotine gum or nicotine candies, if you want.

145
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:42.990
sophie conley: Okay.

146
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's something to think about. Okay.

147
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:48.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: So,

148
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Anything.

149
00:13:53.580 --> 00:14:04.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Any incidents occur. That means you kind of recognize that this is coming this cocaine thing is coming too far. Like something happen, are you

150
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:19.740
sophie conley: Um, no not not like anything physical or emotionally like big that happens that made me want to stop just like my friends expressing their concern and

151
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Your friends said something

152
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.860
Yeah.

153
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.720
sophie conley: They definitely like encouraged me to reach out for help.

154
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:42.480
sophie conley: And then I my mom like had a suspicion that I was using. And I just recently told both my pants.

155
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.490
sophie conley: About it.

156
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good, yeah.

157
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm glad I'm sure that wasn't easy, but

158
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's good to be open with family, you know. Yeah.

159
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:54.630
Yeah.

160
00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: good times and bad times.

161
00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:10.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: So okay, so you're open with them and then you you've been seeing this therapist for three years. But you maybe weren't really being forthright about this stuff until recently. All right.

162
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.610
sophie conley: Um,

163
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or did she kind of know

164
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.270
sophie conley: I think she kind of knew

165
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:22.920
sophie conley: But thought that like she wouldn't be enough help to, like, help me get through it or like

166
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:23.820
Mm hmm.

167
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.440
sophie conley: Like problem solver around cravings and stuff like that.

168
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.850
sophie conley: But I just like chose not to really like

169
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.160
sophie conley: Take

170
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.190
sophie conley: Everything so seriously, I guess.

171
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:46.830
sophie conley: God, or I would like try and it just like I my cravings were too strong, and like I couldn't hold out any longer.

172
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good. Okay.

173
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you have allergies to miss any medications.

174
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you have any surgeries. Have you had any surgeries.

175
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Some surgeries. What about like

176
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:15.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thoughts of harming yourself like suicidal thoughts history of that or are we, is there something we should worry about right now.

177
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:23.820
sophie conley: Um, as of right now, it's, I don't really have like any suicidal ideation.

178
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:30.150
sophie conley: But when I was like in high school when I was drinking a lot. I definitely like

179
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.900
sophie conley: I'm pretty sure I caught myself and like

180
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:46.230
sophie conley: Wanted. Yeah, just like wanted to die all the time, but I'm kind of one away when I drink less and then

181
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:58.980
sophie conley: Using like cocaine has made my suicidal ideation higher, but like after after I'm like recovered from the whole thing.

182
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:07.770
sophie conley: Or like after I'm like not high anymore and not coming down. I feel like way happier way better.

183
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. But yeah, the cocaine does stirred things up.

184
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.380
sophie conley: Yeah.

185
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then, okay, similar to the alcohol.

186
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, how in you were, you were kind of you said you were cutting yourself in high school.

187
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.730
sophie conley: Not like

188
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.330
sophie conley: Tommy Dreamer yeah yeah I'm nothing like

189
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's just like for pain like feeling

190
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.450
sophie conley: Yeah, yeah. And it wasn't very often.

191
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Did you ever, like, have an attempt like took stuff or

192
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Very deeply or

193
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.110
No.

194
00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:56.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so, so I would say we're probably I mean at moderate risk if we're like mild, moderate, severe

195
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: As possible like suicide.

196
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just because you're saying when you do use it does come up, you know, the thoughts.

197
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:27.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: But you don't have a plan. You don't know. Okay. Um, okay. So let's talk about what's going like the US, like, what, what is the latest like in the last week or when did you first tell your parents. And have you been cutting down like what has been going on with that.

198
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:28.470
Um,

199
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:39.690
sophie conley: Ever since the whole coven standing in I've used, I think, like, three times maybe

200
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.200
sophie conley: And then the last time I used was

201
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.030
sophie conley: Last Thursday.

202
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:51.900
sophie conley: Okay. And I just told my parents start your day night about it.

203
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:53.400
Okay.

204
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Got it. So,

205
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Thursday was the 30th of April.

206
00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.020
sophie conley: Yes. Okay.

207
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.160

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:24.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: On the second of May. Okay, gotcha. Okay. So this all recent but you will in since March. So in the month of March, and all of April, total that third time was the end of April for 30

209
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:25.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah.

210
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.080
sophie conley: And I would say I was like

211
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:36.810
sophie conley: Not using as much as a not using as much or as often as I was like before the coven but yeah

212
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, gotcha. Why is that, is it because you used to go out or

213
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:50.940
sophie conley: Yeah, I would just be out more and like at work and busy, but not many parents. I need to know where I'm going and

214
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:52.500
sophie conley: They know

215
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.740
sophie conley: I don't really have like a place that I need to go right now.

216
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:56.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right.

217
00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.870
sophie conley: This is harder to

218
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: For you to be like, Okay, I'm not here. Yeah.

219
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:00.750
sophie conley: Yeah.

220
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: So opportunities have been less

221
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.320
Yeah.

222
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and

223
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, between seven last and then April 30 so

224
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:29.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: So what did your. How was the discussion with your parents on Saturday night. What did they say anything like we need you to go into treatment or like what happened. Did they say

225
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.420
Anything on

226
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:44.610
sophie conley: They didn't say a whole lot I we didn't have like a super long conversation about it, but my mom was not surprised. And I just told her. I'm like, going to get help.

227
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

228
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:58.230
sophie conley: And I was that I was going to ask my therapist about like a program or some outside help with addiction and

229
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.760
sophie conley: My dad didn't take it like as well. He

230
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.540
sophie conley: Was just like upset that

231
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:14.580
sophie conley: I had the money to spend on it and thinks that like I don't actually want to stop.

232
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.630
sophie conley: And they asked how long I had been using

233
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.350
sophie conley: Hey, I told them like around a year.

234
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I mean in terms of money. It was the money you were making right i mean

235
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.690
sophie conley: At this year. Yeah.

236
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, um,

237
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see. So your dad was a little more upset.

238
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:42.300
Yeah.

239
00:21:44.760 --> 00:22:06.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Um, what do I want to ask you, in general, do you have physically like a review of systems like you're breathing, your heart, your stomach like digestion and stuff. Do you have any issues do you get headaches regularly do have breathing problems or

240
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:18.030
sophie conley: No, I'm pretty healthy, I would just say I had an eating disorder. A couple years ago, and I'm still like recovering from that.

241
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:31.110
sophie conley: But when I went into the hospital for it. They said that I had like a slow heart rate or something like my heart wasn't doing well, but I'm pretty sure

242
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:37.920
sophie conley: Like since I've gotten better, it's gotten better. So I don't think there's any concern.

243
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:50.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so three years ago you were diagnosed with depression, anxiety, when were you diagnosed with the eating disorder, or was it going on for a long time and you weren't diagnosed or what

244
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.510
Um,

245
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.330
sophie conley: I think it like got pretty serious around the time that I was diagnosed with my anxiety and depression.

246
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.020
sophie conley: Like shortly after that I

247
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.250
sophie conley: Was sent home from school to get treatment.

248
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, where you're in college.

249
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, okay.

250
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:19.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: So tell me about the eating disorder, a bit like was that for you, restricting

251
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.030
sophie conley: And then, yeah, then

252
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Purging or

253
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.300
sophie conley: Just anorexia.

254
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so like not eating.

255
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.030
Yeah.

256
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.820
sophie conley: And I guess like throughout high school I had been like

257
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.170
sophie conley: I don't know how you would say like

258
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:51.720
sophie conley: Just very like careful of what I'm eating and, like, making sure I work out and like just being sort of restrictive and then it got

259
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.180
sophie conley: Like a lot more serious when I went away to college.

260
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:06.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: And they sent you home. So was there. Did you collapse or something. Did you

261
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.820
sophie conley: Know I had just

262
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:19.650
sophie conley: I like met with this therapists and at the school and told her what was going on and she

263
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:29.280
sophie conley: She escalated. She, she just like recommended that I like drop out and go home and get some like

264
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:37.920
sophie conley: Treatment and then I went home. I didn't get treatment right away and I had like

265
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:56.340
sophie conley: A doctor's appointment one like a few months, or a month after I got back and like through there, they found out that my weight had dropped a lot and I had to go to this clinic and they told me that like I was going to collapse if I didn't go into

266
00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.490
sophie conley: The hospital.

267
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:07.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and you were in the hospital and then they kind of read. Did they do like a rehab type thing where they helped you eat more and

268
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.000
I'm

269
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.880
sophie conley: Kind of, yeah, it was. Yeah, I guess it was like required that I eat.

270
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:23.640
sophie conley: The meals that they gave me. And if I can finish it, they, they would give me like a protein shake or whatever. Yeah.

271
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.920
sophie conley: And that lasted for like a little over a week.

272
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.450
sophie conley: Okay, and then I got out and did like an outpatient program.

273
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, yeah.

274
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:40.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: I was that, did you did you like the program was this any of this helpful or

275
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.430
sophie conley: Yeah, I actually liked the program and it was helpful.

276
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.200
sophie conley: Um, I definitely like grew a lot there. So,

277
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.180
sophie conley: It was nice.

278
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:57.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: To do that. So you did that and then did you go back to school or did you not do that.

279
00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:13.050
sophie conley: I went back to work, or I had been working when I first came home from college. And then I went into the hospital. So I quit. And then I got another job when I got out of the hospital God

280
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.430
Okay.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.460
sophie conley: I'm thinking I eventually want to go back to school.

288
00:26:53.280 --> 00:27:00.420
sophie conley: And I might just start working part time and start doing a little bit of like classes.

289
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Mm hmm. But

290
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:07.950
sophie conley: I haven't really made any, like, Sure. Positive decisions that I wanted. What I want to do.

291
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:14.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Were used more you in like a major something like did you have like a track you were studying

292
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:26.040
sophie conley: Yeah I when I went away to college, I was studying nutrition and then that kind of, I think that like really kick started my eating disorder.

293
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:36.240
sophie conley: So, and then I like when I dropped out. I feel like I can't really go back to that.

294
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:37.800
sophie conley: Yeah.

295
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.610
sophie conley: Yeah, I just don't want to like set myself up for that.

296
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:52.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, if you have that gut feeling. I mean, it could go either way people have, you know, done the op, you know, gone for that because they

297
00:27:53.160 --> 00:28:03.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Did and blah, blah, blah. But if you have a gut feeling like I don't feel like I want to be exposed to this material all the time because it kind of goes into

298
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:09.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: My own hands, then or triggers you in some ways, then you trust that because

299
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Why, why, nobody's making a do that field. You don't have to

300
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.590
sophie conley: Write, you know,

301
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:25.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I think that's probably wise to stay away from that field since that kind of made things wrap things up in a bad way. Yeah.

302
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

303
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so in terms of restricting and eating. How have you since you

304
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:39.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Finished the outpatient program. I guess it's been a few years, a year and a half or so.

305
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.440
sophie conley: Yeah, it's been around like a year and a half.

306
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.970
sophie conley: I feel like pretty recovered and good

307
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.190
sophie conley: Okay, um,

308
00:28:52.710 --> 00:29:04.770
sophie conley: Yeah, I guess, like my eating is all good. Just like my the way I view myself isn't like great like I don't have very high confidence at all or

309
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: Mm hmm.

310
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.320
sophie conley: I still like think about my body and like

311
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.000
sophie conley: Ways that are unhelpful, I guess.

312
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:16.320
I see.

313
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.790
sophie conley: But

314
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:24.180
sophie conley: I feel like 100% or not 100 but like 98% better

315
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:39.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: In terms of your eating habits and restricting and not doing okay. Good. I'm glad I mean the mental stuff though the body image and like confidence stuff, that stuff that that's important because those are

316
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:46.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Some, some of the underlying drivers of those of the eating disorder. Right.

317
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:53.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and can also be underlying issues that drive addictions.

318
00:29:53.640 --> 00:30:00.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, and you wanting to just check out or whatever clear your head, you know, it could be, it could be and

319
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:13.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's in your best interest to kind of try to work on that on self confidence and image, you know, self in audio image.

320
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:25.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. OK. So those. So you have a therapist. You've been working with a therapist, but in bright heart. So in our program. We actually assign you to a therapist as well.

321
00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:39.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you have an option. It's not here's what I think. I don't think it's a good idea to have multiple therapists that you're with at the same time.

322
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:48.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I would say, One option is to pause, you've been with her for three years. I'm assuming it's a she.

323
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.830
sophie conley: Yeah, okay.

324
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:59.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you pause. Maybe you pause your, your care with her and say, Okay, thanks for the referral. I'm going to do their program, which includes like talk therapy.

325
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then start something here with a new therapist.

326
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:08.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: And see how that goes. And you start with like fresh eyes and you say,

327
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:19.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, these are the things that I think I would like to focus on obviously addiction being the most prominent thing but underneath the umbrella of addiction is all the drivers and so maybe

328
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Confidence can come up there if that's something you didn't really focus on before. I don't know.

329
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:30.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, but it could be a good, fresh start for you to just explore, see what that is, you know,

330
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.370
sophie conley: Okay, that sounds good.

331
00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that's the wisest thing to do.

332
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: The other often is

333
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:43.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: You start that, and you're like, You know what, I think I was doing like more I was making more progress with my old therapist.

334
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:54.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I'll do the medication or the like, I don't know the group therapy piece with you guys, but I'll do the individual with her. I still think though if you're going to do this program just do the whole thing.

335
00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:04.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, do the individual and the groups together with us. And then we'll see, you know, give it a little bit and then you can decide what how you want to move forward.

336
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.630
sophie conley: Gotcha. Okay.

337
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that's that. So,

338
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:18.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you'll work with an individual therapist and that could be weekly that could be every other week. It depends on

339
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:28.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: what your needs are when they do that first visit with you. They do what's called a bio psychosocial assessment and they kind of go through your psychiatric history and

340
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.430
sophie conley: Decide you

341
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you will do that. So you'll do individual therapy.

342
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:44.520
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then the groups, like I said, it will be with me and our therapists, it may be the same therapist, you're assigned to depending on what day we decide to come

343
00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:50.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yeah, so that's kind of how it will work. Now, in terms of medications.

344
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:57.840
Dr. Belis Aladag: I will defer to your psychiatry is to continue, you know, the flocks of teen and the lens opinion been on that.

345
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:05.280
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, and so adjustments need to be made. You can you are in touch with that person that's like I do.

346
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:14.760
Dr. Belis Aladag: You can do that and you know cocaine and stimulant addictions respond

347
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:22.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: They respond to like contingent what we call contingency management, which is like

348
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:32.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: rewarding yourself for good behavior. And then, you know, withholding when you're not doing so well, kind of thing not punching but so

349
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:43.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: So like, so think of a reward system for yourself that you can do like if you're doing well. Let's say we set a goal for you and you're like, my goal is not to have to use cocaine.

350
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:49.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: Ever again or definitely not in the next month, you know, we could set little goals.

351
00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:57.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: And meet those goals like every week that you don't or something, you can have a little reward system for yourself. That's a healthy reward you know

352
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:07.320
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, it could be nominal. It doesn't have to be a lot. It could be like, Okay, I'm going to put $10 towards like something that I'm going to splurge on later, you know, if I

353
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:18.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do it, you know, or suddenly something very, but I would recommend that you think of that reward system and just set it in place already for those maybe every day or every week that you have that you stay away.

354
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.700
sophie conley: Okay, that's a good idea.

355
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, just, just do that.

356
00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:28.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then with us will be testing you. So once a month you'll get a random

357
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:42.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: drug test that comes in the mail, you don't open it. Don't open the envelope. Just call us first call the virtual clinic and then they watch you open the envelope you go to the bathroom. Take care of your stuff and then you show them what it looks like.

358
00:34:43.800 --> 00:35:01.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's a drug test like a, you know, on the spot drug test that will keep you hopefully like on your toes, because you're like, well, someone's monitoring me i'm i'm being being monitored and so that should help you feel like, okay, like I'm in a program. I'm doing this.

359
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:15.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that will help you. And then, like I said, you'll be doing individual therapy focusing on what are the drivers behind this. Why am I doing this in the first place. How can I combat whatever it is that's steering me in this direction.

360
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:21.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: First without call them with marijuana. Now with this like what's going on that's bringing me to this point.

361
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:31.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: Right and really exploring those things and then using the groups to see that you're not alone. The groups are. I have a lot of people

362
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:37.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: There's different substances, but I would say a lot of them are addicted to opioids.

363
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:52.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you'll see some opioid users some alcohol use this and that. But the point is, everybody has the same thing in common, of like wanting to just escape or like being drawn to this substance that just takes them out of whatever it is that they're not liking.

364
00:35:53.580 --> 00:36:05.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so knowing that there's other people with similar coming from all walks of life with similar kind of thought processes and tendencies. If it's, there's something really helpful about

365
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Just that

366
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:17.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then it's nice because people can use get to know people a little bit you can chime in if you want to, like, if someone's having a bad day and you want to say something or you know whatever

367
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:24.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: people interact and it's kind of nice. Those are the moments that are like that's the magic of the group is like just

368
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Slip

369
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: People start supporting each other.

370
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.090
sophie conley: Yeah, I like it. Yeah.

371
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good. So you're not you're not unfamiliar with with that kind of process.

372
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I'm

373
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:47.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, I think I got everything that I need any legal trouble any D wise or

374
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.510
sophie conley: No. Luckily, no. Okay.

375
00:36:54.330 --> 00:37:02.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then is there anything that we didn't cover that we should they we you know that you want to mention or

376
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: That you do you have any questions about anything.

377
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.430
sophie conley: Um, I

378
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.950
sophie conley: Think we covered everything. I have a question about like

379
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.860
sophie conley: So that has this always been an online program or

380
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.350
sophie conley: Like an office that

381
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:37.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, good question. Um, because of the coven everybody's founded shifting. But interestingly, bright heart health was created as a tele health service. So there is no like building

382
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:53.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: And the doctors we work from different parts of the country. So from California, you know, you're licensed if I'm licensed in California, which I am I will see patients that are registered for in the state of California. But then there's we have doctors that work in different states.

383
00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:03.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yes, it's interesting. I used to work at Kaiser Permanente in the addiction clinic in Los Angeles. I live in Los Angeles.

384
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:12.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so I you know that's what I'm used to. And I, we didn't tell a health. So some of my patients once in a while for follow up. I'd see them through video or phone

385
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:21.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I never did full time just Tele health. And so this is a newer thing for me as of a couple months ago. So I'm your program to

386
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:22.740
sophie conley: Cool.

387
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: But it's been it's been fun. It's interesting. It's a different vibe. Yeah.

388
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:36.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yeah, so that's that. And then, oh there's blood tests that they want you to do.

389
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now, do you have a quest lab near you.

390
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:40.950
sophie conley: I do. Yeah.

391
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:46.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, good. So you can do that. They it's a urine test and a blood test, I believe.

392
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:50.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so you can get that at some point.

393
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Any other, any other thoughts.

394
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.060
sophie conley: No.

395
00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I would say

396
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:08.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: In terms of sobriety. Let's clarify that before we, you know, and things

397
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:14.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: What, what do you think is your goal. What is a realistic goal. Like, what do you want

398
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.260
sophie conley: What would you ideally like to do

399
00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:22.380
sophie conley: Um I deeley, I would like to be 100% sober.

400
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.600
sophie conley: Mm hmm. Um,

401
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.100
sophie conley: Yeah, I'm not sure. Like how

402
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: From cocaine marijuana

403
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.900
sophie conley: Yeah, from everything

404
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.460
sophie conley: But I thought

405
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:36.930
I like that, yeah.

406
00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think that's a good goal. I think that's the smartest goal right now, you know,

407
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: And so to attain that goal.

408
00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:59.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do you need to take certain measures that you haven't yet, for example. Is there alcohol in the house that really shouldn't be there because it's tempting for you.

409
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.040
sophie conley: Um,

410
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:18.630
sophie conley: It is tempting, but it's not mine. So, I mean, I do sometimes take it, but I feel like pretty okay about it being in the house. Like, it's not really

411
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:26.070
sophie conley: I don't like pass by it every day or anything like that but like my parents will have drinks like yeah

412
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.510
sophie conley: My dad will have a drink, probably every other night or something like that. So,

413
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. So there is that. I mean, you're

414
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:39.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: So for now, you're saying it seems OK and manageable.

415
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: The moving forward. We'll see. Like if it becomes problematic, you start

416
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:50.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: Because you're seeing your dad drink or because you know it's in the house or something. If it starts becoming a problem.

417
00:40:51.600 --> 00:41:03.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: For you in your sobriety, then we can have a different approach like maybe we need to talk to your parents about like, Hey. Do you guys mind or whatever. We'll just figure it out. But for now, you're saying that's not necessary.

418
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.590
sophie conley: Yeah, I feel, I feel like pretty in control. Okay.

419
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: With that, with the alcohol, marijuana. Do have any marijuana do

420
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.250
sophie conley: I don't have any

421
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.340
sophie conley: And yeah, I don't have any

422
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:27.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Over. Okay, so that's that. And then the cocaine. Do you have any. And do you have very, what is your access to that and how can we make it harder for you.

423
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:35.190
sophie conley: To act. Um, I don't have any and my mom.

424
00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:46.440
sophie conley: Is not really letting me take the car anywhere anymore. Ever since I told her. Okay, so I can't go drive and pick it up.

425
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.030
Gotcha.

426
00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gotcha. Okay, so, so you're restricted, you're just restricted.

427
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, okay.

428
00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you feel pretty safe about all those things.

429
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:10.470
sophie conley: Um, yeah, yeah. I mean, if I like or to drive somewhere. I definitely be really tempted to go pick up but

430
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:31.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so as long as your ability to drive is hindered or controlled you feel safe when like staying sober. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay, so we're going to move forward like as time goes on. We're going to because you're going to eventually need to use your car and go, please. You know what

431
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:32.430
sophie conley: Yeah.

432
00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:39.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: To live your life and then feel secure that you can do that and just be in control and not do things. You don't want to be doing.

433
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:55.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: So as we progress as time goes on. We'll work on that, like, okay, how, what's going on with your mom and when do you think you're ready to start taking the car here and there. Where would you take it. What would you, what would your own rules be

434
00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:09.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: And I think your one on one therapist is going to be key for this for your program because these are the kinds of details, you want to go into with with the individual therapist to be like

435
00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:19.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: What is my plan. So this week, not driving, am I going to start asking to be able to drive. Well, how do I feel about that one, you know,

436
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.190
sophie conley: Yeah yeah

437
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:35.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: Really get into the nitty gritty of that as well as, like, what's driving this stuff, this behavior. This compulsion. So the why of it and also the practical, like, Okay, what do I do now. Like, literally, this week kind of thing.

438
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now, those two should be managed by the therapist.

439
00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: So when you enter the

440
00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:42.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: therapy session.

441
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:58.410
