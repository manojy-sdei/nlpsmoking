Jocelyn Corrales: That's good.

93
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:31.860
Windy Borjas: But I've, I've always thought, you know, like with kids. I mean, I don't know, my parents fight over them and take them away from the other side of their family like

94
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.180
Windy Borjas: The more people to love them, the better.

95
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:44.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I think that's true. I think that's true why would you take them away from you know other people when you know

96
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:45.990
Windy Borjas: You know,

97
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.210

98
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.100
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like to be very

99
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.410
Jocelyn Corrales: It's going to be very traumatic for the child. If you're going to, you know, remove her from the environment where she grew up.

100
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:56.550
Yeah.

101
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.840
Windy Borjas: I wouldn't want her to like like get scared.

102
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.950
Windy Borjas: Yeah, she has this sense of home out here. If I were them.

103
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:14.190
Windy Borjas: In fact Espanola she's not only will she not have her grandparents and their sisters, but she's also being an unknown. You know, I mean, I'm for

104
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.300
Windy Borjas: Me, please.

105
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:21.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. UNKNOWN community and she's going to adjust. Again, it's going to be she's going to get anxious leader on

106
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.450
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's like, is it really the best place for me. I mean, I left.

107
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.920
Windy Borjas: As vanilla to get clean and be off the heroin so

108
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.050
Windy Borjas: That's why I just figured it was just best for us. Yeah.

109
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:43.800
Jocelyn Corrales: I think that's a good ATL so that you see out there you know you're away from temptations and, you know,

110
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.550
Windy Borjas: Yeah, I mean temptation is everywhere. When you're in

111
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.090

112
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:57.000
Windy Borjas: Got it. I mean, it don't matter where you go and drugs are always there. But I've been contemplating moving out to clay in

113
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.020
Windy Borjas: Or wherever my fiance ends up getting

114
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.900
Windy Borjas: House. Next, I don't know if they're

115
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.410
Windy Borjas: Moving

116
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.110

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.960
Windy Borjas: Wherever he ends up getting put I've been debating on moving. They're all of us actually not just me and my

118
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.940
Windy Borjas: Daughter is grandparents as well.

119
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.860
Jocelyn Corrales: As a group, you could

120
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:27.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Do that. Yeah, instead of doing it, you know, just by yourself and your daughter. Maybe you could do it if if their grandparents are also planning to move, you know,

121
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.980
Windy Borjas: That's the ideal situation. If not,

122
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.600
Windy Borjas: Then I would go by myself.

123
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.930
Windy Borjas: For don't get established and then take my daughter.

124
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.180

Windy Borjas: I've, I've used that a lot like not just do out my diction, but through life.

130
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:27.720
Windy Borjas: When I feel like I'm like going to get an anxiety attack or I'm just upset or whatever it may be.

131
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.970
Windy Borjas: A drive and music has always been my thing.

Windy Borjas: Yeah, I have. It's never

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're not used to being stuck at home at all the time. All the time.

144
00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:02.370
Windy Borjas: I mean it's it's been hard. It's a struggle. It also has been a blessing because the time with my daughter is

145
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.770
Windy Borjas: Is priceless.

146
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:11.430
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good to hear. So do you like a also like painting or drawing

147
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Drawing or a craft.

148
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:20.700
Windy Borjas: Always love crafts drawing is something I've always took two more though. Just because

149
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.970
Windy Borjas: It's, it's always been easiest for me to keep her notebook and a pen.

150
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:38.820
Windy Borjas: As far as the craft, I guess I've just never really like taken the time to do it. I'm more of the type of person that likes to go to the store and buy all the stuff

151
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.280
Windy Borjas: Or get online and just look at all kinds of things that I could do

152
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:45.540
Jocelyn Corrales: And then I do

153
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.430
Windy Borjas: I don't have the time to do it, I guess, or I never did before. Now, I guess that

154
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.660
Could be. So, yes.

155
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.960
Jocelyn Corrales: That could be something you could do like showing and crafts, you know,

156
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.280
Windy Borjas: It's also good thing to like with my daughter.

157
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.330
She's threes.

158
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, it's

159
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:22.230
Jocelyn Corrales: It's a good thing to get your daughter involved with graphs. Also, you know, just the basic graphs, you know, just cutting and pasting, you know, and let her identify, you know, why not do you know she's since she's three years old already why. Let's do some things like

160
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:36.870
Jocelyn Corrales: In your own way for her to be able to identify the different kinds of shapes the different kinds of colors and you do it by hand. So it's like doing a craft for yourself but you're also doing something educational for your daughter.

161
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.350
Windy Borjas: Yeah, I think I would. Yeah.

162
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:52.050
Jocelyn Corrales: He tried to do some yeah you get you because you mentioned you like drawing you could do you know you could do some, you know, you could do it just like your own craft, like, you know, there are many DIY so you know

163
00:15:52.500 --> 00:16:13.860
Jocelyn Corrales: That you could use or that you could do that. Is that could also be useful for a toddler, like for example you've tried to make shapes like different types of shapes like triangles bars and you know you make those stars decorated as well. And you could do a matching matching shapes.

164
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:38.370
Jocelyn Corrales: And yes, and you could do, you know, you'd mentioned you love crafts. One way of, you know, letting the kids know about the letters is also, you know, have you tried trying to sue letters, you know, it's like a club that is formed letter A, B or alphabets, they would look cute.

165
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.720
Windy Borjas: That'd be cool.

166
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.830
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

167
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:49.230
Jocelyn Corrales: Joy that yeah and it's also a fun thing for you to do because you know I me. I also love doing crafts and always wanted to do that one.

168
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.210
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, the letter crafts.

169
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.220
Windy Borjas: Yeah, that'd be I might. I might go grab some stuff to do that with her.

170
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:09.360
Jocelyn Corrales: And, you know, once you're able to finish that craft you know let her play with it and you let her, you know, identify teacher at the same time. This is letter E, or you know what he sees the color red, you know,

171
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:16.740
Jocelyn Corrales: Color for make it colorful so that she could also aside from, you know, from learning the letter she could also learn that

172
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Too. Yes.

173
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, and would be good. So your mental health. You mentioned that

174
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:34.080
Jocelyn Corrales: You're having a problem right now because you're, you know, you're alone and you're alone with your daughter, because your husband is you know incarcerated.

175
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:44.820
Jocelyn Corrales: How do you manage it. How do you, how do you manage the stress and how do you accept the challenge that you are going through right now.

176
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.290
Windy Borjas: I'm accepting it is a little

177
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:58.170
Windy Borjas: Bit a battle for me. I guess I'm dealing with it. I'd have to say marijuana

178
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:00.840
Windy Borjas: Um,

179
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:10.770
Windy Borjas: I've been trying to get my medical license, just because it's something that's helped me since

180
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.860
Windy Borjas: Far before my addiction started

181
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.580
Windy Borjas: I've always had real real bad anxiety.

182
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.720
Windy Borjas: Since I since I was a young maybe about I think I remember

183
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.680
Windy Borjas: Being about seven

184
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.880
Windy Borjas: When I was diagnosed with it.

185
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.470
Windy Borjas: And I would get, like, the worst panic attacks.

186
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.650
Windy Borjas: Awful and

187
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:42.990
Windy Borjas: You know I

188
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.870
Windy Borjas: Ran into marijuana and

189
00:18:46.980 --> 00:19:01.920
Windy Borjas: At first it was just something I mean I was young. Good. I mean, just to try it. It actually ended up being something that helps me. I've used it since. And as I got older, I developed like the depression.

190
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.330
Windy Borjas: I've been told bipolar disorder.

191
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.210
Windy Borjas: And the marijuana just helps me, you know,

192
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.520
Windy Borjas: I guess.

193
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.040
Windy Borjas: Be more centered

194
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.260
Windy Borjas: And at ease.

195
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:38.400
Windy Borjas: Because without it. I'm just agitated and frustrated. I just don't like to be around anybody. I mean, with the exception of my daughter, my daughter is like the only person that I can deal with and have around me at any level.

196
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.610
Jocelyn Corrales: I think you're muted.

197
00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:03.180

292
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.190
Windy Borjas: A History of this repetitive.

293
00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.340
Windy Borjas: You know cycle.

294
00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:08.310
Windy Borjas: You know we retract back to one another, things go. Good. And then something always happens. I mean, in the

295
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Past.

296
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:19.740
Windy Borjas: Then a relapse for me or relapse for him or we both relapse other and then we end up fighting arguing and then just back in the same, same thing.

Windy Borjas: Yeah, we just kind of, you know,

299
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:32.670

300
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.600
Over the fans.

301
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:36.810

308
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.330
Windy Borjas: Yeah, this is the first time I've ever been on my own.

309
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Like

310
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:59.790
Windy Borjas: I was with you know I've all i guess 5050 in a way because like I would always have my parents to go back to

311
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:06.300
Windy Borjas: I still do I know if I lost everything. And I had nowhere to go. Me and my daughter could go there.

312
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.960
Windy Borjas: You know, but I wouldn't choose to go there. I'm not good.

313
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:16.170
Windy Borjas: So, you know, like I got sick last November.

314
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.240
Windy Borjas: Very sick. Like I it wasn't the flu.

315
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.890
Windy Borjas: They're saying it could have been coven 19 since then.

316
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.440
Windy Borjas: I don't know what it was, but I know that I was

317
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.820
Windy Borjas: Serving wine that I couldn't even get up to go to the bathroom.

318
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.830
Windy Borjas: I couldn't make nothing to eat. And I remember thinking, I want my mom.

319
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.610
Windy Borjas: This sucks. My husband's gone

320
00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:45.960
Windy Borjas: I mean, I went from having my parents to always having my husband.

321
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.300
Jocelyn Corrales: He did everything

322
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:57.090
Windy Borjas: Like everything to to down to my schedule. If I had an appointment, he would tell me that morning he would wake me up.

323
00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.430
Windy Borjas: You know, I mean, he was always

324
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:06.450
Windy Borjas: always there to to do all that for me. So when he left. And they took him away.

325
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.720
Windy Borjas: That's when I had my last relapse.

326
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

327
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:22.680
Windy Borjas: Since then he he's been in and out. So I had no choice but to, you know, learn how to how to live in adult life.

328
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and

329
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.250
Windy Borjas: My daughter, cuz I've never had.

330
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.480
Windy Borjas: You know, I have nieces and nephews that look up to me, but not like my daughter.

331
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:36.060
Windy Borjas: It's, it's amazing to me like I just watch how she's growing up and

332
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.320
Windy Borjas: I trip out because I'm like I created that little wife.

333
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.290
Windy Borjas: And yes, she's just she's so awesome. So

334
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.650
Windy Borjas: I don't want any seeing that

335
00:31:50.100 --> 00:32:05.400
Windy Borjas: You know she ends up ashamed of or or disappointed in one day when she's there. I don't want, I don't want to have to experience what that feels like. Because I i've been in that position and

336
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.030
Windy Borjas: Been embarrassed of my mom and disappointed in my mom.

337
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:09.930
A

344
00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:43.410
Windy Borjas: I just, I feel like every parent, you know, now with this our new generation. I mean, I feel like I was the last of the old generation.

345
00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:51.060
Windy Borjas: My year was united mean the last year's that parents fucking disciplined us and

346
00:32:51.450 --> 00:33:07.890
Windy Borjas: You know, raised us with respect and morality, just being human. These kids nowadays are just so so wrapped up in technology and just the wrong things like yeah

347
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.120
Windy Borjas: I don't want my daughter.

348
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:20.280
Windy Borjas: To have to go down the path I did and have it 10 times worse because that's what I see our future holds. You know what I mean. If anybody didn't start

349
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:27.690
Windy Borjas: Pumping the brakes and I just want my daughter to to be independent and

350
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:33.120
Windy Borjas: A strong woman that doesn't have to be dependent on any of these

351
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.700
Windy Borjas: These intelligent, guys.

352
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:41.670
Jocelyn Corrales: That's true, that's true so windy, are you currently working

353
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:54.180
Windy Borjas: No, I was in the process of job search when all this happened and now it seems like everywhere in Bloomfield is saying they're on a hiring hold

354
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:55.410
Yeah.

355
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:57.480
Windy Borjas: Hold

356
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.530

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.710
Jocelyn Corrales: I know, because the current situation.

358
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:07.110
Jocelyn Corrales: And I understand it, but the are in the process of job searching. Yeah.

359
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.920
Windy Borjas: I've, I haven't been successful yet. I kind of

360
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:15.150
Windy Borjas: I guess veered from that that path.

361
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.890
Windy Borjas: I've gotten lazy. Just because we've had to be at home and

362
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.750
Windy Borjas: When, when I have to like stay

363
00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:30.780
Windy Borjas: Where it is. It doesn't have to be here. I could be at my grandparents or my mom's

364
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:39.450
Windy Borjas: Wherever. I'm at if I'm in one place for too long. I just end up falling into this like slump, I guess.

365
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:47.880
Windy Borjas: And that's when my depression starts to bother me. So then I end up just like stuck in a depression mold.

366
00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:52.770
Windy Borjas: It, you know, I feel like a prisoner in my own mind sometimes.

367
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:55.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm.

368
00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:01.470
Jocelyn Corrales: And are you do you, how are you able to manage your bills.

369
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Are you on a

370
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:05.910
Do

371
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:19.890
Windy Borjas: What I had been using was because my husband got approved for SSI, a long time ago and it was way before he, you know, ended up getting picking up a case and

372
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:25.470
Windy Borjas: And all that. So I was very fortunate because right when they

373
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:37.770
Windy Borjas: picked him up and myself, I should say. And you know, I mean, I was able to detox and get a clear mindset. Then we got a little bit of the back pain.

374
00:35:38.550 --> 00:36:00.600
Windy Borjas: So, you know, instead of it going to partying and drugs and pointless. Shit, I was able to, you know, use that for as long as I could, I mean, my parents have always financially supported me. I mean, it sucks to say that book.

375
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.420
Windy Borjas: I guess you could say, I'm

376
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.910
Windy Borjas: A freelancer

377
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.150
Windy Borjas: I mean, clean

378
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:21.990
Windy Borjas: Have a friend that owns our works at manages the motel here in Bloomfield, so you know if I need money for something. I usually just go clean some rooms.

379
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.350
Windy Borjas: I don't have like a set job but

380
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.700
Windy Borjas: You know, I have a few

381
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.540
Jocelyn Corrales: You still earning

382
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.370
Windy Borjas: Yeah, I feel

383
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:34.830
Windy Borjas: Good. I just, I still work, but just nothing taxable.

384
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:44.670
Windy Borjas: My grandmother helps me a lot. Show. Let me do like cleaning and stuff for her, or if I need money. So I usually just do that, you know, like

385
00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:49.170
Windy Borjas: Whenever I get a chance and I save up any little

386
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Money, I

387
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.030
Windy Borjas: Get I get a tribal checks twice a year. So

388
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.340
Windy Borjas: I mean, I'm not rich, but we're comfortable and we have what we need.

389
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:22.200
Windy Borjas: And that's, that's all I've ever wanted to achieve. I mean, I never really had any like big goals. You know what I mean, just because I just fell into a different lifestyle so early. I didn't really have. I didn't give myself the opportunity. I had the grades. I graduated high school

390
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:33.840
Windy Borjas: Honors. I mean I had it all cut out for me. I just went a different route because I fell into the drugs and all that. Okay.

391
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.690
Windy Borjas: I'd still stay I i've been successful at what

392
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.760
Windy Borjas: The idea. My parents painted for me of a

393
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:55.650
Windy Borjas: Successful adult life was I mean I've success. I've been successful at that, even without college and all that. You know what I mean. But I also have

394
00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:11.940
Windy Borjas: Raped. You know what I mean, the negative impact of not doing it the right way. Yeah, because drugs and all that only leads to two places in jail or dead.

395
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, or depression.

396
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:15.600
Jocelyn Corrales: My depression.

397
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.560
Windy Borjas: Yep.

398
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:24.810
Jocelyn Corrales: So, you, you mentioned that you do works, you know, simple tasks like cleaning room so you are able to

399
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.070
Windy Borjas: In the beginning when we were talking about my day to day. I'm sorry.

400
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:37.980
Windy Borjas: I wasn't even thinking about like when you asked me if I have a job I

401
00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:39.480
Windy Borjas: Just say no because

402
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:45.270
Windy Borjas: Everybody I run into or come across that I have discussed it when that's not a job.

403
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.280
Jocelyn Corrales: But you're still earning your money.

404
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:56.460
Jocelyn Corrales: And yeah, so you do manage your own finances and pay for your own bills.

405
00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:00.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and I think it's good that even if you're not

406
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:15.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Really working on a, you know, on a regular basis, but it's at least you're still earning something you know by cleaning rooms or doing something, you know, maybe you could also do some craft. If you're very good at craft. You could also sell some of your stuff that you're doing.

407
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.960
Windy Borjas: I usually do that like with like food.

408
00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.230
Windy Borjas: Like make like cookies or cook you

409
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Cook. Well, that's good.

410
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.310
Windy Borjas: I just like asked, like my grandma. She'll ask her friends and

411
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.760
Windy Borjas: You know, like my husband was always a very

412
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.320
Windy Borjas: Very, how would you say have

413
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.370
Jocelyn Corrales: A good promoter.

414
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.770
Windy Borjas: Oh, he's a very

415
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.060
Windy Borjas: Very good.

416
00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:49.710
Windy Borjas: Yeah. So because of him. I met a lot of good people, you know, around my community and

417
00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:52.680
Windy Borjas: All over the place so

418
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

419
00:39:53.220 --> 00:40:06.030
Windy Borjas: You know that it helped establish a lot of outlets for me to be able to support me and my daughter united mean like we don't always have the extras book, we have what we need and some

420
00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.710
Jocelyn Corrales: How you do baking. I just discovered you do baking and I think

421
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:28.740
Windy Borjas: I, I love baking. I, I always liked it since I was young. My grandma. I mean, we're Native American. So we have feast and all that. So cooking always been one thing that I did take from my childhood.

422
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:39.660
Windy Borjas: And it's funny because I never intended to like learn like I was never paying attention to actually take anything from it. I would just wanted the food.

423
00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.190
Windy Borjas: And what

424
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:46.620
Windy Borjas: When I moved out here with my husband. I mean, somebody had to cook. He can cook but

425
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.070
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

426
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.360
Windy Borjas: I didn't want to be that wife.

427
00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:54.390
Windy Borjas: Don't know how to cook. So I just started one day and I never stopped.

428
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.200
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's like a talent. Actually it's a talent cooking.

429
00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:09.120
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. So with regards to not working well for you. We talk about what's working well for you. And I think I saw some things because you also mentioned

430
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:19.110
Jocelyn Corrales: The things that's not working well for you. Just like sleeping. Sometimes you're having trouble sleeping, and sometimes you're waking up late in the morning.

431
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.990
Jocelyn Corrales: And do you have beans.

432
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:29.880
Windy Borjas: Yeah, my back my back has stayed really really messed up from like all the drug use.

433
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.100
Windy Borjas: And I'm

434
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:43.230
Windy Borjas: As of late. I mean, not as of late. But recently I i've been battling like with the addiction with the methamphetamines

435
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:43.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm.

436
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.480
Windy Borjas: So that doesn't help because I, you know, fall off the wagon and then

437
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.630
Windy Borjas: Get back on and then I do good and then fall off again.

438
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.970
Windy Borjas: You know my you know my body. I would say is strange.

439
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.510
Windy Borjas: From that just because I mean I'm not getting any younger

440
00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.370
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true.

441
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.230
Windy Borjas: Getting older but

442
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.070
Windy Borjas: Pulling it

443
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.140
Jocelyn Corrales: And your body's getting the effects of what you have been previously doing, you know,

444
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.310
Windy Borjas: Yeah yeah

445
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.340
Jocelyn Corrales: We do exercise, she could do it.

446
00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:31.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, slowly this time, we mentioned, we could start with 15 minutes then a week after once you're able to tolerate 15 minutes we could do 20 minutes then a week after once you're able to tolerate the 20 minutes we could go 25 minutes 30 minutes until you're able to tolerate 45

447
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:42.840
Windy Borjas: Original. Original plan for it when me and Dr. Kendall, I talked about it was I wanted to start off with something like just walking

448
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:43.920
Windy Borjas: Even a vicious

449
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:49.470
Windy Borjas: Of my street, not even all the way, just quarter guy with her and then when I'm

450
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:58.260
Windy Borjas: Active and you know I mean can do that with no problem, then I wanted to start getting into like more of like the yoga.

451
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes, we could start with that.

452
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:19.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Baby. So, yes, yes. Baby steps. That's true. So what we're going to plan as well. With regards to waking up I advice, even if your daughter's not there, I advise you to wake up early, maybe around nine o'clock apiece.

453
00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, set up at around 11

454
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.690
Jocelyn Corrales: So let's say eight o'clock to nine o'clock. That's not too early.

455
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:29.130
Windy Borjas: Okay.

456
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.280
Jocelyn Corrales: So, you know, so that you can do more in a day.

457
00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.240
Jocelyn Corrales: And just in case you know set an alarm.

458
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:49.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Set up on wake up late. So just in case you wake up early, turn off the alarm. So let's say set an alarm at around 830 so that to make sure that you know it reminds you to wake up really

459
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.400
Windy Borjas: Mm hmm. Yeah, I'll do that.

460
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.220
Windy Borjas: Try and get on a set routine.

461
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:57.120
Yeah.

462
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.650
Windy Borjas: I get. I get it going and then I just give beard off.

463
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:11.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. So let's start. You know, just like waking up. Let's start with baby steps. So let's wake up at around 830 to nine o'clock, you know, let's not do very early in the morning. So let's do

464
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:23.820
Jocelyn Corrales: Around that time, and since you're able to wake up early, you'll be able to eat on time. Because if you're late up if you wake up late sometimes. You won't be able to eat breakfast, you just eat brunch.

465
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Will plan on time.

466
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:35.280
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, and eat healthy because you cook eat healthy food.

467
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.530
Windy Borjas: Yeah, I, I just been in a real

468
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:49.380
Windy Borjas: It's kind of hard adjusting to getting back to my, you know, I mean, day to day

469
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, my

470
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Day to day activity.

471
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.720
Windy Borjas: Yeah, it's been a struggle. These last two years, I've been pretty rough

472
00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:04.770
Jocelyn Corrales: So what I'm trying to do here is that we are. I'm trying to get you get back on your

473
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:15.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Life and routine. So let's make this a routine waking up early, but but we'll, we'll do this like a baby steps, you know, we'll do this gradually not

474
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:30.330
Jocelyn Corrales: Immediate all immediately. So let's start with a very basic course. Like, for example, waking up early eating on time. So when you eat, try to eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy snacks.

475
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:38.790
Jocelyn Corrales: With regards to your ad else you've mentioned, I think you already have blend this week. Dr. Candle exercise every day.

476
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:39.810
Yeah.

477
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Started walking

478
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.300
Windy Borjas: Yeah.

479
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:53.910
Jocelyn Corrales: And maybe when you're able to do that, walking, you know, we could do an exercise at home.

480
00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:05.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh you do walking. I think it's good. You know, you do walking every morning and you do exercise at home before you go to sleep.

481
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.290
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, so

482
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:17.130
Jocelyn Corrales: I think yes because walking is not, you know, very tiring. So at least maybe five to 10 five to 15 minutes of walking in the morning.

483
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:31.830
Jocelyn Corrales: And then before you go to sleep so that you will be able to sleep, you know you get tired and you'll be able to sleep. You do exercise before you sleep so you exercise at home, just to just do the basic routines in yoga.

484
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:33.630
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

485
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:34.860
Windy Borjas: That sounds good to me.

486
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:40.500
Jocelyn Corrales: And you know, when you do yoga. You could actually listen to music. Yeah.

487
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:50.160
Jocelyn Corrales: You could actually do you know i don't know if you find nature sounds boring but if not you just do your

488
00:46:51.240 --> 00:47:00.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Routine music when you do yoga because when you do yoga. It's also a form of mind relaxation could also use nature sound might

489
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:02.190
Windy Borjas: Think at all like nature.

490
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.580
Windy Borjas: Down.

491
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.300
Windy Borjas: I think I would start out with, with nothing just

492
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, you could do that.

493
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:13.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And and if you think you get bored and when you know

494
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.710
Windy Borjas: In your feelings. I get it. I mean,

495
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.430
Windy Borjas: Yes, better control of getting myself centered

496
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:21.600
Windy Borjas: Like I can

497
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:27.000
Windy Borjas: Get when we do it like for group and stuff with no problem. But that's because like somebody coating me

498
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:34.020
Windy Borjas: To be able to get myself to self.

499
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:39.870
Windy Borjas: Know, at any given moment, if things are just feeling a little too hectic.

500
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.190
Windy Borjas: But I haven't perfected it yet.

501
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:45.270
Mm hmm.

502
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:54.960
Jocelyn Corrales: So what I did for that iOS is exercise every day we'd walk eating then exercise and yoga at home before bedtime.

503
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Walking in the morning.

504
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:06.750
Jocelyn Corrales: And for the routine activity arts and crafts to do

505
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.710
Jocelyn Corrales: For your daughter.

506
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:22.050
Jocelyn Corrales: And you know, I would like to, you know, maybe next month when I'm meeting you again because I, what I do is I also monitor

512
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.760
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good. Yeah, you could teach her the letters, you know, using that crafty.

596
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:29.460

Windy Borjas: My this session, you know, and I'll continue with it. I'm sure all in dreams.

614
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.440
Jocelyn Corrales: And the people they are not judgmental of you.

615
00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:38.220
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, exactly. Okay, so let me share my screen so that you can see the plan. I just put in the basic plan. Let's not put a very complicated plan here. So, because you know we just want it to be.

616
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Ideal and not really ideal but you know

617
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:43.860
Windy Borjas: Permanent yet.

618
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:57.930
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes, we could always change this one so I have placed in here, what's working well for you and I'll just end it nice leader to fill in the what's not working well for you because I play see it all here either was working well. I'm just going to edit this later.

619
00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:04.680
Jocelyn Corrales: And with regards to the routine. I have written here in the plan. Our goal is for you to

620
00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:19.470
Jocelyn Corrales: Set up a plan. I don't want to do. I don't want you to do planning for us. Let's just take baby steps. Maybe the next time we meet, I could suggest you that you do a planning or your day to day planning, but

621
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:29.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Anyway, we'll just do the basic things first. So wake up regularly set up an alarm so that you will be able to wake up at around 830 in the morning, eat on time.

622
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:39.540
Jocelyn Corrales: On time, so that is breakfast, lunch and dinner on time and try to eat healthy food in avoid and healthy snacks. Just to just junk foods or chips.

623
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:41.790
Jocelyn Corrales: And

624
00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:50.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Activities of daily living. So start with everyday walking every morning, you know, maybe let's start with five minutes. Then later on.

625
00:58:51.120 --> 00:59:05.640
Jocelyn Corrales: 10 minutes than 15 minutes until you're able to get the hang of it 15 minutes of walking is already fine then exercise and yoga at home before bedtime, so that you know it would help you to sleep.

626
00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:07.140
Jocelyn Corrales: At night.

627
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:10.350
Jocelyn Corrales: And also make you feel and active also

628
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:11.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, you want

629
00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:19.080
Jocelyn Corrales: You know when you do exercise every day, you would actually feel energized, you know, you don't feel tired and, you know,

630
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:21.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe, yeah. And you feel lazy.

631
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:31.260
Jocelyn Corrales: But do but we doing are doing regular exercise it would actually make you active. So you be able to do more in a day.

632
00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:33.420
Windy Borjas: Yeah, that would be a big help.

633
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.410
Yes.

634
00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:51.450
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true, that's true. It motivates you through the whole day and you know it you know we I have included the hearing the activities to know to take your mind have so many things. So you could do make yourself busy with graphs and cooking.

635
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:59.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Output here make so me so they see doing. Thanks.

636
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.930
Windy Borjas: Yeah.

637
01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.040
Windy Borjas: To sounds great.

638
01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:14.850
Jocelyn Corrales: So to take your mind off too much thinking you could do so many activities, you know,

639
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:18.750
Jocelyn Corrales: You can do arts and crafts for your daughter.

640
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:23.580
Jocelyn Corrales: And you could also spare some time to do some cooking and baking, you know,

641
01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.930
Jocelyn Corrales: If not cooking, you know, sometimes it could be difficult, doing some

642
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:41.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Cleaning you know in your friends motel or hotel right now because of the situation and for safety reasons. Maybe you could do cooking and baking, you know, you could also answer it.

643
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.660
Windy Borjas: Over there was around people so much

644
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, and sleep around

645
01:00:50.550 --> 01:01:06.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Their own 10 o'clock so exercise it on a law student, you'll be able to sleep early and I think we could do our own that then maybe next month when they see you, we could do. I could suggest for you to write down your plan, you know, the two day plan.

646
01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.060
Jocelyn Corrales: I usually suggest that to the

647
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:26.460
Jocelyn Corrales: Two patients, but I think we have to set your routine for us. Then once we are able to set your routine, then maybe it comes to you doing the daily plans to know. Like, for example, you put in what chores to do for this particular day, what activities. Maybe we could do that later on.

648
01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:29.550
Windy Borjas: Yeah, that works. That's that sounds better to me to

649
01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:37.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Our case I'm going to save this and I'm going to end this, you know, while later on and

650
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:39.180
Windy Borjas: To me after you edit it.

651
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:53.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I usually edit a copy of this to my patients so that you, you have a guide and let me see if I could make you sign this one for a while. Let me share it again.

652
01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:04.050
Jocelyn Corrales: But if not, it's OK. It's not. It's OK for you not, you know, let's try if you're able to sign this one. Can you try if you can say this one.

653
01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.520
Yeah.

654
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.560
Jocelyn Corrales: Can you control the

655
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:11.670
Yeah.

656
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.730
Jocelyn Corrales: We could actually do it again, just in case it

657
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Can you see my screen.

658
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.590
Jocelyn Corrales: Can you get out, you can actually do it again.

659
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:39.360
Windy Borjas: How do I do it again.

660
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.790
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Let me reset it for a while. No worries.

661
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.760
Windy Borjas: Or it could put in my keyboard. I didn't see the keyboard.

662
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. Let me reset it.

663
01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:57.750
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh wait for a while. Let me close this one.

664
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.470
Jocelyn Corrales: And let me have you sign it again. Okay.

665
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:07.560
Jocelyn Corrales: And share it again.

666
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:09.840
Windy Borjas: I think this app is so cool.

667
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:25.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. You know, I think your phone is good because you're able to sign up. There are some patients who are not able to sign this actually. So it's kind of a complicated that are tricky, tricky thing to do. So can you try saying it again. Say it again.

668
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.680
Windy Borjas: I was trying

669
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.060
Windy Borjas: Yes.

670
01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:44.010
Jocelyn Corrales: It just takes some time. You know, just like you did earlier. It just took time to reflect on my screen.

671
01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Yep, I see the W there.

672
01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:57.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, I see your name.

673
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.160
Jocelyn Corrales: OK.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.410
Jocelyn Corrales: OK, let me save this. Where are you

675
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, it's saving. That's good.

676
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:25.800
Jocelyn Corrales: Nice. Yes, I got this. I got your signature already no worry. I'm going to send you a copy of this once I added this, you surely let's see at the end of the week. Probably will be able to send you a copy but

677
01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:38.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Please take note, I think you could you could remember what our plan is, you know, do some graphs in the middle, just the basic wake up early exercise and do some graphs in bakey

678
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, easy to remember.
