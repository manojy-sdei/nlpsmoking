00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.340
Victoria reed: Oh, oh, I'm gonna get this walk in and start

18
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Any thoughts of

19
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Of using any of those popping into your head during the day or evening.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.820
Victoria reed: No. Not lately. No.

21
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.730
That's a

22
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain, then

23
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.460
Victoria reed: Um,

24
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.210
Victoria reed: For the most part, it's been, you know, I can handle it.

25
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.680
Victoria reed: This once in a while it gets to be like

26
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.700
Victoria reed: Out of control and but

27
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.640
Victoria reed: It seems to be something that can handle.

28
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.490
Victoria reed: And get rid of

29
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.850
Victoria reed: I tried them, you know, just different things. I have the line of Cain patches and stuff so

30
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.680
Victoria reed: That seems to do the trick.

31
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

32
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.430

Gwenevere Abriel: Have a smart really smart.

34
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So after you and I met and you did. You did quite, quite a bit of the the end our work with me.

35
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice after that.

36
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.900
Victoria reed: And let me calm.

37
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.820
Victoria reed: And relaxed. Yeah, calm, relaxed. It's the same thing.

38
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

39
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.650
But yeah

40
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.170
Victoria reed: Um,

41
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.150
Victoria reed: I wasn't

42
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.350
Victoria reed: Yeah, it helped me. Okay.

43
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.360
Sometimes

44
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Victoria, it will have the opposite effect.

45
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of what you and I did is

46
00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: We brought in. We weaved in the team, right. So it seems like an effective intervention for loosening up some of that negative network, but sometimes. So I'm just, this is like a warning. A little heads up so that you're not surprised if it happens.

47
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.770
Victoria reed: It makes it

48
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.150
Victoria reed: worth repeating comes. Yeah. Oh my God, yes, yes.

49
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.090
Victoria reed: Oh yes, I know what you mean. Yeah, it did.

50
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It did. Okay, so tell me

51
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.410
Victoria reed: A little bit yeah and

52
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.330
Victoria reed: Um, I was just like, really agitated.

53
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.640
Victoria reed: Yeah, and

54
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.570
Victoria reed: It made me like

55
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.470
Victoria reed: Seem like I was just real depressed and I don't know why, but

56
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.090
Victoria reed: Seemed to just like thin out and then after a little bit

57
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: The depression.

58
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you talking about that same day four days after

59
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.130
Victoria reed: That probably the same day like towards the end of, you know, at nighttime.

60
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.790
Victoria reed: Yeah, okay.

61
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.840
Victoria reed: And then the next day and

62
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.130
Victoria reed: I was still feeling the same way.

63
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.430
Victoria reed: And then after that it lessened up and went, yeah.

64
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do a little bit of a little bit more around

65
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.600
Now, yeah.

66
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.060
Victoria reed: Oh, sorry.

67
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You're all set up.

68
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you're so so good. I love it. I love it. So we want we want Delhi, Delhi at all, then we'll get right to it. Let's, let's do some exploration around

69
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: For a lot of people, they'll, they'll say depression.

70
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.330
Victoria reed: Yeah, sadness that i mean

71
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

72
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. That's it. The feeling was sadness.

73
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.900
Victoria reed: And yeah, and

74
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: It it

75
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Got the emotion labeled

76
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.090
Victoria reed: Yes.

77
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of go back, if you can, to that time period. Or maybe it's happening even today and see what the predominant laws were are like, what are some of the thoughts that you have

78
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.650
Victoria reed: Can you repeat that over again. Oh.

79
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Really. Oh, it was a very open ended question. So it leaves left a lot of room for you to interpret which so that makes sense. You'd ask again. So what I'm asking.

80
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

81
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You've labeled

82
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The day after the day of sad.

83
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: As an emotional awareness that I was always feeling sad. Do you know what you were thinking

84
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.340
Victoria reed: Oh,

85
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.890
Victoria reed: No, I just

86
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:21.090
Victoria reed: It was just sadness. I couldn't really. I didn't know where it was coming from. Yeah, okay.

87
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Sadness. Not sure where it's coming from.

88
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.860
Yes.

89
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And at night.

90
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You said earlier, you didn't have any increased cravings, or these days.

91
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But asking the same question were their cravings.

92
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the sadness was there.

93
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.550
Victoria reed: Yes, a little not too much not

94
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.550
Victoria reed: What I usually would get, you know, when I first started out, and everything just like

95
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.720
Victoria reed: This little thought came to

96
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Me here. The thought yeah

97
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:20.610
Victoria reed: I'm or are you dealing with this on. You can go find something and just yeah get back to it and then it went away. Quick is that it came

98
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: My guess is you actually did something to counter that that voice.

99
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think you did.

100
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.190
Victoria reed: The sadness. Yeah.

101
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, in order to count in order to counter the voice of addiction, which is why you dealing with this, you can go find something and get back to it. That's the voice.

102
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, addiction. My guess is you actually you the authentic self fought back for health for recovery.

103
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.810
Victoria reed: Your healing.

104
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: For healing for love for all those sort of intrinsic beautiful things about you. And my guess is you had a conversation back

105
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To that voice of addiction wondering what you countered it with

106
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.980
Victoria reed: I'm probably one I was alone.

107
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.840
Victoria reed: You know, for a couple nights, because my cousin, she gets back late

108
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.890
Victoria reed: Is like I was having

109
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.740
Victoria reed: Feeling alone. Okay. Yeah.

110
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you notice you're feeling alone.

111
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you

112
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do it like this.

113
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:53.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pull it apart as an actual dialogue if I'm the voice and addiction wants you to argue back to me.

114
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.050
Okay.

115
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we're going to see

116
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether what you just said is something maybe that you you kind of did have that inner dialogue. This is an inner dialogue, when we have in our head. We all have these decisions, do I want to act on my impulse. Is that really the healthy thing to do. We all have them.

117
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.130
Victoria reed: Yeah. Yes.

118
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we check, is that really what I believe in is that

119
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.900
Victoria reed: Exactly what I was telling myself. I said,

120
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.780
Victoria reed: Yeah, it's not worth all the progress that

121
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.910
Victoria reed: Come to lately.

122
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:40.380
Victoria reed: Okay, and it's not worth it. And I don't like the feeling that I feel when I was on it so

123
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

124
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:53.040
Victoria reed: You know, when I was coming when it was wearing off coming down, whatever. Yeah, you feel guilt and you feel

125
00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:02.370
Victoria reed: Sad and all the emotions coming back like horrible. I wouldn't want to feel that way again.

126
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, so even though earlier, a couple of things happened you minimize a bit to me right that the cravings weren't there when I pushed a little harder.

127
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

128
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.940
Victoria reed: Okay. And I like remember them.

129
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but sometimes it doesn't remember sometimes what people do and I noticed it very often in the front end of the session with people they say everything's fine.

130
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.470
Victoria reed: And then

131
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: When we talk a little bit more. That's not the case. There's been some distress, there was more to it. I just invite you that you're here to get right to what's unsettled for you. What's distressing for you. You don't have to pretend ever

132
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:48.750
Victoria reed: Okay.

133
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: See something you don't have to be happy, shiny. If you're not happy shiny. Fantastic. That's, that's, that's just fine. Even though you didn't really reinforce all the other beautiful smile today.

134
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's. It doesn't mean you have to be here with a beautiful smile. This is your

135
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and we get socialized. So we think we've got to make this other person.

136
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.540
Victoria reed: Yeah.

137
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.590
Victoria reed: Now, what is the one that we were doing.

138
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: placating

139
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

140
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Pretty much, yeah. You don't have to do that. This is your time. Okay, so you get what you need from it.

141
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's see. We do have, there's more to work with this way. So we could say, all right, there was some loneliness. There was an awareness that the cousin isn't around. What are you kind of, you know, like it really matter. It's been kind of nice to have around at night.

142
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.250
Victoria reed: Yeah, um,

143
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.960
Victoria reed: Well, one of the things, too, is

144
00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:14.880
Victoria reed: I've been going into the backyard. You know, because I like try to, I always pick up after the dogs and I try to like there's a lot of dirt and I sweep the top of it. I don't know why I do that I'm I've been finding footprints.

145
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.440
Victoria reed: Like someone jumped down into my yard.

146
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.330
Victoria reed: Oh yeah, there's like, you know, you can see when they jumped down

147
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:34.620
Victoria reed: Yeah, it makes like a big ol footprints. I've been finding that and that's like I have a camera here, but it

148
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.880
Victoria reed: Kind of gets a little scary.

149
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I would want to understand that, too.

150
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think it is.

151
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.060
Victoria reed: Um,

152
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.310
Victoria reed: They

153
00:13:54.420 --> 00:14:00.240
Victoria reed: It's probably the neighbor in the back because our someone went through the yard or something but

154
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:10.110
Victoria reed: Um, I don't really know how someone would have just walked through the yard because they keep it, you know, pretty much locked in. It's like

155
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.010
Victoria reed: They seem kind of

156
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.720
Victoria reed: rowdy yeah okay

157
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.090
Victoria reed: Oh, I think maybe you're

158
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Not thinking anyone sneaking in or out of the house. You're just thinking they're kind of in the back area.

159
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.670
Victoria reed: Yeah, going through our yard.

160
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.520
Victoria reed: Okay, yeah, come in through it like the wee hours of the morning

161
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:43.080
Victoria reed: Yeah, cuz I let the dogs out to use a bathroom again like around

162
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.080
Victoria reed: 1112

163
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.430
Victoria reed: You know, before we lay down and then

164
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:53.280
Victoria reed: So like

165
00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:00.300
Victoria reed: I know those footprints weren't there, you know, around that time. So it's like

166
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:11.610
Victoria reed: They just go to our yard to get to where maybe they need to go or something, I don't know, cut through it.

167
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.290
Victoria reed: But I don't

168
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.440
Victoria reed: Like that feeling.

169
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the feeling

170
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:29.850
Victoria reed: Scared. Yeah, scary because it's obviously Male Okay. They got there's a real big footprints.

171
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.740
Victoria reed: And then

172
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:46.020
Victoria reed: This morning there was a a boot boot prints jumping, you know, from the fence in the back on to my dirt.

173
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.100
Victoria reed: You can see it. They walk all the way out to the

174
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.800
Victoria reed: The street.

175
00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe. What do you think, and for a solution, putting something right on the other side of that fence, a land in the water.

176
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And

177
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.140
Victoria reed: That's exactly what I was

178
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.280
Victoria reed: Thinking, I know what

179
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Works.

180
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, or a bunch of bells are ringing when they

181
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:17.550
Victoria reed: Yes, our

182
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Cans man.

183
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you're going to wake up and hear it.

184
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.040
Yeah.

185
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.500
Victoria reed: Yeah.

186
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I think about things like having something sort of a negative thing happened, but you never know. People retaliate, and

187
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.740
Victoria reed: They're not rash. Yeah.

188
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: At least if you were to wake up.

189
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You could call emergency services or something you could

190
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes picture on it.

191
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.110
Victoria reed: I kind of, yeah. I went through and to

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.590
Victoria reed: With my phone.

193
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.060
Victoria reed: Pictures of the

194
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:59.520
Victoria reed: Footprint yeah and they fall all the way out to the end of the gate and they jumped in the neighbor's yard to get out.

195
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:09.750
Victoria reed: Because it's like really low in the front of the yard to where they could just like put their legs over and get out

196
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:18.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Your landlord has like a sign that could say no trespassing trespassers will be prosecuted. I mean, is that sign and offer an option. Maybe or something.

197
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.530
Victoria reed: It is an option. I just need to, you know,

198
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.750
Victoria reed: Get it myself.

199
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.160
Victoria reed: Hmm. Yeah, that's what

200
00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.910
Victoria reed: I'll probably this weekend goal and get the things I need

201
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Me just get get this call. Let me stop for just

202
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.400
Victoria reed: Yeah, no problem.

203
00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So since there's nothing really

204
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: About what to do with that.

205
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.160
Victoria reed: Yeah.

206
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we spend a little bit of time around the sad.

207
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.970
Victoria reed: Okay.

208
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's spend a little bit of time with that.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is not to say we couldn't we couldn't go and address that.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this fear.

212
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is probably much, much, much, much older and there might be

213
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know someone that was prowling or something. Maybe back in your history.

214
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yes. Okay.

215
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:39.600

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's do, let's do some of the diet for matic breathing together. Let's do

257
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this so that we can remind the body.

258
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So have a really clear contradiction to what the thoughts are right now. So we brought it from memory.

259
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And it thinks it's happening now, but we need to remind the body to contradict what's going on in the brain. And no, no, no. We're okay that's in the past. So we're going to do that. So let's

260
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's have a really, really big inhale together, bringing it into the belly and hold it there for 321 push it all out.

Gwenevere Abriel: I'm safe.

282
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Just scan your body. See how it's doing

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So right now what does stress level. Would you say from zero to 100. Are you out of this point.

290
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:25.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yep. And you don't have to believe in this stuff or to work. This is just physiology.

291
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.340
Victoria reed: Really, yes.

292
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.260
Victoria reed: I love it.

293
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.310
I do to

294
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So, but what happened just now just what science offers this explanation is the timestamp because you are so flooded with fear back then.

295
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It the timestamp corrupted in your hippocampus, it thinks. As soon as you pull up the memory it thinks it's happening now.

296
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.600
Victoria reed: Yeah, goes into

297
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And the response in

298
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:56.850
Victoria reed: Your mode.

299
00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so he thinks it's happening now. It's not set in the past. So let's do some work with it and let's get it in the past. Okay, so, um,

300
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I might use a really bad. I'm so sorry about that.

301
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.050
Victoria reed: Oh, no.

302
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So just

303
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:28.950

428
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.960

429
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.360
You can on your own.

430
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding the worst image with your team all around.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Exhale, letting it all go

440
00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And just do a scan of your mind, your emotion and your body and tell me what's what's coming up.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to do this. I want you to close your eyes for a moment. I want you to picture if you are going to ask for some help from your protective figure from your nurturer from your wise figure

449
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Just imagine that this this anxious stomach is still registering some perceived threat. Okay, it's sending a message is still hasn't really important concern.

450
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to give it a voice. It needs something from these figures. See if you can give it a voice. Who does it want to ask help from doesn't want to say something to one of these, these figures.

451
00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: With it until that comes to your awareness.

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's get into that imagery. I want you in this imagination. I want you to picture you're doing that, you're directing the wolf to make this personally and not come back. You're going to open your eyes first pull up the worst part of it. And then let's have you

461
00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:11.190

Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

515
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.180

More calm.

523
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.040

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.770
Victoria reed: Whatever comes

528
00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:52.950
Victoria reed: To fight that person.

529
00:48:54.390 --> 00:49:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Go with that I handled it. And I believe I can handle it. Hold that worst image. You did handle it. You're here now.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And you can handle it picture that horse piece. And now I know I can handle it.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I can handle whatever comes

532
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and slow.

533
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's pretend together nice inhale.

534
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Then

535
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.330
Letting it all go

536
00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:05.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And that'll be our last iteration for today, but take some time and really scan scan the body, see if there's any charge left

537
00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:07.410
Anywhere.

538
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.110
Victoria reed: Low tiny little painting with

539
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Paint in the sun.

540
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:16.410
Victoria reed: Yeah, little

541
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can put it, would you like to put it in that container and leave it there, or put it in in a on the distancing sort of metaphor and have it be drifting away. Let's see what

542
00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:37.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's do that together and your metaphor is it's sort of on this ship and it's sailing. Okay.

543
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So, picture putting putting this stomach pain on the ship how you're going to get there.

544
00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:54.690
Victoria reed: Just put it from my hand, take it off my domain. Yeah.

545
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:56.040
Victoria reed: Okay.

546
00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.160
Victoria reed: Here we

547
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Go, go. Okay, so is it in any kind of container on the ship.

548
00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.070
Victoria reed: No. Okay.

549
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just sitting there. All right, and then just see it, leaving the dock and you remain by your side always this beautiful strong wolf.

550
00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And remaining with you. Your grandma.

551
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:25.620
And your cat.

552
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And the wisdom.

553
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.110
Of Peggy

554
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how to protect yourself.

555
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know how to nurture yourself.

556
00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know when to do it and how to do it.

557
00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you put this

558
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: On the ship and it's moving further and further away and try to picture it

559
00:51:55.770 --> 00:52:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of off in the distance, maybe where you can barely see it anymore.

560
00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: To notice how your body feels. Is it it's further away.

561
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you are there grounded.

562
00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: In wisdom safety and nurturing

563
00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:27.030
Victoria reed: Really

564
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: There's relief.

565
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: scan your body again check and see if there's any charge still left working feet. See if there's blood. They're, they're numb check and see if there's blood in the legs means they want it to be flowing everywhere.

566
00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Not just in the large muscle groups when we're afraid and tense and need to run or fight we want that blood flowing everywhere.

567
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Back in the belly in the chest.

568
00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Your hands and arms.

569
00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Shoulders.

570
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Throat jaw.

571
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Errors and

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: her cheek.

573
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Eyes.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: temples and forehead.

575
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The top of the head.

576
00:53:54.150 --> 00:54:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that there's a shift to a relaxed state or if you notice, there's still something tense somewhere.

577
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's open the eyes and hang out with me here in in this moment and share with me a little bit about what was important for you today. Are you noticed

578
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.850
Victoria reed: I noticed that

579
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:30.480
Victoria reed: Everyone that I needed was right there.

580
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:32.880
Victoria reed: To help me through

581
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:35.130
Victoria reed: This little

582
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.240
Victoria reed: mishap. Yeah.

583
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:42.030

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.300
Victoria reed: Relax calm.

585
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:49.890
Victoria reed: And I know I have

586
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.370
Victoria reed: My wolf to protect me.

587
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right.

588
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe sitting with that imagery more frequently. This week, especially at night. Yeah. When you're alone.

589
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Making sure that you're reaching out to people still we've got to make sure those those time periods are very carefully protected because that might be a time when you're, you want to make some plans with people.

590
00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's not with people, then at least kind of have something set up for yourself, because that's a little bit more of a vulnerable time for you.

591
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that seem like maybe hey you know at Lucy, could we do this or

592
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Sin or gray kind of set that up because, you know, that's your, your time when it's quiet and

593
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's some loneliness and stuff that comes up, then

594
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.630
Yeah.

595
00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.000

Pull up your chart while I'm doing that, once you tell me a little bit about, um, I can't tell if that were annotation. The other day had to do with a new job or is this a new job.

613
00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:00.030
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, but

614
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:01.500
Daniel Guerrero: When I got

615
00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.220
Daniel Guerrero: I got a part time job, but I've already been terminated. Oh.

616
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:15.780
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I have some stuff on my background that you know kind of caused

617
00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:35.400
Daniel Guerrero: The manage but they're going to give me an opportunity to fight it, because it's already been 10 years you know I'm a felon, but it's I caught the case I caught the case like 2010 and here we are in 2020 so I'm hoping that maybe we can get it a second care of so

618
00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So you really like this job you want to fight for it.

619
00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:55.170
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, it's, I mean, it's not like it's just a part time job well because my wife's uncle lives here with us. Right. And so he has a he has this provider this care provided company that

620
00:58:56.490 --> 00:59:02.610
Daniel Guerrero: You know, they take care of, like, all his finances, they take care of like his doctor's appointments and stuff like that. Well, he

621
00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:08.640
Daniel Guerrero: They need of someone who's like will come in and be like an aid to him right but

622
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:21.990
Daniel Guerrero: He's not he does anybody from the company from their company coming into our house. And so I applied for it to see if I could get it and so

623
00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:32.190
Daniel Guerrero: They allowed me to get it. Well, they gave me 10 days. So I have 10 days to fight this and then hopefully we can get it resolved. Otherwise it'll be

624
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:34.680
Daniel Guerrero: Be a dead issue.

625
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you would be caring for your uncle.

626
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:47.340
Daniel Guerrero: Right. Well, I mean, we do all the big we already do all the basics for me anyway we cook. We clean, you know, we'd be

627
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Able to bill for Bill insurance for that.

628
00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:54.480
Daniel Guerrero: Right. You know, I mean, what have you. They're going to pay me for it. Why not you know i mean

629
00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:56.370
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

630
00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of people that are doing that. Yeah, yeah. New Mexico did something that they loosened up the ability to what you're what you're describing

631
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know how to phrase it but there's a lot of participants.

632
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:13.620
That are doing that.

633
01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just going to take a couple of your goals here and I'm going to put achieved on it because you've been able to attend group and individual therapy consistently so props to you for that.

634
01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to kind of

635
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: change some things around, get some new goals for you.

636
01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That are more relevant for you today. Okay.

637
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We go achieve

638
01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Goals. Nice. Okay, so

639
01:00:51.240 --> 01:01:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't mean you stop attending. It just means that those first 30 days which are usually the most difficult for people being able to attend individual therapy and group every week tends to be a challenge.

640
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I'm saying that but I didn't actually look and see how many attended. Let me just look step back a little bit. Come back or are all right we got

641
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What is you came in for iOS psycho social

642
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: On 114

643
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:30.960
Okay, and then we got 122 DPS and 22 we

644
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All grew up on 120 as a group.

645
01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And then grew up 127

646
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And then individual 131

647
01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: On growth was 2323

648
01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Individual to sex.

649
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.110
Daniel Guerrero: One second.

650
01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.390
To 12

651
01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:00.300
Daniel Guerrero: I can hear you, man.

652
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.780
Daniel Guerrero: Taking care of uncle and sometimes he loses in

653
01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I can't actually have it here. Specifically, I can hear some sound but but not anything to specific is he upset.

654
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:25.440
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, exactly. Like in well. He claims that he has a memory loss and he can't remember nothing

655
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:32.490
Daniel Guerrero: But like I said, he's claiming that and you pull this card every day. And when I really do.

656
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:44.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I see 1234

657
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:48.270
Yeah, I think that's pretty darn good.

658
01:02:56.490 --> 01:03:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Really just to close that goal. I really should have one more.

659
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

660
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

661
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How distressing. Is it for you. The, the, the financial instability. Let me understand a little bit about what that's like for you right now.

662
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:23.640
Daniel Guerrero: Um,

663
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:26.340
Daniel Guerrero: You know, to me, it's

664
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:39.990
Daniel Guerrero: It's a heavy know you know financially to be financially stable because, you know, I've never had it before, you know, never been financially stable my life. Okay, and

665
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:53.160
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it took me a long time to get to where I'm at. So for me, it's very important, and at the same time it to stressors, you know, because, you know, I do have I do full time job and

666
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:57.450
Daniel Guerrero: But also on my full time job. They're also garnishing

667
01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.070
Daniel Guerrero: Celtic

668
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you pay restitution for something

669
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.680
Daniel Guerrero: Though paying child support.

670
01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.130
That's how

671
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:08.700
Daniel Guerrero: I paid to 10 a month. And one of my son's

672
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:15.030
Daniel Guerrero: Don't even get to see him. Let me see him, but I still have to pay for it. I mean, but anyways.

673
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.830
Daniel Guerrero: You know, so

674
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:34.230
Daniel Guerrero: I've already already working at it, you know, I work at a burger place, you know, Marty, you know, in the, you know, my hands are tied to read there. I mean, oh yeah, I'm the manager, but I think I should be making more than when I'm making but I'm not

675
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:40.470
Daniel Guerrero: I bring home about 530 every two weeks. It's about 1060 a month.

676
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:42.270
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

677
01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's hard to live on right there.

678
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:52.290
Daniel Guerrero: My rent my rent alone is 850 a month, you know, so like it's super tight. You know what I mean. Yeah, I do. I hear you.

679
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You got, you know, a little mouths to feed to

680
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:57.030
Daniel Guerrero: Do she do

681
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it is a heavy burden.

682
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't disagree. I mean, I know right now. I'm kind of having this sort of shock because you are highly articulate, intelligent

683
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Charismatic like all the recipes for really everything that you need to get what you want. You do have this history that's a pain in the butt. It follows you around that that felony conviction stuff their convictions. Right. That's what we're talking about.

684
01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:28.560
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

685
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But they're 10 years old and

686
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you at the point in your life and it doesn't it. The answer can be no i don't have a hidden agenda. I'm very transparent.

687
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there an interest to

688
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Get a career.

689
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:48.810
Yeah, you

690
01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:50.700
Daniel Guerrero: Know, man. I wouldn't

691
01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:59.640
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I think about this every day. You know what I mean, like, you know what would have been like if I would have chose a different route, you know, but if I would have

692
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:06.510
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know if I would be the person I am today. You know, I think I might be somebody different. You know, because I'm really happy with myself, you know,

693
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.040
You know,

694
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.440
Daniel Guerrero: But at the same time, you know. Yeah. You know, I would love you know

695
01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:15.330
Daniel Guerrero: Like

696
01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:26.580
Daniel Guerrero: You know I'm challenged. You know, like, I'm not really like, you know, I can read and write, basic, you know, basic arithmetic, you know, but

697
01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:42.300
Daniel Guerrero: Like when it gets into, like, you know, like, because I was trying for my GED, and I missed it, like, three points I missed my god for three points and well I got out of prison and I get in. It's like now life's demands are hitting me

698
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:48.720
Daniel Guerrero: Where I'm always spending more time at work. I'm always spending time running around, you know, got the kids.

699
01:06:49.500 --> 01:07:01.380
Daniel Guerrero: You know, not blaming none of them, you know, because I do have a couple hours, you know, to stop when I could you know be studying, you know, to get a GED and but I choose not to. Because I'm resting on the cool you know this, you know,

700
01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:03.930
Daniel Guerrero: What

701
01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So I, I heard that the you go into the past and and that's that isn't quite what I'm inviting you to do right now. What I'm asking you to do is

702
01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:28.410
Gwenevere Abriel: We can't go change the past. I like I like how you appreciate who you are today. I think that's smart. It's healthy but what I'm asking is,

703
01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: This is really tricky. Some people identify, they have a career idea.

704
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people, they're like, I know I want to get my CD license and I know I want to be a driver or they'll say, I know I want to be a chef and so they'll write a love food or I want a food truck. They're like they have something in the back that brings them joy and could bring in

705
01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: An income that isn't job. It's a career. It's like this taps into something more than just an income. This is life satisfaction to. And I wondered if there was one of those. And I heard you with the GED.

706
01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think there are

707
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: solutions that can be arranged around finding time for that. You know, it would be inconvenient, but

708
01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:35.430
Gwenevere Abriel: You could do it if you really, really, really wanted to do it. But what's the motivation. You know, is there a career. Is there a passion you have, is there a field.

709
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That maybe you caught a glimpse of when you were a young man, or maybe somewhere along the line and you kind of let it you let it go.

710
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:45.780
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know,

711
01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:57.930
Daniel Guerrero: Back, back, you know, being a manager, you know, I've always I've always done that, you know, there's always great opportunities working for franchises, you know, in corporations to become you know like GM

712
01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:02.550
Daniel Guerrero: And that's something that I did pass up. You know, when I was younger.

713
01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:06.780
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because I let. I let my temper, get the way

714
01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.610
Daniel Guerrero: I might want to be a I was a first assistant manager for McDonald's.

715
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.050
Daniel Guerrero: And

716
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:16.950
Daniel Guerrero: The word supervisor asked me is like,

717
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.180
Daniel Guerrero: You know, Danny. Are you ready to step up, you know, made

718
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.780
Daniel Guerrero: 60,000 80,000 a year.

719
01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:36.690
Daniel Guerrero: I was like, well, yeah, no. Yeah, so I want you know, and he goes with just keep doing what you're doing, man. You're doing a good job and you know we're recognizing and I'm like okay

720
01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:44.610
Daniel Guerrero: And like I said, like, you know, six months down the line that conversation had already drifted

721
01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:52.350
Daniel Guerrero: My focus. Wasn't that any more. My focus was, you know, my myself, you know, self ambitions.

722
01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that

723
01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that I'm

724
01:09:57.990 --> 01:10:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Selling drugs or something like what got in the way.

725
01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.210
Daniel Guerrero: No, I was, um,

726
01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.810
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I honestly

727
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.850
Daniel Guerrero: I was working. I was working for McDonald's at that time and

728
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:32.730
Daniel Guerrero: I was the one of the one of the shift managers there. You know, I had did something you know uncalled for, you know, I didn't, a middle of lunch. It was stupid. It was stupid. Stupid what I did. And now that I think about it was stupid. You know, I know. Did it anyways so she closed. She was

729
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:43.020
Daniel Guerrero: A girl have been complaining that you know she needed a break, because she had been there, you know, since nine o'clock that morning it was already launched. She wanted a break. So she closed the bat drive

730
01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:51.120
Daniel Guerrero: And so now we have to collect food and I mean to collect money and send out food out of one window because she closed it back drive

731
01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.130
Daniel Guerrero: And it pissed me off.

732
01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:03.540
Daniel Guerrero: And I told them. I told the the GM I say they do. Why, why are you allowing this to happen. I mean, we're in the middle of lunch.

733
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:05.940
Daniel Guerrero: And

734
01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:14.610
Daniel Guerrero: He popped off with. I'm the manager here and this and that. And I was like, well, good, then you can manage this fucking store your damn so you know

735
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one.

736
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:28.080
Daniel Guerrero: So, okay, I've got really upset about it and I and under cool like I should not even know let her, you know, get to my nerves like that because she wasn't nothing but a shift manager.

737
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.990
Daniel Guerrero: And I should have been more responsible and I've been like, well, then I'll do it myself. And you can run the front or something.

738
01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:48.120
Daniel Guerrero: And well. Instead I chose I chose to let my anger and like I said you know myself getting the way of, you know, just looking at a bigger picture. And I kind of ruin that and now

739
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:53.430
Daniel Guerrero: McDonald's is just like, now you're on higher level, you know, so

Daniel Guerrero: Because i think i think that i can put a good resume together. If I knew how just don't know how. Okay. Right. Well, I've been going online.

Daniel Guerrero: Said that, okay. I don't even know what these words mean with their long you

745
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:41.250
Know,

746
01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:42.870
Daniel Guerrero: So,

747
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:47.370
Daniel Guerrero: Down. But anyways, so that's something that I had been trying to do because

748
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:54.570
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I believe in my heart, my heart that I can do that. I because I've been doing it my whole life. You know, I've been. I've been working in fast food.

749
01:12:55.290 --> 01:13:00.360
Daniel Guerrero: Restaurants and cooking, you know, I got 20 years experience. I've been doing this since I was 18 years old. I'm 40

750
01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:10.350
Daniel Guerrero: And you know this was my, my first job was flipping a burger. And my last job would probably be flipping a burger, you know, in me. You know, it's not made for everybody, everybody's not made.

751
01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:17.550
Daniel Guerrero: But there are people that are do I can do it right and I can do it and I'm a, I'm really good at it, you know, so

752
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:33.450
Daniel Guerrero: I just know that pays not really that well with it. And so like at times. Yeah, it's a financial burden for me just not have been like, you know, for example, I wanted to go and be a Marine. I wanted to be. I want to go and be a Marine. And I went and I wanted to be.

753
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:35.790
Daniel Guerrero: I know I wanted to be a

754
01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.310
Daniel Guerrero: PT origin and

755
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:50.340
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I kind of a kind of ruin that you know I didn't ruin that i think i mean i did because I still could have done it.

756
01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:57.150
Daniel Guerrero: But you know, I let you know smoking bud and partying getting away.

757
01:13:58.290 --> 01:13:59.310
Daniel Guerrero: And so

758
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.940
Daniel Guerrero: You know, kind of hard on myself about that because it's really what I wanted to do. I wanted to go and serve my country and

759
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:08.670
Daniel Guerrero: Oh,

760
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so, um,

761
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:22.830
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the piece about the anger is a big one. And there's been you've touched on it a little bit around your, your children.

762
01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Especially the adolescence, we heard about that in here. I think it's going to need a more attention from us. I think it's something that deserves more attention and then I'm also hearing. There was some passion about wanting to serve your country.

763
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know you were a kid and and I understand for a lot of people, their environment. There's just, that's what's around. That's what everybody's doing so then you do the same thing and you have a lot of responsibilities now.

764
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: But that that part about I wanted to serve my country. I'm curious about that one. Um,

765
01:15:11.610 --> 01:15:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you think of a way that you could do that without going into the military.

766
01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.360
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, um,

767
01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:20.850
Daniel Guerrero: You know, um,

768
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:28.890
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I care of late, you know, I've kind of gotten away, you know, a little bit, you know, but you know it's not an excuse, you know,

769
01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:38.910
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I could I could do. I could do things, you know, to help you know because I never got help you know nobody ever helped me, you know, because

770
01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:49.860
Daniel Guerrero: You know, the way I looked at it as people are too full of themselves that they didn't have time, you know, to give a lending hand. Now the only people that are helped me was like my mom, my father in law. My mother in law.

771
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.660
Daniel Guerrero: And

772
01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:58.800
Daniel Guerrero: I think, I think I can start my country by giving back. You know, to even if I don't have it, you know, just serve and give back.

773
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:04.080
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, it may not seem like it but you know I'm

774
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:11.190
Daniel Guerrero: I'm pretty good. You know, I, I'm pretty good at my and the word. You know, I know the word will be well okay

775
01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:19.890
Daniel Guerrero: You know that's something that you know i i need to get back into extremely because you know I'm pretty good.

776
01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:26.910
Daniel Guerrero: Before I got out of prison, you know, that's something that I did. I was involved in the church. I, I served in the church.

777
01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:34.200
Daniel Guerrero: And I also, you know, taught in the church, you know, Church as well.

778
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're getting somewhere. Right, so right your ministry is is around you all the time, these people that you could be talking about right that passion that thing that you you care deeply about. That's a way for you to be in service.

779
01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So right and and for some people.

780
01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not

781
01:16:56.910 --> 01:17:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Where they're getting their income, but it can also be around volunteering to so there might end up being an opportunity for you to

782
01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:07.380
Daniel Guerrero: Anyone sorry about

783
01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:08.940
Daniel Guerrero: To

784
01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Volunteer for some people it's not really becoming a minister, although maybe it is

785
01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's making sure that that part is being addressed i i think that it's important that we take a look at what what brings you joy. It's because a life is not just earning an income. It's. Am I enjoying my life.

786
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And this this irritability or short temper and anger can be diminished. If there's a balance and there's another part of your life where you're getting refueling

787
01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That makes sense.

788
01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:54.270
Daniel Guerrero: We've recorded, please.

789
01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.420
Daniel Guerrero: Write it in the car.

790
01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever volunteered.

791
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: To be a big brother or peer mentor, something like that.

792
01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:12.540
Daniel Guerrero: I haven't

793
01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:19.410
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and when I was when I was in prison. I used to do that, you know, I used to go to other guys, you know, you know,

794
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:28.320
Daniel Guerrero: If you need anybody to talk to you know I'm always available. You know, I always do that, you know, because you know

795
01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:44.670
Daniel Guerrero: I mean i remember when i when i first stepped into the system was just a kid and you know it was the older guys that they related to me because they knew they had already been through what I was already going through or without what was coming up.

796
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:45.150
Yeah.

797
01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:57.300
Daniel Guerrero: And so I would you know I would take these cats, because I have, you know, in a bunch of them early 19 and 20 years old I have 1920 year olds and now the room.

798
01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:13.320
Daniel Guerrero: And so, excuse me, so I so I would relate to them like, you know, and I would take them in and like, Yeah, you know what, I'm not your dad and I'm not going to be your dad. But look, bro. This is not the road, you know, we have to change some things, you know, and

799
01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:28.380
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's to stop my dad, you know, and I would love to, you know, get involved, you know and and being, you know, but there's going to be honest man like I make excuses time or I'm always tired.

800
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:32.970
Daniel Guerrero: But maybe we'll change it.

801
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:42.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's it's it's a weird thing that happens we we think the GED. So it's you go online. You say, Why are there some online courses, you know,

802
01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you and me or whatever's around you. They may have online courses to review for your GED. You know, I don't have time for that or volunteering. I don't have time for that. You may think that's true.

803
01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:07.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But what comes back to you when you're actually doing something that you care about it, it does something for the soul, it, it, it feeds it

804
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Once you step into doing something. Yes. It takes time. But it's something you care about.

805
01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not the Grudge and drudgery of job right. It's not a nine to five thing it's I'm investing in myself. It gives back

806
01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: It returns immediately in self love validation self esteem confidence excitement and vitality, you think it would suck all the life idea. It doesn't all of a sudden you're like, Oh, I've got the time for this, this, this, I and you just but you don't know until you get there.

807
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So you might be at the phase where you're thinking, I don't have time for it, but you're not going to know what it feels like. Until you put your little toe in it.

808
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:56.610
Right.

809
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

810
01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This all started with

811
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: The piece about the anger and you know it intellectually, you know it because you brought it up to me about with with your older older boys. I get that.

812
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:25.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But it also, it got in the way of a career path if it turns out that wasn't really your, your path. Anyway, so be it nothing we can do about that. Anyway, nothing but what we do with it today is important.

813
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to, I want to set some goals if you'd like around because we started to I can see I started to write a goal.

814
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get into that a little bit more. And so it's anger. It's a discussion of resume GED volunteering, right, those kinds of things. Those are things you can really get your hands on and we can start to put some action into

815
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: For

816
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: For you, though I they can't be my goals they have to be yours. They have to be what what inspires you, or you have just an idea.

817
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That this is where the passion lies. This is where vitality, which is our, our life spirit. It's just this energy if you sort of think that's where it is, then that's the direction to go. But it can't be my direction. I can't be the ones doing this, it has to come from you, where do you

818
01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to put energy into based on some of the things we talked about, what do you want to do.

819
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.240
Daniel Guerrero: You know, um,

820
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:30.720
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I think it's important for me to get a GED. I think it's important for me to get an education because

821
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:40.680
Daniel Guerrero: You know I have. And, you know, and I think it's important to me because I think if I if my kids see that I can do it at this age, they can do it right.

822
01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:56.250
Daniel Guerrero: You know, sometimes you know you watch like the commercials. You know, you got like students graduating from college did or you know grandmother's or, you know, that are already fathers and mothers and you're graduating from college, you know,

823
01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.130
Daniel Guerrero: I know that would be something I will be my first and then

824
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:21.570
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you know, my, my brother graduated. My mom was so happy for my brother, right, like she threw them as big as graduation party. No, she bought him a class when she bought her gown, you know, she's she spent a lot of money, you know, getting him together, you know, for his graduation.

825
01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:27.270
Daniel Guerrero: And so it would like to, I would like to have, you know,

826
01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:35.010
Daniel Guerrero: A diploma to take to my mom and be like your mom, I did it for you, you know, or not for you, but for me first. But, you know, here's your joy.

827
01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It starts with the first step, Daniel. It starts with where to go.

828
01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: It starts with getting on the internet. It starts with making a call. It's about these little tiny steps. There's no

829
01:23:52.620 --> 01:24:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Big achievement. That's not built on tiny little pieces if they're all the same. Doesn't matter what you want to do. They're all built on these little steps. It can feel overwhelming you get ahead and you think, Oh, it's this insurmountable thing.

830
01:24:11.670 --> 01:24:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't know what we're capable of until we get there. Just assume you're capable

831
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.640
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

832
01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:20.220
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, right. There's no his

833
01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: wife wants to tell you. No, no, you need a little bit more of this a little bit more of that.

834
01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm pretty darn confident, it is not going to be any more difficult than you surviving and frozen.

835
01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:36.060
Daniel Guerrero: That's true. I agree with that.

836
01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I seriously and I know this may seem like an odd thing to compare it to. But you you think guys forget

837
01:24:45.150 --> 01:24:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: How strong you are okay when you're out here and it's about rejection from out here, you know,

838
01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The rules are different, like I can't punch him.

839
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't

840
01:25:01.410 --> 01:25:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't, right.

841
01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:02.940
Now,

842
01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't leverage power and control inside the prison system. The rules are different. It's a real black and white world in there but out here. It's subtle it's nuanced and it can be scary for you guys but you're forgetting you have all the skills that are necessary.

843
01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:20.970
You do.

844
01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:35.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're worth it, you're worth protecting yourself and maybe had to compromise some core values in order to survive in prison and I get that, but it's the same self preservation

845
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that I'm worth it. I'm worth protecting myself, you're worth investing in yourself and it's not going to be more difficult than what you had to do in there. Okay. You may think so high with this. So sorry. There's so much going on.

846
01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's an adult child. It's got some medical things so I'm kind of I want to have the alert on but full of distracting. So

847
01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's break it down into pieces. This is just over the next 30 days. It's a tiny little step a little brick right in the foundation. What's the very first small task that you think you need to do to learn more about getting a GED first tiny step.

848
01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:27.270
Daniel Guerrero: Um, well, you know, the first step, but I want to take as

849
01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:33.090
Daniel Guerrero: I want to call the CCC here in Clovis and

850
01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:36.660
Daniel Guerrero: See if they offer some kind of adult

851
01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:40.980
Daniel Guerrero: GED classes or night or daytime.

852
01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:42.990
Daniel Guerrero: GED class.

853
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:47.310
Daniel Guerrero: If they're free or how

854
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.620
The cost. You got it.

855
01:26:52.530 --> 01:27:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you also consider. I don't know if you have a laptop or something or a library, but you can. You may have the option of doing something online to it might be a combination. See how you're able to do this with me sometimes, you know, with technology advancing were able to do a lot online.

856
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.730
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

857
01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So I have client will call si, si, si in Clovis, see if they have daytime classes, the cost and what else

858
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:29.550
Daniel Guerrero: And what times on the time is important and go right on schedule. Yeah.

859
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:36.810
Daniel Guerrero: And see if I reflect like because I have to. I have to be at work at two o'clock every day, like, yeah.

860
01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:48.510
Daniel Guerrero: And that's and that's the thing that searches. Because like I want to be my own boss. I want to be able to to say when I'm going to go to work. You know what I mean. And, and I want to be able to, you know, earn a good living

861
01:27:49.650 --> 01:28:00.990
Daniel Guerrero: be my own boss, you know when when when these restaurant, you know, and I'm going to call the shots and and I'm not going to work. You know, the employees low a the workers pay us where they pay us like

862
01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:07.920
Daniel Guerrero: That I mean shit I'm making $10 an hour $10 an hour.

863
01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:14.430
Daniel Guerrero: And some jobs in town or pain, you know, more for doing less

864
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.070
Daniel Guerrero: You know, then when I doubt.

865
01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the administrators that make more money. It's, it's weird.

866
01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just the way it is.

867
01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's get you there. Let's get you there. Okay, I don't see any reason except a fear of the unknown, you have time, I think I don't know where it is. But we have this hour you're able to create this hour for your chemical dependence. You can do it as an hour.

868
01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:45.900
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

869
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do it if you commit to it and it's just using this this. I'm just going to do it, even though I don't feel like it that that notion all feel like doing it. You're never gonna feel like

870
01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: You've done this before, nobody ever does nobody feels like it. I've got plenty of things I'm procrastinating on and I know the recipe I got to do it, even though it's

871
01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's never as bad as I think it would be once I'm actually doing it. It never is.

872
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: We make up this story in our head that it's going to be I'll feel stupid inadequate, I'll get bored. I won't be able to do it, but it's all in our head is never as bad as you think once you get there. Okay.

873
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You are intelligent, you can get this GED. I truly do believe that I do think this anger is a big piece of some things I went sideways. I do want to continue to develop a goal around that, too. So let's take a look at that one.

874
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me a deadline at when you want to hold yourself accountable to have called CC enclose. What do you want to set yourself for that.

875
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:59.850
Daniel Guerrero: Wouldn't have it wouldn't have it done by, by the end of the week.

876
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:01.680
OK, I will call

877
01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:07.770
Gwenevere Abriel: By that puts it at February 21

878
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:09.810
Okay.

879
01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so we'll check on that every month all ask and see if you reach that you're more than welcome to brag about it. I love a text from people saying, I called. I know what it is. And you can brag. I love it. Um,

880
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get to I want to build a resume is that one two. Is there something that

881
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.400
Daniel Guerrero: Yo, you know, because I'm

882
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:45.420
Daniel Guerrero: I've been trying to do it online. Right. And I've been trying to save them. Well, of course I don't have the money because you know you have to like summer. Like, for example, and I know this is gonna sound silly like three books.

883
01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.860
Daniel Guerrero: That's okay. My big accounts and negative 103 bucks. You know, so

884
01:30:51.060 --> 01:31:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, you know, we could do. I'm Danielle, you and I can, I can sit here in a Word document, and I can type it up with you. I can share my screen. We could build one together. If you wanted to spend some time on that. And then I can, I guess, email it to you in a Word document, you'd have it.

885
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you want to do that.

886
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, if you hate it. If you're like, oh no, but it's a point of departure. It's you hearing from another person.

887
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you may recognize more resources than you realized

888
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You may recognize. Oh, I really don't want input or you may like the input, it can still be a therapeutic experience because I'll be able to see as we're interacting around things. What's coming up for you.

889
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:39.900
Daniel Guerrero: Right and and you know I'm pretty coachable, you know, like

890
01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:46.830
Daniel Guerrero: I don't I don't try to be a selfish, you know i i enjoy. I enjoy correction. I enjoy, you know,

891
01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:52.410
Daniel Guerrero: Criticism. Once you can say is that what it is that the right word criticism.

892
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:57.930
Daniel Guerrero: Criticism constructive criticism, right, because you know I'm

893
01:31:59.670 --> 01:32:05.070
Daniel Guerrero: All my life I've been told that I was going to amount to shit. You ain't shit and they will be shit.

894
01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:15.720
Daniel Guerrero: And, you know, so like when I when I get a constructive criticism, you know, hey, you're doing a good job. But let's try it like this.

895
01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:25.740
Daniel Guerrero: So when I fix it and correct it. You know, it's like hey you catch it. You're doing it. You're doing a good job, keep doing what you're doing, you know, and

896
01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:30.450
Daniel Guerrero: All right. And so for me, that's, that's a big deal because

897
01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:40.530
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I've never been patted on the back and say, hey, you're doing a good job. You know, my mom and dad never had time to do that shit. You know what I mean, and that's

898
01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So important though we

899
01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotta be able to praise.

900
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's how we find out

901
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You know we absorb the positive feedback from our environment we absorb that and it carries it forward for us. That's how we develop our strong identity.

902
01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:58.590
Daniel Guerrero: Is important.

903
01:32:58.650 --> 01:32:59.190
So,

904
01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote it down of what we can do is we can kind of pull the screen up you can give me what you already have. We can use a template from the internet or whatever you want to look at

905
01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll start from there and fill it in. Because you mentioned that there's some big fancy words and there are. There's some great words out there.

906
01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: They capture what's your the skills and knowledge that you already have. And it's just sort of plan with those big fancy words and plugging them in. Okay.

907
01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. And then you're going to set yourself a goal of calling Clovis CC. Is it three C's.

908
01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:42.360
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, it's a global community college, so it's it's a CCC

909
01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.160
Daniel Guerrero: M.

910
01:33:45.930 --> 01:33:46.860
Daniel Guerrero: I remember the commercial

911
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're going to let you have to, but that's still a lot of steps because you'll have to look at the number or you'll go online, but you'll still have to do those steps. Okay.

912
01:33:57.570 --> 01:34:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, for I want more self control. This is something you mentioned, I think last time I want more self control. I had taught you the the box breathing.

913
01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You gotta be honest with yourself here. Don't try and make me happy. This serves no one not here to make one of your happy don't need a happy therapist and happy client for you.

914
01:34:19.890 --> 01:34:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you been able to a remember to do it.

915
01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And be remember to do it when you get irritated, angry, frustrated

916
01:34:32.190 --> 01:34:40.050
Daniel Guerrero: Know I'm remembering to do it. It's like, I don't have to remember anymore. It's like I just automatically take the time out and I mean

917
01:34:41.190 --> 01:34:42.990
Daniel Guerrero: That's, that's just real shit and

918
01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.180
Daniel Guerrero: So like

919
01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:57.090
Daniel Guerrero: For me, and when, uh, you know, it happens a lot in my house, you know, don't understand. I got I got three teenagers in my house who who got the world's figured out and

920
01:34:58.110 --> 01:35:09.810
Daniel Guerrero: And then I have. I didn't have an upcoming teenager who already got the world figured out because his brothers and sisters already got to figure it out and they're telling you. Oh no, that's not the way it is just the way it is, you know, but anyway, so

921
01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.150
Daniel Guerrero: I find myself.

922
01:35:13.410 --> 01:35:15.510
Daniel Guerrero: When, when I get myself in that position. I just go

923
01:35:16.770 --> 01:35:19.110
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I just go out there and I'm just like,

924
01:35:20.670 --> 01:35:24.750
Daniel Guerrero: I just close them out for a few minutes, relax, and then

925
01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:30.900
Daniel Guerrero: I'll come back in and do my thing. You know, so like yeah I'm finding I'm finding it effective

926
01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, I've heard you say you're taking time. But this is a very specific effect. This isn't the same as a regular deep breath. This this intervention this diet dramatic breathing.

927
01:35:44.850 --> 01:35:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

928
01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Different than just we'll just take a deep breath. They can both be effective, but this this other one

929
01:35:53.550 --> 01:36:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Very much it we, you know, I call it a bagel break basically whatever distress, you're having, whether it's anger, fear, or wanting to sort of run for the hills sort of that fight or flight response.

930
01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It puts a break on it.

931
01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And

932
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me ask the question again. I heard what you said. I also automatic I take time for myself. I do it because I have all these teams. I heard on taking the break. But are you remembering to do this box breathing.

933
01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.400
Daniel Guerrero: Oh no. Okay, NOT AT ALL TIMES, YOU KNOW, I WOULD I DO IT.

934
01:36:32.670 --> 01:36:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Once a week.

935
01:36:33.450 --> 01:36:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Once a week, twice a week, how often

936
01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:37.530
Daniel Guerrero: You know, to be honest with you, I probably do it.

937
01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:39.150
Daniel Guerrero: Maybe

938
01:36:40.290 --> 01:36:41.970
Daniel Guerrero: Once every couple days maybe

939
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.820
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

940
01:36:46.170 --> 01:36:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Once every couple of days.

941
01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:48.030
Yeah.

942
01:36:49.230 --> 01:37:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And I would say for you. You may want to do it as at least like two or three times a day. I really think that increase is going to help you have a lot coming at you.

943
01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:02.790
Daniel Guerrero: I really do you know what

944
01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:04.740
Daniel Guerrero: I mean,

945
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.110
Daniel Guerrero: They'll be tough, you know, so

946
01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brain is going to work better and you already know that because you walk outside, you get away from it, your work, your brain works better, faster, stronger when you're calm.

947
01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It just does the blood gets to it. Otherwise, it doesn't. It's in the large muscle groups and it's not up here where you need logic, reason and planning and organization, just not there.

948
01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're smart, you get away you chill out, add this piece to it and you did say, you know, originally it was, I'm going to do this, you're kind of excited about it. I think it's kind of fallen away a little bit

949
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do it. I like it. I'm going to teach it. So, but that's jumping a little fast. First, you do it first and

950
01:37:47.610 --> 01:38:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do it. And you remember it. It's a hard thing to remember because we're activated. We're angry were upset. We are in a threat response. So the first piece is just increasing that frequency. See if you can

951
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want to get into some of the cognitive part because there is something going on.

952
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: It's it's around this phrase me see if I can find it. This one comes up has come up a couple times with you.

953
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't quite get it. They these these guys know what life's about is in that thing like they know what's up and they don't right because they're just kids. Right. I don't know how you phrase it but you have a way of saying like

954
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't know what's up and they're acting like they got life figured out like you're able to see it from a distance. Right.

955
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you use your own phrase what describe what your boys are doing. So I have the right phrase.

956
01:38:56.190 --> 01:38:56.790
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

957
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.330
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

958
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:03.300
Daniel Guerrero: There's a, there's a lot you know the

959
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:12.510
Daniel Guerrero: You know, honestly, you know, the way they think they just, they just feel like they kind of like figured it out because

960
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:21.480
Daniel Guerrero: You know, they can. Okay, for an example. My son has a job he's 20 years old and he has a job.

961
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:28.920
Daniel Guerrero: And honestly, he works for me. He's, he's one of my he's under me as an employee, you know, so he works on my ship.

962
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:36.690
Daniel Guerrero: And so he's been working, you know, in the business for six months.

963
01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:52.590
Daniel Guerrero: And he swears he knows everything about a burger joint that there is to know about it. You can't tell them why because he's already. He's already. He's been there and he knows everything there is to know about the position that he works, but he still doesn't get it right. Yeah.

964
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry to interrupt you.

965
01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:54.720
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

966
01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:59.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, you've had time to think about that. I know your story.

967
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: He thinks he's got it figured out, being a kid. He's gonna be a kid he's gonna have an underground brain. What do we talk about tell what age.

968
01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.440
Daniel Guerrero: 27

969
01:41:10.770 --> 01:41:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it is obviously a kid. His job is to learn

970
01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:21.870
Daniel Guerrero: You know what I put that and I put that a lot to put that in there too, because I'm like, you know, yeah, you know,

971
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Now your job if you choose to do it a lot of parents don't don't really choose to be conscious parents, your parents didn't choose to be conscious. They didn't have the time the resources and you have suffered from it.

972
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:42.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But you want it. I can tell. I hear it often. But it doesn't mean that all the rules come laid out.

973
01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There are books out there, there is information on what to do, but I suspect there's something going on around the belief you have about yourself. So let's just sit with that for just a second. You and I are in agreement.

974
01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That kids think he knows what's up and he doesn't. It's true. He's a kid.

975
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: None of them do. We can't be mad at that. Like how they supposed to, well, we don't want them to grow up too fast and they, how they supposed to know

976
01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:23.430
Daniel Guerrero: Well, I mean, that's exactly right. You know, and it's it's like it's like my 15 year old he's all like, I'm just a kid. I'm 15 I'm doing what they quit talking to me like you're fucking grown, bro.

977
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.780
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

978
01:42:25.170 --> 01:42:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's hold that right there. Let's get into it. I love the precision. I want to hear what he said to you, why is he, what do you mean he's talking to you like he's grown. I want to hear the words you use

979
01:42:35.610 --> 01:42:36.630
Daniel Guerrero: I don't like on

980
01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:38.070
The

981
01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:41.820
Daniel Guerrero: Spot the bush. It's cool, man. I hate this book.

982
01:42:45.330 --> 01:42:55.860
Daniel Guerrero: I'm like bro, you have to go so you can become to get an education. What I do work at a down burger joint for the rest of the day in life, but I have a career, don't you, the positive in your life.

983
01:42:57.390 --> 01:43:07.560
Daniel Guerrero: So yeah, but I hate just focus. You know, I'm just like, Look, I'm not cursing at you. Don't let me change, you know, change the way your tune with me, you know,

984
01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:17.370
Daniel Guerrero: Now I'm pretty guy, but when I started cussing at me, you know, and started raising her voice it. I mean, okay. No trigger something, you know,

985
01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. That's the one you got it now.

986
01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on to it, you got it.

987
01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not content. If he says, Dad, I hate the school.

988
01:43:34.650 --> 01:43:35.190
You know that

989
01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: People have the even the teachers are yelling at each other and they don't take the kids don't take it seriously and

990
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And I feel criticized there. And I feel like

991
01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's a waste of my time.

992
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that is triggering as

993
01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: All the way he does it.

994
01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:03.930
Daniel Guerrero: Right, you know, because you know there's there's a way to come across with communication. I, I feel like because

995
01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:18.840
Daniel Guerrero: I'm my whole life. I was raised with, you know, the ways to communicate. Right. And I'm sure we all are, but my family was different, you know, like, why did you say it like this when you could have said it.

996
01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.050
Daniel Guerrero: You know, like this, you know, for example.

997
01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:23.640
Daniel Guerrero: Um,

998
01:44:25.650 --> 01:44:30.120
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's like, Oh, I like this puppy. She's fucking grows. Why, you feel me this.

999
01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no.

1000
01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:33.090
Daniel Guerrero: I'm not

1001
01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:36.570
Daniel Guerrero: No, I'm not a fucking dog instead of being like

1002
01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:43.380
Daniel Guerrero: The other way you could have been as, like, look, Dad, I really don't like you know to spaghetti. Can you make me a sandwich.

1003
01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:44.280
Right.

1004
01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:50.940
Daniel Guerrero: Rather than I like to split the shit why you're feeding me. What am I fucking dog. You know, like dead right there.

1005
01:44:51.120 --> 01:45:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that no, let me check. Is that happening in your home now, or is that how your, your childhood talk to each other, your family of origin who talks like that we talked

1006
01:45:01.050 --> 01:45:02.190
Daniel Guerrero: About me. No, no, you know,

1007
01:45:02.250 --> 01:45:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what's happening now.

1008
01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:13.770
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah but but before you know even on it. You'd happen you know as I was a kid, you know, this is the way my dad. We talked to my mom. Yeah, okay.

1009
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.730
Daniel Guerrero: So,

1010
01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So Daniel, you recognize that it's not the healthy way to speak to one another, but you're modeling is the same thing.

1011
01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, how you get. Now you've been away for a little while. I think I'm not sure away from these kids as they've been coming up or no.

1012
01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:32.850
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, well,

1013
01:45:34.530 --> 01:45:37.410
Daniel Guerrero: I was gone. I was gone for 18 months, you know,

1014
01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I can have an impact. I mean, I don't know.

1015
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:45.480
Daniel Guerrero: But before the 18 months before the 18 months.

1016
01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:48.480
Daniel Guerrero: I was gone.

1017
01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:52.680
Daniel Guerrero: For about a year for another 18 months. Right.

1018
01:45:53.700 --> 01:46:01.560
Daniel Guerrero: On my own ambitions on on my own, you know, getting high one in the street selling drugs doing drugs.

1019
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So over two years. So that is a lot

1020
01:46:06.570 --> 01:46:10.290
Daniel Guerrero: And not and not, you know, making them a priority and so

1021
01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:19.170
Daniel Guerrero: No, and I'm gonna agree. I agree with, with this is that, you know, I've let them raise themselves to a point that we're

1022
01:46:19.770 --> 01:46:30.090
Daniel Guerrero: Now that I'm trying to change them. They don't want to change because I feel like it's too much work. Yeah, you don't have a good attitude because they're so used to the negativity, because the negativity is so simple.

1023
01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's not a moment. Let's have a moment. We got only got 10 minutes left.

1024
01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just just close your eyes to the degree that you can tolerate that. My eyes are closed. Let's turn away turn away from there for just a moment. I want you to sit with this idea

1025
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what it would be like

1026
01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: To not be your son's friend.

1027
01:46:56.790 --> 01:47:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To sit with it. So, not their friend, they won't like what I say.

1028
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: They won't like my rules.

1029
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be a parent.

1030
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be shaping

1031
01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Behavior.

1032
01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It reflects what I believe in.

1033
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: They won't be my friend.

1034
01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: They won't like what I'm saying.

1035
01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's being a parent.

1036
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:32.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's inconvenient. It's hard work.

1037
01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And they won't like it.

1038
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: So as I invited you to think about that role.

1039
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: As a parent, which is not the same as a friend.

1040
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you notice where your mind wandered and what came up for you.

1041
01:47:58.800 --> 01:47:59.610
Daniel Guerrero: For me it's like

1042
01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:03.600
Daniel Guerrero: You know, they're not even a one in a relationship with me, you know,

1043
01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:05.790
Daniel Guerrero: Just like

1044
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:11.700
Daniel Guerrero: You know, and I try this, try this all the time. You know, I'm like,

1045
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:14.010
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I get that shit.

1046
01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:19.110
Daniel Guerrero: I don't like this, dude. They can't be dude when they're mad at me right

1047
01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:22.590
Daniel Guerrero: I like this fucking do that do

1048
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:25.920
Daniel Guerrero: What kind of get that

1049
01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:29.010
Daniel Guerrero: And, you know, for me, it's

1050
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:32.070
Daniel Guerrero: You know, what am I doing wrong, you know,

1051
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:41.820
Daniel Guerrero: You know i'm not i don't i don't party with my kids I don't drink with them. I don't get high with them. I don't you know get there. My parents

1052
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:49.860
Daniel Guerrero: My dad get first line of cocaine. He gave me my first film the marijuana

1053
01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:55.110
Daniel Guerrero: I went with him on his first traffic run with methamphetamines you know they did that.

1054
01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:59.250
Daniel Guerrero: And I don't I don't do that with my kids, you know,

1055
01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:01.590
Daniel Guerrero: For me it's it's

1056
01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:04.680
Daniel Guerrero: Because

1057
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:09.840
Daniel Guerrero: I did that with them, they will not respect me. I mean, they don't respect me anyway but

1058
01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1059
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You just said a lot

1060
01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That is

1061
01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not what I've heard you say you want you want this life that has this spiritual connection.

1062
01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You want them to have opportunity and choice through education, they can go and whatever, as adults, they do what they want to do, but at least you're creating this platform with which to spring from you have consistency and you can provide that. But what you just described.

1063
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:48.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All you know is to not do that horrific stuff. It doesn't mean that you know what to do.

1064
01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: It's complicated, being a parent, a conscious. One is hard. It's hard for professionals. Okay.

1065
01:50:00.330 --> 01:50:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

1066
01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself acknowledgement that just an just knowing you don't want it this bad way. Let's say doesn't automatically mean you know what to do. So give yourself a break. This is complicated stuff. This is the realm of professionals are needed.

1067
01:50:21.330 --> 01:50:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Even the dude part. I mean, it's like

1068
01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't be calling me dude. So we have to start somewhere, Daniel.

1069
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I have you here. I don't have a whole whole room full of your family, which I could definitely do. But I've got you. So I'm going to start with you, which is not to say that, how they feel that these boys, because the first thing out of your mouth when I did that exercise was

1070
01:50:46.170 --> 01:50:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But they may not want a relationship with me. I mean, there's a, there's a, there's a piece of I WANT CONNECTION WITH THESE KIDS. I want love there too. I don't just want to be right.

1071
01:50:57.810 --> 01:50:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: This was

1072
01:50:58.470 --> 01:51:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: An area. I know you do. And that's why I started where I did, which I wanted to just sort of tap in a little bit and see if you could tolerate

1073
01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Not being light at some points in this parenting process in order to re instill the values as a parent, because as a parent.

1074
01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:21.810
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't always like what we're doing.

1075
01:51:22.890 --> 01:51:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But in the end,

1076
01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: We have an adult that learned

1077
01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you kind of do need to earn reward can't steal it can't sling it

1078
01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:51.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Around and they earned it. They earn it in school we earn it like you're going to earn it. Again, you're going to make that call for GED, you're going to, you're going to do things that are harder and and no one can take that from you and I can see you want it for them.

1079
01:51:58.110 --> 01:52:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: But anger gets in there and it's something when they say to you that volume of voice.

1080
01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That violation that relived pain of early childhood is coming up.

1081
01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to do next time we meet, if we can, I want to do some some specific therapeutic interventions that can desensitize some of that for you. So that anger isn't so close by. So it's you're not running hot

1082
01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd love for you to be able to cool and calm, be able to have access to your all of your brain and be able to say to your son.

1083
01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't hear what you're saying.

1084
01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Because of the way you're saying it.

1085
01:52:48.150 --> 01:52:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: If you continue doing this, then List, list List, list of consequences that will happen, but

1086
01:52:56.550 --> 01:53:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What ends up happening. I'm guessing is you match the intensity, you're gonna come at me like that that disrespectful right you you reach that same intensity with them know

1087
01:53:07.890 --> 01:53:09.150
Daniel Guerrero: We do that. Yeah.

1088
01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well good. That means I'm my hypothesis is so that's great. I just want you to know that when this is gonna sound really ironic when you actually own your power, you're actually a lot more powerful than you realize. In that moment.

1089
01:53:25.110 --> 01:53:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're very powerful. You're the parent

1090
01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to flaunt it, you never have to pop up. You never have to yell and that's weird. It's like, wait a minute, what. Think about it. The cool cat that can sit back and it's like you're going to keep doing that.

1091
01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:45.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Germany, I say what's about to go down.

1092
01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep it up. Keep the phone.

1093
01:53:52.350 --> 01:54:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's going to be, you're going to stay home and then you don't get to go out and you want this and you want those shoes and boob, whatever, and that you and I will get into the nuance of it later. But the point of the matter is,

1094
01:54:04.230 --> 01:54:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: He's. Gotcha.

1095
01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: He's got your when you lose it. When you lose your cool right

1096
01:54:12.330 --> 01:54:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're not operating as parent anymore.

1097
01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:18.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You've lost that battle.

1098
01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:31.380
Daniel Guerrero: A lot of sense to man. Because, I mean, I agree with that 100% because like, you know, I would like to be more of a, you know, an effective parent that's, you know, if you understand where I'm coming from, you know,

1099
01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: I do and it's right in there. It's this

1100
01:54:36.450 --> 01:54:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to have some place to start for some people it is

1101
01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I noticed the thought, I'm offended. Most people resonate with I felt disrespected that that's probably one of yours right I feel disrespected

1102
01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:53.130
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah yeah

1103
01:54:53.850 --> 01:54:54.210
Daniel Guerrero: It's a good

1104
01:54:54.450 --> 01:55:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You probably you probably noticed that one first. I feel disrespected, so that's when you do the breath.

1105
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care if you look silly if you even have to do it right in front of them. But if your conviction is to not repeat the damage that your parents did to you.

1106
01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't take the time to brave.

1107
01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:23.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You will give you enough seconds fractions of a second to remember the other stuff. We're going to learn

1108
01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm already the parent. I already have more power than this kid. I already know the truth. I already know how hard it is. I already know.

1109
01:55:34.890 --> 01:55:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That running that game you lose, you lose, you make it short.

1110
01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Wins like there'll be a flood of money. All of a sudden, you might have a few things for a little while. But in the end, you won't have anything you already know you've lived it. You already have all the information that you need. They don't know that.

1111
01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You're the adult

1112
01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But you forget because what is coming at you is a relived distress of your own childhood someone yelling at you. And so all of that puffs up

1113
01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: But our work together over time it will dissipate, it will get better. Okay.

1114
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But for you. It's once i i noticed I just got disrespected, I'm going to do some breathing. I'm going to do the box breathing, do your thing. You got that we walk away go and do that for sure. That's amazing. Give yourself some time to collect yourself.

1115
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And then let's get into

1116
01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that lecturing and yelling

1117
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is effective

1118
01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Has it worked to shape their behavior with them. Is it getting them to change.

1119
01:56:52.410 --> 01:56:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I'm going to say this.

1120
01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Weeks, months from now, it will work even this will work.

1121
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Because now that

1122
01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Will have meaning it will have consequences attached to it.

1123
01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now it doesn't have anything

1124
01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's got no negative consequence. I just have to tolerate this yelling in this webinar.

1125
01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing attached to it.

1126
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Flash forward into what is possible in the future is if I roll out consequence. Listen man, I can't do it the way I've been doing it. I'm doing it like my family stress them out.

1127
01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I knew I was gone for those two years that's on me. I want to do better. I'm learning more, I want to do better. I want to do this differently. I'm going to show you

1128
01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be here for you. I'm reliable and consistent and this is how it's going to show up, but tell you in advance. Right now, how it's going to go down.

1129
01:57:58.260 --> 01:57:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You call me do it again.

1130
01:58:02.250 --> 01:58:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to write sentences.

1131
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:07.170
Daniel Guerrero: Oh yeah, that's a good one.

1132
01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's got some precision to it, too.

1133
01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: When you write sentences. You don't want to say dude in it because you're reinforcing the word, dude.

1134
01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have them right so in advance. You say, hey, you know what, if you call me do it again because I it hits harder. I'm not dude let's find a name. You can call me.

1135
01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you call me dad or, I don't know, whatever you guys agree on, right, if you do it again. We'll start off easy and you're going to be writing the following sense. I call my dad.

1136
01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Father or dad I call my dad.

1137
01:58:51.570 --> 01:58:52.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of respect.

1138
01:58:53.940 --> 01:59:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's going to be your sentence. It's a long one. So he may only do it 20 times is that's really easy actually. But what will

1139
01:59:04.110 --> 01:59:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Happen.

1140
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Stop here and

1141
01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch back promise you.

1142
01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:16.620
Daniel Guerrero: Promise. All right, man.

1143
01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Awesome stupid right promise you.

1144
01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Your job, like I said, the parent consistent follow through consistent follows through do say something you're not willing to do this sentence business. Don't even bother until you're ready, don't even do it for another couple weeks till we're ready.

1145
01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't do it until you can actually follow through. It does more damage because then, again, once again, you know, I need and follow through. So all you gotta do what you gotta do with him. He's just push a little harder.

1146
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You're teaching them all they have to do is push, push, push, push. Eventually you'll break and you'll yell, and then it'll be over and they will have gotten their way and there's no consequence.

1147
02:00:00.930 --> 02:00:01.560
Daniel Guerrero: And that's exactly

1148
02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the alternative is what happens is they start to learn over time. Let's say it goes like this. And eventually what you and I do is we break down this contingency.

1149
02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It sentences and I'll continue to do this, adding every time. If you give me like you give me attitude we know what it is you pop off without yelling at me or call me another name on each time you do it on an add another 10 seconds.

1150
02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're sitting here cools, a cat. Now, you already gave me a heads up, this House is going to go down. So that's not coming out of left field. Remember yesterday, I told you this, I was going to go and you just send some nasty thing to mom.

1151
02:00:40.530 --> 02:00:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't work for me. So I'm going to write the sentence down got 20 of them a year, I need to get them done in the next 15 minutes

1152
02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now it's at now. It's a 25 and you're going to have and you're just cool you follow through.

1153
02:00:58.050 --> 02:01:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're doing is the way life is. And I can't. What do you even know real time you got upset with a manager, what happened. We can't do that in the real world. We can't lose our duty. We got to keep it together or we lose our job we're doing

1154
02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: We're teaching a kid. You can't do that to to a parent. We're learning how to do that in our little microcosm, and then they can go out into the world and think and apply those rules. Okay, let's put a pin in it. Lots and lots of talk about

1155
02:01:29.730 --> 02:01:33.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to continue to meet. Let me see if I have this timing open next week.

1156
02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:37.290
I don't

1157

Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, but I have February 27 already booked for you at nine.

1158
02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.460
Daniel Guerrero: On Thursday at 927 to nine. Sounds good.

02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, no. Okay so uh you you heard a lot today. That's a lot to take in. I don't expect all of it to stick

1160
02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, we'll revisit the parenting, we can revisit anger, we can revisit resume GD we can revisit all of it. Just pick one thing to do today. You don't have to overwhelm yourself. Okay. Just pick one, that one, you want to focus on
