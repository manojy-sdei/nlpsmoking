00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.820

22
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.310
Ryan Ashoo: Oh, but the my other job I got laid off from yesterday so

23
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.260
Helena Rouhe: Yeah.

24
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:47.250
Helena Rouhe: So, are you okay with where you're going to live for a little while. Are you feeling like you've got that covered. Or what are the ramifications of the layoff.

25
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.630
Ryan Ashoo: Though I'm filing for unemployment.

26
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.190
Ryan Ashoo: I don't really have any other choice. I have to. Otherwise, I'm not gonna pay my rent and

27
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.480
Ryan Ashoo: Like my rent and I don't have a place to live, are going to buy me me me good.

28
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.010
Helena Rouhe: Night.

29
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.310
Ryan Ashoo: No incredible because none of this is my fault. And I really don't want to end up going back to something that I didn't do anything wrong. And, you know,

30
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.110
Helena Rouhe: Right.

31
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.100
Ryan Ashoo: It makes it difficult definitely stressful.

32
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.300
Yeah.

33
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:37.650
Helena Rouhe: Well, I think that they're, you know, the hard and fast rules of yesteryear maybe going to be a little bit lightened to your point, because it's not your fault, but at the same time. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be making

34
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.450
Helena Rouhe: Every effort to be proactive and follow up on what you need to do on your side. So

35
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.030
Ryan Ashoo: Right. You know, I was going to apply for more jobs, but they shut down all the businesses down here in these little towns.

36
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.350
Ryan Ashoo: And the company that I'm working for right now, it's just a little like Mom and Pop restaurant.

37
00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.910
Ryan Ashoo: But

38
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:11.340
Ryan Ashoo: You know she's not closing where instead of closing. You can't have customers were just going to deliver people food and have certainly right

39
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.150
Ryan Ashoo: I mean, keep pointing away from

40
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:27.300
Ryan Ashoo: And keep really really trying to help me out because he said that if I lose my place of that because like a

41
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.540
Ryan Ashoo: Trailer on her property and he says that he'll help me clean it up and clean it out and to let me move in there.

42
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.510
Ryan Ashoo: And, you know, really trying. Usually we're only open from eight in the morning to be in the afternoon.

43
00:03:46.620 --> 00:04:03.390
Ryan Ashoo: Mondays is the only days that I work all day there, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I only work from six in the morning and in the morning, but that that with everything going on because everywhere else to shut down is going to be people stay open for like nine o'clock at night.

44
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:13.200
Ryan Ashoo: Well, okay. Let me read it to myself for all my meetings with my counselor and stuff. And then I can go back workout to that.

45
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.290
Ryan Ashoo: For them good

46
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.580
Good.

47
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.140
Helena Rouhe: Well, that sounds like a great plan and you can't ask for anything better than that. Right. Given these crazy circumstances.

48
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.770
Ryan Ashoo: And it can I getting a job with

49
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.590
Ryan Ashoo: It was kind of cool because I didn't. I wasn't applying for it. I did. I went in to get breakfast one morning and I was talking to one of the people there.

50
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:51.030
Ryan Ashoo: And they were saying, me, me at work every day and they asked me to go over there. And I said, Yes. And he asked me if I am cooking experience of, like, yeah, I'm a cook right now and

51
00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:03.720
Ryan Ashoo: And he was like, Well, are you interested in the job. And I was like, actually yes like only part time time. I was like, well, that's cool. Cuz I'm only working part time now. Right.

52
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.190
Ryan Ashoo: Right, it worked out. And then I got laid off here. You know, so

53
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.030
Yeah.

54
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.850
Helena Rouhe: Well, hopefully this will work out this new thing. It sounds like that's a, you know, she's going to try and help you out. So that sounds really good.

55
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.380
Helena Rouhe: So are you guys still able to do meetings and things like that. They're not shutting down

56
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.480
Ryan Ashoo: Meeting no area.

57
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.290
Ryan Ashoo: From what I

58
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.830
Helena Rouhe: Do and

59
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:45.870
Ryan Ashoo: I talked to one of my counselors out here, and I guess the parole office is closed. Mm hmm. So I'm not sure how are checking with our shows are supposed to work. I'm on an ankle bracelet, so they can still monitor me show it. I mean,

60
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.720
Helena Rouhe: You have a phone number to be able to just

61
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.650
Helena Rouhe: Call and chicken.

62
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.960
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah. And so I think that's what they're going to have everybody do is go home.

63
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:05.340
Ryan Ashoo: Oh, so as far as counseling goes my counselor is for have a private concert. So she wasn't affected by the state shut down.

64
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:22.620
Ryan Ashoo: Okay, and she said she's going to stay open. Okay, that is patients are worried about getting sick or whatever that they don't have to come in, they do it over the phone, but as long as we're not worried about it. Don't worry about it.

65
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.960
Ryan Ashoo: Mm hmm.

66
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.900
Helena Rouhe: Well, good. So I'm glad to hear that. You sound like you still have some decent support in a plan to kind of manage your responsibilities.

67
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.080
Ryan Ashoo: Good.

68
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.530
Helena Rouhe: So how are things going with your family with your sister and all of that excitement that was going on before

69
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.040
Ryan Ashoo: I mean,

70
00:06:48.900 --> 00:07:02.970
Ryan Ashoo: I don't know. I don't know what her thing is. And the reason this dude and then goes back to them and then leaves and goes back from it and let it go. And then about two and a half weeks ago.

71
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:16.560
Ryan Ashoo: She was getting ready to go out of town for work and there's an old man now you're in one of the towns and does he used to take care of him. We had like

72
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:31.260
Ryan Ashoo: I don't know, broken dead for or something like that. And so to take care of them. And then he asked me to go with her to help her boots. Some of the furniture and when we got there. We had killed themselves.

73
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.150
Helena Rouhe: My lord,

74
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:42.870
Ryan Ashoo: God himself in the head. And so, you know, definitely having problems.

75
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.010
Ryan Ashoo: You know, so it's been stressful. I've tried to be there for her life. And, you know,

76
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.610
Ryan Ashoo: When I walked in the house and I seen him. I tried to stop her from walking around the corner.

77
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.420
Ryan Ashoo: But he walked in any way.

78
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:14.250
Ryan Ashoo: So when she went outside. I will cover them up and then we call the cops and the ambulance, everybody. And, you know, they came and

79
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:26.640
Ryan Ashoo: kind of stuck because of me being on for old they were kind of treating me like I did it. They took us to the police station question us for like eight hours, and they were building

80
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.130
Ryan Ashoo: And I

81
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:38.190
Ryan Ashoo: Told them. I'm like, you guys can track me every movement of the day you guys said that he's been dead for like 12 hours, then you know I wasn't there.

82
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:52.980
Ryan Ashoo: And it says they wouldn't leave us alone and wasn't so much me that I was bad about like desert. They had no reason to talking to her, the way they were. And so I kind of lost my cool with them.

83
00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.120
Ryan Ashoo: You know i i did the end up getting a hold of client hurting somebody in 30 days down there.

84
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:13.170
Ryan Ashoo: But I have to call my PO, they were trying to arrest me and I kind of got upset. Probably a little more upset than I should have said something that I probably shouldn't have said, but

85
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.990
Ryan Ashoo: You know, there was a lot of things going on. It was very hectic and I do

86
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.830
Ryan Ashoo: I don't do good in situations like that, especially when I feel like I'm being cornered. Yeah.

87
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.320
Ryan Ashoo: So,

88
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.230
Helena Rouhe: Well, do you feel like, I mean,

89
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.450
Helena Rouhe: Is this something you can learn from as far as what

90
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.260
Helena Rouhe: Its gonna be terrible situation. I don't know if that's something we can learn from someone to survive, but

91
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.410
Ryan Ashoo: I mean, I guess, kind of, in that sense, but

92
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.270
Ryan Ashoo: Oh,

93
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.880
Ryan Ashoo: I know it's not really a good thing, but I'm kind of seeing things like that so

94
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.590
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah, we didn't affect me.

95
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.070
Ryan Ashoo: As much

96
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.360
Ryan Ashoo: As my sister and I like to get some talk to one of the counselors out here that I see.

97
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:11.580
Ryan Ashoo: Because free counseling and things like that. I thought it would be a good idea for my sister to go but

98
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:25.410
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, things like that. We can't force upon people, they have to decide when they want to manage it and sometimes they can manage it on their own, and other times they're going to need somebody to talk to. But they won't do it unless they're ready so

99
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.950
Helena Rouhe: I think to being available with the information so she can be

100
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.510
Helena Rouhe: Ready new

101
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.400
Helena Rouhe: Take it when she's ready to receive it.

102
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.770
Ryan Ashoo: Right, you know, having a lot of trouble sleeping, yes.

103
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.570
Ryan Ashoo: You know, it just kind of mentor up very fast. So

104
00:10:46.560 --> 00:11:01.230
Ryan Ashoo: Rough and then, you know, dealing with that and then dealing with it. Do that off and on with and, you know, then the house that I was living with her at when I had to go speak to the first boyfriend.

105
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.660
Ryan Ashoo: Couldn't afford the rent.

106
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.910
Ryan Ashoo: got kicked out and now she's kind of bouncing for please, please.

107
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:15.480
Ryan Ashoo: No staying in hotels here they're leaving us out of nowhere to go.

108
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:25.170
Ryan Ashoo: And I worry about that, especially with everything going on now know everywhere, getting shut down and it just

109
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:31.710
Ryan Ashoo: I worry about her being done you know it. Things are starting to get hectic.

110
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.630
Ryan Ashoo: They just activated the National Guard out here. So I don't know.

111
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.990
Ryan Ashoo: Oh really. Oh, that's probably going to happen with that.

112
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:53.670
Ryan Ashoo: And my P O letter come stay with me so right. You know, I've kind of been doing that anyway might feel fine. Val. I'm going to give my lead for the way but

113
00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:02.400
Ryan Ashoo: It is what it is. I'm not exactly going to be on the screen, especially with all this but not have anything in particular for

114
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:05.370
Ryan Ashoo: Sure.

115
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.210
Helena Rouhe: Is there anywhere else. She can say that you would feel like it's trustworthy enough or no.

116
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.710
Ryan Ashoo: No, but you throw Gabby and I don't want to wait now.

117
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.510
Ryan Ashoo: I mean, the last couple weeks, you've been asked to do

118
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.180
Ryan Ashoo: And so he's been definitely struggling with that thank you know but

119
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:39.270
Ryan Ashoo: I've been there and being put out on the street when you're going to that you're just going to go right back to it. There's no way around

120
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.840
Ryan Ashoo: So I would rather take the risk of having like to Pepsi and violate the event.

121
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.710
Ryan Ashoo: ever go back using and dying on

122
00:12:52.890 --> 00:13:01.350
Helena Rouhe: Well, let me just throw something else out there if you get violated, you have to go back to jail where she gonna say she say where you're saying

123
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:08.280
Ryan Ashoo: They were my houses. Yeah. So landlord, we'll just let her take over the least feel comfortable

124
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:18.030
Helena Rouhe: Well, hopefully you don't get violated that I would, you know, see if there's a way to have a conversation with your PO so that you can be

125
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.070
Helena Rouhe: Having an opportunity to be

126
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:33.450
Helena Rouhe: upfront about what's going on. And maybe it's just something along the lines of, I'm still really concerned about my sister. She's never any workspace to say, can you give me any suggestions. I'm really worried about her safety. I don't want to go back out on the street.

127
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.980
Helena Rouhe: Now maybe

128
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.720
Helena Rouhe: See her case and see if

129
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.620
Ryan Ashoo: She has

130
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:44.190
Ryan Ashoo: Other options. I kind of already talked to her about it and she really wasn't willing to put

131
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.670
Ryan Ashoo: Up their hands like this group, go to joy junction

132
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.930
Ryan Ashoo: Which is like a homeless shelter.

133
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.480
Ryan Ashoo: And I'm not going to do that.

134
00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.410
Yeah.

135
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:14.280
Helena Rouhe: Well, I think that if even if the conversation that you have with your PO was a couple of days ago. Things are changing. It's such a quick pace. Maybe you can talk to your PO again and see if there would be a different option because things are changing.

136
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.950
Helena Rouhe: Now every day. And maybe there would be

137
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:23.880
Helena Rouhe: A willingness to kind of see other things like I guess it's okay for to stay with you, but just, you know,

138
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.890
Helena Rouhe: Keep me in the loop or

139
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.710
Helena Rouhe: Make it just be better for you if you could have

140
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:30.480
Ryan Ashoo: You know,

141
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.290
Helena Rouhe: Have that be aboveboard and not something that you're having to worry about.

142
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:44.100
Helena Rouhe: So you need to make your own decisions there obviously that I just want to advocate for you to continue to have those conversations, just because I think

143
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:52.980
Helena Rouhe: The world is a very fluid place right now. And I think that was what was true, you know, even a week ago. It's not necessarily true today and hopefully

144
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.190
Helena Rouhe: You could convince your PO to kind of see

145
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.620
Helena Rouhe: Some other options other than just the whole bunch

146
00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:58.740
Of

147
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:00.300
Ryan Ashoo: Really

148
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.910
Helena Rouhe: A good solution given what you're talking about with pretty much the three plus right so

149
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:15.360
Helena Rouhe: Then as well. And the is your sister working, what is she doing to kind of keep yourself busy during the day.

150
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:24.180
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah, working and her company isn't really affected by a while. I mean, I get to a point, it is but

151
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.770
Ryan Ashoo: She does.

152
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:37.560
Ryan Ashoo: merchandising for a company called Apollo. So he goes to like gas stations and ballparks and miss and places like that and

153
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:49.140
Ryan Ashoo: That's up displays and you know stock new certain items that they're only having for, you know, certain period nine or whatever and

154
00:15:50.580 --> 00:16:03.030
Ryan Ashoo: Things like that. So, and if she doesn't all over the state. So I'm luckily travel kind of limited right now. So she's not really having to go too far away.

155
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.000
Ryan Ashoo: No, so

156
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:15.060
Ryan Ashoo: They said that if she doesn't feel comfortable coming in. They don't have to, but if they want to keep working. They are not going to stop so

157
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.660
Ryan Ashoo: Working staying busy.

158
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:29.550
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah, he's not eating as much. It's not sleeping as much as he could be been he's been through a lot

159
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:31.170
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah.

160
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:37.590
Helena Rouhe: How about you. Are you getting enough sleep and food and taking care of yourself in those ways

161
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.040
Ryan Ashoo: I definitely didn't know

162
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.020
Ryan Ashoo: My greeting is still the same. I really still owe me

163
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.990
Helena Rouhe: Did you talk to Dr. Element about that.

164
00:16:50.190 --> 00:17:02.670
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah, I did, um, you know, and he recommended trying melatonin and, you know, working out during the days when I had before bed and watching TV, things like that.

165
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.900
Ryan Ashoo: And I really don't watch much the

166
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:16.020
Ryan Ashoo: And then, you know, I worked out. But I, it doesn't. None of it help my phone.

167
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.400
Helena Rouhe: And I

168
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.580
Ryan Ashoo: End up with a really bad headache in the morning because I

169
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.490
Ryan Ashoo: You know I fall asleep and I started dreaming. And then if I'm up

170
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:37.920
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, so the, so he understands that the reason you have sleep issues because of your night terrors, not because you can't go to sleep.

171
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.090
Right.

172
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:52.320
Helena Rouhe: Well, I guess we'll just kind of keep seeing if there's other ways to solve that, because I feel like there might be some different kind of medications, but maybe he's not comfortable having you take those so

173
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.880
Ryan Ashoo: Right. And I, I'm kind of against it, too.

174
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.840
Ryan Ashoo: I just, I don't know. I

175
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.220
Ryan Ashoo: Just never really done good getting put on met um

176
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.130
Ryan Ashoo: I don't know why it just

177
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:27.030
Ryan Ashoo: Makes me depressed makes me angry, frustrated. I just, you know, finally being clean and off of drugs. And yeah, I really kind of upset about being on the Suboxone program because I feel like I just traded one addiction for another you know is

178
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:45.570
Ryan Ashoo: Last Friday I got my prescription sent in. And then the Walmart that that was here was like 45 minutes from my house, but it's the only one that I'm allowed to go. This is the only one in the entire county and I can't leave the county well in your heart on fire.

179
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:53.160
Ryan Ashoo: So they weren't worried, and I couldn't pick up my prescription and they were like, well,

180
00:18:54.060 --> 00:19:10.890
Ryan Ashoo: You know, we should be open tomorrow. Well, tomorrow came and they weren't open and then Monday came and they weren't open and then Monday night, I got a hold of the virtual clinic, who got a hold of another doctor and I had them transfer my prescription to Alberta.

181
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.480
Ryan Ashoo: And by the time my sister got there the pharmacy was closed.

182
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.260
Ryan Ashoo: So Tuesday I ended up having to get it won't by Tuesday I was already taking pretty hard.

183
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:31.830
Ryan Ashoo: You know, taking three scripts, a day and by four days without it. I was. It was starting to get bad and then

184
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:41.490
Ryan Ashoo: By the time I got it to the evening and took my first one. You know, I hadn't slept Sunday I hadn't worked Monday.

185
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:49.530
Ryan Ashoo: Tuesday night I took the one hasn't slept with up all night. Don't go into work at six in the morning.

186
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.870
Ryan Ashoo: And it comes all the way until last night restless leg. The anxiety.

187
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.920
Ryan Ashoo: And though.

188
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.350
Ryan Ashoo: You know, it's been rough

189
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:05.550
Helena Rouhe: Know,

190
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:16.920
Ryan Ashoo: It's been rough and you know it's like I was telling my counselor yesterday, it's a good thing that I couldn't get heroin, it's a good thing that I don't have any connect because I probably would have

191
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:34.320
Helena Rouhe: Well, I mean, yeah, that whole thing that the pharmacy is terrible and something that's avoided that that's the whole reason for the Suboxone right is under stressful situations to keep you from using and but I understand what you're

192
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:41.550
Helena Rouhe: What you're sharing is it was this or that you are having major kind of concerns there. So,

193
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:55.260
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, you can certainly talk to darker Omen about what it would look like for you to taper mean you can take her down maybe to a little bit different dosage that might make it a little less stressful is things were

194
00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.210
Helena Rouhe: Difficult to get ahold of Madson the nuts, something to talk to him about

195
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:07.710
Ryan Ashoo: Well, even tapering like they only taper of a quarter of a milligram at a time and

196
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:16.050
Ryan Ashoo: Like even tapering after three or four days without the bozos you start feeling it.

197
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:29.550
Helena Rouhe: No, I wouldn't want you to do it right now, but I just think that once you stabilize again, maybe you start feeling the taper and and you can do it very slowly. But if you're worried about the amount that you're taking that is an option.

198
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.850
Ryan Ashoo: It's not necessarily the amount that I'm taking it's just being on it. Period. And I know

199
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.470
Ryan Ashoo: I don't want to be feeling like a drug addict anymore. Right.

200
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.520
Helena Rouhe: Yeah yeah

201
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:48.720
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah, and I know that I need it because I know that right now. If I were to stop. I would go right back to using and I know

202
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.370
Helena Rouhe: So there. So there's your answer, but I understand where I understand that the both things.

203
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.270
Ryan Ashoo: Like cultural

204
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.830
Helena Rouhe: It is uncomfortable.

205
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:05.610
Helena Rouhe: Yeah, probably. I get it. I mean both things can be true. You know, you need it. But at the same time, it would be nice if you didn't. And it's frustrating because you are trying to

206
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.690
Ryan Ashoo: Reading Yeah, you know. Yeah, like people judge me because of it.

207
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:11.490
Yeah.

208
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.830
Helena Rouhe: Well, I, you know,

209
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:24.600
Helena Rouhe: I get it. I'm sorry that you're dealing with that struggle. But I have to say, I'm really impressed with your willingness to

210
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:32.640
Helena Rouhe: Hang in there and be determined and do all the things you need to do to keep yourself on the straight and narrow, and that's what it takes. It takes a lot of dedication

211
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:42.750
Helena Rouhe: To and determination to stay sober and to be in recovery until not let life and all its challenges, get in the way of that.

212
00:22:43.470 --> 00:23:00.540
Helena Rouhe: And certainly have plenty of opportunities where you could have gone out, but you know that you're done with that life and and so you're going to they're going to be tough times, but those tough times are way better than if you went out and experience the consequences of going out.

213
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:12.060
Helena Rouhe: So just try and remember that, which I'm sure is what you do when you have these tough moments you know the other side is not worth it, even though it feels like in the moment.

214
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:23.310
Helena Rouhe: It might be worth it and why I'm advocating for you to continue to try and find ways to have candid conversations with your PO regarding your sister, because again you work so hard and all these ways

215
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:32.790
Helena Rouhe: I wouldn't want something that's well meaning like you have in your sister getting away of you being able to live a functional life in society. So

216
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.690
Helena Rouhe: Maybe keep finding ways to chip away at that a little bit so that that doesn't become a concern for you.

217
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.680
Helena Rouhe: Or stay a concern for you, I should say.

218
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.210
Helena Rouhe: All right, well,

219
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.760
Helena Rouhe: I think you're doing great, you're handling a lot of crazy stuff. Good for you.

220
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.090
Helena Rouhe: Anything else you

221
00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.390
Helena Rouhe: Want me to be aware of or think that we need to touch base on

222
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.660
Ryan Ashoo: I think that's about it.

223
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:14.970
Helena Rouhe: Okay, so let's figure out a time when we can meet again in the past, we've done every two weeks. And then we had kind of some scheduling snafu with life.

224
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:27.870
Helena Rouhe: So what given everything that's going on. Are you okay with doing a touch base in two weeks, again, just to kind of see where everything stands, but I just feel like there's a lot of things happening right now so

225
00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:33.060
Helena Rouhe: Two weeks would be April 2 and I know your

226
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:36.960
Helena Rouhe: Time okay for you.

227
00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:40.530
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah. What time right

228
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.140
Ryan Ashoo: Right. Oh, yeah.

229
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.560
Helena Rouhe: Same time so 1pm Mountain Standard, is that okay

230
00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.210
Ryan Ashoo: Yeah, that works.

231
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:58.200
Helena Rouhe: Okay. And then if you need to change it because your schedule is fluid and things are moving around. Then just, you know, shoot me an email or let me know. We'll move it around, if we need to.

232
00:24:59.250 --> 00:24:59.580
Ryan Ashoo: Okay.

233
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.010
Ryan Ashoo: Okay, yo.

234
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.770
Helena Rouhe: And I'm going to reach out to Dr. Solomon and let them know that you made your appointment so that he's aware of that.

235
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.150
Ryan Ashoo: And

236
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:14.040
Helena Rouhe: You still have your group on Fridays. Right. Yes. Okay. Cool.

237
00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.900
Helena Rouhe: All right, well, Ryan. Hang in there. You're doing amazing

238
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.580
Ryan Ashoo: They do up the good

239
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.800
Helena Rouhe: Work, take care of yourself and I'll see you in two weeks. But let me know if you need anything between now and then.

240
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.450
Ryan Ashoo: OK, I will

241
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.900
Helena Rouhe: Okay, take care. All right, bye.
