00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Today is going to be a lot of the sort of similar questions sort of that same style lots of questions. It's not going to really be delving much into the psychotherapy part of our work together. I just, I need to get a history.

7
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you put me down somewhere on and you don't. There's no rush on it. I can be a bookshelf could be a stack of books could be dining table could be coffee table, but it would be nice, that I could see you and hear you.

8
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And you take your time kind of working that out you can maybe put a book in front of the phone or something like

9
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: That clip and I'll be opening up a note for us to get started.

10
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that's great, right there. That's cool.

11
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Excellent.

12
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're attending and

13
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Becca, Becca group, is that right

14
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.510
Yes.

15
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:36.270
Gwenevere Abriel: That's unique. I don't see a lot of clients that I don't also see in my groups. So kind of doing my best to be sort of flexible there.

16
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, and let's just see how it goes.

17
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to take a second because you and I haven't met really just to at least introduce myself a little bit so you know who I am. Okay, and then I'll get to know you through some of the questions that I'm going to ask you today.

18
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here in Florida, and I have been a Licensed Marriage and family therapist for about 21 years I've been licensed in New Mexico for going on three

19
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: In June, yeah I specifically got that license to work with bright heart health.

20
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been working with folks in chemical dependence and substance abuse, for I would say my entire career. I find it fascinating really enjoy working with the population. Good. Yeah. And just a couple of things.

21
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The phone

22
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I use you guys have my personal cell.

23
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Which means

24
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a cool thing because I get quick access if you want to confirm a schedule appointment with me or if something changes. You can reach me very quickly.

25
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: But what can happen for some people is they can get confused about that therapy might also happen through texting and it won't

26
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So what will happen is, yeah.

27
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: People can text me

28
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And

29
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be, let's say in distress you might be going through something and you messaged me a concern. But what the what you'll get back is it'll sound something like this. Are you able to meet in, zoom, because I want to meet in here to process, what's going on.

30
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So it can feel sometimes a little cold, the feeling in a text.

31
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.020
Debbie Barker: You know,

32
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't intend it to. But I'd like to say something like that so that we can meet in here and we can talk in person. Okay, you know,

33
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: If you think you're going to miss appointment, let me know 24 hours in advance so that I can book another client in that place that you won't be able to attend.

34
00:04:49.770 --> 00:05:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Either I'm an independent contractor, which means if you don't show up, then I'm done I don't earn a living. So will always try to schedule it around both of our schedules. So I'm not interfering in your work life balance, and vice versa.

35
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.350
Debbie Barker: To work.

36
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, that's basically it on my side. So what I'd like to do is I want to give you a little heads up about what today might look like.

37
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There today is not a day for the full long story that I want to go over very gently and carefully when you and I meet for individual therapy.

38
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What's today. Today is mostly going to be about pulling an history of when did it start, so you might hear me say how old were you how much, how often, how long, and then I might go to the next one.

39
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: On this substance. What age did you first sight started, how much, how often, how long was your most recent you so I'm looking for really short answers.

40
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.950
Gwenevere Abriel: This assessment is for me. I just have a little bit to sort of just gently. Get to know just tiny little pieces.

41
00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And then later on I'll get to know you more fully through longer conversations. So if you catch yourself kind of get delving into a longer story. You might hear me say, well, let's explore that later. And let's go on to the next question. It's not intended to cut you off.

42
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is a two hour assessment that I have to cram into one hour.

43
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I gotta move super quick. You ready

44
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yo, I'm excited. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to talk about the history of your opiate use

45
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're not going to talk about other substances, just for now let's just talk about when you first use the short acting opiate that would be percocet hydropower biking in and what was it for was it for a surgery. How did it all get started.

46
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.800
Debbie Barker: Um, it was back in 1983 and I fell down two flights of stairs.

47
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.380
Okay.

48
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And your doctor. So you had, was it a surgery, what, what was the injuries that you

49
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.020
Debbie Barker: For years later, I had my first surgery took them 40 years to figure out what was wrong.

50
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the surgery on

51
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.850
Debbie Barker: My back. Okay.

52
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:17.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and what injuries still remains. Like what's your current condition with your back. How is it diagnose what do you have

53
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.120
Debbie Barker: I have a fusion that's coming apart.

54
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.250
Debbie Barker: Yeah, I've had for a few for back surgeries.

55
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so have had for got it.

56
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So here it is. It's 1983 and I'm you were prescribed. Do you remember what you were prescribed back then. What that medication was the pain medicine.

57
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.760
Debbie Barker: I'm sure it was hydro

58
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Hydro so okay and so then you took it probably under the doctor's supervision and then after that, did you go to the streets, or did you start doctor shopping. How did it go from

59
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.330
Debbie Barker: That point you Lord kept getting them from the same doctor

60
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. For how many years.

61
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.840
Debbie Barker: Well, I've been on and off since 83

62
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And the times that you were off of them. How did that happen that you were off of them.

63
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.410
Debbie Barker: I just didn't have a doctor to go to

64
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that because a lapse of insurance or something like that or you just moved

65
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.090
Debbie Barker: No, we have

66
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.190

Okay.

72
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there's also a change in residence. So that might have also interrupted the the medication.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:03.600
Debbie Barker: Like that, you know,

322
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:04.950

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So every now and again is different for everybody. That's why I was trying to grab a timeframe that you did great. I know it's a hard thing to kind of capture in time.

324
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was your did it ever like let's say later on in life where you ever prescribed it. Are we getting it off the street or

356
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Client denies lifetime use of hallucinogens including mushrooms acid PCP. How about whippets

357
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.110
Debbie Barker: Though I don't really know what they are.

358
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It's good to me. Client denies huffing and whippet behavior in lifetime.

359
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um, as far as treatment history thinking not so much about you know that word you use my nerves.

360
00:31:48.900 --> 00:32:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Now thinking just around for a moment substance you were maybe you were seeking some treatment to address substance use. Have you ever been. Let's say to a residential program, a lot of people call it remap

361
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: No clients denies residential level of care lifetime. What about intensive outpatient where you talked with a therapist for like three hours a day, three times a week.

362
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay clients a nice intensive outpatient level of care history. What about outpatient, we sat with a therapist and talked about your thoughts and feelings, maybe even once a month or once a week.

Debbie Barker: Though for years.

364
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.200

366
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.450
Okay.

367
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: 1995 and were you meeting with someone like a psychologist, where you kind of analyze

368
00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.460
Debbie Barker: Their business.

369
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapist and how many months or years, did you see that therapist.

370
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.190
Debbie Barker: Maybe a couple months.

371
00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh ok for on and did you not connect with that clinician.

372
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.000
Debbie Barker: No, not really.

373
00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it's really important isn't it if you don't jive with them. If you can't, like, find something where you feel safe. It's hard for us to open up, isn't it.

374
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.740
Debbie Barker: Yes, it is.

375
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, oh boy. Okay, I got you. So you at least you know kind of what the therapeutic relationship is we got 1995 any other any other sort of either psychotherapy or substance use treatment. Besides that, one in 1995 and this one now.

376
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. Okay. So still pretty fresh still haven't like completely gotten into some of that history. Okay, I'm going to be very respectful of that because I want to make a good impression

377
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, cool, cool, cool. Today's a rough one, because it's hard for us to develop rapport when I'm coming at you have all these questions, but we'll all be slowing way down next time. Okay.

378
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so fantastic. We got a real good sense here. Hey, how about this. Have you ever been hospitalized though around the, let's say any of the substance use maybe okay so client also denies hospitalization history associated with substance use. What about

379
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: This is going to be kind of a shifting of gears here.

380
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's use it on a scale from zero to 1010 being super confident

381
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And zero being really not confident when you assess your self esteem. In other words, your ability that once you make up your mind. You want to do something, you have the confidence to go do it 10 is

382
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:45.720
Debbie Barker: Unreal for

383
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so self esteem. These days from zero to 10s about like you want me put 3.5

384
00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:51.870
Yeah.

385
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay 3.5 I got you. Beautiful. All right, something so we can kind of have a reference point.

386
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's go in here, save those same all this good stuff.

387
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So just now. I was very much following my own sort of list of things I like to talk about. I'm to now shift gears and follow bright heart health structure. So I've got these little drop down windows that I'm going to use to steer the questions.

388
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:33.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, depression, bipolar any PTSD, anything like that.

389
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.130
Depression.

390
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And I heard some antsy anxiety. I also heard that those Benz's were also for some anxiety.

391
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:50.970
Debbie Barker: Yo, I spent four years in a wheelchair before they decided to do this last surgery.

392
