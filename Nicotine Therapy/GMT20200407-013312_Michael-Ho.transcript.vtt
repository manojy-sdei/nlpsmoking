215
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:11.580
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. All right, and you live in, you live in Richmond, and we talked about school and work.

216
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:21.420
Michael Hoefer: All right. Well, those are the main questions. I need to ask you as far as doing the intake process. I appreciate you answering them all. I know it's a lot of questions.

217
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.710
Lerone Matthis: Do you have you

218
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.140
Michael Hoefer: Do you have any other questions for me or is there anything that I missed that you think is important for me to no

219
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.580
Lerone Matthis: No, no.

220
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.200
Lerone Matthis: No.

221
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.100
Okay.

222
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:45.510
Michael Hoefer: Okay, great. Alright, so. So next step. So certainly, in speaking to you. It's clear, you know, very clear to both of us that you have an opiate addiction, which we call an opiate use disorder.

223
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:56.520
Michael Hoefer: And there's three medications available that are approved by the FDA to treat that disorder. One is methadone. One is buprenorphine and one is Naltrexone

224
00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:04.440
Michael Hoefer: I mean, I think for for you and for what we're talking about. It makes a lot of sense to try the medication buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone

225
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:21.600
Michael Hoefer: And and that's just because I mean a couple things. One, that's kind of considered by most people. The first line treatment, like if you've never been in treatment before. That's the usually the best one to start it has, you know, it's very safe. It has really good, kind of, it's very effective.

226
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.340
Michael Hoefer: And it's even more of a good thing. At this point, because

227
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:38.760
Michael Hoefer: With the coven 19 and the lockdown. It's something that we can just send to the pharmacy or you can take on your own, you know, at your house and keeps you from having to go to a clinic every day or things like that, which wouldn't be really safe right now.

228
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.230
Lerone Matthis: Right.

229
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:52.110
Michael Hoefer: So the way the medication works is it's not like other pills you don't if you swallow it, you only absorb about 10% of it. So you need to stick it under your tongue and let it dissolve.

230
00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:02.730
Michael Hoefer: And so what we recommend you do is, you know, don't eat or drink anything about 15 minutes before you take it and then just stick it under your tongue and let it dissolve. Okay.

231
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:15.060
Michael Hoefer: And the only thing tricky about the medication is when you started that first couple doses, you take of it. You have to wait till you're in moderate withdrawal from heroin.

232
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:23.910
Michael Hoefer: You just have to you have to wait for till you feel like basically till your model withdrawal to you're really kind of started to feel sick and you can't really take it anymore.

233
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:40.800
Michael Hoefer: That's when you take your first dose. And if you do that, you'll feel a lot better. The only really risk of this medication is if you take it too early. It can either not work, or it can make you kind of sick. Okay, so you just gotta wait. So when was the last time you used any heroin.

234
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.410
Lerone Matthis: Damn.

235
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.240
Michael Hoefer: Okay. So you haven't used for a while. And are you feeling withdrawal symptoms at all right now.

236
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.360
Michael Hoefer: Absolutely. Yeah. What do you feel in mostly

237
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.580
Lerone Matthis: Some exchange.

238
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.910
Lerone Matthis: Sweating wearing now. Oh.

239
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.560
Crap.

240
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.980
Lerone Matthis: I mean, sweating, the light and

241
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.170
Lerone Matthis: Oh,

242
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.250
Lerone Matthis: No, it's coming.

243
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.690
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

244
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:20.160
Michael Hoefer: So okay, so we should try. Yeah. After we get off this was after we get off the line. I'll put an electronic prescription for the medication. So you can pick it up and start taking it.

245
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:29.580
Michael Hoefer: And it's and, with it being a day and a half since you've had heroin and also the, the symptoms. You're having right now, it would be okay to start it and you should start feeling better.

246
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:41.970
Michael Hoefer: And the way you do it is you start off by taking about either a half tablet, which is four milligrams. They come in eight milligram Tablets. Tablets to take a half tablet every couple hours till you feel better.

247
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:48.810
Michael Hoefer: And those people will feel better somewhere between a total of eight milligrams to 16 milligrams. Okay.

248
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.820
Michael Hoefer: And so whatever you dose, you get to where you feeling better and you feel okay just stop there.

249
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.500
Lerone Matthis: Okay, okay.

250
00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:05.400
Michael Hoefer: Um, and then after the first 24 hours of being on it, you'll know, kind of, oh, you know, I'm somebody who needs eight or 12 or 16 of this med and then you just start taking that each morning

251
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.450
Michael Hoefer: And it'll help you and the things that will do for you is it'll

252
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.790
Michael Hoefer: Get rid of withdrawal symptoms.

253
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:21.660
Michael Hoefer: It will minimize cravings for heroin and it will also work as what we call a blocker. So basically, it'll, you know, bind to your opiate receptors in your brain.

254
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:33.870
Michael Hoefer: And if you were to use heroin or some other opiates, they'll just basically bounce right off. And you'll you won't feel anything. And most people who use will say, Well, that was a waste of time. I'm not going to do that again, you know,

255
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.220
Michael Hoefer: We're yeah

256
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:43.980
Michael Hoefer: And so that's that's the ways that it's helpful. It is important to know that it is a certain it is Suboxone is still a type of opiate

257
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:54.270
Michael Hoefer: Its own the same family as other opiates, but it's very unique in that it's very safe, like it's really the only opiate that you could take like people if

258
00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:09.630
Michael Hoefer: It's almost impossible to overdose on it, you can take so much and it won't shut down your breathing. It also has a much less opiate side effects than anything else. So it doesn't cause constipation or testosterone changes or sedation, or things as much as other opiates do

259
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:24.180
Michael Hoefer: But, but you should know it is a type of opiates. So if you know if you when you you are going to try to stop it. You will need to go through a taper process because you will go into withdrawal like you will with other opiates. Okay.

260
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.160
Michael Hoefer: Yeah.

261
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:45.300
Michael Hoefer: And really the only way you can get into trouble with this medication is if you were to take this medication and then take large amounts of benzodiazepines like Xanax or Valium or whatever that is a very unsafe combination as well as if you were to drink a lot on it.

262
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.990
Michael Hoefer: Those are really the only two things that you got to really avoid

263
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.570
Michael Hoefer: Because it's not a good combination

264
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.010
Lerone Matthis: Okay.

265
00:23:55.110 --> 00:24:02.130
Michael Hoefer: All right, that's a lot of information. Do you have any questions about the medication. Anything else you want to

266
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.490
Michael Hoefer: We want to know about it.

267
00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.870
Lerone Matthis: Are you very thorough, I'm not

268
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:08.820
Lerone Matthis: Saying information.

269
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.590

Lerone Matthis: All right.

274
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:25.050
Michael Hoefer: Well, if there aren't any other questions. What I can do is we'll get off the line I can put in the prescription. I can give you a week supply of the medication right now.

275
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:38.700

276
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.200
Michael Hoefer: And that they'll let you know kind of what the next steps are and how things go.

277
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.220
Lerone Matthis: Okay, okay.
