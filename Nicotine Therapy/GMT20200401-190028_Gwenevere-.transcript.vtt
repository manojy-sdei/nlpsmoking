Gwenevere Abriel: Contagious you might end up catching it.

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.310
Michelle Lucero: I would wear white more but

15
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.910
Michelle Lucero: It makes my teeth looks super yellow. So I don't work.

16
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Difference between Wait, I can wear bright white. But if I were off way, it draws all the color out, it makes a difference. Even that little bit

17
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.770
Yeah.

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Or like, I love pastels.

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.090
Michelle Lucero: But I'm wearing

20
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: My closet. I can't wear like that to light pale green. I can't work pale yellow. I can't work pale pink. And that's so pretty.

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't wear pastels at all.

22
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.870
Michelle Lucero: It just, boom.

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It pulls all the color right out of my face.

24
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the facts, ma'am. We're just dealing with the facts.

25
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm dying to know

26
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: How many cigarettes.

27
00:01:40.260 --> 00:02:02.220
Michelle Lucero: Oh my god. So I got, I should have grabbed it, I didn't. I don't have my log on you. What I've had. Okay, so that full night and the next day I hadn't smoked at all, right after the meeting. It just, I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I went and wrote it down. Okay.

28
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.170
Michelle Lucero: When back immediately if all I thought about. So I ended up going and I had to buy some because I didn't have any

29
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.880
Michelle Lucero: Had to go buy some and they still have this thing and I've only. I don't even know I should gather the Packers me how many I have in there, but it's been

30
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.370
Michelle Lucero: Six days now and I think I still have like 13 out of 20. Oh, okay.

31
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's um

32
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at this, because I heard some things that worked. And then I heard some other things that didn't. So we did a we did a an experiment. And let's do more of what works and do less of what didn't work.

33
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.910
Michelle Lucero: Yeah yeah

34
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.910
You get into a note here first.

35
00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: First of all, I'd like to start with. Are you safe. Are you feeling okay. How's your mental state HOW WAS HOW WAS MICHELLE doing

36
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.220
Michelle Lucero: I'm safe. I'm not feeling great. Oh, and here's the point that in myself.

37
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.150
Oh,

38
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.150
Michelle Lucero: And other than that I feel good because I finally got my son on all his going links that he needed

39
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.670
Michelle Lucero: So he's been doing that all day and that too. He have he

40
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.390
Michelle Lucero: Has a login to get to what I already showed him how to do it. So he should be good.

41
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: He's not going to win a lot of it is he and pretend like he did the exercises.

42
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.710
Michelle Lucero: Know, I think this will handle. Tell me because she used to be my PE teacher

43
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So weird.

44
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.480
Michelle Lucero: Isn't, let me know. Yeah, I can't believe it. She's so like, great. She's doing like even better than when she was my teacher

45
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.730
Michelle Lucero: So yeah, yesterday was a hard day. It was a great day actually until Anthony

46
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Now,

47
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say I'm hard on myself. What does that has to do with what what what what happened. What, why are you disappointed in yourself.

48
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.450
Michelle Lucero: I let myself get super angry and I broke up.

49
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.550
Michelle Lucero: With you, is actually

50
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: super angry and was it over something really important all this anger.

51
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.750
Michelle Lucero: Um, no. Not now that I think about it in my right mind it was

52
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's pretty common, like after we see there's time. It really has nothing to do about the thing they did in the moment is the fact that there's so many

53
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.240
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

54
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So many times that you didn't show how angry you were that

55
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.820
Michelle Lucero: Yeah yeah okay so

56
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're upset with yourself because you got angry.

57
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.190
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, because I let him get me angry that I broke the window, and now I'm going to have to replace

58
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it affect him. Can he drive anywhere, do anything. Does it affect his life at all.

59
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.170
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, he can't use this record until it's fixed because it's illegal to drive with her.

60
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.840
Michelle Lucero: For the break to be in your point of view at any point and it right in the middle.

61
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So on. Is he planning on spending his earned money on repairing it

62
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.130
Michelle Lucero: I don't know, we haven't talked to

63
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.340
Michelle Lucero: He didn't come home last night he got home and probably around

64
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.620
Michelle Lucero: 1130

65
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.620
Michelle Lucero: And he's been in this room, sleeping, ever since. So I didn't talk to him.

66
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.510
Michelle Lucero: And he hasn't talked to me. I think he just bought up to eat something, but

67
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.490
Michelle Lucero: You haven't talked about it. I'm sure he will pay for it, and then we'll

68
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.590
Michelle Lucero: See him back when I get

69
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it worth talking about the content. Do you want to

70
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:24.630
Michelle Lucero: If not, well, I mean, I guess it is something to talk about. So it's he was mad because

71
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:43.500
Michelle Lucero: I knew that step on how to do these meetings today and he needed a haircut and there's no barbers open, but his dad cuts air. So I asked him, Do you think you can come home, in your right mind to cut his hair because he has these meetings tomorrow for school.

72
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:54.270
Michelle Lucero: And he's like, Yeah, yeah, maybe you can help me because his hair had gotten along we couldn't just buzz it like you need to use scissors to cut his hair.

73
00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:07.890
Michelle Lucero: Right. And I was going to help you. And if anyone needs for his dad to cut his hair because he takes a long and all he does his thing. So I was like, I'll just put your hair before your dad gets home well

74
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:18.690
Michelle Lucero: Without telling me he went and made us have on an appointment with his friend Ryan at eight last night, but I didn't know that. So I'd already could have stepped on air.

75
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.400
Michelle Lucero: And so when he came home, he was already drinking and

76
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.070
Michelle Lucero: He was like, Oh, you're already cut his hair and it came out nice like

77
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.420
Yeah.

78
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.160
Michelle Lucero: Not really.

79
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.440
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, your dad. I was like, wow.

80
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:45.000
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, but I've been. I've done it before. I just didn't want to cuz he's letting it grow because he wants, long, long

81
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Long time

82
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.190
Michelle Lucero: And I don't know how to

83
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.830
Michelle Lucero: Short on the sidebar. Yeah.

84
00:07:50.940 --> 00:08:04.950
Michelle Lucero: Right. And I didn't know how to blend it. So I had to cut the top down from like his hair was so long and I had to cut it down to like an eight to blend it into the feed. Anyways, um,

85
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:21.630
Michelle Lucero: So that wasn't even the problem I was more mad that Anthony didn't call me to tell me that before I cut his hair like how did he expect me to just know that he didn't get home, till like almost 730 so then I just let that blow away.

86
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.970
Michelle Lucero: Well, I was still

87
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:33.600
Michelle Lucero: Upset so every time we would talk to me. I was just being short with him. And it was like all his hair came out nice and I was being. I was like, Yeah, I know.

88
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:35.490
Michelle Lucero: Like

89
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.160
Michelle Lucero: I left my phone on the charger.

90
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.720
Michelle Lucero: And he was going through my phone and I have nothing to hide. He's saw a message from

91
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:56.130
Michelle Lucero: my nephew's dad's best friend that I've known since I was three years old. All he asked me is, can you show me or give me a recipe on how to make tortillas.

92
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:10.200
Michelle Lucero: That was it. And I was like, sure. Here's the recipe I use but Anthony didn't mind to look through the message to see what the context was he was just like, Oh, you're talking to someone out

93
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:18.120
Michelle Lucero: Which it wasn't which made me even more mad because I was like, can you read the message he wouldn't give me my phone, you have

94
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:29.610
Michelle Lucero: And he pays for it, it's all under his name. Oh, he was like, I'm not. This is my phone and I'm throwing it away. You want to talk to the other guys. And I was like,

95
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:44.880
Michelle Lucero: Read the message and we'll see what it says. He asked me for a tortilla recipes like get over yourself. I 10. Plus, I'm not like you, because he's always talking to girls, but I don't feel the need to do that. I don't

96
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:55.500
Michelle Lucero: So I just got more mad because all the information they needed for us on this or just classes today was on my email and I don't have email anywhere else except for my phone.

97
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:06.930
Michelle Lucero: Without internet or if I could get on my laptop. No problem. Right. But I don't have internet also without my phone for the hotspot. So then

98
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:17.760
Michelle Lucero: I was just I gave him a piece of paper and I was like, just give me the link. I don't even care. Keep the phone, I'll buy my own phone when I get paid. I'm not worried about it. Give me the links, I need this one.

99
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.170
Michelle Lucero: Tomorrow, and he wouldn't. And he was like, I'm just gonna leave. And I was like, we have, I don't care.

100
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:35.070
Michelle Lucero: And I was like, I don't care. It's just give me those links and he wouldn't. And I tell them, okay then just give me my phone and my anger was building and building and

101
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:47.820
Michelle Lucero: He was driving away and there was a hammer on the porch and I can be myself thoroughly minute him, hit him in the head with it, but I didn't, I just aim for the wind filter.

102
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.130
So,

103
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you surprised at how much anger, you have inside

104
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.460
Michelle Lucero: Now I'm not surprised. I'm surprised that I let it

105
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.840
Michelle Lucero: That I showed it because I can usually in myself down without

106
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.230
Michelle Lucero: Ya know, Michael.

107
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: This one was about your son's education. There was more at stake than just

108
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.000
Yeah.

109
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:26.640
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, I think that's what because me off more because I was like, I don't care. Take the downfall. I don't care have it.

110
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:33.090
Michelle Lucero: I can buy another one, not, not a big deal of what pisses me off is that in the moment. I was like,

111
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:43.770
Michelle Lucero: How am I going to get these leads. He needs to be out school tomorrow like the principal called me yesterday and was like he doesn't have this Chromebook. Will you still need to get online summit.

112
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:58.560
Michelle Lucero: So I knew it needed to be done, and I think that's why I reacted the big in a wife upset upset and she just what it was. And I don't think it matters that she was drinking or not even over industry wouldn't know.

113
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.790
Michelle Lucero: It was just as mine that I was talking to someone else.

114
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.970
Michelle Lucero: That's all that he heard you don't want to see anything.

115
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about the level of of of I was aiming towards him like you had the hammer in your hand.

116
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hear.

117
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:30.480
Michelle Lucero: I could see. So in my head, I could literally see myself getting them throwing it in hitting them in the head with a hammer and like one coming from his head, and I was like yeah Yokota job.

118
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.490
Michelle Lucero: Right, and even throwing it at the truck.

119
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:46.440
Michelle Lucero: I still scared myself after right through it because I was like, Oh my God, if He calls the police, but I was like wait, that's my truck and it's under my name. I could break all the windows that I want.

120
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.030
Michelle Lucero: But

121
00:12:49.740 --> 00:13:07.260
Michelle Lucero: Actually, I can't because it's still put his life in danger bites are leaning towards in the truck. So even though in my head. I like quickly came up with a solution. Oh wait, it's my truck. I could break all the windows that are born, I can't because it's still

122
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.660
Michelle Lucero: Open ignoring him.

123
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: He got you through the moment, though it wouldn't you were still in charge you were able to discharge some of this years and years and years of pent up resentment and anger.

124
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So the reason why I'm focusing on this. And it's interesting because you're going to take it or leave it. We don't need to talk about almost killed a man, but now I'm going to really have to talk about in therapy.

125
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Like what

126
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:35.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, what

127
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:46.350
Michelle Lucero: It does scare me because I do think of that more than ever in 13

128
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.120
Michelle Lucero: Right.

129
00:13:48.420 --> 00:14:05.610
Michelle Lucero: And I've never acted on it, but I don't want to. Most of the time I can walk away and I can just ignore him all come to my room and I'm really good about that for everyone, not just him if anyone's upsetting me. I don't like to get upset.

130
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.910
Michelle Lucero: I i usually can but

131
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:21.090
Michelle Lucero: I don't know, I just really, I just thought, I think it's, it's, like, just so much has built up. That's right. And so many times I haven't

132
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:33.420
Michelle Lucero: Said anything and I just walk away and I just wanted him to know I was right and it's not because I was like just read the damn message and you'll see there's nothing to it.

133
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.620
Michelle Lucero: But he wouldn't. He just wanted. I think literally like always, who just wanted a reasonable

134
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.410
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, because he didn't come home late so he obviously had a plan, you know,

135
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:50.940
So,

136
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: From the outside

137
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: In we just take it from the outside in. And we say, well,

138
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not going to have any links you will be able to problem solve and help your son. If you're in jail.

139
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Just one day of things that you won't be able to help with. You might have years of having to defend yourself for a domestic violence.

140
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Murder. Right. I mean, just think about it for a second. It's like this is how it happens. This is what happens.

141
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Victims get sick and tired. So my concern. Remember, it's like, I gotta really kind of talk about it because it's like, well, how much can Michelle take yes you're good at keeping it down, but you don't discharge.

142
00:15:47.730 --> 00:16:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't let it go, it, it's still sits there more after more after more after more. That's the concern. Not that you have an ability to compartmentalize it or to discharge it through some other means. But it sits there that resentment and anger.

143
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And what if you get to the point that you can't take it anymore.

144
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:17.550
Michelle Lucero: What are you using that terrifies us right out of me because I watch it all the time on TV.

145
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.690
Michelle Lucero: I know like

146
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And their people just like you and me their regular people. It's just there's only so much we can take

147
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's put a pin in that was step away from that for a minute and just let that one settle down. Okay.

148
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing happened.

149
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You had enough consciousness.

150
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: To think through all just beat up the car, you were conscious. You weren't completely disassociated with rage.

151
00:16:50.580 --> 00:17:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But it can happen that people only feel rage. They can't use the frontal part of their brain. And they're all just completely hijacked by anger and rage and. That's my concern, you have an I know you have a lot

152
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:14.490
Gwenevere Abriel: That it could maybe build to that. And then you'd be like, holy crap. What am I done

153
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:15.900
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

154
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So we got to find a way to discharge to set life up for success. All those things we've put in motion in the past.

155
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: But right now, it sounds like what you might need in a more urgent way as a place to discharge. Some of these feelings you have

156
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't hear you go in for a run. I don't hear you. Can you know doing, you know, hitting a punching bag. I don't hear you writing him letters and and coming into group and talking about what a turkey is

157
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't, I don't know if you are. I don't know if you're letting it all now it's you're hearing people validate you

158
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:02.640
Michelle Lucero: And me when I talk about it. I feel better about it. Like I'm I didn't have my phone until like

159
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:15.600
Michelle Lucero: I don't even know what time it was last night he finally called my son's phone and told him, have your mom couldn't get her phone. It'll be outside in my truck. So I finally went and got my phone.

160
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:27.540
Michelle Lucero: But I had already figured it out. Honestly, I ready when we need it, but I thought about our group and I didn't remember my zoom login

161
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.410
Michelle Lucero: So I was like, yeah, I mean my phone so

162
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.200
Michelle Lucero: Was my point.

163
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:37.890
Michelle Lucero: I remember

164
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.590
Michelle Lucero: Um,

165
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So it feels good.

166
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It feels good to you to talk about

167
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.260
Michelle Lucero: Oh, yeah.

168
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:57.720
Michelle Lucero: To talk. Oh, I hadn't told anybody is Devon was the only one that knew about it all all night and day. And then when he got into his first class.

169
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:11.430
Michelle Lucero: His first class today. I just got on the phone and called My sister and I told her everything. And she was like, oh my god, I think you need to come ski over here. I'm afraid for you to be there. And I was like, I'm not afraid because

170
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.480
Michelle Lucero: In the moment I'm not afraid, like

171
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know.

172
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.840
Michelle Lucero: When he first took the phone.

173
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.350
Michelle Lucero: And I used to see my mom do this shit all the time which blows my mind.

174
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:34.800
Michelle Lucero: And my mom was tiny compared to my dad and she's waiting on him. She didn't care. She knew he'd knock her out and he would, but she didn't care.

175
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:46.680
Michelle Lucero: And it scares me because I don't want to be like that. But I can see me hitting him like in his face, and I know he's gonna hit me back, but in the moment. I'm not afraid.

176
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:53.460
Michelle Lucero: At that time, but thinking about it now. I'm like, yeah, you're lucky even get it because we probably wouldn't

177
00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.690
Michelle Lucero: But it scares me because I don't want someone wasn't in the room and he didn't see anything.

178
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.930
Michelle Lucero: In here is fighting or he wasn't outside when nice through it. I told him that I broke the wind chill, though.

179
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.920
Michelle Lucero: But it just bothers me because I don't want him.

180
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.750
Michelle Lucero: To not feel safe way I get into the home.

181
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:24.750
Michelle Lucero: And Mike

182
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:32.910
Michelle Lucero: I don't know if I told you, but like he collects BB guns and knives and he has since he was young.

183
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:38.160
Michelle Lucero: And last night when we went to go get my phone. He brought up going with him.

184
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:52.410
Michelle Lucero: He has to protect me. I don't want him to feel that we either like I don't want him to feel that I'm going to put myself in the situation that he's going to have to protect me because that's the way I felt for my mom.

185
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.110
Michelle Lucero: Like I always had to protect her. I needed to be there in case something happens.

186
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:05.370
Michelle Lucero: And it's not because I'm still here.

187
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.640
Michelle Lucero: And I haven't shown him that

188
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.340
Michelle Lucero: We don't have enough with this.

189
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:21.330
Michelle Lucero: So I already you know I have money sleep and then he doesn't know that I'm thinking anybody knows that except you and me.

190
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:34.830
Michelle Lucero: And I'm going to start. I don't know. I don't think anything's hope and but I remember my news telling me that she didn't have to go through like the state to get on

191
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.920
Michelle Lucero: low income housing.

192
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:50.580
Michelle Lucero: So I actually went in online this morning. And when they choose the apartment she lives that and they put in an application, and then I'll submit it.

193
00:21:51.930 --> 00:22:01.620
Michelle Lucero: Like tomorrow. I think I'm going to have to pull out the money and go take it to them for the application fee because they don't take like credit card or anything. They only to pass.

194
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.180
Michelle Lucero: So I'm going to go do that and like an

195
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:19.650
Michelle Lucero: Ice really scared the shit out of myself and I was really hard on myself this morning and I was like, damn, you could be in jail right now and it scares me because I don't want to be in jail.

196
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.290
Michelle Lucero: But even more.

197
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:34.380
Michelle Lucero: I'm scared of what I could do, because if I could break a window. I could you know if I can get that Matt.

198
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.180
Michelle Lucero: I don't want to. I'm going to try to just

199
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.300
Michelle Lucero: Go and put in a nap and try to do that because I mean

200
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.230
Michelle Lucero: I don't want to stay here anymore.

201
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.830
I'm really impressed.

202
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.530
That's all it takes.

203
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Is one application then you drive here you get money out there. Then you go to the next place you drop the money off there. You pick up another piece of paper you pick up a pen, you go online, you fill this out, you find a link to this final link to that don't get ahead of it.

204
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all you have to do.

205
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you come in and you talk to the tami's into the knees and your sister, whoever you need to vent to us. You can tell us how scared you. Are you do the same anyway.

206
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Anyway,

207
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: One delayed impulse control your whole life. Your son's life.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Powder Keg the home here in

209
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You have images of what that looks like deep in your brain from watching your mom goes through that that is familiar and I'm afraid you're going to reenact it you got really close.

210
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I love that you filled out that application. I love this, you held on to this recovery process long enough to tolerate the people at work at gossiped with you because you tolerate it. Those moments because you showed up anyway when you were tired.

211
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: When you didn't want to go, you have money.

212
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, just like that. It's we all think it's this big. I won the lottery. Now I can move out. So it's one little thing at a time. You're doing it, you're in your solution right now and you scared yourself into it. If that's how it is. Okay, fine.

213
00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: keep the momentum going.

214

253
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:27.330
Michelle Lucero: A day it'll go away after that because they're totally like they hide everything just in case you are trying to get away, so no one like where you are. That's right. There's still good.

254
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you scared yourself. You got face to face with how much rage, you have

255
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And right. I think you scared yourself because you like I could kill this guy.

259
00:29:52.740 --> 00:30:03.810
Michelle Lucero: Playing it over. But then in the back of my mind. I could see me hitting him and him hitting me back, but then right after that I saw my mom doing it to my dad and

260
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:13.020
Michelle Lucero: In the minute I was like, Mom, why would you do that, but I know how upset because her that she felt

261
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.790
Michelle Lucero: She didn't care what he did to her, she was going to get in, you know,

262
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.570
Michelle Lucero: It's scary to think. But yeah.

263
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's time to go.

264
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And that was the conclusion you came to, I'm assuming, when you started filling out that application.

265
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.570
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

266
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:35.970
Michelle Lucero: I just don't wanna

267
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.960
Michelle Lucero: Make myself do that again or

268
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:46.110
Michelle Lucero: How do I know I hit him and he doesn't kill me. And that's the end of it for me not.

269
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Just right

270
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.690
Michelle Lucero: Like

271
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.750
Michelle Lucero: Very easily he could do that.

272
00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:00.120
Michelle Lucero: Not mean to just like me that only now I'm writing my senior like hitting and then the temple in him like dying.

273
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.440
Michelle Lucero: It wasn't worth it at all. He was already trying to leave. I should have just like to meet

274
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:21.420
Michelle Lucero: With the phone. I could have like in the moment. I didn't think of all this, but I had already gotten older, like an hour after that, like, I'll be damned if my be at school tomorrow.

275
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're resourceful one you've just been you've been kind of locked up in this in this fear that you aren't strong enough. You're not capable and

276
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you've got a little bit, a little something in there a little motivation and so you'll recall, with it. Is there anything else I can do to support you through this process.

277
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:52.260
Michelle Lucero: No. Um, I think what also pissed me off is because he knew I didn't have my meds yesterday or today.

278
00:31:53.970 --> 00:32:03.300
Michelle Lucero: I was in a bad mood, but it wasn't even because of that I didn't. I still don't feel like I mean I'm tired, but I'm not like

279
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:05.520
Michelle Lucero: Withdrawing

280
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.600
Wow.

281
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:20.520
Michelle Lucero: But what is me, I'll be the Mars because he thought it's because you don't have your drugs. And I was like, Oh my God, I hate to hear anyone say that I'm like, don't call them because they're not good.

282
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:32.580
Michelle Lucero: It's my medication and I could we are drug, but I'm not like me off. I think it was a not as what the cherry on the cake.

283
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it mean to you when he says, You just can't get to your drugs. What does that mean to you.

284
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.460
Michelle Lucero: If

285
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:49.470
Michelle Lucero: Him just saying that I'm on drugs like some optimism drug. It's my medication and

286
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:58.530
Michelle Lucero: He goes upsets me that that's what any knows that bugs me. I've already asked him, don't call it that, like, can you not see drugs can you

287
00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:58.920
Michelle Lucero: Be

288
00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Your meditation. Michelle, you just restated it

289
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it mean to you when he says, You just, you just need your drugs right now. That's why you're acting like this.

290
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:23.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It means something to you. So sit with it a little longer because you just repeated what we already heard in here, see if you can figure out what it means to you he words it in that particular way.

291
00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:29.130
Michelle Lucero: Because it sounds like he failed on the scale on drugs and I'm not

292
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you believe about yourself when he says that

293
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.860
Michelle Lucero: That I'm not on drugs that I'm clean I'm

294
00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.690
Michelle Lucero: In a program taking my medication. The way I'm supposed to

295
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's the difference between a drug and a medication.

296
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.520
Michelle Lucero: The way he makes it sound as like

297
00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:12.480
Michelle Lucero: I'm still a drug addict is the way it makes me feel and not because there's me on

298
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Describing a drug.

299
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.780
Michelle Lucero: Like doing anything for drugs and

300
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.750
Michelle Lucero: feeling horrible when you don't have

301
00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:35.340
Michelle Lucero: And I don't even know honestly how he knew i i don't know i think he overheard me screaming and I didn't have any

302
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.030
Michelle Lucero: I don't know.

303
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it turns out you were a drug addict. What would that mean to you if you poor

304
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.230
Michelle Lucero: I probably be in jail if I was

305
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.650
Michelle Lucero: Not probably I would be in jail.

306
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:36.180
Michelle Lucero: Like my probation officer would throw me in jail, no doubt.

307
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:47.070
Michelle Lucero: I mean, that's not saying that. I don't know that I have a problem with drugs. It's just I wish you wouldn't say

308
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:58.920
Michelle Lucero: Oh, it's because you don't have your drugs like if you would say, oh, it's because you don't have your medication. I probably be like it. You're probably right now probably is why I'm letting you get me upset.

309
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's about

310
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:03.510
Michelle Lucero: Three.

311
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.220
Michelle Lucero: Is what

312
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think that that's the same for everyone, but those two words.

313
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Should have a different impact they do for you and everyone should it should have the same reaction.

314
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:30.660
Michelle Lucero: I don't know. I mean, I know a lot of people feel that way.

315
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:54.780
Michelle Lucero: Like you blocked my cousin on Facebook because she had put like if you're on these. This doesn't mean you're clean or something and it was like a picture of Foxman like as you I am clean and I am on that. Like I know people don't know that I don't plan on changing everyone's mind but

316
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:03.000
Michelle Lucero: It just bothers me. I mean, I know I'm not a drug addict anymore. I know that my medication.

317
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:12.060
Michelle Lucero: It just bugs me to hear people saying that any he does it just, that's what bothers me about it even more.

318
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What is

319
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: A physician, call it a drug.

320
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: What would happen

321
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.000
Michelle Lucero: Probably nothing because in a way, I guess it is the drug.

322
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.410
Michelle Lucero: Like a medication. Sometimes our drugs, but

323
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.520
Michelle Lucero: It's like in the con texts, I guess.

324
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:51.570
Michelle Lucero: I've seen it like I know Anthony means like drugs they're your drugs like you can't live without it. And I mean, I know I can. I plan on tapering all the way off. Okay.

325
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, right there right now, can you live without buprenorphine.

326
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:12.120
Gwenevere Abriel: What it's okay it's real. It's real questions just trying to find your truth to it live live just

327
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.340
Michelle Lucero: Yet, okay. I could live

328
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:15.990
Gwenevere Abriel: live comfortably.

329
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:17.220
Right.

330
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice, notice something. Notice I said the last two days haven't had it.

331
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you have gone two days without it, and

332
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: In fact, probably last week, the week before a very recently.

333
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Noticed after he said you're an addict. Basically you. Isn't that amazing how your body responds differently.

334
00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how powerful the mind is

335
00:38:50.580 --> 00:39:01.680
Michelle Lucero: Yeah I don't if I don't think about it doesn't bother me at all. But the minute I remember I haven't taken it or if I don't have any when all starts filling that

336
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:10.470
Michelle Lucero: And just like just with Dr. Don telling me, Oh, you shouldn't even feel it until the third day

337
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:22.200
Michelle Lucero: Is that changed my life just in that I know in my head. Okay, you're not feeling good. It's not because of us, not because you don't have the box.

338
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So why can't. Why can't Dr. Aubrey I'll say to you, you know what Michelle.

339
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You are smart industrious woman. Let's save some money and go get an apartment.

340
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I want it work like that.

341
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it work let our faith in you.

342
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Carry you can remember how strong you are just just, you got this. Okay, you got this. So let's look at this a little bit together here because something's kind of

343
00:39:52.710 --> 00:40:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting about your, your understanding of these terms and it's got a hold on you. It's got power over you and it need not have power.

344
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm suspecting there's something about your own history that you just don't like to look at this. Let's look at the distinction between it. I call it

345
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Active addiction.

346
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that would be the word you just called drug addict. Right.

347
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And we also call CVS and Walgreens. What a medication store.

348
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:28.800
Or a

349
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:31.500
Michelle Lucero: drugstore.

350
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.270
Michelle Lucero: Okay, yeah, so like I don't know why. Like if a doctor said it wouldn't bother me.

351
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.570
Michelle Lucero: But it's in the context. He's using it.

352
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you haven't quite named that you haven't quite said what it means to you.

353
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But it means something he's calling you a name that you're already calling yourself and it hurts you.

354
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.480
Yeah yeah

355
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's look at this, just to really fine tune it. So let's let's see which one it is. We've got a B or C. And sometimes it's all three of them chemical dependence. That's this thing that you said

356
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling horrible without it. That is the best withdrawal.

357
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: The other thing that chemical dependency is, is it the signs are that you have what's called increased tolerance oftentimes found

358
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: This particular one does not. This particular substance of your printer thing you don't develop what's called tolerance for it. But let's move through this together and see how you feel at the end of it.

359
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have a lot a lot of time. Do we will do a few of them. So I told my supervisor that my son was sick when in reality I needed a few hours in the morning to score dope, because I was dope sick. I was dishonest.

360
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: In order to avoid responsibility. What do you think is happening here is that a function of chemical dependence.

361
00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Active addiction or recovery mindset I told my supervisor that my son was sick when in reality I just needed a few hours to score.

362
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.460
Michelle Lucero: In active addiction.

363
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, see this word and read. It's the dishonesty.

364
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Now what about this. What about the fact that you were dope sick.

365
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:32.880
Michelle Lucero: Yeah.

366
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What, what is this is this recovery mindset active addiction or chemical dependence. If I'm literally sweating leg cramps, nausea, diarrhea, is that

367
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. They can be going on at the same time.

368
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.830
Michelle Lucero: Gets keep going if you have one, are you knocking.

369
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.590
Michelle Lucero: You lost the link

370
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.880
Michelle Lucero: Real quick. Okay.

371
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:16.260
Michelle Lucero: This one right here.

372
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.470
Michelle Lucero: I'm almost done here.

373
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.610
Michelle Lucero: Okay, sorry.

374
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. Okay, so I picked a fight with my husband last night over something lil

375
00:43:50.700 --> 00:44:04.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I made a little misunderstanding into a big argument. So then I had time to be away from him. I was isolating myself because I needed to drive to my dealers apartment to score drugs.

376
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Was that chemical dependency active Addiction Recovery mindset.

377
00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You got it. See this isolating

378
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, I kept number three I kept having to use more and more pain pills in order to get relief from the pain in my neck. I built up physical tolerance for the chemical

379
00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:32.700
Michelle Lucero: Chemical Dependency got it.

380
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I have to DUIs but that was from alcohol and alcohol is not my drug of choice. I'm in denial that a mood altering substance is negatively affecting my life.

381
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Denial

382
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.550
Michelle Lucero: I'm in active addiction.

383
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Denial isolating dishonesty.

384
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Active addiction. Those are signs when you are lying omitting sneaking around setting your life up for a full blown slip relapse. You're not in recovery mindset. Let's keep going. I just spent a two hour lunch with my granddad

385
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And had a heart to heart talk, telling him how I had pretended last year to need money to pay for a down payment on an apartment, when really I spend it on a trip to party and get hi

386
00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sharing how I acted outside of my core values and morals. I'm starting to make amends. I'm starting to repair relationships to those I may have harmed.

387
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: What am I in

388
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.200
Michelle Lucero: Recovery mindset. Yep.

389
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I just over eight at the office party in truth. I often oh I eat my feelings.

390
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: By eating sugary or salty or fatty foods that

391
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: After not sharing my opinion with my supervisor about how she could make the project work better for everyone. I repressed.

392
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:22.500
Gwenevere Abriel: I repressed kept secret. My true feelings and was passive rather than assertive in communicating

393
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I'm repressing and keeping things secret.

394
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: What's going on there.

395
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:33.450
Michelle Lucero: Active addiction.

396
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.500
Got it.

397
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt nauseous. Last night was sweating during dinner realized it's been two days since I last use heroin. I was aware that I am still withdrawing from using heroin daily for the last year, I think to myself, this feeling will pass. I will not die. I can survive through the discomfort.

398
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.660
Michelle Lucero: Recovery mindset.

399
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:15.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That last part is, and that's right so would be to it would be the mindset is recovery mindset. And there's also because of the withdrawing. There's two. There's also a chemical

400
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, you sound like number seven.

401
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You still have a mindset that's positive that you know that this is a temporary thing is the chemical thing.

402
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:35.340
Okay.

403
00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to be careful about time because I know you need to jump out so I'm not going to continue this worksheet.

404
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Michelle, do you know

405
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What it is that you are already calling yourself that when your husband calls you that name it enraged you

406
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:03.480
Michelle Lucero: What am I already calling myself.

407
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can't find that one. What do you think he was if he could call you a name. What was he calling you with the kind of questions he was asking him.

408
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.540
Michelle Lucero: He was calling me a drug addict.

409
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:19.920
Michelle Lucero: Know in my head. I already see myself.

410
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:20.430
As

411
00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I would argue that you see yourself as one

412
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so too. So the difference between you and i is the facts are these

413
00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Chemically, you are dependent

414
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you might, although you're saying I do it psychologically on the third day because Dr. Gabriel said so there's chemical dependence, you have at times come in and said, I feel these withdrawal symptoms.

415
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's these beliefs. You have about how this like what a loser, a drug addict is that's the problem. You have a picture of these people, all these people on in jail. They're losers. I don't see it the same way you do.

416
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.300
Michelle Lucero: You are because

417
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:26.790
Michelle Lucero: What I used to do when I was a drug addict is what bothers me. And I'm not doing that now.

418
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:28.770
And

419
00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's still a part of your history. It doesn't mean it's all of who you are. Those are just actions.

420
00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. That's part of the past.

421
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You're also a mother, a friend, a sister right in her recovery work in herself. She's, she's an employee. She's a lot of different things. She's also chemically dependent

422
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That sitting with that. I don't think you like that. I think you like the image of yourself is clean and I want to hear anything else.

423
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Michelle, you're, you're getting there.

424
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting there.

425
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Take the heat away from the word addict and your husband can call you whatever he wants. And it won't phase you at all.

426
00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: The more we talk about a new here, the more you hear yourself say I'm an addict. I'm an addict. It takes the heat away. I don't ask people to ever say it, but for you it might be useful, because then we can demystify it loses all its own.

427
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.920
Michelle Lucero: Yeah, and they won't bother me if I hear someone else.

428
00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.390
Yeah.

429
00:50:48.330 --> 00:51:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: She were far more than a some of those actions that you did because I'm going to tell you something, when you're in active addiction, you're not thinking about what's the long term effect on the relationship with my son.

430
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Because Michelle, you weren't there the addict was making the decisions. So if you're going to hate someone hate the adder, not you.

431
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Know you need to go. Let's schedule another time to meet um

432
00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:18.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see.

Gwenevere Abriel: And then, so you didn't show up to group, despite oh

Michelle Lucero: Here, just be there.

448
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And experiment with some risky things like, see if you're willing to say just a bit of something that we talked about in here today just to really pull in some support from people. Okay, see if you're willing to do it. I'm not going to push you. But if you want to
