00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.670
Patrick S: Hey,

2
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.770
Patrick S: How are you

3
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.890
Patrick S: Pretty good.

4
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.810
Richelle Direny: How's me

5
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:56.610
Patrick S: I'm sorry about the light my house got real bad lighting of the bathrooms got regular lights and everything else is lamps.

6
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.920
Richelle Direny: That's fine, that's

7
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.780
Patrick S: Good.

8
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.890
Richelle Direny: That whole lot has changed since yesterday you were in group yesterday, weren't you

9
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.940
Tuesday.

10
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.690
Richelle Direny: Today is Thursday. Yes. There you go.

11
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.780
Richelle Direny: But these are running by too quickly.

12
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:43.170
Richelle Direny: Now how's everything going on with your wife and I know her. She lost her job and kind of everything was kind of going actually

13
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.040
Patrick S: Everything's great. Now,

14
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.260
Richelle Direny: Oh, she was able to find that

15
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.660
Richelle Direny: You thought that the school situation is still the same. Right. So pretty much

16
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.880
Richelle Direny: It is what it is.

17
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.560
Patrick S: School

18
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.110
Richelle Direny: With the loan. You remember you were telling me about

19
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.290
Patrick S: The

20
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.320
Patrick S: Garnish man, that's fine.

21
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.060
Patrick S: Um,

22
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.820
Patrick S: Yeah, that's the same

23
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.710
Richelle Direny: Okay.

24
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.400
Richelle Direny: And

25
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.710
Richelle Direny: Did you say your job was like it was a little bit rocky or something on your job.

26
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.300
Patrick S: Well,

27
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.750
Patrick S: I think I'm always been a little panel crap, I'm a little paranoid.

28
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.370
Patrick S: And

29
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.240
Patrick S: Like every now and then. I think they might get rid of me, and I think that's just paranoia.

30
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.300
Richelle Direny: Me. Are they kind of indicating to some degree that things are going to change.

31
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.360
Richelle Direny: layoffs because they're not making enough money if you work out well.

32
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.970
Patrick S: Well, actually, yeah that's somewhat of a concern. I can't get any new work the

33
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.520
Patrick S: They can't get new bids because of the quality issue with GM

34
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:37.320
Patrick S: So they can still get new jobs from CHRYSLER AND FORD And Ohio or something, but they can't get any from GM

35
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.820
Patrick S: So that's like we usually last year.

36
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.440
Patrick S: All summer was seven days a week, um,

37
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.900
Patrick S: This year since since the story.

38
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:03.270
Patrick S: Hasn't like I were this Saturday and Sunday, but that was the first day of work and a couple months.

39
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.520
Richelle Direny: Oh, there's a straight

40
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.580
Patrick S: Straight

41
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.510
Patrick S: All three

42
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:24.270
Patrick S: I don't know wasn't three months, maybe just two months GM was on strike that's been overly the mom.

43
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.790
Patrick S: But yeah, we, I was missing Fridays and

44
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.300
Patrick S: When that was going on.

45
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.060
Richelle Direny: Now just to review. So here are the goals that we're working on.

46
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.220
Richelle Direny: That you had mentioned

47
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:55.590
Richelle Direny: You know, one of them was identifying how your spirituality or religion or recovery process.

48
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.690
Richelle Direny: So how is that in terms of and I know one of the things is that you had been going between you and your wife. You've been going

49
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.310
Richelle Direny: To church your, what is it you're CATHOLIC, RIGHT. AND SHE IS

50
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.350
As a gospel

51
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.620
Richelle Direny: nondenominational

52
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.420
Richelle Direny: John. Can you kind of go back and forth, but more geared towards where she goes.

53
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.520
Patrick S: In comparison to

54
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.270
Richelle Direny: Well, no, I

55
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.570
Patrick S: Oh yeah, we used to go to her church more. But I'm

56
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:30.720
Patrick S: Like

57
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:39.480
Patrick S: We were first shift. And if we don't, if I work Sunday we usually go to Sunday night mass

58
00:08:40.530 --> 00:09:01.470
Patrick S: Um, we would probably go to Saturday night mass instead because the priest better on Saturday, a lot better than Sunday priests is Sunday night is a he's not our parish priests. These from somewhere else. And it's born, so I'm

59
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:12.450
Patrick S: So we probably go to Saturday night is more often than anything seen as if we if we get back. Seven days a

60
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.020
Patrick S: Week Sunday morning. Most the time we go to the name

61
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:20.790
Patrick S: And

62
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.420
Patrick S: Usually our Sunday looks like a in the morning of the mass

63
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.960
Richelle Direny: On Sundays.

64
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:50.310
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Okay. And do you find it, like, especially the other day where it was a little bit hard like a little bit more challenging with her losing her job with the garnishments and kind of like a few things going on there. Did you find

65
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:51.930
Richelle Direny: From

66
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.580
Richelle Direny: Wrestling company comfort grow in going to church and being able to

67
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.260
Richelle Direny: Just focus more on your spirituality in some way.

68
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.840
Patrick S: Well, I would, for the night.

69
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.860
Patrick S: But, uh, no know I'd get back to work and

70
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.540
Patrick S: And

71
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.320
Patrick S: Be miserable at work, then

72
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.090
Patrick S: Just start thinking about

73
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.090
Richelle Direny: Your situation certain. I don't know.

74
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:40.710
Patrick S: situation and circumstances. So no church doesn't help that much, but it does like because I can't hold on to it.

75
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.510
Patrick S: But it didn't last long, because I'll start stressing out

76
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:56.610
Richelle Direny: Well, I mean, the church itself, the building but it's more what what are you going for three

77
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.600
Richelle Direny: Four or you

78
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:07.530
Richelle Direny: Know it's kind of like equals into your second goal ultimately that you want to work on is wanting to relationship with God.

79
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.930
Patrick S: I'm yeah I'm. Oh, I see. I'm capable

80
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.920
Patrick S: When I'm not when I don't have too much on my plate.

81
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.520
Patrick S: So like I need him to take some stuff off my plate, which he did and

82
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.890
I'm

83
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:41.460
Patrick S: So it's just easier by when when I when I can see a light at the end of the tunnel and I'm not going to be thinking too much about God, I'm just gonna be

84
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.290
Richelle Direny: Me and

85
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.700
Patrick S: Yeah, there's too much if I'm under too much stress.

86
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.980
Patrick S: It's hard. It's hard for me to have relationship.

87
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.520
Patrick S: And I know, I know. He's like,

88
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.180
Patrick S: On, you know, I understand that.

89
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.070
Patrick S: That's not good.

90
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.430
Patrick S: In the sense of, I guess, it got worse.

91
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.490
Patrick S: Well,

92
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:25.560
Patrick S: Like I'm supposed to know that everything's gonna be okay and have faith in God. Take care of understand that it's just

93
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.080
Patrick S: I don't know if it's um

94
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.650
Richelle Direny: It's a little hard when you look at your situation in front of you.

95
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.420
Patrick S: Yes. And yeah.

96
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.290
Patrick S: It is

97
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.210
Patrick S: And then I

98
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.280
Patrick S: Have to go to work and

99
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.810
Patrick S: I just spent a lot of time there and don't enjoy it.

100
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.150
Um,

101
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:16.530
Patrick S: You know, I would be nice. I don't feel like I have the freedom to go find another job right now because of this box and program because that's my health insurance right there. I know you know what i'm in

102
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.850
Richelle Direny: I'm weren't you

103
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.730
Richelle Direny: You weren't. Are you a veteran.

104
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.140
Patrick S: Yeah, we weren't

105
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:40.260
Richelle Direny: We were the ones that about you looking into going to the getting registered with the VA.

106
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.750
Patrick S: Yeah, that's right, yeah.

107
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.790
Richelle Direny: Yeah. Okay, so what about that. Did you look into that.

108
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.620
Patrick S: Model.

109
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.450
Richelle Direny: Because sometimes when you think about and and

110
00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:00.960
Richelle Direny: Within respective means, and it really just depends on when you say

111
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:09.780
Richelle Direny: When you look at spirituality and how deep you want to get and kind of how you want to explore that but sometimes it even not even really taking it from that angle.

112
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:25.170
Richelle Direny: Sometimes when you look at your situation that's laid out in front of you. It's somewhat hard to compartmentalize each situation and kind of structure and organize to figure out how do I address the

113
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:38.340
Richelle Direny: Problem that lies in front of me, and how do I get each get through each of it. Um, you look at your problems and your circumstances.

114
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.120
Richelle Direny: Are we all

115
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.130
Richelle Direny: I should say, for that matter, when you look at it.

116
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.020
Richelle Direny: Think about

117
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:52.260
Richelle Direny: Going to an event, whether it's Fourth of July Thanksgiving, whatever it is. And often times at these events. What is the

118
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.000
Richelle Direny: What is the big thing that we do.

119
00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:05.040
Richelle Direny: What is one of the big things that each of the that's a common factor and every event that you go to Thanksgiving. Fourth of July Memorial Day. What is a big thing that everybody does.

120
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:07.980
He

121
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:25.290
Richelle Direny: Eat food and with the eating of the food on your plate, you have a little bit of everything. Because you look at, like, Oh, I gotta try a little bit of everything. Right. So when you look at your place, all you see is a lot of food.

122
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:37.110
Richelle Direny: Rice chicken salad bread vegetables you see a whole lot of food on your plate. And it's so much that you really can't see the point. Right.

123
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:45.090
Richelle Direny: So that's like your light at the end of the tunnel, because all you're seeing is all of this in front of you. But what we have to do is take our time.

124
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:52.050
Richelle Direny: And kind of section on each thing. So you have your rice in one section, you have your

125
00:15:52.560 --> 00:16:05.880
Richelle Direny: Chicken in one section, you have your salad in one section so you you put each in its designated place so that you're better able to figure out how am I going to get. So each of these things. How am I gonna

126
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.170
Patrick S: Finish each of these

127
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:13.050
Richelle Direny: And that's how you have to look at your issues. It's this big plan everything is kind of comes together.

128
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:30.930
Richelle Direny: And when it's clumped together. It's hard to see through it. It's hard to see how am I going to figure this out. Like all I'm seeing is all of these issues. So one thing. And the reason why I bring it up. One thing we talked about is the fact that you are a veteran.

129
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.780
Richelle Direny: And you are married.

130
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.980
Patrick S: It's looking

131
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:40.560
Richelle Direny: Into getting registered with the VA and exploring from a medical, like, you know, how can I

132
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:55.620
Richelle Direny: Get medical benefits for myself or my wife, giving them a veteran and all of the different and what benefits are there for me as a veteran that I can

133
00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:05.640
Richelle Direny: You know, go and apply for that you know whether or not you were if you serve during a time of acts of war. If you are service connected in

134
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.330
Richelle Direny: Some way if there is any better in there in

135
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:11.910
Richelle Direny: Your in Michigan. Right.

136
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.220
Patrick S: Yeah yeah yeah

137
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.380
Patrick S: There's a, there's a VA office in town.

138
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.200
Patrick S: Hospital. There's just

139
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:34.230
Richelle Direny: No, but each VA office, he just is is a link to a main hospital so wherever your main hospital.

140
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.670
Richelle Direny: It's wherever it is what you you you

141
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:55.080
Richelle Direny: You go to a clinic because they accommodate they make these community based clinics for people who live far from the main hospital so you can go to the clinic, just to see the provider. But everything is still requested out of me.

142
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.150
Richelle Direny: So,

143
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.040
Richelle Direny: It's looking at it from that standpoint and seeing aren't as a veteran.

144
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:12.690
Richelle Direny: Let me explore what benefits are there for me as a veteran. Okay. Is there any type of additional income that I can get

145
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.330
Richelle Direny: As a veteran of

146
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:31.530
Richelle Direny: My time in the military was I, you know, is there any of that, you'll see that I thought, while I served and. Would I be eligible for any type of compensation until you go and you explore it will not

147
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.900
Richelle Direny: But that's additional income.

148
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:41.280
Richelle Direny: Given that I have a wife. I am married on issue eligible for any kind of

149
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.760
Richelle Direny: Florence give you that I am to me on her own. She will

150
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.060
Patrick S: Be

151
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.100
Richelle Direny: Given that she's married for veterans.

152
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.340
Richelle Direny: Is there some beneficial intention.

153
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.010
Richelle Direny: She won't know until you find that out.

154
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:06.600
Richelle Direny: So yeah, until you understand when I say you take everything you put it, you structure it you section and then you work each

155
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.480
Richelle Direny: Because if you try to do everything all at once. That's just really, really hard.

156
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:27.180
Richelle Direny: And soul, like you said, you know, from a spiritual standpoint, like you want to just say God like You know what, what you take things off of my plate and he's trying to say, okay, well how about your, your structure everything that's in front of you.

157
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.530
Patrick S: Maybe you have everything that

158
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.320
Was very hard for sure.

159
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:33.330
Patrick S: So,

160
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.060
Richelle Direny: Just kind of Section each thing and kind of

161
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.870
Richelle Direny: Address.

162
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.770
Richelle Direny: You can address them all at one time. But you can do one at a time.

163
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:51.990
Richelle Direny: So think about the plate in front of you, can you keep everything. Can you put chicken rice sound critical all of it in your mouth. One time is all at once.

164
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.370
Patrick S: No, no.

165
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.090
Patrick S: Probably not.

166
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:09.900
Richelle Direny: Bro. Yeah. No, you don't want to show you do that, then you're going to choke then somebody's going to do for something on so

167
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:15.720
Richelle Direny: It's the same thing was when you try to address all of your issues at one time.

168
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.700
Richelle Direny: That's when you get overwhelmed. You start choking.

169
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.440
Patrick S: And you need someone to

170
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.990
Patrick S: Rescue because you're saying

171
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.040
Richelle Direny: You know, this is really overwhelming. So

172
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.140
Richelle Direny: You know, I definitely will encourage them to

173
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:45.540
Richelle Direny: Continue to work on getting an appointment. It doesn't get rid of your insurance. I mean, each state when it comes to be at least a little different.

174
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.380
Patrick S: What

175
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:47.610
Richelle Direny: You know,

176
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.740
Patrick S: Present get rid of your insurance. In fact,

177
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.640
Richelle Direny: Having the insurance is a good thing but

178
00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:55.530
You know,

179
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.290
Richelle Direny: Doing majority of

180
00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:15.450
Richelle Direny: Your medical or whatever it's related to medical doing it through the VA. That helps alleviate one situation, but just exploring. Is there any kind of financial compensation through the VA, what are, what are some benefits that we make it through the

181
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.490
Richelle Direny: Financial

182
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:18.690
Yeah.

183
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.720
Patrick S: Yeah.

184
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:28.740
Patrick S: I was supposed to go to a hearing test couple years ago and I never went

185
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.010
Patrick S: But I know I'd be a couple hundred bucks a month.

186
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.340
Richelle Direny: Because our drone general

187
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.260
Richelle Direny: If you're hearing loss.

188
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.100
Richelle Direny: Was during

189
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:39.900
Richelle Direny: The military

190
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:55.470
Patrick S: Well, I work next to loud generators and then I was stationed right by the term Mac or whatever were jets take off and land in Korea.

191
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:02.220
Patrick S: Mm hmm. So yeah, definitely, uh, definitely get a couple hundred bucks a month 10% of my hearing

192
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:16.470
Patrick S: And I know most of the what I try to claim, would it be mental health. And that's exactly, that's what the Battle Creek VA is mental health and

193
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.310
Patrick S: That's the closest one, that means so

194
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.540
Patrick S: I just, I've just never got around to it, but

195
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:27.720
It's

196
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.880
Patrick S: I guess it's just something I need to do. It's a

197
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.930
Patrick S: It's it stinks because

198
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.730
Patrick S: Because I do work so much and

199
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:51.930
Patrick S: I've probably ended up taking personal days and vacation days we go to the doctor, then, so then I never have a day off.

200
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.350
Richelle Direny: But it's something you know just explored us to see um

201
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.820
Patrick S: You know, when came

202
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.860
Richelle Direny: from a financial standpoint if you're getting let's say for hearing

203
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.490
Richelle Direny: Let's say $200 just for hearing a little

204
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.540
Richelle Direny: Mental health, you get diagnosed with a mental

205
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.130
Richelle Direny: Mental

206
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:27.660
Richelle Direny: Disorder initial illness and that has some kind of compensation attached to it.

207
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:28.890
More

208
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.820
Patrick S: Mental health. The be quite a lot of money each month.

209
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.890
Patrick S: I forget if it was 60% of

210
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.210
Patrick S: What you made a mall and then in the army.

211
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.030
Patrick S: No hearings touch.

212
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.710
Richelle Direny: But I mean, I know that for

213
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.710
Richelle Direny: To get a certain percentage

214
00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:06.810
Richelle Direny: I think you have to do it during a time of active were if you were serving during a time of active work and if everything documents that all that you acquire was during your time.

215
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.550
Richelle Direny: That you serve. But again, every state is different. Oh, what

216
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.070
Patrick S: You know what, you know, I joined

217
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:21.180
Patrick S: I joined a join the service during the Second World War.

218
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:34.110
Richelle Direny: Okay, it was worth, even if it's one day. Let's say you joined on the, the day that it ended, as long as it's one day during that time you kid.

219
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.650
Richelle Direny: You can benefit from it but

220
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.020
Richelle Direny: Like you have some knowledge of it, but then

221
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.620
Richelle Direny: I guess life business as allowed you go in and explore it a little bit more

222
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:57.000
Patrick S: Yeah, I just, I talked to other like jailhouse lawyers.

223
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.790
Patrick S: But you know what I mean.

224
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.070
Richelle Direny: Because that sounds familiar.

225
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.910
Patrick S: Yeah, just

226
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.260
Patrick S: Just from other people been to the VA and

227
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:18.180
Patrick S: Who have claims and and know what you're talking about.

228
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:23.610
Patrick S: No.

229
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.590
Richelle Direny: Definitely. That's what of jail.

230
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:34.620
Richelle Direny: When you said a jailhouse Lori. I thought you talking about like those people there have served their time in jail anybody

231
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.770
Richelle Direny: Time to educate themselves about the law.

232
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.230
Patrick S: Actually project. Oh, no.

233
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:42.990
Patrick S: No.

234
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:54.000
Richelle Direny: Okay, but either way it's something it's something definitely to war. And I think that sometimes

235
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.680
Richelle Direny: You know, like you

236
00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:12.780
Richelle Direny: You see, God for certain things and it's kind of like you're questioning is you give me the answer in football. Maybe he is but he's just haven't records. That's what you're asking for help and maybe he's providing the assistance. But the question is, are you taking advantage of it.

237
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.060
Patrick S: I can you hold on a second.

238
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.410
Okay.

239
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.330
Patrick S: Sorry about that.

240
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:45.690
Patrick S: Yeah.

241
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:53.160
Patrick S: I don't know too much about phones, like I said, it said my phone said something about a

242
00:27:54.870 --> 00:28:01.110
Patrick S: High speed data. So I just asked my wife, what it was talking about. Okay.

243
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.770
Patrick S: Yeah.

244
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.160
So,

245
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.400
Richelle Direny: Now, in terms of wanting to improve the relationship with your wife. I know you talked about going to

246
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.230
Richelle Direny: Our Excel to me. How's that been going for you.

247
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:34.860
Patrick S: Well,

248
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:42.480
Patrick S: I don't know, like we got a great relationship. I just, I just met like

249
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.930
Patrick S: It's just most important thing in my life and

250
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.840
Patrick S: I just meant like

251
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.340
Patrick S: How to make it better. Even though it's great.

252
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.530
Patrick S: You know, I mean,

253
00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.050
Richelle Direny: Yeah, right now, everything is going really well.

254
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.360
Patrick S: Yeah, it really, as always, man.

255
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:14.850
And

256
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:16.800
Patrick S: He

257
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:21.420
Patrick S: Was

258
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.320
Richelle Direny: really supportive of you in the program.

259
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.900
Yes.

260
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:32.760
Richelle Direny: Okay.

261
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:39.870
Richelle Direny: Now, have you ever thought about like looking into recovery support groups.

262
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:41.940
Richelle Direny: From

263
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.590
Richelle Direny: Christian perspective. Have you thought about going to their fruits are they

264
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.160
Happen.

265
00:29:48.690 --> 00:30:15.300
Patrick S: Yeah, there's a Celebrate Recovery. But there's a chance they don't do that anymore. I'm not sure it was at the her church at a Celebrate Recovery group, but they got a new pastor. A couple years ago, and I know I went to it one time and they played that movie. I can only imagine.

266
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.100
Patrick S: And

267
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.870
Richelle Direny: I'm Did you watch it at the church.

268
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.150
Yes.

269
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.070
Patrick S: It was pretty good.

270
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.430
Richelle Direny: What resonated

271
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.060
Patrick S: Um,

272
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.530
Patrick S: It was a long time ago.

273
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.220
Patrick S: I don't really remember that much.

274
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.620
Richelle Direny: The father was the one that was the, I think he was an alcoholic.

275
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.620
Patrick S: I don't know.

276
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.720
Yeah, the father was Valley.

277
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:58.830
Patrick S: Yeah, I knew I just knew it was a huge dick.

278
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.540
Patrick S: But then he got cancer and

279
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:12.420
Patrick S: I don't, I don't even remember if he found God, he just started being a better guy when he got cancer.

280
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.490
Richelle Direny: Yeah, the father was an alcoholic and he abused the sun.

281
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.630
Richelle Direny: But then later on the sun found out

282
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:37.560
Richelle Direny: That he was abused the same exact way he abused his son, he was being abused by his father insanely and I think that father was an alcoholic. So it was kind of look at Federation, all it was a cycle.

283
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.880
Yeah.

284
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:42.150
Richelle Direny: So,

285
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.690
Richelle Direny: But you said that they showed it in the movie.

286
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.880
Richelle Direny: I mean they shown it at the church.

287
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.400
Patrick S: Yeah. Celebrate Recovery played the the

288
00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.490
Patrick S: Movie for us.

289
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:10.830
Richelle Direny: I think it was more about forgiveness. Then, cuz I'm trying to figure out what would be the that particular movie.

290
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.520
Richelle Direny: But I think it was more on forgiveness.

291
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:15.930
Yes.

292
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.750
Richelle Direny: forgiving people

293
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.700
Richelle Direny: That you've heard

294
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.640
Richelle Direny: Or the people for giving you that you that you will hurt.

295
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:27.930
Right.

296
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.980
Richelle Direny: You just went by yourself.

297
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.790
Patrick S: Well friends dead.

298
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.220
Patrick S: Yeah, he was hanging out and doing yard work and stuff.

299
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.140
Patrick S: Just add somebody to hang out with

300
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.090
Oh,

301
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.450
Richelle Direny: Okay, so you still hang out with that person.

302
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.950
No.

303
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.790
Patrick S: No, I was when I first got out of rehab.

304
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.060
Richelle Direny: Uh huh.

305
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.050
Richelle Direny: He said, when you first got out of rehab.

306
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:17.190
Yeah.

307
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.460
Richelle Direny: So what happened. You don't talk to that person anymore.

308
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.560

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:39.540
Richelle Direny: So what. So who in terms of outside of your wife or some positive supports that you have

Patrick S: Oh, my parents.

311
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.270
Patrick S: Some people at the meetings. There's a guy I work with who also goes to the meeting.

312
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.950
Patrick S: I've talked to him a few times.

313
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.220
Patrick S: He's helped me out a lie Yelp and put on a front door on the house.

314
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.890
Patrick S: Helped me moves and stuff of his truck quite a few times.

315
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.570
Patrick S: As movie my sponsor and

316
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.330
Patrick S: He was pretty much

317
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.570
Patrick S: He told me he

318
00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.090
Patrick S: He really wasn't up to it at that time.

319
00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.790
Richelle Direny: To being our sponsor.

320
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:39.930
Yeah.

321
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.210
Richelle Direny: Okay. And have you ever worked with anyone else.

322
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:50.880
Patrick S: Is three people to be my sponsor and I got denied three times.

323
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.130
Richelle Direny: They kind of gave up on the whole for having getting a sponsor.

324
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.480
Patrick S: Yeah, and

325
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:09.840
Patrick S: I know it's just the but I didn't in my home group. I didn't think there were too many

326
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:11.700
Patrick S: People

327
00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:15.360
Patrick S: That would be good sponsors.

328
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:28.830
Richelle Direny: So I mean after the people turns you down, you didn't like I know you said like you're admitting to the fact that nothing but you never really

329
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.510
Richelle Direny: Care to ask anybody else.

330
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:31.620
Um,

331
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.080
Patrick S: No.

332
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.600
Patrick S: I guess I want a mom, I think it'd be kind of fun to do a CT stuff.

333
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:48.900
Patrick S: fourth step.

334
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.210
Richelle Direny: Okay.

335
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.670
Richelle Direny: So elaborate a little bit

336
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.720
Patrick S: Well, I don't know if it'd be fun.

337
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.140
Patrick S: I think it might be beneficial.

338
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.640
Richelle Direny: Elaborate a little bit

339
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.860
Patrick S: elaborate on why be beneficial.

340
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.260
What is the

341
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.280
Patrick S: What is the fourth stuff.

342
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:25.740
Patrick S: It's the searching and fearless moral inventory

343
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.280
Patrick S: Yeah.

344
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.440
Richelle Direny: And have you done that. Are you starting in or

345
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.510
Patrick S: No, I have a

346
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:46.260
Patrick S: Sponsor to help you. I've done you know I've done this a lot going to confession

347
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:53.220
Patrick S: You know, Catholic church going to confess my sins.

348
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.480

Patrick S: Yeah, well, I'm

351
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.470
Patrick S: I'm struggling with that one turning over

352
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.850
Patrick S: Yeah, that's probably the hardest one

353
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:33.300
Patrick S: Is turning you know everything over to God. That's, that's definitely my hardest one

354
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.990
Richelle Direny: What's your biggest struggle with that one.

355
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.390
Patrick S: Well, cuz

356
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.570
Patrick S: It's just because I'm a I obsess over

357
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.370
Patrick S: I'm

358
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.680
Patrick S: Obstacles or

359
00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:55.860
Patrick S: Fears or

360
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.690
Patrick S: Yeah, I guess obstacles, you know,

361
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.980
Patrick S: Like the whole money thing, two weeks ago was all I could think about

362
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.340
Richelle Direny: What you didn't know that.

363
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.790
Richelle Direny: You know that it makes you human being. Right.

364
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.040
Richelle Direny: Thanks you naturally

365
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.860
Richelle Direny: That we will struggle with, with different obstacles, all the time.

366
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:32.640
Patrick S: Hello.

367
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:34.050
Yeah.

368
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.800
Patrick S: But everything was dark, you're

369
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.680
Richelle Direny: I think you're from

370
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.770
Richelle Direny: But yeah, I mean,

371
00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.320
Richelle Direny: Do you think that

372
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.170
Richelle Direny: What when you think about when it says

373
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.380
Richelle Direny: Turning over your will.

374
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:54.840
Richelle Direny: Of God.

375
00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.220
Richelle Direny: When, when you when you think about what it says, like in your mind.

376
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.180
Patrick S: How does that compute the. Step three.

377
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.520
Patrick S: Michelle, are you still there.

378
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:27.510
I am

379
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:35.250
Patrick S: Going on my phone, or keeps kicking me out cutting off.

380
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.100
Richelle Direny: Baby is your internet is your signal.

381
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:42.120
Patrick S: Maybe

382
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.080
Richelle Direny: That happened to me today. I think it has something to do with your signal.

383
00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:55.290
Richelle Direny: Is are that are there. What is it tethering down your, your data or whatever it's called. Is that what's going on.

384
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.030
Patrick S: I don't know.

385
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:06.450
Richelle Direny: I think when they do that I want, I believe, then your, your internet connection or something like that is not a great

386
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:20.460
Patrick S: Website, the mine. I was losing my high speed data like 100 gig and around all gigs hundred something more up so

387
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:25.050
Richelle Direny: So they're slowing it down. When you ask your wife is that what she said.

388
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.990
Patrick S: Yeah, that it was going to be slower.

389
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:30.870
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's what, that's why. It keeps kicking you off.

390
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:32.280
Richelle Direny: Your

391
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:38.070
Richelle Direny: Service. We're news and you get it back. Until then they're going to slow it now.

392
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.490
Patrick S: Well, I mean, okay. They've done some good for

393
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:46.320
Patrick S: Zoom.

394
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.890
Richelle Direny: For one, does your plan renews

395
00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:52.860
Patrick S: I don't know. I do.

396
00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:02.880
Richelle Direny: I mean, it doesn't, it's not going to cut it off. It just slows it down. They just that's kind of what company are you with

397
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.360
Richelle Direny: I'm here, I can hear you. I

398
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:18.780
Patrick S: Can't

399
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.650
Richelle Direny: Hear you, I'm here.

400
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.000
Yeah.

401
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.310
Patrick S: Keeps kicking me out of the room and then coming back.

402
00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:28.560
Richelle Direny: What company are you with

403
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:30.510
Patrick S: What's up,

404
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.720
Richelle Direny: What company are you with T Mobile Verizon what

405
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:41.100
Richelle Direny: Yeah, maybe that's what it is. Your whatever data plan, whatever the your plan is that you guys have

406
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:50.520
Richelle Direny: It's probably slowing you down because of whatever if I if you only bought like 100 gig or 20 gauge from us up a lot.

407
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.570
Patrick S: So you

408
00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.820
Richelle Direny: Are up. I mean, I can still hear you.

409
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.880
Patrick S: Oh, turn video

410
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:07.860
Richelle Direny: I mean, that's fine. I don't, I'm not seeing right now. I'm seeing a blank screen, but I could hear you.

411
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:09.990
Richelle Direny: Now,

412
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.190
Richelle Direny: I can hear you.

413
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.720
Patrick S: Okay, yeah, I don't know.

414
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:20.730
Patrick S: So hit stop video

415
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:37.860
Richelle Direny: You can try and see what that that does, it's more of the Zoom is what is that your internet connection is what the issue is. So whether the Zoom is. I mean, the cameras off or not, it doesn't really do anything. It's the whole zoom. If you're using Wi Fi.

416
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.720
Patrick S: Okay, well, I hit stop video

417
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.100
Richelle Direny: So let's see if

418
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.780
Patrick S: It makes a difference, I think, that just means you can't see me.

419
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.920
Patrick S: As I see you know

420
00:42:50.460 --> 00:43:06.420
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's all it means I can't see, that's fine. But either way, I was asking for step three, when it says turning over your will to God and then you said you struggle with it because of your moments where you obsess over things that are

421
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.910
Patrick S: Out of your control. So

422
00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.370
Richelle Direny: I just wanted a, like a better

423
00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.080
Richelle Direny: Insight or deeper insight in

424
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.970
Richelle Direny: How does your mind when instead

425
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.170
Richelle Direny: Of

426
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.390
Richelle Direny: Turning over your God.

427
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.450
Richelle Direny: And how do you apply that

428
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.950
Patrick S: Apply that to stop worrying.

429
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.840
Okay.

430
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.050
Richelle Direny: So when

431
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.390
Richelle Direny: You're not turning over your will.

432
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:46.680
Patrick S: Well, yeah, or if you try to can if you try to keep controlling everything you're not turning over your will.

433
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:53.670
Richelle Direny: Okay, and so that can be true. But the question is,

434
00:43:55.110 --> 00:44:00.120
Richelle Direny: Do you completely like stop working on. Step three. Or do you

435
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.240
Richelle Direny: Isn't it a conscious effort.

436
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:06.570
Patrick S: I guess.

437
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:13.770
Patrick S: Yeah, it's, it's a daily thing. It's a

438
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:17.340
Patrick S: Yet like

439
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:25.560
Patrick S: I don't know, I guess would be kind of like a boxing scenario you get knocked down and you sit there and

440
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:32.910
Patrick S: You worry over something you can't control for a bit. And after a while, you got to get up.

441
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.390
Patrick S: And start giving it back over to God again.

442
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:48.420
Richelle Direny: Uh huh, uh huh. So it is a struggle. But I think it's a. Do you believe that pretty much everyone somewhat has that struggle.

443
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.160
Patrick S: Oh, yeah.

444
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.430
Patrick S: Yeah, I'm assuming everybody does.

445
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.410
Richelle Direny: Everyone has that struggle.

446
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.320
Richelle Direny: Because you're you're going off of your own cognition and how things should be

447
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.550
Patrick S: Yeah.

448
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:13.050
Patrick S: It goes back to our interesting like that's that's helpful.

449
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.290
Patrick S: I don't ever think about

450
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.120
Patrick S: Oh,

451
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.870
Patrick S: Oh, other people struggle with egos.

452
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:32.310
Richelle Direny: And natural we don't naturally. That's why we lose our ability to cope, because we were just thinking about ourselves.

453
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.450
I mean,

454
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:43.140
Richelle Direny: Do you think that individually as humans, where we're all selfish individual like in our own way. We're all selfish means

455
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.330
Richelle Direny: No.

456
00:45:52.530 --> 00:46:00.960
Patrick S: Yeah, kicked me out. Again, I'm back. You were saying something about do I think as individuals will selfish individual. Yes.

457
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:06.390
Richelle Direny: Do you think as individuals, as human. Do you think that we're all selfish in our own way.

458
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:12.000
Patrick S: No, I think everybody's different.

459
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:18.420
Richelle Direny: Okay. I mean, but when I say selfish, like in our own way. When you think about selfishness.

460
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:23.400
Richelle Direny: Do you think we think about ourselves at all times. So we, for the most part.

461
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.100
Patrick S: Yeah.

462
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:30.600
Richelle Direny: Okay, so if we're thinking about ourselves. If I'm hurting

463
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:43.740
Richelle Direny: Am I thinking about in my time of hurting my reaction is hurting someone else am I thinking about how it might be my behavior. My time of hurting how it might be affecting the next person.

464
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.160
Patrick S: Oh,

465
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:56.580
Patrick S: Yeah, well, yeah, and I guess I guess I should try it well.

466
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.540
Patrick S: Like I know

467
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.970
Patrick S: I know when I'm struggling and people see

468
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.880
Patrick S: The

469
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.860
Patrick S: They'll take on some of my struggle.

470
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:26.520
Richelle Direny: But think about, think about it from this. Okay, so let's just use it with your wife. I'm not gonna bring anybody else in your family. But let's just use it because that's the person that's closest to you right now.

471
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.890
Patrick S: If you're overwhelmed.

472
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.360
Richelle Direny: You're just stressed that

473
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.040
Richelle Direny: About the work or what have you.

474
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:33.570
Patrick S: And you come to you.

475
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:40.500
Richelle Direny: And your wife is just naturally. She's not feeling how you're feeling in that moment, but she's just really just trying to help.

476
00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:49.710
Richelle Direny: Or whatever the situation is, but in that moment, you're just really overwhelmed, you're frustrated, you're angry and you can't recognize it, or being aware of it.

477
00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:57.510
Richelle Direny: You start snapping at her, or you so much kind of shut around, you don't, I don't want to talk. I don't want to be around like you just kind of shut around

478
00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.340
Richelle Direny: Ever actually

479
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.940
Like that.

480
00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.490
Patrick S: Yeah.

481
00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:07.020
Richelle Direny: And so in us doing that in that moment.

482
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.380
Richelle Direny: We're being selfish, because in that moment, I'm just thinking about

483
00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.070
Richelle Direny: How I feel I'm not thinking about how

484
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:31.440
Richelle Direny: He's shutting out my partner. It's actually hurting them because the reality is that they're trying to help me carry that burden, but I'm saying no, this is my burden, no one to hold on to my burden and however that burden makes me feel that's what I want to do in that moment.

485
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.350
Richelle Direny: without recognizing it so our

486
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.730
Richelle Direny: Actions, in turn,

487
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.870
Richelle Direny: Is affecting the next person. So when I

488
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:42.810
Richelle Direny: Say what we're all selfish in our own way.

489
00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.200
Richelle Direny: That it just goes back to

490
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:54.270
Richelle Direny: You know, when we think about. Step three. And turning over our will just turning everything over.

491
00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:01.260
Richelle Direny: Here that we have a hard time doing that because all we're thinking about is ourselves and how we're

492
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:01.770
Patrick S: Feeling

493
00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.170
Richelle Direny: And like, you know, you just kind of hold

494
00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:12.270
Richelle Direny: On to whatever emotion or thought or whatever it is, instead of just saying, no, I'm going to turn it over. I'm not going to allow

495
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.540
Richelle Direny: overwhelming feeling to

496
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.530
Richelle Direny: Consume me

497
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:26.280
Richelle Direny: Because what step three is saying is not turn it all over to me turn everything over to me. Don't hold on to it. Don't

498
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:27.570
Richelle Direny: Just

499
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.740
Turn it over to me.

500
00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.500
Richelle Direny: We understand

501
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.500
Richelle Direny: Or you

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:53.040

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.100
Richelle Direny: So, alright, so we will pick back up this question, we meet every other week. Right.
