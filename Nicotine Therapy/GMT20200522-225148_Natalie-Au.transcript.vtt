00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.830
Natalie Austin: Did they send you any like new information like on the urine drug screens.

160
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.860
Brooke Oaks: Whoa.

161
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.130
Natalie Austin: Don't set the price on your new urine drug screen.

162
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:09.750
Brooke Oaks: Okay.

163
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:11.010
Natalie Austin: It's easy to do, though, you've

164
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.480
Natalie Austin: Probably already done them right

165
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.630
Brooke Oaks: Oh yeah, I've done them before. Yeah.

166
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:16.020
Okay.

167
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.700
Natalie Austin: Yeah, you do. Last one. You did wasn't see here, September. Yeah, okay.

168
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.510
Natalie Austin: Good. That one was very good. Yep, mm hmm

169
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:39.240
Natalie Austin: Um, the, some of them are doing now you do at home and you just take a picture of it. So that'll be easy for you so you don't have to leave.

170
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:41.940
Natalie Austin: Is that how the last one was

171
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:47.430
Brooke Oaks: They did them and they gave you, like, a minute to use the bathroom and then you come back, and then you just kind of

172
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:48.990
Brooke Oaks: Your cadence.

173
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:54.270
Natalie Austin: Yeah. Cool. Okay, I think that's neat that. That way you don't believe that's pretty cool.

174
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.930
Natalie Austin: Oh, good. Yeah, yours was good.

175
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:00.990
Okay.

176
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.250
Natalie Austin: And then you had labs done

177
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.550
Natalie Austin: And may

178
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.000
Natalie Austin: You probably don't need to redo those. I don't think so.

179
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:26.580
Brooke Oaks: Well, if she needs anything except the drug testing that if we're going to hold off until we just got we're getting are signed up for Medicaid. I think the emergency room was getting started on it.

180
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.080
Brooke Oaks: So,

181
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:37.260
Brooke Oaks: Medicaid here know where you are. But now we've expanded Medicaid. So she should be able to get on it relatively quickly and relatively easily some

182
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:43.380
Natalie Austin: Good. Yeah, I saw that my secretary gave me those notes already up. I'm glad.

183
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.920
Natalie Austin: I'm glad they were helpful to you in the ER. That's great.

184
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:54.000
Natalie Austin: She it's hard. If you don't have the resources. I know they're very helpful over there. That's great.

185
00:29:54.030 --> 00:30:00.030
Brooke Oaks: Well, this is a new standalone ER and like that nobody's ever there. That's why we went

186
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.570
Natalie Austin: Oh nice, really know how are you good for you.

187
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.160
Brooke Oaks: there yet. So our yeah in any are in and out an hour.

188
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.620
Natalie Austin: I never even heard of a standalone er before it's like a med express com thing.

189
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:24.060
Brooke Oaks: Is it's affiliate its affiliated with a local hospital in another community over. We have a lot of them around here. Let's just kind of like, or they're attached to a

190
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:37.950
Brooke Oaks: Doctor's office building, you know, just a mini er, you know, they didn't have do surgeries and things like that. But they definitely stabilized and yeah I mean I've been there a couple times myself. I've been issues and

191
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.430
Brooke Oaks: Yeah, it is it and then they've got like

192
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:51.210
Brooke Oaks: You know X rays and cat and things like that, too. So, but it's not. It's not a big hospital settings. Just a small building so

193
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.410
Gotcha.

194
00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.340
Natalie Austin: So what do they do, if there's like a heart attack. They probably send them out.

195
00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:15.270
Brooke Oaks: They probably ambulance. I think they've got some rooms there. It's just not a full facility, it's, it's a, it's in between, like, it's out in a rural area really in between to college in areas. So it's kind of like a way station, I guess, you know,

196
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:32.640
Brooke Oaks: If you need more. I know. If you need more. They probably you know transport you but you know they can handle the app and documented probably just get you out and get Jeff to the other hospital for surgery. I don't know. I've been gone for pain so

197
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:38.370
Natalie Austin: Oh, nice. That's good. They have those that's good there even available. It's amazing.

198
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.180
Brooke Oaks: Yeah.

199
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:44.190
Natalie Austin: Because like you said, You're right. There's not a whole lot of hospitals around. We live in a in the rural area.

200
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.500
That's great.

201
00:31:47.700 --> 00:32:02.460
Natalie Austin: But yeah, I don't think you need any more bloodwork. But if they do definitely you can hold off any and any new patients, we've had, I've told them you know they can wait. It's not imperative, because the lab work just checked your, you know, liver and kidney

202
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.020
Natalie Austin: It's just your basic health check up you know more for you guys.

203
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:09.390
Natalie Austin: So that's fine.

204
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.250
Natalie Austin: And that we have groups.

205
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:15.840
