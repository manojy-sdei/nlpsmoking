Krista Forby-Hunter: Yeah, not that. Oh.

147
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.470
Okay.

148
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:35.310
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, so you feeling today. No problems, you don't have any cold symptoms right nipples sneezes nothing

149
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.750
Krista Forby-Hunter: No. Okay.

150
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.410
Jill Beavers-Kirby: How much of the boxes were you taking

151
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.450
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Each day

152
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:53.910
Krista Forby-Hunter: And when I get to a day. So like if I have was I feel like crap or can't sleep. Okay.

153
00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:02.490
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So if you had three a day would you take three day if you got your hands on three, you think, or do you think to a day.

154
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.350
Krista Forby-Hunter: Um, I don't know. Okay.

155
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.980
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So there's a couple different ways that

156
00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:19.320
Jill Beavers-Kirby: We can start on Suboxone. And so one of the easiest phase. Um, I forgot to ask what i'm sure once

157
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:28.140
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Molina okay so Molina prefers the film. Is that what you were getting off the street, the film.

158
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.330
Krista Forby-Hunter: Yeah. Okay. All right.

159
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:43.800
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So you can cut them and in half, or you can even cut it in a force. So what I like to do is I'm going to send you some film, you know, a quality and some film and

160
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:57.690
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You're gonna, I want you to feel crappy. I want you to feel like you're in what draw. All right. I want you to, you know, maybe your nose is running your eyes are watering a little bit and I want you to take a half of film.

161
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:17.310
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Then wait about four hours. See how you're feeling, you know, make sure the film and maybe your cheek over here gums, or under your tongue. Make sure it dissolves going up 20 minutes where you start feeling anything about that.

162
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:29.880
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So I want you to take a half of them, and then you'll wait about four hours, you're going to see how you feel. If you all feel bad crappy

163
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.380
The film. Okay.

164
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.680
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And that'll be it for the first day.

165
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:58.320
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The second day, um, you know, you're gonna make a half of film. And then you have the second day, see how you feel. If you feel like crap and four hours. The other half, and then you'll see how it goes throughout the day. I will. I'm

166
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:07.350
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Looking forward, I will send you all the information or one of the care providers will, it will all be wrote out and very easy.

167
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.980
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It looks like.

168
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.240
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It looks like this.

169
00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.200
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Look like this. So,

170
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:31.770
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I'll say you take, you know, you take a half of film great take the other half way and it'll guide you through like what to do for the first days. Okay.

171
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.290
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, and that's going to be good.

172
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.700
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Give me an idea about what you're doing is going to be

173
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:46.830
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So the number of films that you've been in off the street, that's fine. That's what you've been get through the news and everything.

174
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:55.380
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But now we really want you to start to feel better. We want those cells in your body screaming for their heroin and we want

175
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:07.470
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It and start taking the Suboxone and be okay with that. So they don't like I said make you feel like crap so you, you just take as much as you need to, where you feel okay

176
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:17.520
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And then we'll discuss that. And that will be your dose. Some people take one normal day. Some people take one film twice a day, you know,

177
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.530
Krista Forby-Hunter: Everybody's different. It's

178
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:31.140
Jill Beavers-Kirby: It has nothing to do with how much you how much drugs, you've taken in the past. It doesn't have anything to do with how long you've been on drugs. It's just how your body is going to break this day.

179
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.850
Krista Forby-Hunter: Yeah. Everybody's got different

180
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:42.030
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Exactly. Everybody's different. And like I said Molina likes us to use the film instead of the tablets. So that will be what I send them for you.

181
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.410
Um,

182
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.430
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So you mentioned a little bit of problem with depression, a little bit of problem with anxiety.

183
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.570
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Do you take the marijuana like recreational or medical

184
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.950
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Any problems with chronic pain.

185
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.320
Krista Forby-Hunter: You know,

186
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.140
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And the medicine that you're on for the anxiety that's working well for you right now.

187
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.920
Krista Forby-Hunter: Yeah. Well, it was said again.

188
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:15.510
Krista Forby-Hunter: Being

189
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:28.890
Jill Beavers-Kirby: On it. Yeah, I think once we get, you know, get you on a nice steady dose of the Suboxone and get these medicines and I depressant medicines going. I think you're going to start to feel really

190
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:40.470
Jill Beavers-Kirby: A lot better it's going to take some time though it's not an overnight fix you know it didn't take you, you did get like overnight so I can't fix it overnight. It's going to take a few weeks. Okay.

191
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:50.580
Jill Beavers-Kirby: All right, so you mentioned a friend that does bright heart health. So hopefully that friend has told you about the group counseling that bright heart health does

192
00:19:51.120 --> 00:20:01.740
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And what that is, it's like I said, a group of people. I'll be there since I'm the one who manages your medication, a therapist will be there. And then there's other people who are like you

193
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.120
Jill Beavers-Kirby: People who have problems with going this just like you.

194
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:15.390
Jill Beavers-Kirby: There, they're going to be at different stages than you, because they've been on Suboxone you know maybe one started two months ago maybe one first started last week.

195
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:24.030
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So there'll be at different stages but everybody's got some really great ideas. Everybody's got a story to tell and so

196
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:35.580
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I think once you hear what other people are going through and what they're managing and what they're running into I believe it will really help you understand that you're not alone in this.

197
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.470
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I saw that

198
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:39.960
Krista Forby-Hunter: leave for work.

199
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:48.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: But none of the group therapy works because it lets you know that you're not alone. You know, so, um,

200
00:20:52.110 --> 00:21:02.910
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So the grip the therapy, you probably need to know when this is therapy is on Wednesdays. So we had a therapy meeting yesterday and it's at one o'clock. Okay.

201
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.060
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Okay, so you will, you'll get

202
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:17.220
Jill Beavers-Kirby: A room invitation, just like you did today, you'll log on, just like you did today, and you'll go to this room just like this and you'll see everybody in the room.

203
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:31.740
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And we'll have conversations about how everybody's doing what's what's going, well, what's not going well, what do we need to to what do I need to, you know, do differently to help manage everybody so that they can be their best. Okay.

204
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.710
Krista Forby-Hunter: Okay. What questions do you have

205
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.270
Krista Forby-Hunter: Oh so far. I don't learn

206
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.360
Krista Forby-Hunter: Basically, good to just have it.

207
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.810
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And I like that you have, you know, somebody that you know going through this

208
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.590
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So that way, that person, you know, can kind of help guide you in case you do have any

209
00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:07.110
Krista Forby-Hunter: Questions or anything. Right. Yes. See, that's some, like, because I was having issues with because I mean we're, we're in the middle of nowhere. Yeah.

210
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:17.880
Krista Forby-Hunter: And I was having issues with transportation stuff and like, like I kept like talking about, like, man, like I need to get a doctor. I'm willing to travel, you know,

211
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:36.690
Krista Forby-Hunter: It's not just something you can just stop going. You know what I mean. And I'm like, if I don't get my prescription and when we screwed. And then the only doctors around there within 45 minutes to an hour drive away. And she was like, dude, told me about your though.

212
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:42.210
Jill Beavers-Kirby: That gets tiring every four weeks, you know, having to drive that far.

213
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:51.390
Krista Forby-Hunter: Yeah, yeah. Like this is genius though. I didn't even know like that they did this. And so she told me about it. I was like,

214
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.750
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I know it really works for

215
00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.670
Jill Beavers-Kirby: For being out in the boonies so

216
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:05.580
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Let me make sure I've got your pharmacy. Correct.

217
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:12.210
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Northside Somerset pharmacy. Yeah, okay.

218
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:14.520
All right.

219
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:27.840
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So I will call this in or send it electronically. I'll send us in today and you will also like I said get that the instructions on how to start the Suboxone, like I said, we'll start with a half a strip

220
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:38.550
Jill Beavers-Kirby: When you're in withdrawal when you're feeling like crap and then you'll wait for hours if you still feel bad. You'll take another half a strip. If you're feeling okay then you don't need to take another half

221
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:44.460
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Um, I don't know if you've noticed this, but Suboxone can cause constipation.

222
00:23:45.210 --> 00:24:01.350
Jill Beavers-Kirby: And if you start getting constipated. Just make sure you're drinking more water more fluids eating, you know, high fiber foods and if it gets to be a problem, let me know and we can do some medication like some stool softener just something for it. Okay. Okay. Um,

223
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.980
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Some people also feel

224
00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:13.050
Jill Beavers-Kirby: As they're coming off of their, you know, their heroin and stuff. They feel nervous or antsy on the inside.

225
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:20.730
Jill Beavers-Kirby: So because of the medicines that you've just restarted taking you might not feel that. But if you do

226
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:30.000
Jill Beavers-Kirby: A drug that we use to help calm that down during the first few days is a drug called Clonidine, and it's really good for

227
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:45.600
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Getting that nervousness that empty feeling inside it really helps that to go away. So if you have any of those problems or if you're just feeling like I don't know if it's normal to feel like this or, you know, maybe this is normal. I just don't know. Just contact us.

228
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:52.140
Jill Beavers-Kirby: In Myself. Me and we can figure out what we need to do to feel bad. Okay.

229
00:24:52.530 --> 00:25:03.180
Jill Beavers-Kirby: The goal is to get you through this and feeling good, so that you continue this, you know, and then as time goes by and and you get settled into your new normal.

230
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:17.640
Jill Beavers-Kirby: You know, we'll start making changes to how your how we're doing things. Then, but for right now. We just want to get you in a nice happy place. You know all your medicine doing what it needs to do. And, you know, getting you

231
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.760
Jill Beavers-Kirby: Back to how you want to be.

232
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.940
Krista Forby-Hunter: Great. All right.

233
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:36.900
Jill Beavers-Kirby: I don't have any other questions for me or for you, D and you don't have any questions for me. But like I said, if something pops up, just let me know.

234

Krista Forby-Hunter: Okay. And then when do I contact you again.
