Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. How did it go. Did you start out with a half what happened.

25
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.930
Josh's S10: I started with about a quarter.

26
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.150
Josh's S10: Okay. Um, and then this morning. I had to another quarter just me.

27
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.740
Josh's S10: I didn't want to get all to wasted. Uh huh, is I know I've taken before when I was just mis around and mystery are pretty good.

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.410
Josh's S10: Such as taking so

29
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.490
Josh's S10: So far I'm all right.

30
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, now withdrawal symptoms.

31
00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:05.730
Josh's S10: I mean, the first day that I took that core. I was. I wasn't feeling well. I took that which went to bed last night said, pretty good. And then this morning. I had another quarter and I'm probably another one here in the world, we're

32
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.980
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay. So remember I did find the induction.

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.120
Dr Katrina Groves: I think area called you did she tell you

34
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.870
Josh's S10: I talked to her.

35
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.980
Josh's S10: I didn't, I'm trying to find out I was, I tried to ask her last night, but she didn't exactly know what I was talking about. So the induction sheet.

36
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.430
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, just to help you figure out, it's on the website. If you go to bright part of

37
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.390
Dr Katrina Groves: And you scroll all the way down.

38
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.840
Dr Katrina Groves: It'll say patient. I don't remember what it says. Now patient information and one of them is

39
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:53.850
Dr Katrina Groves: How to Do the induction. And that's the name we call we get people onto Suboxone and I know we talked about doing maybe eight milligrams. The first day, try to keep it as low as possible because then, like you said, you don't get messed up on it. The goal is not to

40
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.820
Dr Katrina Groves: Get high. The goal is to stop the cravings and keep the withdrawals down so

41
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:12.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, so if you need more assistance with that you could probably call the virtual clinic again. And even after this call. I could put you back in there. And you could say, hey, how do I find this in sheet.

42
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.830
Josh's S10: Okay. Oh.

43
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.950
Dr Katrina Groves: Did you pick up any of the nausea medication. Yeah.

44
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.640
Josh's S10: I got that you

45
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.720
Dr Katrina Groves: Did you need it.

46
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.110
Josh's S10: Now, yet, but I just got it. So, just in case.

47
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.240
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. You're doing really well. I mean, you're not sweating. I don't see that you're miserable.

48
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.380
Josh's S10: Number it

49
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.210
Dr Katrina Groves: Alright, so again, like maybe eight milligrams today and then tomorrow if you can stay with eight

50
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:48.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, but in the morning when you wake up, do the whole eight right then probably unless you're one of those people, that's just going to take four in the morning or at night, but you're going to want to get on a routine.

51
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.170
Okay.

52
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.990
Dr Katrina Groves: And then, did I say we were going to meet. Let's see. 21st next Thursday. Was that right

53
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.910
Josh's S10: Okay, I didn't we. I didn't ask you want to talk to me today. And then we're going to go

54
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.050
Josh's S10: There. Yeah.

55
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.130

59
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.300
Right.

60
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Because you said it would be easier with your mom schedule. I think

61
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah okay so 1130 21st Thursday, there'll be a couple other people but it won't be a very big group so

Dr Katrina Groves: You never know. You know, this

71
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.700
Dr Katrina Groves: Would be somebody come across or or you're actually more risk or getting overdose. If you went back to heroin.

72
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:41.700
Dr Katrina Groves: You know week or two or three or month or something and you decided I you know Suboxone it's not for me. I'm going to shoot up again. You could actually die if you use the same dose. So it would be good for your mom to know how to do that. And, you know,

73
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.260
Dr Katrina Groves: It up your nose and if she could save your life. So that's under that

Dr Katrina Groves: You know, God forbid that will not happen or, you know, say you come across somebody on the street and oh my god there's, you know, they're down and you know their user and you want to save their life. You can do that so

75
00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.740

Loraine Niemi: About this last night.

202
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.010
Dr Katrina Groves: I bet you guys aren't sleeping. Really good.

203
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.760
Loraine Niemi: Um, he does. I don't. Very well.

204
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

205
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.460
Loraine Niemi: He wakes up like every two hours.

206
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.710
Dr Katrina Groves: to breastfeed, or what what's going on with that.

207
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.930
Loraine Niemi: Um, I stopped producing milk.

208
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.830
Hello.

209
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.550
Loraine Niemi: Um, I think I know why.

210
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.350
Loraine Niemi: The second week that we were home.

211
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:45.720
Loraine Niemi: He decided that he was going to go a whole day without pooping and Nathaniel was like, really scared about it. And he was saying. Little things and he wasn't directing it towards me, but I was thinking that it was me because my Suboxone that maybe he wasn't pooping because of the Suboxone

212
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.840
Loraine Niemi: And so I didn't nurse for like two days.

213
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:58.770
Loraine Niemi: And then like a couple days after that I was really I was being really sporadic with it. And then he got nipple confusion. We're all he wanted was the bottle.

214
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.530
Dr Katrina Groves: It's so much easier for them to want the bottle.

215
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.670
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, cuz it comes out a lot faster. And it's Instagram page.

216
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.190
Loraine Niemi: Yeah. Yep. And so now he doesn't really want to latch on like

217
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.420
Loraine Niemi: He will he'll latch on but then he'll just start getting really mad and he'll like

218
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.010
Dr Katrina Groves: Like it's not coming fast enough.

219
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.880
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, so now I only produce like maybe a half an ounce out of just this side.

220
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:25.110
Loraine Niemi: I don't. My reg

221
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:37.830
Dr Katrina Groves: What's the plan. I mean, you could work really, really hard. And then we'll come back, but it would require you to stop the bottle. And eventually, he'll eat again, you know, but in a stressful.

222
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.450
Dr Katrina Groves: Or just want you're doing what, what's your plan.

223
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:50.670
Loraine Niemi: Um, well, I tried. I tried to bring it back. I bought lactation cookies I got into Greek

224
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.230
Loraine Niemi: Some kind of herbal supplement is called mother's milk.

225
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:03.690
Loraine Niemi: I think, and then I got the mother's milk tea and I was pumping every hour I power pumped.

226
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:17.220
Loraine Niemi: Wow, it came back. Yeah, it came back a little bit, where I started producing like a little bit more, but it was just too much. Yeah. So I'm slowly. Just let me go.

227
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:24.750
Dr Katrina Groves: And you know what, that's fine. My kids. I don't know if I told you I think I might have, but

228
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.440
Dr Katrina Groves: I couldn't breastfeed at all.

229
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:37.710
Dr Katrina Groves: My first one had a skull fracture and it was he couldn't suck anything because his head was so big industry as well so on.

230
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.490
Loraine Niemi: Anyway,

231
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.010
Dr Katrina Groves: He ended up just being on. I mean, I tried the same thing. I tried a little tube to go down and like

232
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:53.340
Dr Katrina Groves: It was it was a nightmare. And my kids were on soy milk and bottle fed from almost day one, and they're now six foot five and

233
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.440
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, some

234
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.510
Dr Katrina Groves: So it doesn't matter. I mean, I know there's a lot of guilt about oh

235
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.260
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, but you know what kids are going to be fine.

236
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.330
Loraine Niemi: Okay, yeah.

237
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.960
Loraine Niemi: I feel really guilty because we're

238
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:10.890
Dr Katrina Groves: All things

239
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:28.200
Loraine Niemi: There's a lot of other family members that have given birth within the last month before me, or even after me and they're all doing great. Like they're nursing. Amazingly, and like, they're not. I'm not trying to be rude, but they're not as good as moms, as I am.

240
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:28.800
Loraine Niemi: Right.

241
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:41.310
Dr Katrina Groves: And it's nothing to do with being a good mom your breasts just decided, I'm done. I've had how many babies is this 544 I'm having babies. You're 36 years old and your body is just like, Okay, I'm done.

242
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:53.550
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, some people get an appendix that they have to get taken out is that their fault. No, you know, it's not your fault and your baby's gonna be fine. I know it makes you sad, but you don't get over that.

243
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.480
Loraine Niemi: I really wanted to, because he is the last one I got my tubes tied

244
00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:58.020
Oh,

245
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.620
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, I was like, no, I

246
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Can't believe Nathaniel was into that.

247
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:12.060
Loraine Niemi: He, he was like he was like, No, we really shouldn't have any more because we're getting older and we're gonna be like in her 60s with

248
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.960
Loraine Niemi: That kid. And he's like, but it's up to you, because it's your body

249
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:27.930
Loraine Niemi: Okay, yeah, natural, I'm like, No, this is for us because it's not only me, having the baby to to so we both decided that that was probably the right thing to do.

250
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.730
Loraine Niemi: Good, yeah.

251
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:48.900
Dr Katrina Groves: The other thing I want to say is actually advantages to not breastfeed because the baby ends up bonding with you because of you. Not because of breasts, you know. So number one, you'll be able to we you'll be able to sleep better, he'll be able to sleep better as time goes on.

252
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.980
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, it's just a lot easier. I thought I did. It was annoying to try to to breastfeed was annoying.

253
00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.130
Loraine Niemi: Oh, yeah. Yeah. It is. It is very annoying.

254
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.950
Loraine Niemi: It's so inconvenient.

255
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.950
Loraine Niemi: And nobody else can feed them and you have

256
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.550
Dr Katrina Groves: Like your freedom to, you could go to, you can go work. You don't have to pump. Yeah, it'll be it.

257
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.660
Loraine Niemi: So I'm slowly getting that in there.

258
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:25.710
Dr Katrina Groves: For a while, and he postpartum depression Lorraine, like a lot of moms equity me you know you have a lot of anxiety, and do you think that's part of it. Are you okay

259
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.010
Loraine Niemi: Um, I'm okay. I haven't no depression.

260
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:37.530
Loraine Niemi: Maybe a little anxiety only, not from pregnancy, but from like work issues and coven

261
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.260
Loraine Niemi: being stuck now is

262
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.770
Loraine Niemi: From pregnancy, you know,

263
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.580
Okay.

264
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:55.080
Dr Katrina Groves: So this is kind of a little history and but I'm supposed to do on you for bright heart and I know some of this stuff, but I'm supposed to pretend I don't so

265
00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:05.760
Dr Katrina Groves: It can you remember actually. I don't remember this part. When did you start the program. What year was it or how many and how many years. Queen. Do you have

266
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:14.730
Loraine Niemi: It was 2011 I do believe or the beginning of 2012. So I think the jury's either nine or 10 years

267
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.200
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh my god.

268
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:21.300
Loraine Niemi: APRIL, APRIL because it was right after Christians birthday. It was like April 24 through 20

269
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:23.910
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh yeah, that's

270
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.680
Loraine Niemi: Incredible. Yeah.

271
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:40.470
Dr Katrina Groves: I know you had a few like little on and I like the Tramadol thing but i don't i don't remember you having any relapses or flip up things. I mean, one taking Norco once or something, I don't know, whatever.

272
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.060
Loraine Niemi: Nope, just the Tramadol yeah the for you then.

273
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:45.720
And then

274
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:58.830
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so I have to go back, though, to when you started using, at what age and what you started with and and just kind of take me through like your childhood stuff. I'm sure you just want to remember

275
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:00.870
Loraine Niemi: Okay, um,

276
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:07.320
Loraine Niemi: I think I was like 15 when I first tried marijuana

277
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.570
Loraine Niemi: Or maybe even 14

278
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:25.320
Loraine Niemi: I was about 15 or 16 when I first drink alcohol and I wasn't. It wasn't until I was 19 when I started smoking cigarettes and then I tried meth for the first time when I was 19 I actually tried it with Nathaniel.

279
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.480
Dr Katrina Groves: You guys met

280
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.070
Loraine Niemi: No.

281
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.290
Loraine Niemi: No, he worked. He worked at a gas station.

282
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.470
Loraine Niemi: And I came it yeah that's a whole different story.

283
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.620
Loraine Niemi: Wasn't through drugs.

284
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.110
Loraine Niemi: But he actually he did do mess when I first met him, and I didn't know and I yeah he lied about it. So it was a sisters and blah, blah, blah.

285
00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:56.700
Loraine Niemi: And then I only did met for, like, maybe six or eight months or something like that. It wasn't very long stint and haven't gone back haven't done it since.

286
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:16.410
Loraine Niemi: I actually didn't get addicted to painkillers until I had my daughter 10 years ago in 2010 when I had my C section. And that was just a runaway train. I just took them and they gave me three months afterwards they just kept refilling them for me.

287
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.480
Dr Katrina Groves: That was not good. Yeah.

288
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.100
Loraine Niemi: No, that was back in 2010

289
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:36.000
Loraine Niemi: And then once they denied me the prescription. I just kept buying them from other people. Anybody that had them. My parents, friends. Yeah, so that's how that whole thing with never tried heroin.

290
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.100
Loraine Niemi: Crack cocaine. None of that stuff.

291
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.750
LSD. No.

292
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.750
Loraine Niemi: No. Not even mushrooms like

293
00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:52.170
Loraine Niemi: I was such a square. Growing up, I mean, the only reason why I tried marijuana is because I got

294
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.110
Loraine Niemi: Whole peer pressured into it.

295
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.950
Dr Katrina Groves: Mm hmm.

296
00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:02.400
Loraine Niemi: Even do that again until God 2010 so from like nine

297
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.960
Loraine Niemi: From like 2002 2010 I didn't do nothing.

298
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:08.940
Loraine Niemi: So,

299
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.480
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, you didn't know in your brain that you had that

300
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Addiction thing. So, and then

301
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:26.580
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, so I guess I should go back. How much Suboxone are you taking now like you got down to four milligrams. But now, are you back up or what do you take in

302
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:41.070
Loraine Niemi: And backup. Now, now I'm taking two two milligrams in the morning and then at night. I'm taking anywhere from to go anywhere from four milligrams to six milligrams

303
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Depending on what

304
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:58.500
Loraine Niemi: Depending on I guess if my days crappy, I don't know, I just sometimes I just take one extra I'm like in Daniel, he's been helping me, he says, Oh, you don't need it. It's the same as taking one. It's the same as taking two so

305
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.410
Loraine Niemi: He's been helping me with that.

306
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Because remember we talked about that before people get

307
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.620
Dr Katrina Groves: To the point where they start using their Suboxone like a drug and

308
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:07.920
Loraine Niemi: Yeah.

309
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:16.620
Dr Katrina Groves: Supposed to help you feel better and get through your day. It's supposed to be just what you need to stop the cravings and not go back to the pills.

310
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:28.320
Dr Katrina Groves: You know, you're just a new mom and we can talk about it but i i think at one point you had wanted to get off the Suboxone. Is that still kind of in your head.

311
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.210
Loraine Niemi: Yeah yeah that is

312
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.520
Loraine Niemi: It's so good. Yeah. Okay.

313
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.990
Dr Katrina Groves: So you're there is

314
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.220
Loraine Niemi: This new job at Walgreens, like they own. That was my pharmacy and so

315
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.490
Loraine Niemi: There's a couple people that work there. Or they did work there. They know that I take it and

316
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.270
Loraine Niemi: You know, like, people say that they don't judge you like

317
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.420
Loraine Niemi: Right, I don't want them to. So

318
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.370
Dr Katrina Groves: That's a scary thing huh

319
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.270
Mm hmm.

320
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.000
Loraine Niemi: Coffee.

321
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:02.940
Dr Katrina Groves: T

322
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:05.730
Loraine Niemi: Can see

323
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:14.760
Dr Katrina Groves: That that's the drug, you can do so, um, are you changing your prescription to a different pharmacy or where have you been getting it from

324
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.710
Loraine Niemi: So dairy has switched it to Walmart at the beginning of this coven thing.

325
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:29.400
Loraine Niemi: Okay, because they Walgreens couldn't get their shipments. So it's now at Walmart. Plus, I guess there's a guy that worked there. His name is Mike and Mike

326
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:36.000
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, he says, Terry says easier to deal with him because he knows how to get get ahold of you right click

327
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:38.970
Loraine Niemi: And backlink so I just left it at Walmart.

328
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.280
Dr Katrina Groves: That's good because then you won't feel like, Yeah, it's weird having your prescription. The same place. You work at

329
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.160
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, so I'll probably end up transferring everything

330
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:55.230
Dr Katrina Groves: So speaking of that, I need your medication list so I can put it down here. Are you are you taking what else you take antidepressants.

331
00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:01.170
Loraine Niemi: Know I'm the only thing I take is Suboxone I think do soccer's

332
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.090
Loraine Niemi: Yeah yeah he they she prescribed it for me after I had the baby.

333
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.490
Loraine Niemi: Okay, fiber gummy Tylenol and ibuprofen. That's it.

334
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.910
Dr Katrina Groves: So you're not really taking anything for anxiety or depression.

335
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.230
Loraine Niemi: No, no, no.

336
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.990
Loraine Niemi: I haven't taken that stuff since like high school

337
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:26.610
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, I thought you and I talked about it at one point, because you were stressing so much we

338
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.860
Loraine Niemi: Talked about me on some

339
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.040
Dr Katrina Groves: See that would make more sense to me. If you have a thyroid problem are you supposed to take

340
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:42.780
Dr Katrina Groves: What, what's a good analogy. If you've got a thyroid problem. You wouldn't take a diabetes medication for your thyroid problem, right.

341
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:43.770
Loraine Niemi: And

342
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:55.230
Dr Katrina Groves: If you have stress and anxiety and depression you you know you would want to take a medication for stress, anxiety and depression nuts box on which is for addiction, so you know where I'm going with that. Yeah.

343
00:28:55.290 --> 00:29:05.130
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, I completely understand it's like a routine and concentration thing to so like if I if I don't take it at a certain time, then it feels like

344
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.720
Dr Katrina Groves: My body freaks out. Yeah.

345
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.510
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, yeah. And it feels like something's missing.

346
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.190
Loraine Niemi: Right, I

347
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:12.930
Loraine Niemi: Swear

348
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:17.100
Dr Katrina Groves: I remember that. And then I think we also talked about put a Listerine under your account.

349
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:27.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, that will do it. He's texting me, I'm okay. I'm okay so let's see. Oh, did you ever overdose at all around when you were

350
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:36.840
Dr Katrina Groves: Using. No, no. And how many did you ever try to quit on your own more than once, or was it just like

351
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:45.090
Dr Katrina Groves: The only time you wanted to quit when you came to the program. Did you how many attempts. Did you try to quit before you did.

352
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.360
Loraine Niemi: I can't remember, but I know it was quite a few

353
00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.400
Dr Katrina Groves: So you're trying to get done.

354
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Go off on you.

355
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:59.790
Loraine Niemi: I'm like, like wean myself off of them, or even cold turkey. This is the only program. I've been to for it.

356
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:06.390
Loraine Niemi: But it was quite a few times. I want to say at least five. That's a good number.

357
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:12.720
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, and your withdrawals would last like days or hours or how long

358
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:18.120
Loraine Niemi: I would get like two days into it and then because I couldn't sleep.

359
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.350
Loraine Niemi: I would just go right back to it because I've got I had kids.

360
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:31.320
Loraine Niemi: Right. And I was working and Daniel was working. And it was just in both of us were in like right in the middle of our addictions. So

361
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.780
Loraine Niemi: I just couldn't handle it.

362
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.920
Dr Katrina Groves: And what are your coping skills. Now that you use when you get stressed.

363
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.110
Loraine Niemi: Um,

364
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:46.890
Loraine Niemi: Gosh. It's been so long that it's not even a part of my day anymore. Like, it's not even

365
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.250
Loraine Niemi: Some even a question. It's not even in my mind.

366
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.590
Loraine Niemi: I guess.

367
00:30:53.610 --> 00:31:09.750
Dr Katrina Groves: I guess I mean when you get stressed. What things do you do to calm yourself down and relax. Instead of the drugs. Now do you take baths. Do you breathe, do you what stuff did you learn from Tony or the group or me or anybody that you're using to help self care.

368
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:19.980
Loraine Niemi: Oh, I would read well most of the time I remove myself from wherever I'm at, like, I'll go into the in a different room. I'll go outside or

369
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:26.940
Loraine Niemi: A cigarette. I'll take yeah yeah and I breathe and I tell myself this too shall pass.

370
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:27.690
Dr Katrina Groves: Good.

371
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.270
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, that's like my favorite thing is even myself.

372
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.310
Dr Katrina Groves: I like that.

373
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.700
Dr Katrina Groves: So that means you're still smoking. I'm gonna cry.

374
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:40.410
Loraine Niemi: I know. Oh my gosh. So I got five days into it.

375
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.330
Loraine Niemi: By day

376
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.160
Loraine Niemi: Wow. Yes.

377
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.280
Loraine Niemi: And I'm gonna blame it on

378
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.630
Loraine Niemi: Tramadol I'm going to blame it on the Tramadol I'm telling you.

379
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.190
Loraine Niemi: The first secret that I smoked it hurt so bad you Oh god.

380
00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:07.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow, you know, five days is like the date the time if you can get five days in you've got it. So if it's still in your brain, are you still interested in trying to quit.

381
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.240
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

382
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.090
Dr Katrina Groves: And how many cigarettes. Do you smoke right now.

383
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:13.260
I'm

384
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.010
Loraine Niemi: A lot because we're at home.

385
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:17.880
Dr Katrina Groves: I dare

386
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.140
To

387
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:25.530
Loraine Niemi: Like 1516 almost a pack a day.

388
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:33.600
Loraine Niemi: Wow, almost because mean that Daniel We share so and we go through one package and when there's 20 cigarettes in a pack.

389
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:44.220
Loraine Niemi: And I'm not. I don't know if I'm smoking, most of it or if he's smoking, most of it, but probably close to either half a pack to pack. Wow.

390
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.710
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so yeah. Have you ever used anything to try to quit. If I given you patches or be got

391
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.110
Loraine Niemi: Like that stuff like I can text and it made me psychotic

392
00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.710
Dr Katrina Groves: Low

393
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.060
Loraine Niemi: Like me like

394
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:07.710
Loraine Niemi: I went to work, taking that stuff. And when customers will come up to me. I was in my head, calling them name.

395
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.930
Loraine Niemi: Agitated

396
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.240
Dr Katrina Groves: Chantix on your allergy list.

397
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:18.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, like Wellbutrin or nicotine patches, because those don't have any of that kind of side effects.

398
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:29.850
Loraine Niemi: I've never tried below the chin and the patches and I tried them a long time ago and I don't know. I don't remember if they were I didn't use them or not.

399
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:37.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Or maybe, number one, maybe you weren't ready, but I guess my question was the patches didn't give you an allergy, like a rash or anything that you remember right

400
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.690
Dr Katrina Groves: Now, okay.

401
00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.430
Dr Katrina Groves: Because I'm

402
00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:46.470
Dr Katrina Groves: So on that scale of zero to 10

403
00:33:47.850 --> 00:34:02.400
Dr Katrina Groves: Zero is where you don't want to stop smoking nearing the want to talk about stopping smoking. You're like, totally not into it and 10 is like, okay, I'm quitting today. Where do you think you're in that you know 1-234-567-8910, where are you in in the motivation scale.

404
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.250
Loraine Niemi: Probably like a seven or an eight.

405
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:06.870
Dr Katrina Groves: That's pretty high.

406
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.240
Dr Katrina Groves: So why didn't look like a five or lower

407
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:19.020
Loraine Niemi: Um, because I know how bad it is. And I hate it. I absolutely hate the taste of it. I hate the smell of it. I hate

408
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:19.860
The

409
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:27.510
Loraine Niemi: My kids tell me all the time how much you know and I know I'm gonna die. I have a smoker's cough.

410
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:40.200
Loraine Niemi: Over here. Yeah, so like I know how bad it is for me and I really want to quit, but I'm so addicted to it and it's so amazing. When I do smoke. So that's why I'm like right there. Right.

411
00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:45.510
Dr Katrina Groves: But that's good that you acknowledge that that's it's better than a two.

412
00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.330
Dr Katrina Groves: And so my suggestion would be when you're ready.

413
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:58.380
Dr Katrina Groves: Let me know. Oh, I know you have a doctor at the clinic, who is your primary care doctors at either now or

414
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:04.110
Loraine Niemi: I don't know, I haven't seen a primary care and long time you've been yelling at me for like five years.

415
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:07.380
Dr Katrina Groves: No, no.

416
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.100
No.

417
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.230
Loraine Niemi: You very kindly

418
00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:12.540
Dr Katrina Groves: So,

419
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:27.120
Dr Katrina Groves: If I will be happy to prescribe you whatever patches Wellbutrin might be a good one too, because it's good for a little bit of stress. But again, you know, whatever you want. I think patches would work too.

420
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.710
Dr Katrina Groves: So just let me know if if and when you're ready.

421
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:33.630
Dr Katrina Groves: I think want to go.

422
00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:34.620
Loraine Niemi: Back to work.

423
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.060
Loraine Niemi: When I go back to work.

Loraine Niemi: Yeah, like in my mom, my parents are gonna die of a heart attack because of my brother and the stress that he puts on them. Just wait we don't go there. Very often, I haven't gone over there.

466
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:57.840
Loraine Niemi: You know, to visit on a regular basis for probably a good two years now because of my brother in the drug things that he brings around my parents, though. Yeah, he got shot him. So he's okay.

467
00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.640

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:11.400
Loraine Niemi: Yeah. Well, he he he traded a truck, you didn't like the truck. The truck didn't work. So he went back to reboot the truck. Instead of talking to the guy, he

469
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:21.390
Loraine Niemi: Tried to hook it up and take it without the guy, knowing that guy comes out of the house. He's that he's trying to take the truck to then he got into a fight, and then he pulls out a gun and shooting.

470
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.040
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh my God, yeah.

471
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.600
Dr Katrina Groves: Spend time in prison for that one.

472
00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:26.880
Loraine Niemi: I'm still trying to find the guy.

473
00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:32.400
Loraine Niemi: And this happened to three days ago, two or three days do you

474
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.470
Loraine Niemi: Yeah.

475
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.990
Dr Katrina Groves: So your father doesn't have any substance use disorder, just your mom.

476
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:50.310
Loraine Niemi: Yeah I know my dad, he's got way too many health issues and he's been clean off of meth or probably a good 1520 years and

477
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.220
Loraine Niemi: My mom, she was the same.

478
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.180
Loraine Niemi: But she doesn't have as many Hill well

479
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.860
Loraine Niemi: She's mobile. I'm like, my dad. Oh.

480
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:03.690
Loraine Niemi: Yeah.

481
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:13.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, she must acquit for some reasons he must have felt like like you know maybe partly for you, like, oh, we can. You can see your grandkids more if you don't use her. I don't know.

482
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:14.400
Loraine Niemi: Why

483
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.640
Dr Katrina Groves: Why do you think she decided to quit after for three weeks.

484
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:27.990
Loraine Niemi: Um, I think a lot of it had to do with us, all of us kids and my dad like we just made her feel really super ashamed, like in my dad told me

485
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:48.420
Loraine Niemi: The day that I went in for my C section, the hospitals, homie. I could have two people. So I hadn't Daniel and I had my mom and my dad told me that my mom had used the night before and that morning. So the whole time that I was in the hospital. She was higher than a kite.

486
00:40:50.430 --> 00:41:03.570
Loraine Niemi: I'm my dad. He told me that. And then he told my mom that he told me that. And I haven't talked to everybody, yet, but I think about super ashamed because after that I told my dad that I wasn't going to bring the baby over

487
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.770
Dr Katrina Groves: Exactly.

488
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.490
Loraine Niemi: It wasn't going to let them have any contact if she was going to be using. So

489
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.880
Dr Katrina Groves: I think that was, you know, tough love.

490
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:16.050
Loraine Niemi: Mm hmm. And it really, really, really, really pissed me off.

491
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:24.330
Loraine Niemi: And I thought something was up by my mom's always been high energy like she just never really been able to sit down. She's just

492
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.830
Loraine Niemi: Taking everything

493
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.020
Loraine Niemi: She's the person that you don't ever want to take into a doctor's office room because he's been through reading

494
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:32.970
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, so

495
00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.810
Loraine Niemi: I just thought it was a little bit normal and she was nervous, so

496
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:38.700
Loraine Niemi: Yeah.

497
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, I hope so. I sounds like he's on the right track. So

498
00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:45.270
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, I hope so too.

499
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:49.710
Dr Katrina Groves: So you have, how many sisters and brothers. I know you have a big family.

500
00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.200
Loraine Niemi: Of four brothers and one sister.

503
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:07.050
Loraine Niemi: Um, you know, I, she said she's not. But it's hard to tell.

504
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.700
Loraine Niemi: She and her husband split up almost

505
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:20.580
Loraine Niemi: Like almost a year ago now, he decided one day she literally one day woke up and said, I don't want to be married to you anymore.

506
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:32.400
Loraine Niemi: And he was like, what, what do you mean like this is coming out of nowhere and he took their youngest kid and moved to Arizona, because that's his own blood biological child.

507
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.300
He couldn't take him.

508
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:44.820
Loraine Niemi: And ever since he left. She just went off the rails, like she party like she leaves for days on end. Yeah, the typical drug addict, how

Dr Katrina Groves: If it ever turns color and you know you get

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.220
Dr Katrina Groves: fevers, you got to go get antibiotics.

Dr Katrina Groves: Trying to breath when you're walking

572
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.920
Loraine Niemi: Shortness of breath, whenever I run up the stairs.

573
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.330
Dr Katrina Groves: Huh.

574
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.330
Loraine Niemi: Oh my gosh, it's so stupid.

575
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Mm hmm. You'll get there.

576
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:17.940

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:31.320
Loraine Niemi: Constantly. Yeah, yeah, I'm still like getting through that little bit of concentration. Yeah.

580
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:32.970
Dr Katrina Groves: No blood in your stool, though.

581
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:33.840
Loraine Niemi: No.

582
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.810
Dr Katrina Groves: Are you normally concentrated just taking the Suboxone

583
00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:42.000
Dr Katrina Groves: Yes. And so a lot of fiber in your diet. That's a good thing to continue

584
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.180
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, I have to take fiber dummies.

585
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:46.770
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, even when you're not

586
00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:56.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Yep. Yeah. So neurologically any tremors or seizures vertigo, dizziness, headaches, migraine.

587
00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.210
Know,

588
00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:02.940
Dr Katrina Groves: And we talked a little about mood stuff you don't feel depression or anxiety.

589
00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.010
Loraine Niemi: Know,

590
00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.340
Dr Katrina Groves: Any history of suicidal thoughts in the past.

591
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:09.450
No.

592
00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:11.280
Dr Katrina Groves: Good.

593
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.100
Dr Katrina Groves: And goals for the future. I don't know how far can you plan.

594
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:26.430
Dr Katrina Groves: You have any in your head, like what you want to where you want to be, or in your two years or

595
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:31.140
Loraine Niemi: Well, I mean, I have short term goals right now. I don't really have anything long term.

596
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:36.300
Loraine Niemi: That's fine because getting pregnant kind of turned everything upside down.

597
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.640
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah and now. Baby focus

598
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:50.550
Loraine Niemi: Yeah so short term goal is start this new job and start a savings. So we can buy a house.

599
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.620
Loraine Niemi: Yeah.

600
00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:54.750
Loraine Niemi: And they're doing

601
00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:58.110
Loraine Niemi: Short term that short term going into long term.

602
00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.850
Loraine Niemi: Exactly, yeah.

603
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:04.860
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, having a house is great. You need like six bedrooms, or something.

604
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:06.960
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, literally.

605
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:09.720
Dr Katrina Groves: List at all.

606
00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.280
Dr Katrina Groves: No, no.

607
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.120
Dr Katrina Groves: It's not that hard. People are getting housing.

608
00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Much better. Now, for whatever reason,

609
00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:36.420
Loraine Niemi: Yeah and we recently, a week before I went on maternity leave. We did our research here at the apartments and she told us that with the both of us working at that point we made too much money and our rent went up to almost $1,000

610
00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.980
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, and she said that we were going to have a year to move out.

611
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.410
Loraine Niemi: Oh my god about. Yeah.

612
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:52.470
Loraine Niemi: I don't know if that still applies. She was able to get our rent to go down because obviously I'm not working. The Daniel quit.

613
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:53.550
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

614
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:55.020
Loraine Niemi: So he's not working.

615
00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:04.200
Loraine Niemi: I'm getting disability and he getting paid family leave. So yeah, I rent was able to go down.

616
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:11.160
Loraine Niemi: But I when I go back to work. I don't know if we still will be making too much money so

617
00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.180
Dr Katrina Groves: It will work out.

618
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:16.200
Yeah.

619
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.370
Dr Katrina Groves: Life is stressful.

620
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:27.810
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, you finally get to where you're doing so good. And then they tell you that. Oh, because you're doing good. Right. You don't get nothing.

621
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.090
Dr Katrina Groves: That's not right.

622
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.870
Yeah.

623
00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:40.380
Dr Katrina Groves: But I like the fact that you're going to work less hours and be able to be a mom and that's you know and and you know cigarettes cost a lot of money.

624
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.420
Loraine Niemi: Oh my god of thunder dollars.

625
00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:48.180
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah. And if you could take that cigarettes and put that in the savings even 50 bucks.

626
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.360
Dr Katrina Groves: What hundred dollars a month. Are you saying

627
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.390
Loraine Niemi: No, that's $100 every two weeks.

628
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.860
Loraine Niemi: Well, yeah.

629
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:58.350
Dr Katrina Groves: 200 bucks a month you're spending on cigarettes.

630
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.770
Loraine Niemi: Even sometimes more. It just kind of depends.

631
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:07.770
Dr Katrina Groves: And let's see 200 times 12 is what $22,400

632
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:12.120
Dr Katrina Groves: Wow year $2,400

633
00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:13.890
That's insane.

634
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.370
Loraine Niemi: And that's just on the low end

635
00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:19.290
Dr Katrina Groves: More yeah that's

636
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.510
Dr Katrina Groves: 844 thousand 800

637
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.160
Loraine Niemi: Wow.

638
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:34.230
Dr Katrina Groves: That's huge. You could definitely know how to put that in your brain to help you quit smoking, the less you smoke, the more money you get in, you know, maybe what you can do is every time you buy a pack of cigarettes.

639
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:52.890
Dr Katrina Groves: You can, I don't know, trying to be creative. Here it's not working. Put some of the money that you maybe buy less if you can, and put some of that money into a little cookie jar. That's house or something that can help you save

640
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.850
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so much for my advice here.

641
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.760
Dr Katrina Groves: So I'm going to go where I'm we're pretty much done. I got everything I needed.

642
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:18.720
Dr Katrina Groves: I just want to know when you're going to be able to do a group. I want you to be able to get a group meeting in and I know how much you love group but group is moving on internet because you don't have to go out of your house. Yeah.

643
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:26.430
Dr Katrina Groves: And right now, I've got, I know this will change because when are you starting to work again. Do you think

644
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.530
Loraine Niemi: John yeah in June.

645
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:37.230
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, that's not much time. So we've got a group coming up on Monday night at 5:45pm but it's really packed right now.

646
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:58.470
Dr Katrina Groves: Gosh, Riley Julian Jennifer Anna Jake Casey Stephanie Layla, I mean I got tons of people in there, but I have two groups on Thursday morning. This next week one at 10 o'clock. And what I'm trying to fill up at 1130 so I'm wondering if you'll be able to do like 1130 group on Thursday.

647
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:01.560
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah week. Is that okay, get it over with.

648
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:05.220
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, okay. I don't see you writing it on a calendar.

649
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.140
Loraine Niemi: All right, I'll get a

650
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.510
Dr Katrina Groves: Phone or a piece of paper, time to move. Anyway, you don't want to go.

651
00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.130
Loraine Niemi: Hey, I've been up since six o'clock this morning, so

652
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:23.130
Loraine Niemi: peacemakers so Thursday, as in

653
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.270
Loraine Niemi: The 21st or the

654
00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.040
Dr Katrina Groves: 21st

655
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.330
The 21st

656
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:48.660
Dr Katrina Groves: I could do the 28th, but I'd rather just get you on there 11 1130 so with bright heart. You have to check in a half hour early seriously, you could check up check in up to six hours early and do they're going to have a questionnaire. Every time it'll be shorter

657
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, but there's so many people on zoom now because of the coven thing.

658
00:53:53.730 --> 00:54:05.490
Dr Katrina Groves: That there's, you know, they get with that. There's like the front desk. People that check you in at the virtual clinic, they get swamped and everybody checks in five minutes before their appointment and so you basically will miss it.

659
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:16.410
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, I would say at a minimum 30 minutes if you want to get it over with and call it six or seven in the morning and do your check in and then pop in later you can do that too.

660
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:25.770
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, alright. So, um, what else questions for me about Bret Hart specifically

661
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.190
Loraine Niemi: Um, I don't really have any

662
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.270
Dr Katrina Groves: Not yet.

663
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:32.040
Loraine Niemi: Not yet now.

664
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:33.510
Dr Katrina Groves: So, um,

665
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.750
Loraine Niemi: She said something about doing labs.

666
00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:49.140
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, so everybody you know how when you started in the group. It was so long ago I made you do blood work because I want to check your liver and your kidneys and being on Suboxone a long time. Does it affect your, your liver.

667
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:57.360
Dr Katrina Groves: So we do Bret Hart once everybody to get checked. You can do that at the clinic. I don't know if they put

668
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:02.430
Loraine Niemi: She did. She, she sent me an email that said that she did order my labs.

669
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.410
Dr Katrina Groves: Perfect. I hope she did it at the clinic or was it at the center coast hospital. I don't know.

670
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:12.270
Loraine Niemi: Um, I think the clinic. I think I remember the email saying clinic.

671
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:19.800
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so just go there whenever you want the lab is still open. I don't know what's going on with their hours. I'm sure you have to wear a mask. Don't take the baby.

672
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:26.070
Dr Katrina Groves: Obviously, just go and get your blood drawn. You don't have to make an appointment. I don't believe

673
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.030
Okay.

674
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:31.350
Dr Katrina Groves: real important like try to see me.

675
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:38.610
Dr Katrina Groves: To get your prescriptions. So the prescriptions won't come from Tony and dairy anymore. They'll come from.

676
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:39.900
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay.

677
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.310
Dr Katrina Groves: If you miss your group.

678
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:48.120
Dr Katrina Groves: You won't get your script. You can't just like call Tony and say, yeah, I mean you can but

679
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.720
Dr Katrina Groves: It's better to

680
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:54.540
Dr Katrina Groves: Keep your group number one because it's real hard to get you back in. I've got like 60 some people and only

681
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.440
Dr Katrina Groves: Three groups. I'm doing so far. So they get

682
00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:59.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Three pack.

683
00:55:59.160 --> 00:55:59.670
So,

684
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:06.030
Dr Katrina Groves: Just keep in touch with us. But when you start working. What do you think your hours are going to be, I mean,

685
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:10.590
Loraine Niemi: Why so at Grocery Outlet because

686
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.620
Loraine Niemi: We're going to go to work at first, are you really okay

687
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:19.560
Loraine Niemi: Cuz I'm with Walgreens, she said. It takes a couple weeks for the background to come back.

688
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:21.900
Loraine Niemi: Okay. Plus, I need to tell them

689
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.560
Loraine Niemi: Yes. Yeah, go back. I got to put in a two week. Notice

690
00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:35.580
Loraine Niemi: So, um, I do believe it's going to be the same school that had before, which is nights, though, and I'll have Fridays and Saturdays off.

691
00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:36.780
Loraine Niemi: So,

692
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:37.800
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm as night shift.

693
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:45.540
Loraine Niemi: 12 to nine. And I think right now they're closing at eight. So it may even be 1130 to 830

694
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.900
Loraine Niemi: So I can do like a morning group with you.

695
00:56:49.140 --> 00:57:02.340
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, so yeah, so the Thursday this Thursday is fine at 1130 but after that, we do have a 10 o'clock we can do, and only only have you come like once a month for a couple times and then I'll let you go farther

696
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.060
Dr Katrina Groves: It's just I want you to get used to the system and

697
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.330
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, this is a little different.

698
00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.870
Loraine Niemi: Mm hmm. I'm not very technologically inclined like

699
00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:14.550
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, you did awesome

700
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.960
Dr Katrina Groves: Other people, they have no clue how to do this. You're, you're like,

701
00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.760
Dr Katrina Groves: You're than eight out of 10

702
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:25.230
Dr Katrina Groves: So what else was I gonna say

703
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:30.840
Dr Katrina Groves: We'll just go. We'll talk about it more on Thursday, and more, you know,

704
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:38.460
Dr Katrina Groves: Oh, the drug screen. They're going to have you. They're going to send a pee pee thing to your house, did they talk

705
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.810
Loraine Niemi: No, she just said at the clinic. So it's funny.

706
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.190
Dr Katrina Groves: Now that's lab work.

707
00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:54.330
Dr Katrina Groves: But they're going to send you a little peek up in the mail to your address, so be watching for it. You could even call and say, hey, I want my peak up and get it done.

708
00:57:54.870 --> 00:58:04.230
Dr Katrina Groves: Since you have time right now. You can actually call the virtual clinic and say send me my urine tests and you don't do it right when they mail it to you when you get it, you call the

709
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:11.310
Dr Katrina Groves: Bright heart and tell them, you've got it. And then they will put you with somebody and they'll kind of walk you through how to do it because

710
00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:16.740
Dr Katrina Groves: You can go in the bathroom by yourself. Nobody's going to follow you there, you leave the phone you come out.

711
00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:26.700
Dr Katrina Groves: Then they they have you hold it up and take a picture of it like to make sure that the temperatures right and what drugs are in it and what aren't and yours are all going to be perfectly normal.

712
00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:33.810
Dr Katrina Groves: But they just like to. So that's the way you do the drug test and they'll probably send it once a month. Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

713
00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.730
Loraine Niemi: Isn't it strange

714
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:40.320
Dr Katrina Groves: Well, it's a way to do it without, you know, this is a totally online.

715
00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:55.620
Dr Katrina Groves: Group, I mean, bright heart has people all over. All over the United States. They might even have more places, but I know that they got people in Georgia. They got people in New York. They got people in Washington, you know, here I am in Oregon, and I'm not

716
00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:59.670
Dr Katrina Groves: Taking Oregon people right now, I'm just taking you guys because I want to get you all

717
00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:10.140
Dr Katrina Groves: On boarded but at some point, you know, we might add more people in. So, you know, that's how they, they, their people. They can't just be sending urine test everybody's doctor, they gotta do.

718
00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:13.470
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, that's kind of cool, though. It's different.

719
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:20.070
Dr Katrina Groves: All right. So, do you need a prescription of Suboxone like today, or when did you get one.

720
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.040
Loraine Niemi: I literally just got it feel yesterday.

Dr Katrina Groves: 0.7 1.71 that's crazy. Okay. What happened with Suboxone did it make you sick.

735
01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:27.960
Loraine Niemi: No, we went down to the subs are we went over to the subs all because it

736
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.420
Loraine Niemi: Dissolves quicker and I was having an issue at work. I'm

737
01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:34.110
Dr Katrina Groves: Right, just

738
01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.120
Loraine Niemi: Holding the Suboxone fast enough.

739
01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:36.780
Dr Katrina Groves: Got it.

740
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:47.310
Dr Katrina Groves: District, but now you're just taking it to in the morning into at night, so you won't have to. Well, it depends on your schedule. But hopefully you can do it at home instead of

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:49.350
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, yeah, I'm not

742
01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.490
Loraine Niemi: I'm gonna have to you because I don't want them. Yeah.

743
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.170
Loraine Niemi: The whole different environment.

744
01:00:55.650 --> 01:01:03.180
Dr Katrina Groves: So what's. I'm sorry. How many what quantity that they give you 60 I know 120 or whatever. What am I supposed to give you what are they, oh yeah.

745
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:10.350
Loraine Niemi: Um, they only gave me 28 and they still owe me a bunch more. I'm not sure how much more they owe me

746
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:20.670
Dr Katrina Groves: And for they get if they give you a month that would have been to twice a day is for a day, which is four times 30 is 120 a month.

Loraine Niemi: I think you're right. I think it's 120 let me go get my box right away. Today my box would tell me how much

748
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:33.570
Loraine Niemi: Every shred my box, too, because I don't need because people go through our dumpsters.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.100
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, great. So it's

769
01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.950
Loraine Niemi: Gonna be a whole lot easier. Anyways, because I play phone tag with area for like a week before

770
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.610
Loraine Niemi: Because I know you're super busy, too. Yeah.

771
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.620
Dr Katrina Groves: I'm really glad because

772
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.250
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, it just works out so much better this way.

773
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:21.900
Dr Katrina Groves: So,

774
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:34.950
Dr Katrina Groves: Okay, I think we're done unless you think of anything else. I look forward to seeing that Daniel in here too. He can't come to the same group, obviously, cuz he's going to have your an app to hold the baby. And so we'll have to figure

775
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:35.340
Dr Katrina Groves: That out

776
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.330
Dr Katrina Groves: Maybe baby will be fine.

777
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:40.980
Loraine Niemi: If he's sleeping.

778
01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:48.030
Loraine Niemi: He goes from zero to 60 in like a matter of like a second I

779
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.520
Dr Katrina Groves: Was either asleep or why wait

780
01:03:50.910 --> 01:04:01.230
Loraine Niemi: Yeah yeah yeah and then like whenever he cries. It's not like a little whimper any work themselves up. No, he just goes straight into screaming like he's like, I want to know.

781
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.450
Dr Katrina Groves: Who's been really good here. This whole hour I think I only heard him plus ones.

782
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.000
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, nothing. I will put them back to sleep.

783
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.180
Dr Katrina Groves: So you go take a nap sleep on a baby sleeps.

784
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.130
Dr Katrina Groves: Mostly

785
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:15.390
Yeah.

786
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.780
Dr Katrina Groves: So anything else.

787
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.150
Loraine Niemi: I can think of. I'll have to write down everything. So we remember

788
01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:30.720
Dr Katrina Groves: The groups will be just check ins. There's a really good counselor. Her name is Rebecca. Rebecca Evans. She's awesome.

789
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:39.660
Dr Katrina Groves: But everybody kind of has to give people turns and to top a little so you'll just do a check in, you know, nobody

790
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:57.180
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, that's cool, because the other groups at the clinic, there was usually like a few people that would dominate the whole time and not. Not that I would be mad about that, but it was totally defeating the whole purpose of me even being there.

791
01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:01.230
Loraine Niemi: So I felt it was a waste of time. Yeah, well,

792
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:13.140
Dr Katrina Groves: You know sometimes people have issues like last I think there was a group recently where somebody had just relapsed and it was awful. And we had to kind of help that person through that. So I'm not going to tell you that that won't happen because

793
01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.670
Loraine Niemi: Oh, no, no, no. That's okay.

794
01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:23.640
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, sometimes people do dominate depending on who it is, but mostly it's going really well. And people have to learn this new format, you know,

795
01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:28.920
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, learn like okay there's eight people in group, we only have a few, you know, and

796
01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.090
Dr Katrina Groves: We end up

797
01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:39.600
Dr Katrina Groves: Like Rebecca will do like a worksheet like okay here's. I don't know if you'd like to worksheets or not. I know that Daniel didn't like him, somebody

798
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.950
Loraine Niemi: Yeah.

799
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:46.980
Dr Katrina Groves: So sometimes we'll do that. And I don't know I'm learning. I'm new to this too. I've only been doing this since what January.

800
01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:48.330
Dr Katrina Groves: So,

801
01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:58.680
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah, and I still have my other jobs so that I'm trying to get out of that job and go into this one more. So I'll have more groups and people but

802
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.410
Dr Katrina Groves: The wave of the future.

803
01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.330
Loraine Niemi: Yeah, it really is. Yeah. My kids already do zoom meetings with their teachers so

804
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.740
Dr Katrina Groves: Yeah.

805
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.490
Cool.

806
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:12.240
Dr Katrina Groves: All right, barefoot really good to see you. You look awesome.

Loraine Niemi: So I'm going to flip it around so you can see what he's doing.
