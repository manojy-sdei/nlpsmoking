00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.220
Saraniah Aston: I am very stressed out.

4
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Well, all we have to do is just sit here and answer some questions is nothing more than that. Is there something I can help it.

5
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:52.170
Saraniah Aston: I have I just been making these mistakes with my appointments. And I thought, I thought our meeting was for 10am

6
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.750

7
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.940

9
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How far away.

10
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.860
Saraniah Aston: I'm here right now.

11
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how far as

12
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.590
Saraniah Aston: Far away. Uh huh. It's about five minutes.

13
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you drive so you so here's what we can do.

14
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a very good drive

15
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a solid hour. So here's my proposition. If you can fully attend in here. We'll do a half hour 25 minutes let's say if you think you can cram it all in. And then you and I can talk again later this evening. We can do the second half, do you want to do that.

16
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.560
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that would be great.

17
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.320
Saraniah Aston: Okay. So when would be really great.

18
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You have any other commitments today.

19
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.720
Saraniah Aston: No, no.

20
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So if I get if I get a cancellation. I'll call you. But otherwise, it will probably be about your time maybe either three 330 or 430 is that maybe. Okay.

21
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.630
Saraniah Aston: Sure 430

22
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.560
Yes.

23
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.620
Saraniah Aston: Okay, I'm actually, I'm ready.

24
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good.

25
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just I'm

26
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Just anything need to be alone. And then we can finish the assessment. So I'll persevere and I mentioned before in group that it's it's a lot of questions. It's not therapy.

27
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So this, this is getting some history, but it's not therapy. Okay, so I wanted to just say that. So although you might be tempted to want to give me a long story. I won't be able to get through the assessment. So they're just kind of

28
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Just basic. This is the answer. And then we'll move on to the next one. Okay.

29
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.880
Saraniah Aston: So it feels a little different.

30
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Than therapy does

31
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.430
Saraniah Aston: Okay, excellent.

32
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me open up a note.

33
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, see.

34
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So just let's get. Let me just do a little introduction of who I am, so that you know who you're talking to, here.

35
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: As you know, I'm in Florida. I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist have been practicing for over 20 years have been very interested in drawn to and have been working directly with people struggling with chemical dependence and

36
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything from private practice to felony drug court.

37
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Aap. So kind of a

38
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: wide spectrum as well as private practice.

39
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Business been with bright heart about two years have had in Mexico license about I specifically got it to work with bright heart. So I have a dual license there and here

40
00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The only other thing, really, I have the ability to kind of I send reminders via text to say, hey, you have an appointment and the night before. Typically I get a confirmation

41
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I use the phone as a way for my clients to reach out if there's a big like something big happens and they want to reach out to me and say, hey,

42
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know I'm in the urgent care or something happened to my dog or, you know, I've got to go do this thing. People can reach out to me and say, I've got a big thing going on.

43
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't use it as a therapeutic intervention, you're not going to have this long winded text, you'll probably hear me say, Hey, do you have time to meet in, zoom, so that we can talk face to face. Okay.

44
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.650
Saraniah Aston: So for some people.

45
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Still kind of cold because like, why would I say something therapeutic on a phone. I've learned over the years that it's too risky words are misinterpreted and when feelings are very tender and there's vulnerability. It's better when we meet face to face. Okay.

46
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.400
Saraniah Aston: Do you have. Yeah, for sure. Definitely.

47
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You have my telephone number.

48
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.100
Saraniah Aston: And I cannot

49
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Even yours down and I'll put it on my phone, and then I'll send you text reminders when our appointments are okay.

50
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.570
Saraniah Aston: So it's area code that would be amazing.

51
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure it's area code.

52
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:36.450
95427240088 495-424-0084

53
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.600

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm gonna send you a quick lunch and then you can just say, Hey, so that we know

56
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.940

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.540

60
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure did. That's beautiful. Okay, so we're going to dive right into

61
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.860
This

62
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

63
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You went looking for treatment where you already taking Suboxone or were you using a short acting opiate like a Percocet, or heroin right before you got here.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.990
Saraniah Aston: No, I've been

65
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:57.060
Saraniah Aston: Clean from any other drugs for over five, six years.

66
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you went looking for treatment. What was your goal, like

67
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.840

Saraniah Aston: 2024 something like, what, eight times 324 yes

71
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And how many years or months have you been at 24 milligrams

72
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.250
Saraniah Aston: Three years.

73
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And why by the change, why change programs.

74
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.440
Saraniah Aston: Um, because the program. I was at previously was

75
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:54.240
Saraniah Aston: Absolutely inhumane and they have been shut down since I left because of how the HR people

76
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.340
Oh dear. Okay.

77
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And did you receive any psychotherapy through that other program.

78
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.140
Saraniah Aston: No. No. None, okay.

79
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So I do provide that I provide the psychotherapy oftentimes my

80
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: clients have a trauma history. They have depression, anxiety, and those underlying issues, even if it's I'm looking for a job or I want to go back to school or I want to eat differently, whatever it is. It doesn't matter what your goal is. I'm going to work with you on that.

81
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So if when you go see this like high interest, you may want to include and say, Hey, I just started. I'll be getting psychotherapy with

82
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: With one of here and then this psychiatrist probably would want to do the medication management piece. Okay.

83
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.430
Saraniah Aston: Okay cool so

84
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:57.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's I'm going to be starting with and it'll be really isolated to just the opiate use. And then I'm going to dip into other substances like alcohol.

85
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.410
Saraniah Aston: Etc, etc.

86
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.520

Gwenevere Abriel: Took it just

97
00:09:54.330 --> 00:10:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because I was curious about the euphoria immediately when you took it just you got a euphoric effect or when you went off the dose. Oh, okay. And how long were you prescribed by couldn't

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.160
Saraniah Aston: Let's take

145
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:18.420
