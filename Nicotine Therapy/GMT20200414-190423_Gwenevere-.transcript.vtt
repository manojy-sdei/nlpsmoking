00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it. Yeah, used to be my color.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Well blonde hair, blue eyes. It looks good.

5
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.410
Saraniah Aston: Yes, it does. The contrast

6
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Ran out of white things to where it's all dirty.

7
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.560
Saraniah Aston: Don't buy white

8
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.940
Saraniah Aston: Because there's no chance it'll survive past

9
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Journey and you guys can't see I have stains all over my clothes. You guys can't tell, it's fantastic guys can tell I can tell from one to three times all stinky.

10
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Straight

11
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.610
Saraniah Aston: Know you always look very put together.

12
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, thank you so much.

13
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's get you in here. We'll look at you, you're like not immediate severe distress.

14
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.930
Saraniah Aston: Now I'm not

15
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.150
Saraniah Aston: I have had a it's been really rough and

16
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.300
Saraniah Aston: I have had some really rough days.

17
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.090
Saraniah Aston: But I just keep trying to write things down.

18
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:19.830
Saraniah Aston: To just remind myself of who I am and what my goals are.

19
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.920
Saraniah Aston: And

20
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.130
Saraniah Aston: And one of the things that I wrote down that's really important to me is

21
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.800
Saraniah Aston: How to control my anger. It's affecting my life greatly, and I do not need it.

22
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.010
Saraniah Aston: Like I have all this anger.

23
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.860
Saraniah Aston: Towards my father. And then my mother, of course.

24
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.370
Saraniah Aston: And then, well, my brother.

25
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.990
Saraniah Aston: My family, basically. And it's hard.

26
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So can I check in a little bit on when you say, I don't need it, I get it. I got a little scared because your brother is a scary, dude.

27
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And like I think you do need to be afraid of him and and so that anger might keep that distance

28
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That if it's not there, he might go in like expecting your love and kindness and compassion will mean that he will be loving and kind and then everybody's going to get hurt. So I guess I don't want to throw out all the anger member who was talking about channeling it harnessing it

29
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.790
Saraniah Aston: I guess. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about more of is

30
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.670
Saraniah Aston: I don't know if not getting rid of it then putting it to some better use

31
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool.

32
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.530
Saraniah Aston: Because it

33
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.090
Saraniah Aston: Is in me.

34
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.470
Saraniah Aston: And

35
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.900
Saraniah Aston: What I don't need, is it to completely like dictate my life.

36
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Amen. I gotcha. Yes.

37
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

38
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If anger was sort of that energy that mobilize it so in my world. I think about what mobilizes and what it mobilizes I kind of pull those two apart. And I'm like, Okay, well, anger, I like because it mobilizes I get pissed off enough, then I'm going to speak.

39
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Truth.

40
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm not to anger like

41
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I really want to pick this battle friend.

42
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.780
Saraniah Aston: Right.

43
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:43.500
Gwenevere Abriel: There are some that are so unacceptable that, then it's going to motivate me and I'm going to speak my mind. So I'm grateful to it in that way and it mobilizes action.

44
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And then there's the the immobilized which is more like the freeze and that can be the depression. SO IF YOU HAVE BEEN SWINGING between

45
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Rage

46
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and then the depression.

47
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Then maybe finding another way in the middle is our goal. Can we go back to some of the things that we did because we had just sort of began this this visual piece. Um, did you add any more to that art that you had done.

48
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.980
No.

49
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.770
Saraniah Aston: That was a rough day

50
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So not that we're not in that day.

51
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm wonder if we could look at it again.

52
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: With neutral or less than sort of emotional eyes, wondering if we could look at it. Is it around.

53
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.950
Saraniah Aston: Trying to find it.

54
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.420
Saraniah Aston: Oh,

55
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.900
Saraniah Aston: Look,

56
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: At now and see just just kind of assess it yourself from an emotional distance, it's not quite as pressing for some time that happened from it and now

57
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.410
Saraniah Aston: Well, there's a lot of anger in that box. Okay.

58
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.390
Saraniah Aston: And my intention is goodness

59
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.140
Saraniah Aston: helping other people

60
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.970
Saraniah Aston: But then on the other side. It's like I need to help me to

61
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.220
Saraniah Aston: Know if I can help many people. When I need help.

62
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe for you. It's

63
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Investing

64
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: More in the self for a little bit.

65
00:07:42.900 --> 00:08:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, making sure that you're feeling well rested well fed that you're sort of feeding that spiritual connection that you're doing the self care should be not recovery mindset, right, you're, you're keeping appointments to okay I'm taking care of this body.

66
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I can care for others. I can be helpful.

67
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.110
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm. Okay.

68
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Well then let's start with those basics. Let's talk about how many hours of sleep, would you say over the last five days you've had, let's say,

69
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.600
Saraniah Aston: Three to four hours a night.

70
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.530
Huh.

71
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Not outstanding.

72
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:30.090
Saraniah Aston: Ask them, I asked the doctor for docs that pin, but I don't think he I

73
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.850
Saraniah Aston: Don't think he sent it in

74
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go quickly messaged him on that because that is probably just a he forgot

75
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm good. I can do, I can see what's today Tuesday I think he'll get my message pretty quickly. Are you do you need buprenorphine to before I send

76
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm just gonna put that before I forget, so it's already on its way. We may hear back from an melted session.

77
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, thank you for God.

78
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.740
Saraniah Aston: God that he actually did and

79
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:09.390
Saraniah Aston: The pharmacy just didn't know yet because I, my mother wouldn't picked up my medication for me yesterday.

80
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Asking them, did you, I'll just ask them.

82
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.130

83
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To have an E at the end of pain like that.

84
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.210
Saraniah Aston: I don't think so. No.

85
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pin would be non let's give that a try. I think you're right. All the he's selling did you order her BA BA BA BA BA. Okay, great. Let's see what he says, I'm okay so right that's about the sleep right now. It's about three hours and

86
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Where's my my note. What about nutrition, are you feeding this body things that it knows, right, it can use as fuel or like how are you eating.

87
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.020
Saraniah Aston: Um,

88
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.740
Saraniah Aston: Well, I eat very healthy food. It's just, I'm

89
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.730
Saraniah Aston: right at this moment, like the past few days. I don't think I've been eating enough

90
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.580
Saraniah Aston: You know, maybe like once a day.

91
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.850
Saraniah Aston: And then picking here in there like on all

92
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.470
Saraniah Aston: Suddenly,

93
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.690
Saraniah Aston: But I'm on the keto diet to it's very restrictive.

94
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.880
Saraniah Aston: Some people think it's healthy. Some people think it's not

95
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't have an opinion about it. I just my only contribution would be

96
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It, good, bad, maybe it's more like is this adaptive for you is this diet is this keto diet working for you right now, doesn't mean it won't work.

97
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Back then, or in a month from now. Is it working for easy giving you the energy and the fuel, so that if you do get sick you heal.

98
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If you need to be processing a cycle lot of big psychological piece that it's not Depleting your nutrition that you need to be processing a difficult sort of emotion. Is it working for you.

99
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:35.130
Saraniah Aston: I think so, but I'm, I'm going to be making a doctor appointment with my doctor my family care doctor just to make sure you get checked out because I did dive into it rather abruptly and hardcore when I found out that I was diabetic.

100
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you lost some weight. Are you noticed your clothes are looser

103
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: It might be just the angle, but it does look like in here. There's a bit like almost like

104
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Some change.

105
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And you may not because you see it incrementally each day, but I have like a few days that pastor. I don't see you so I might be able to catch a change

Gwenevere Abriel: And you have an experience in session with me and you liked it, you really liked you were, I think you got a glimpse to yourself and you wanted to hold on to it.

140
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know,

141
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.910

142
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And it sounds like it's working.

143
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:14.070
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, I think it is. I, I, well my problem is is that I'm extremely unorganized right now, so I don't have one book that's a journal

144
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.830
Saraniah Aston: I have them all over the place. Um, but yeah, I am writing

145
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:28.920
Saraniah Aston: Pretty much daily, whether it be about life or whatever I need to write down. I just write it

146
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.100
Saraniah Aston: I wrote

147
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:47.190
Saraniah Aston: World on hold, not, not a bad thing for me, necessarily, Travis moving to Silver City.

148
00:16:48.540 --> 00:17:01.860
Saraniah Aston: Equals anxiety and paranoia, he sleeps on couch. So I can't visit for a night. I can tell that he is really stressing my mother out big time. Now she really has no

149
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.820
Saraniah Aston: Room for me.

150
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember that actually you it was that there's no room for me part that really hit hard

151
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:21.330
Saraniah Aston: There's a Tuesday, April seven, that must be right after retards I'm assuming

152
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:32.190
Saraniah Aston: I truly do not want to cause worry in the minds of people who love me in this world. I do not mean to be dramatic.

153
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:45.060
Saraniah Aston: Surely, one could say that there was a time when I was without a doubt, seeking attention. I think I wanted to really be seen. Ever since I was a tiny tot I was a very entertaining, little girl.

154
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.130
Saraniah Aston: toasters, things like that, that I'm writing down every day.

155
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.730
Saraniah Aston: You know until I get into it until I really start spilling pages.

156
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So if we just look at somehow this has

157
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:23.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Helped us therapists have this cool word lability right it's this, it's the roller coaster of an effect. Its highs and lows. It's a label it goes through like this.

158
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:34.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If it is in any way helped that sort of seeing yourself on the page. Haven't bounced back at you right. This is my truth. It's right here.

159
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What it does if it's only that it gives you this dual awareness that I am not this feeling, I can write

160
00:18:49.620 --> 00:19:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I will not kill me. I can write it, even if it just us that you're having this dual awareness is a powerful intervention. And if that is working. Let's keep doing it.

161
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.240
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

162
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Absolutely. I love it because what that reinforces is

163
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not this moment.

164
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not just this moment.

165
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I can look upon myself and be the writer of what it sees you can be of dual awareness. That's fantastic. I don't know if you remember if when there's been moments where you feel as if this horror, this anger this sorrow is all there is.

166
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that one.

167
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you just did with the journaling, although you may just say, oh, well, it's journaling and what's the big fuss.

168
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: There's really cool things happening in the mind when you're doing that. So I am a big fan.

169
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.340
Saraniah Aston: Like what, like you just realizing things as you write or

170
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.140
Saraniah Aston: Well, going back and reflecting

171
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how I just told you, it gives you dual awareness.

172
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready, which means you're both feeling it in the moment. And you can also be the observer of it which means that you could even give it and we can we can talk about this as as a as a as a technique. Also, I've been calling this the dual awareness countdown.

173
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like this man like a 9596 right, this is awful. That's objective unit of distress that thing that I asked you guys to do like that's really number

174
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is it.

175
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And use it for yourself like holy

176
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:44.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I meant like 98 know this is awful. Okay, I'm gonna breathe and I'm gonna watch the number

177
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I watch it go down, look at that. It just went down by 95 after my first breath you literally keep watching.

178
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, look at that. I hit just hit 93

179
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like 85 and you're literally watching it go down as you're breathing. That's an it, that would be similar to you, writing it out.

180
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.990
Gwenevere Abriel: In

181
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: The phenomenon of dual awareness, you are not just

182
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.700
That up

183
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah it does work. If you decide for it not to and you fight the number

184
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: If you say no, then of course it won't work. But if you decide, yes. I want this to work, and indeed you watch it and I do this a lot with kids.

185
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, they get a bloody me kids are always falling, let's say, Oh, how does that feel what's awful. It's awful. Well, I wonder how long it's going to feel awful.

186
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: blood coming out in there and let's look at it. Who is it going to keep bleeding that much. Let's count.

187
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: How much pain is it now. What number is that we write we give it that number again there's that number who How dare you give it a number of this pain. Yeah, we can we even if

188
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: We give it a number is still there. Is it down to four. Is it good worse sipping getting worse and they're just looking at me like, Huh, what's she doing because the North

189
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And the normal reaction right is all baby. And then of course the crime continues.

190
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: But this time is different. It's being an observer of yourself have this witness know that you're going to be okay. By asking these kinds of questions and just sort of observing it

191
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It gets the crime stops the pain basically disappears because we're looking at it together. We're saying I wonder how it will last. We're not running away from it. We're not panic and freaking out, we're just really getting to know it.

192
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.160
Saraniah Aston: Whoa.

193
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what this is on the inside is is saying, hmm, not going to run away. I'm not going to numb it going to feel it. Let me give it a number

194
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:56.940
Hmm.

195
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a lot longer than I thought it would be. Maybe I'm not as in distress as I thought. And I'm actually, if I can think about it number and I can do more than just feel this summer. Oh, I can also think

196
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I remembered I also remember the guy was talking about this number system countdown business. So I'm also thinking that's a different part of the brain.

197
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not just hijacked by my limbic system. What else can I think about whoo. I could think about my goal. And I just remembered it. So it's not just static it leads to other things that have worked for you that can work for you again. Oh, yes.

198
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: This moment will pass. I have had these before, and I need to focus on my goal. How do I do it. I'm gonna go get that journal

199
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to draw this feeling I'm going to draw what it feels like. Maybe I'll draw what it feels like an 85. I'm going to go over here and draw it looks like it's 75. Oh, it's like it's 60

200
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to do this anymore. I want to go do something else. You know it, it can be that quick.

201
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And seem silly like why but

202
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.050
Saraniah Aston: No, it's pretty awesome to me.

203
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: If it works, let's do it.

204
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.850
Saraniah Aston: Who's the main skill sets, you've got there.

205
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it. But what I'm learning from is you you're teaching me

206
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, we want to pay attention to what is working. Don't want to take something away when I sort of see what what has kept you alive. What has helped

207
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: get you where you are gets you the success that you have. And let's let's do the things that worked and things I can add, I definitely am going to definitely give you everything I've got

208
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.370
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go over to this thing where you started today with

209
00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: This anger. How did you say

210
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.280
Saraniah Aston: Structured with my mother's suggestion that I bring it up when I talk to you next

211
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.580
Saraniah Aston: Because I told her that I

212
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.430
Saraniah Aston: Told her mom. I'm so much anger towards you.

213
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:09.240
Yeah.

214
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.430
Saraniah Aston: And she's like, well, maybe you need to work out that that with your therapist.

215
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we start there. How did that feel, literally, to have someone say work it out with your therapist, but the anger is directed to her.

216
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:31.620
Saraniah Aston: It's like I'm being shoved under a rug. It's like being shut up.

217
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:50.400
Saraniah Aston: It's like being blatantly ignored and that happening in your face. Um, it's like being told. I'm going to go ahead and take that information that you just gave me and completely ignore it now.

218
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:51.030
Yeah.

219
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.460
Saraniah Aston: You'll deal with it somehow. You'll, you'll do it.

220
00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the main one.

221
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice it's work it out.

222
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Therapist you you for a while we're working it out, maybe with with drugs.

223
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Working out with. Maybe it was self injury pretty toxic relationships. But no matter what. Notice the distance. Fine. Mom, it's work it out.

224
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.780
Gwenevere Abriel: But she didn't engage in was

225
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What's making you angry.

226
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.730
Saraniah Aston: Exactly. She avoids that she doesn't want to know.

227
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:28.200
Right.

228
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where the big piece for you and you say, I want to control and I don't know if it's you.

229
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: If it feels like it's more about your mother.

230
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Then they'll be some ambivalence, and the work won't be as rich

231
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You've mentioned before, these concepts of of anger your favorite, but they've got a you've got they've got to be yours now because your mom said work it out with your therapist, you've got to really own

232
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:03.420
Saraniah Aston: The work, you and I, oh, I do. I mean, she's right. She was right, working with us. She's right.

233
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

234
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.740
Saraniah Aston: I mean, what else am I gonna do. I mean,

235
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.470
Saraniah Aston: I've had anger issues for a very long time.

236
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, where they anchor issues are with those a solution to something that your mother and you were doing well it can we stop giving anger such a bad rap.

237
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.220
Saraniah Aston: I know right.

238
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I I'm like what would have happened to force our Nia without that anger. I don't know.

239
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, would you have gone insane maybe

240
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Cold, so I don't know that we wanted this it so hard.

241
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:41.730
Saraniah Aston: Right.

242
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:45.240
Saraniah Aston: I don't actually I think anger is the gift. Um,

243
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:52.350
Saraniah Aston: But when it controls your life and ruins your family and all that stuff.

244
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.320
Saraniah Aston: And again, I need to stop blaming myself because I am not ruining my family.

245
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not so let's introduce something now you've got this real you notice how you were able to just now see perspective. He just went in came back out. Wait a minute. It's not me. I can't, I can't do that. It's not. Yeah.

246
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that that's that's dual awareness, you're getting you're getting it. That's all we ever do. Whoo. This feels awful. This feels awful. Is this the only perspective I lift my head up.

247
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:35.790
Gwenevere Abriel: No, this is not the only reality. I need to get out of this single respectable do some journaling, I'll ask somebody, how they're doing. How do you see me. We can get out of this. This is the only experience when I put that aside for just a second. I want to talk to you about something.

248
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: These the concept and it's going to feel a little abrupt but the concept of gaslighting

249
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: How foreign or familiar are you with that.

250
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.600
Saraniah Aston: Okay, I still don't understand what gaslighting actually means.

251
00:28:51.750 --> 00:29:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go. I'm trying to find out. I have a lot of clients that have one in their life, and it's not a clinical term but I came across it within the last few years and I'm in love with it.

252
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.650
Saraniah Aston: Because they've been heard about it.

253
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot. Yeah, it's, it's, I love this thing. And I have one video where this woman talks and I'd love to show it to you.

254
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:14.730
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

255
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: If I may, and and if you say, oh my goodness this is my mom, then we're on to something. If you're like,

256
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we'll roll it out.

257
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.230
Saraniah Aston: Okay, okay.

258
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a suspicion.

259
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That you have been as a, as a young girl as as probably a baby even I'm imagining that you have grown up in

260
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:57.840
Gwenevere Abriel: In Validating Environment meaning non validating meaning not validated, which means. Hey, isn't this pretty aren't I pretty on I talented, look at me, and someone somehow along the way, said, yeah, no.

261
00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU GO, GO AWAY. Something like that. Your, your reality, not being met with someone saying, Oh my gosh, look at those photos look at those dance moves.

262
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: That's fantastic. So, and it's not just the dancing. It's

263
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:32.070
Gwenevere Abriel: My value having insight. My, my communication me as a parent me as a student me as a sexual being as as a young person. Great. I mean, there's a bajillion of them, right. And so my question is I'm trying to see if you grew up in that environment.

264
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at this woman and just see what comes up for you, like, oh yeah I I relate to this gal, or no, not so much. It's, I gotta remember if it's 14 minutes 11 minutes, not too sure.

265
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:58.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold on, I gotta focus here with my doing I'm saying bookmark. It's going to show all and then I'm going to type in this word.

266
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: There it is beautiful and I'm gonna share my screen.

267
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: There she is. She speaks very slowly. Okay.

268
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.710
Saraniah Aston: Okay.

269
00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

270
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to skip all the TED Talk stuff.

271
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.840
Saraniah Aston: Talks.

272
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're gonna skip

273
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now, the world is experiencing what I experienced every day as a child.

274
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: There is chaos, there is confusion.

275
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything is upside down.

276
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Reality is being cancelled and nothing means anything

277
00:31:55.050 --> 00:32:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: From gaslighting refers to when someone manipulates you into questioning your own sanity.

278
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a term we are hearing a lot of right now.

279
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's a term. I'm very familiar with.

280
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: People are perhaps confused with how to manage and to cope with the situation. And that's where I can help.

281
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:35.280
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was in my mid 30s. I had a meeting with my editor and it was my first major journalism assignment for the Sunday Times magazine.

282
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd gone to meet him for drink and I was feeling hopeful. I was feeling like things might work out.

283
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And as I was leaving another writer arrived.

284
00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: This writer recognized me from when I was a child, and he said, Are you so and so's daughter and I replied, Yes.

285
00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And hit been against one of my mother's dinner parties.

286
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: After I left this meeting my editor told me

287
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That he had said hi I always wondered how that little girl would survive. I had thought her only chances are suicide or murder.

288
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: When you told me this line. I felt validation, because here was this person who had actually witnessed what I knew to be true and it confirmed what I knew

289
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So he had said two options suicide or murder. Why would you say that. And what does this have to do with gaslighting

290
00:33:47.940 --> 00:34:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I grew up in an environment that from the outside, seemed privileged an enviable my mother was a very glamorous poet and an artist, and there were always very interesting people around.

291
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a bohemian world.

292
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: She loved entertaining and there would be raucous parties on weeknights I would be in my bed trying to go to sleep, and I would be woken up with drunken laughter noise outside the bedroom.

293
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And sometimes these people would come into my room to escape from the crowd and they would sit and they would smoke and they would use the bathroom.

294
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And other times I would get up in my nightgown and open the door and shout desperately. Please, can people be quiet. It's a school night I have to go to sleep. I have to get up tomorrow.

295
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: My mother would reply Ariel. Come join the party or she would say after the belly dancer. Everyone will go home.

296
00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.260
Gwenevere Abriel: It was total bombardment.

297
00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So the following morning, what would happen is I would confront her about the situation and it was as though this disruption had never happened.

298
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What I thought had happened, I was being told has not happened. That's the key piece, what

299
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I was being told did not happen.

300
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:20.070
Saraniah Aston: That

301
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The escalating and that I was making a big deal out of nothing.

302
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And finally confronted her with the facts. They were bad in a way

303
00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I was sprayed with words of adoration and words of content you're stupid idiot, and I wish you had never been born when I confronted her about having said this to me. I was told I was making it up and that it was a lie.

304
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So it wasn't just that my reality was cancelled, but my perceptions of reality we're overwritten.

305
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of the most insidious things about gaslighting is the denial of reality.

306
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: being denied what you have seen with your own eyes, and you know to be true being denied an experience that you have had and you know is real.

307
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: For me via ratio of the abuse was worse than the abuse.

308
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So it can make you crazy, but you are not crazy.

309
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I developed for strategies writing

310
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Even know they were strategies to put them up. So in these uncertain times. I'm going to share them with you and maybe they can help you to

311
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one is to remain defiant

312
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: When I was a little girl. I wrote a story about running away from home.

313
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And when my mother saw the story, she said.

314
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't true, and demanded I change it and I didn't change it.

315
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I actually yelled out, I am not changing my story. I'm not

316
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: This defiance was key because I was trusting my version of reality and not allowing it to be altered on demand.

317
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: This anger protected me. I knew what I knew and it couldn't be erased.

318
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So the person gaslighting you will often try to bully you

319
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But being defiant is something that does not make you difficult it's being resilient.

320
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Now recognize that you will never get accountability.

321
00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Will never select go of expecting accountability. That's going to be the second piece. She does put them up on our screen your head was down and see the first one, she will list them, but it's letting though. Right. I think my late 20s, I tried to recognize

322
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: There will never be

323
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Her

324
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, another

325
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: BROTHER, FATHER anyone. This is the piece there will never it's the never there will never be accountability.

326
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Radically accepting

327
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

328
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm here for you. And we can we can grieve together. But let me tell you something to freedom that comes to vitality on the other side. I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay.

329
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: With really accepting

330
00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.270
Never

331
00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

332
00:38:51.330 --> 00:39:02.100
Gwenevere Abriel: The truth about what happened in my childhood I was sitting with my mother in a Japanese restaurant and I said the words, child abuse, for the first time out loud.

333
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:15.180
Gwenevere Abriel: playfully so she didn't feel like it was an attack on her and immediately her response was, what about mommy of use, nobody ever talks about that.

334
00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I learned in that moment was that she would never be able to take accountability for her actions, she would never get it. She would never say, Oh, you're right. You have a point

335
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And that acknowledgement was not in the cards.

336
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:40.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Asserting myself was not just useful, but it was harmful.

337
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the person gaslighting you did you hear that

338
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:45.450
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

339
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.500
Saraniah Aston: heartedness

340
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Is not just not helpful, it's harmful where normally a therapist, etc. You're going to hear me say self advocacy assertive, a sort of sort of

341
00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't waste your time.

342
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.990
Saraniah Aston: Yeah.

343
00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:13.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Will never be able to respond to logic or reason. And so if you think that you can apply logic and reason you're going to feel let down

344
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: With this recognition. You are no longer powerless.

345
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting go of the wish for it to be different. This is a big one.

346
00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.970
Gwenevere Abriel: For me, because the wish for to get different is very powerful.

347
00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It inoculates you to the tumult

348
00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It allows you to continue to believe that logic and reason will prevail. Well,

349
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And after a particularly bad episode. My mother would reassure me that it would never happen again.

350
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It would happen again.

351
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Promises were broken. And I realized that I could not rely on her work.

352
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.740
Saraniah Aston: With gaslighting

353
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The person gaslighting you makes you feel as though the ground is always shifting beneath your feet and that you have no center of gravity.

354
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You want things to make sense, but they won't

355
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Engaging with someone who has gaslighting you means you will never feel hurt. So what's the solution you stop engaging and you put yourself first.

356
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Number four, would be to develop a healthy detachment. I had to develop coping mechanisms. When I was a child.

357
00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: The back and forth and the push and pull of affection was emotional whiplash. You're wonderful you're horrible. I love you, I hate you. I had to protect myself by believing that nothing meant anything

358
00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you can't invest in anything. The other person says what happens. Well, when you grow up, there's a price for me.

359
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What had been adaptive as a child became maladaptive as an adult. So trusting was very difficult. I was always needing verification. I became vigilant about clarity.

360
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: There was no room for misunderstanding and there was no margin for error.

361
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Somebody asked me once, what are you looking for in a relationship, and I replied certainty.

362
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I needed certainty in an uncertain world.

363
00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But we live in an uncertain world.

364
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there has to be a way to find balance.

365
00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: detaching from gaslighting does not mean total detachment.

366
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It means distinguishing between the world of the gas lighter and the real world.

367
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can let people have their alternative facts, you'll stick to reality.

368
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Distinguishing between gas lighter

369
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Perspective, she gets to have her altered reality. You get to pay attention to how your body feels that years the words you just heard you get to pay attention to your emotional reaction you get to have that distinguished you're developing a healthy detachment. Let's keep listening.

370
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:42.240
Okay.

371
00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So if the only options for me were suicide or murder. How did I survive well there was actually a third option writing it down.

372
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: This was my way of making sense of the chaos by organizing it on the page.

373
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.250
Gwenevere Abriel: This happened. This was real.

374
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Whether the writing was published or not it was something that had to be written

375
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: To say what needed to be said to validate my reality.

376
00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:27.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Even if it was disavowed which it was

377
00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It was testimony.

378
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Ironically, it was my mother, who passed on to me the tools that I needed in order to survive because she always championed freedom of speech through writing

379
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And by telling my story.

380
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It was and continues to be an act of redemption.

381
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you.

382
00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so yeah. What do we think

383
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.270
Saraniah Aston: Know what I'm writing

384
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.330
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, that pretty much describes

385
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.720
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, my mom. Definitely.

386
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:23.160
Saraniah Aston: Makes you feel as though the ground beneath you, is always shifting

387
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:33.480
Saraniah Aston: I wrote down how she wrote. We live in an uncertain world and validate your own reality.

388
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:40.740
Saraniah Aston: And develop healthy detachment distinguishing between gas lighters, and my perspective.

389
00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:50.820
Saraniah Aston: And then basically gaslighting when someone manipulates you to question your own sanity.

390
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Correct. What's happening is they're questioning the question your they negate your own reality.

391
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So you might say, this happened yesterday and all you're doing is breaking down the facts. I went to the kitchen. You said shut it. No, I never said that.

392
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Like it would you I was there. And so it's that. And then it's also about feelings. I'm hurt. I'm angry. Oh no, you're not stopping. You're being ridiculous. Anyway, let's focus on dinner.

393
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:33.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's both. It's not only what you heard saw felt with your physical body. You were there witnessing it with your eyeballs in your ears. It's also

394
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Completely invalidate your emotional experience and saying, You're being ridiculous. And so it's so if you so all you have all of those notes. Now, clean it nice and tight and write these four things. Number one, three main defiance defiant

395
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Gets its own page number one remain defiant

396
00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Anger protected you

397
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And can protect you. Number two.

398
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:05.610
Gwenevere Abriel: She will never

399
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Be accountable.

400
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:12.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Number three.

401
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: harsh reality. I know.

402
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I know. Oh, yeah.

403
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But the other side is something else. Okay. If you decide to do these things.

404
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no clear decision. Number three is let go of the wish that's I think the one that's probably going to be the most

405
00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:29.970
Saraniah Aston: Different

406
00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a level wish for it to be different.

407
00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And number four, when you're ready.

408
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.290
Saraniah Aston: Yeah, ready

409
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:47.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Develop healthy detachment.

410
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't say abandon. I didn't say never speak to, again, nope. She's talking about is that list that you took a picture of it's about boundaries.

411
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about learning little phrases like, is this a me problem or you problem.

412
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about choosing curiosity over being right there's going to be little phrases that you may decide to own and live because they're more than just a catchy little annoying phrase that you might hear me repeat. They're very, they're like, literally.

413
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: They're the tools of defiance where you will not budge from your truth and you don't have to fight for it anymore though. That's the difference. It's no it's real. I know exactly how I feeling. I know exactly what yesterday was

414
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Her

415
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:40.710
Night.

416
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:44.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And so then okay now I'm back in a relaxed body.

417
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: She's never going to see it your way. And if she does.

418
00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, guess what tomorrow. She's gonna pull that rug out from under you and you're going to be left with the same you were starting to rely on that shared reality and then tomorrow, it'll be something else.

419
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you have the position of radical acceptance except exactly what it is. If this is happening. Look there she's doing it again just doing it again. She's doing it again, but it has more and more distance from you and you can say

420
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I know what that is.

421
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And it will never change. I see it, it's real, it's not me.

422
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not me.

423
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fine. I'm saying

424
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: My trying to question, make me question myself and I won't

425
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.640
Saraniah Aston: I'm just unless you want to change. Right.

426
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So obviously, that is a completely. That's it. That is, notice how I'm not doing anything about her. I can't change anything about her if she decides

427
00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: To do some self growth then fantastic, but guess what we do, we jump in. No, we don't jump in. We dip our toe slowly, we see if this individual can earn trust again and trust takes time.

428
00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.290
Mm hmm.

429
00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Will they will they do what they say this week, will that be sustainable for a month.

430
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Nine out of 10 times

431
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at that. I'm starting to see a pattern. I'm going to share a little bit more vulnerability with this person, much like what you and I were talking about with the dating thing. It's the same thing with mom and start there. She's the big one. Anyway, right. I wonder

432
00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what, I will. I've watched her this last month, and she seems to be she's saying and doing the. I'm sorry.

433
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:58.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I will tell her a little story a personal story and see how she handles it, see if she is careful with it or she goes and gossips and tells other people well okay she's not ready.

434
00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:04.710
Saraniah Aston: Right. It's funny yesterday she was like, Mia. Can we start over today.

435
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:13.830
Saraniah Aston: First, I was like oh my gosh she had her mind, we start over. There is a starting over, like

436
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:18.930
Saraniah Aston: Guess mom. Today we'll start over.

437
00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah. In a regular healthy relationship. I wish that was true. I wish what she was saying was

438
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. And let me each each little stone each little breath. Let me put them down for you.

439
00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:47.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry I tried to make you crazy when I denied that you were doing this, I'm trying, I'm sorry I got in between you two. And I said you were bad, and he was good. I wish she was laying the foundation with her genuine ownership and accountability.

440
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But the I want to start over. Is that because she doesn't want to own anything and talk about what happened.

441
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.130
Saraniah Aston: I think it's 75% of that. Yes.

442
00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the other person.

443
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.550
Saraniah Aston: The other percent is her genuine

444
00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.090
Saraniah Aston: genuinely trying in her own

445
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.260
Saraniah Aston: kind of way.

446
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:15.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

447
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You do get a sense that she cares about you. She may not know how to show it.

448
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But you do see that she

449
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.370
Saraniah Aston: Chill. Yeah, I believe that she cares about me, it's just

450
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:37.710
Saraniah Aston: Messed up it's wrong. This all backwards, not the right way to care about somebody she loves me. Yeah, okay.

451
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.200
Saraniah Aston: She loves her daughter, but

452
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:45.240
Saraniah Aston: I don't know. She likes me very much.

453
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.530
Saraniah Aston: She'll always love me, I think.

454
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:56.910
Saraniah Aston: As her daughter, the child that she gave birth to, you know, the little girl I was

455
00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So what if you. Let's start with number one on this member. It's very, it's very much like I don't have a lot of time. I just check the time. But let's take that piece you started with. Today, which was about. I need to control my anger.

456
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I was like, Oh, how do we channel it harness it. But what if what you're doing is doing this.

457
00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You picture this list defiant right hands on the hip. So I think of, I think, of a sassy little girl right

458
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, and I know I want those, those are the shoes. I want to tell me I like something else. This is what I like. Like I picture my hands on my hips.

459
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:39.270
Saraniah Aston: Mm hmm.

460
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so I picture that and I'm just like,

461
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I can be on the phone. I could be talking with her and I just make the pose. Just stand there and I picture the words that you look at them, they're look at it.

462
00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:54.480
Remained

463
00:53:56.310 --> 00:54:02.520
Gwenevere Abriel: If I remain define which means I have nothing to defend have nothing to argue

464
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: We just take it.

465
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I will not explain myself.

466
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't give you details so that we can argue not gonna say anything, you just stay quiet your hand sort of on your gifts or whatever feels right and you just because it's going to be brand new.

467
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:22.110
Um,

468
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can just breathe last defiance look like, or I don't have to argue anything I accept what is she's kind of switching from what was yesterday. And now she's okay it's happening. I will not join her there. I will not

469
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I have my reality. I'm still in the one that we talked about yesterday. We're starting over. I'm still in that space on this date here define them I'd be like, Hmm, I want to stay happy I'm having a good day.

470
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly gonna stay here.

471
00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you watch her in her various antics of different things. She's doing you just watch. There's nothing to change. There's nothing to do you have your reality, it's right here right in these tips.

472
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I will not be budged.

473
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:13.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Just that

474
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what happens with just fat staying quiet.

475
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So that anger can just begin. I will not move from my position. I know what I know what I know. I'm going to say it just see if you can keep it just challenging audience settling in.
