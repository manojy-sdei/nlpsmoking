Douglas Denlinger: Some you know how to go to the doctor and get pain pills and

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:29.250
Douglas Denlinger: And when I got that shoulder injury I that's the pain pills or where I wrote lost control and started to, you know, a couple years of just taking too many of those pain pills that were being prescribed to me. And then, you know, I started, you know, talking to more than one doctor at a time.

3
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.630
Douglas Denlinger: Or I'd start buying something from somebody and then

4
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:47.220
Douglas Denlinger: Still get my prescription for my doctor back and forth and just messing messing around with the pain pills is where I really kind of lost control and wasn't able to

5
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.130
Douglas Denlinger: physical addiction. I wasn't able to get off of those. And I went, what almost two or three years of

6
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:15.870
Douglas Denlinger: being addicted to pain pills and to the point where it was, you know, getting really bad at the end where I was buying, you know, larger amounts of pills is getting really expensive got really close to losing the house and the job and all the stuff with my family and everything and

7
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.550
Douglas Denlinger: That's when 2009 I

8
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:30.060
Douglas Denlinger: My wife didn't know anything about it either. So I basically told her what was going on and that I needed help, and I checked myself into a 30 day rehab.

9
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:42.960
Serenna Beers: Okay. So just to recap, because unfortunately I did not hit. I didn't unpause the recording button. So I need to say it for transcription

10
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.490
Serenna Beers: Purposes, because we have somebody who will take this video and then transcribe it into note. So it started with because you've been with

11
00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:01.620
Serenna Beers: Doc Dr groves for about the last seven, eight years and then when her practice change to bright heart health. You just continued your care with with her, but you were established with

12
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:12.720
Serenna Beers: Doc Dr groves your history with substances. I mean you experimented did different things pot. I think you said alcohol. I'm not sure if there was any other drugs, but that was kind of

13
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:32.370
Serenna Beers: A recreational things until you blew your shoulder, shoulder out and then that started with the pain meds to the point where you had to start buying them off the street or first you went to different doctors to try to get more pills and then when that wasn't accessible to you.

14
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.370
Serenna Beers: Then you went to buy and pills and then that's when kind of things all went south, you had to let your family know and then you went into tree and right

15
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.340
Serenna Beers: I'm surprised I remembered that

16

Douglas Denlinger: One on law. The 13 year old boy.

57
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.780
Serenna Beers: Okay, and I assume you live with your wife and your and your son.

58
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:38.280
Serenna Beers: And then tell me, tell me a few things that you hope to get out of being with us. I mean is, is there anything new that you want to learn. I mean, it sounds like you have a pretty good.

59
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:52.290
Serenna Beers: Recovery stance like you seem pretty stable with with that. But is there anything, anything that we could provide you with. Is there any educational things that you want to learn or anything like like that.

60
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.570
Douglas Denlinger: No, I don't.

61
00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.890
Douglas Denlinger: Very good. Pretty good spot with, you know, I've done years and years of a and na

62
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:12.030
Douglas Denlinger: As well as been with Dr. Gross for a lot of years now. And in part of her Suboxone group that meets in Crescent City.

63
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:21.480
Douglas Denlinger: I really don't have any needs from bright heart health, to be quite honest with you, other than to be continuing my carrot. Dr. Gross.

64
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.450
Serenna Beers: Okay, um, let me just look

65
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:39.690
Serenna Beers: Cuz I can talk with her about it, but I wanted to see your file as far as what the expectation is as far as you being you meeting with a therapist because I do think that there are some

66
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:49.980
Serenna Beers: Qualifications like you know whether we meet once a month to check in, or something like like that, as far as, as far as

67
00:08:51.210 --> 00:09:05.880
Serenna Beers: being compliant with the pain management, but maybe I can send her a message like on here, it says on your file twice a month, but I can talk to Dr groves and see what she wants me to do with them.

68
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:18.240
Douglas Denlinger: What what I need to know too is, I was pretty straight honest and asked a lot of questions when I started this process and I was told I really only needed to see you once because it was part of the process that I

69
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.710
Douglas Denlinger: Guess you therapist, so

70
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.210
Serenna Beers: Well, that's

71
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:30.540
Douglas Denlinger: Probably true then and then on top of that, when I so here's the deal when every time I go to one of these groups with bright heart the actual Open Group with Dr groves.

72
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:39.900
Douglas Denlinger: And then the other people that are part of the group at the same time there's a therapist and Dr grows in that group. So that's two co pays right there.

73
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.000
Douglas Denlinger: Plus, if I have to see you.

74
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:52.950
Douglas Denlinger: A month or say twice a year, whatever it is not that money is that big of a deal, but we're talking $30 per provider.

75
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.870
Douglas Denlinger: Just to see Dr groves.

76
00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:14.640
Douglas Denlinger: To have a group meeting have that group meeting with other people that are in recovery which is I still don't mind doing but $60 every time I do a group with bright heart and then $30 every time I see a therapist that you know I'm not personally looking to see no

77
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.100
Douglas Denlinger: Nothing against you.

78
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:17.940
Douglas Denlinger: Oh, that

79
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.790
Serenna Beers: That doesn't know personalizing it.

80
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:35.880
Douglas Denlinger: Talking 90 bucks every, you know, all these visits, it's, you know, that's kind of where I'm at, to have stuff set up that doesn't cost me any money. A na I have Dr groves and her staff that I

81
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:43.560
Douglas Denlinger: Regularly part of I still go see Tony over it del Norte community health center. I'm still part of their Suboxone group.

82
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.790
Douglas Denlinger: Okay. Um, I have

83
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:52.080
Douglas Denlinger: She's an addiction counselor therapist that I can walk into her office right off the street, and he today. Anytime the week.

84
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:58.290
Douglas Denlinger: And have the conversation with her, and I'm not hooked to a computer, I can actually

85
00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.430
Douglas Denlinger: Okay.

86
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.900
Serenna Beers: Physical Contact I

87
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.880
Serenna Beers: Mean not you know like we physically see in

88
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:16.770
Serenna Beers: Person. Yeah. Um, well, I mean, I, I'm not going to schedule you. I mean, if I'm told differently then then that's a conversation, but that will probably be a conversation between you and Dr groves.

89
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:33.540
Serenna Beers: So I so I'm just going to hold hold off and I'm gonna and the transcription notes. It'll, it'll say that you have. You're very solid you're very stable. And so the recommendation going forward is just that you attend those groups for pain management.

90
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:43.560
Serenna Beers: Purposes and and and i'm sure that it sounds like that that was already in agreement that that you made so

91
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.870
Douglas Denlinger: Yeah, for instance, I only have to see.

92
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.450
Serenna Beers: You just froze.

93
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.980
Douglas Denlinger: Fills for the Suboxone

94
00:11:53.340 --> 00:12:00.600
Douglas Denlinger: And then I only have to do the group and what she heard I have set up so that the bright heart.

95
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:07.770
Douglas Denlinger: Group meeting is also once every three months when I do my get my refill.

96
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.430
Serenna Beers: Oh,

97
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.620
Serenna Beers: Okay, well, then I wouldn't see why you need

98
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.280
Douglas Denlinger: Gotcha. Alright. So sounds like that is what you're supposed to do. So I will not

99
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:27.870
Serenna Beers: Try to schedule you or anything like like like that they may want you to see me once every three months to check in. I doubt it, but it sounds like you have a pretty

100
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:41.220
Serenna Beers: Solid found station so I definitely don't want to mess with that, but I do wish you the best stay safe and stay well. And thank you for your time and being honest with all of these questions.

101
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.560
Douglas Denlinger: You're welcome. Thank you.

102
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.420
Serenna Beers: Okay. Okay. Thanks. Bye.

103
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.250
Serenna Beers: Sounds like this gentleman says per Dr groves that he doesn't have to attend.

104
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.530
Serenna Beers: Therapy, so I will follow up with Dr groves about this.
