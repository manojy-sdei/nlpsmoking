00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's

100
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.500
Nicole Roybal: I think that's why I throw up because I like I get so dizzy. That makes me

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you saying, Are you saying that you are throwing up

Nicole Roybal: Three.

105
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:33.990
Nicole Roybal: Usually just like in the morning I wake up and I'll be sitting here and I'll just be like all woozy as long as I'm laying down. I won't throw up.

106
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.280
Nicole Roybal: They've been laying down a lot.

107
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.450

So,

112
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:08.130
Nicole Roybal: I guess I don't know cuz I usually smoke joints and smoking dabs over here looking. Laughs Okay I'm only thinking like

115
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, don't see any connections to now Asha dizziness anytime without that behavior. Correct.

116
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:42.960
Nicole Roybal: No, that's I like I've been waiting till at least like four o'clock, maybe three at the earliest to see if maybe that's causing more dizziness, but not because I still haven't even smoke to date and it's horrible.

117
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: How, um, talk to me about the last four days. If you're eating.

118
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.070
Nicole Roybal: Okay, so

119
00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:03.480
Nicole Roybal: Wednesday night Thursday I did eat that day like for my breakfast bacon, eggs and potatoes. Oh, I didn't eat eggs, bacon and potatoes.

120
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.100
Nicole Roybal: And then, Virginia. I've made meat and potato tacos.

121
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:18.990
Nicole Roybal: And then the next day for breakfast. I made the same thing for breakfast. But I know the next day I felt so does yet commute and get up and eat much that I did all

122
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: This was like a

123
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Thursday or Friday Thursday or Friday.

124
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:40.440
Nicole Roybal: I think it was Thursday I didn't eat nothing else to do. The first day that this was happening and then Friday I finally was able to get up and cook but yeah Thursday I laid in bed all day didn't really eat much because I couldn't get up.

125
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:56.310
Nicole Roybal: And then Friday was what I was able to get up and cook a little bit, but I didn't really eat much just because yesterday. I didn't feel good in the morning. And then finally, I am took a shower and made myself get up. I make

126
00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.850
Nicole Roybal: tortilla burgers. Okay. And I one of those with some fries.

127
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So I am noticing.

128
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not a nutritionist, but I'm not hearing a lot of fruits and vegetables you're eating a

129
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a lot of grease in it. I don't have a judgment about Greece, but sometimes I'm, what I'm hearing from people that have things like

130
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Always it their pancreas. I forget which Oregon processes.

131
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the grease.

132
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It makes it gives them abdominal pain, so you don't have any abdominal pain, right.

133
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. Just curious. But how come. How come you don't eat fruits and vegetables is that does that come from your family or you you don't know the value of them, or what's the deal there.

134
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.970
Nicole Roybal: But I like like like cantaloupe and honey you and stuff like that.

135
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so cantaloupe and

136
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm

137
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm sort of hinting at here are dark colored foods. In other words, a spinach is a dark color a kale is it, it is not a you need to hold on. This is not about your taste buds, Nicole.

138
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.710
So it's not about

139
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This is about your health. So just taking the information just let it in

140
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:43.380
Gwenevere Abriel: kale, spinach, collard greens, these are dark colors. Broccoli is a dark color.

141
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: When you go over to the fruits and vegetables, fruits part a blackberry is a dark color a blueberries, a dark color. Notice that right

142
00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: The tricky raspberries, a dark color you go over to

143
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What I'm told about the strawberries, is that they're very absorbent of pesticides. So if you were ever to splurge on something.

144
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: That was organic, it would be a strawberry. So maybe hold off on strawberry.

145
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I know this is you're not used to hearing about health who talks to you about health, nobody in your family talks to you about health. So I know this is not going to be welcomed information.

146
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just gotta say it because I'm only hearing bacon.

147
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Honey, do I don't know anything about honey do, but I don't know that it has any nutritional value.

148
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what I'm getting at, like, I know it tastes good, the textures. Good.

149
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But what if we're onto something. What if what you're eating.

150
00:18:51.270 --> 00:19:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You know the science behind the gut and the brain biome, the more and more their understanding the fact that right. Where's the serotonin made in the gut.

151
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: That's our happy hormone that's the one that makes us happy.

152
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And we can stay in denial that that exists or we're denying science.

153
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

154
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it, I would rather eat a bag of Doritos.

155
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And I look at what I like, I like orange slices. I like straight up just sugar is bad.

156
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And it gets all my teeth. It gives me all kinds of cavities.

157
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I, that's what I want to eat.

158
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But when I changed my philosophy about what this body is

159
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm protecting it you're protecting it from a virus, why aren't you protecting and putting healthy things into it. I just, I know you've got a long way to go on these these things but I figured somebody's got to say it because nobody else. Who else is saying it to you.

160
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.610
Nicole Roybal: I know only you. Sorry, my head is just like

161
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: throbbing and how hydrated, are you

162
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.130
Nicole Roybal: I'm hydrated.

163
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: OK. OK.

164
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.160
Nicole Roybal: I think a lot of water night and all day, all the time.

165
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

166
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, we'll just lay down and hold the phone off to the side. Just lay down

167
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.780
Nicole Roybal: What about like green beans are like the dark

168
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: The dark race. I think those dark ones actually have some some value. I do think that's true beings, I think, beans, not bad, it's the, it's the leafy of the green the leaf Enos, that has the antioxidants in it that's what

169
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what he wants.

170
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.260
Is the antioxidants.

171
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: That's in the leafy green iceberg has nothing

172
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Celery nothing

173
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: There's nothing in it.

174
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: There's literally. And so here's the thing, here's how you know when there's

175
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Thinking about the cost of something, how cheapest bread but sheep is a low for Wonder Bread.

176
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And now you go over to the fancy one that has the Steve's. I don't know what they're called. It's got those 4000 grains in it. They're like, whole grains, and it's like it's like eaten eaten raw week

177
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I like it because I like that guy. Like, I mean a nuts. But look at the price difference. This one's going to be, you know, a buck 50. This one's going to be like pushing for dollars.

178
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Iceberg lettuce is really cheap. There's

179
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.140
Reason.

180
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And kale is going to be more expensive.

181
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You have to ask yourself, why is that

182
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.820
Nicole Roybal: Because the government wants overcharges to be healthy.

183
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Other way around it.

184
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:13.590
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

185
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I agree. I am

186
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to Washington on that one. I totally agree.

187
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We got nine o'clock. Okay, cool, cool, cool. We got 10

188
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.750
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'm not gonna keep coming at you with this information, because I know it's

189
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:45.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not something you're quite ready to hear. But the more we hear it if we hear it and then we hear it. Then someone along the line, maybe you'll see something or hear something that you you believe has some credibility and maybe you'll say, okay,

190
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:47.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Y'all look at that.

191
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.170
Nicole Roybal: bugging me by saying it or nothing. I did. I have

192
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:53.700
Nicole Roybal: Not

193
00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, so you just analyze something that's not accurate. Do you want to ask me a question.

194
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.480
Nicole Roybal: No.

195
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm not

196
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not offended upset. No, this is you're ready.

197
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: To take in new information.

198
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I want you to kind of get it nice and slow. So that you're not like oh so annoyed with hearing people talk about that. I don't want to do that.

199
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:24.450
Nicole Roybal: To you.

200
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.820
Nicole Roybal: Not irritated.

201
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, okay. That's okay. I thought

202
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So my audio is such that I say something and then I can hear it back at me. So that's a nice

203
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

Gwenevere Abriel: Just log out and come right back just you can lay there but just log out and come right back. Let's see if it snaps.

207
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Check, check, check.

208
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Check, check, check, check.

209
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Worse.

210
00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

211
00:24:47.220 --> 00:25:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to think, no I looks like we're doing some psychotherapy, where will the psycho analysis for you're laying on the couch, you know, and I want you to think of your childhood. If I'm shooting a man, boy. Yo, Massa

Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted you to hear that. I'm so playful.

215
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You know who Freud is right.

216
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So that philosophy was we're supposed to create this blank slate. The psychologist psycho psycho therapist is supposed to stand behind the couch can even see the therapist, and then there's the just free association.

217
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Science has come a long way, we've got to actually

218
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Be looking at each other.

219
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.250

Nicole Roybal: That's what I was thinking. Yeah, but my job is noise orange. It was this time.

277
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

278
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to take it again.

279
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: How long, how many minutes had passed that had been in your stomach.

280
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.110
Nicole Roybal: Like 1012 minutes

281
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:31.800
Okay.

282
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.370
Nicole Roybal: Like I said to get like literally right before I signed in to talk to you.

283
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm wondering if now, what is important. I know this is not your favorite topic but foods coming up again. I'm just wondering. So, for example,

284
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not a breakfast eater, but I make myself, eat a piece of that, you know, the funny nutty toast that Fred was talking about the fancy ones with all the nut like green in it.

285
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I stuck it in my face. And because I know when I take my multivitamin or fish. What else nonsense. I have to take. I know I'm getting an upset stomach, it's, it's the same as medicine for me stuff in there so that my stomach doesn't get nachos.

286
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm, you might need to have that piece of bread crackers in there so that it doesn't just have the stomach acid and the elephant in there.

287
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I'm. That's what I'm doing.

288
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:37.890
Nicole Roybal: No. Yeah, that makes sense. No, but well done on those words to me as I drink like a whole water bottle.

289
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:50.250
Nicole Roybal: For that you will not like a whole lot, and like half of one and there was no water. It was all just like stomach acid and the pills. So I found that really odd that no, there was like no liquid. It was all just like acid.

290
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:57.000
Nicole Roybal: Hmm, and I drink the water bottle right before it like along with the gallon containers so I don't know why the hell.

291
00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.360
Nicole Roybal: And I wouldn't have done that with my head wasn't spending.

292
00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You have just not gotten truly stable, there's something going on. I really do. I think that there's still something just hasn't quite settled to because you don't come in here saying, oh, I had a normal day and

293
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:26.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Going about my business, my room. If your body continues to be in distress.

294
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And and you must be tired of that.

295
00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.030
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I can't get a break.

296
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's kind of what I'm picking up on like each time. It's something just the knowledge. Just seems to be there quite a bit. Once we figured out okay together, repent. We need to take it easy on the taper.

297
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I still think we need to continue to investigate what's going on. That's what I'm thinking. And if you're open to it and we can rule out some things

298
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if we can get you feel like a normal person, why it always happens you

299
00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

300
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's find out. We just kind of figure it out.

301
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:13.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm pretty sure, see what you're doing some pretty specific there for a while. Um, yeah, man.

302
00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.340
Nicole Roybal: You're probably right eating habits.

303
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, the eating.

304
00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: May really

305
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Have something to do with it.

306
00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what did you end up doing around taking care of your health care. So we had a little something.

307
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: We had well wellness checkup on 2pm march 27 did you keep that appointment.

308
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh you cancel.

309
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.210
No.

310
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Cancelled. Okay.

311
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: What she's thinking about what's going on there.

312
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:05.220
Nicole Roybal: Okay, remember what happened that day. I think I got sick again that game.

313
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.140
Nicole Roybal: My boy, you know,

314
00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So maybe you didn't cancel, maybe just didn't go

315
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.500
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, cuz I was gonna go but I wasn't feeling good. I can't remember why wasn't good.

316
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.520
Okay.

317
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:25.920
We could go, come on.

318
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:27.600
Nicole Roybal: I remember

319
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:34.290
Nicole Roybal: I remember seeing an appointment with my mom when you weren't feeling good.

320
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.170
Nicole Roybal: With that

321
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll

Nicole Roybal: Yeah, I know.

324
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:56.490
Nicole Roybal: Okay, I'm kind of thing. If it was, if I had that feature happened to me. Not too long ago, or whatever. IT WAS HYPERVENTILATING. I don't know what the hell. It wasn't my hand picked up till June.

325
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

326
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:57.930

Gwenevere Abriel: How many hours.

332
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.480
Nicole Roybal: I go to bed around like 10 1030

333
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:27.600
Nicole Roybal: And then I've been like honestly like now. Well, the past few days I've been laying in bed all day. So I've been seeking to like 12 or one even sometimes just because I don't want to get out of bed because my head is hurting

334
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.230
Nicole Roybal: If I didn't know. My head hurts. Just as busy is just like spinning

335
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think you need to see somebody, but I mean, you know, we're in such a weird time right now. So I go there and

336
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: come away with something else.

337
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I hear you. Um, if you want you can lay the phone down. I'm going to run out for 60 seconds just sort of lay there and do some breathing just focus on on when we do this. Let me see if I can pull up something kind of positive here for you to focus on

338
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, why don't you focus on

339
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Best Friend, Tiffany.

340
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right as a nurturer really get into focusing on how she might see you as this strong and capable person knowing you can get through this. Knowing this is

341
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Some passing moment, it will not feel like this. You just just sort of we don't hide to run away from this experience, and then also the asshole.

342
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Tony Stark.

343
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: The wise figure also kind of

344
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Really smart or Howie Mondale's then we get this sort of light hearted wise figure

345
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you

346
00:37:51.090 --> 00:38:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: This adult woman, this young woman that shares the qualities, much like with the therapist, when you share those qualities of a protection.

347
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You know caution and preparation just sort of sit with those you can put the phone down for a little bit and really just be with those qualities and I'll be right back.

348
00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.340
