00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.720
Diane: How are you, I'm good. Did you

2
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930
Shawn Phalen: Happen to have group tonight or did you see a physician.

3
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.180
Diane: No. Okay.

4
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.540
Shawn Phalen: So did you check in early to

5
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.920
Diane: Yeah, I checked in. Well, I thought I had an appointment with john today to talk about something. So I checked in over two o'clock.

6
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.600
Okay. All right. But you didn't have an appointment with him.

7
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.680
Diane: I guess it wasn't like written down, but it was something that like we I can talk to him about tomorrow so

8
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.600
Diane: Yeah.

9
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.600
Shawn Phalen: OK. So, with this session. I just need to ask you, background questions.

10
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:28.830
Diane: Okay, and probably some of them you've been asked before. Okay, so it's just kind of like getting some background info from you.

11
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.810
Diane: All right.

12
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.920
Shawn Phalen: So tell me what what brought you to write her, like, why did you choose.

13
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:51.210
Diane: Well, um, I have had like chronic pain for for many years and I was taking pain to the for it. And I wanted to stop taking the pain pills. So I went to. I started going to

14
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.000
Diane: Suboxone group here locally.

15
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.270
Diane: And they recommended by heart, because they weren't going to get the doctor was leaving

16
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.510
Diane: They, they didn't. They didn't do like chronic pain groups and stuff like that. They actually I didn't get really much out of it. So,

17
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:24.780
Diane: Now that I've been in it. I'm learning so much more about how to deal with it because my my problem for the longest time is I always worried that the pain is going to get worse, which I know it will, and like I used to not be able to. I used to get like depressed and

18
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.170
Diane: Just like sad that you know sometimes my pain holding back from a lot of things. And it's just me and

19
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.990
Diane: My three kids, my youngest is five night. Second, is he six and then my daughter is 17

20
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.060
Diane: So I don't have time to release. You know, so I just get depressed and I get in

21
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.000
Diane: They didn't really help me with that. So okay, so that kind of way originally was because the doctor was leaving

22
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.310
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so are you on Suboxone right now.

23
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.100
Shawn Phalen: Yeah okay and tell me what is your chronic pain from

24
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.180
Diane: I have three discs out in my, in my neck. I have

25
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.140
Diane: Osteoarthritis scoliosis fibromyalgia and

26
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.990
Diane: I think that's it.

27
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.490
Diane: I've seen different doctors and I'm I haven't really accepted that I even have fibromyalgia, but I know I do because

28
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:34.320
Diane: I have all the symptoms of it and here recently I've, I've noticed like just certain points on my body that have never heard before, and never bothered me before, just

29
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:49.080
Diane: It's like radiating pain, my finger today hurt. And then my ankle last night and you know the Dr. Jackson helps a lot with that kind of stuff to with the insight timer in the chair yoga.

30
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.870
Shawn Phalen: And again, how long have you had the chronic pain.

31
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.880
Diane: And it's been about

32
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.040
Diane: 2000 and

33
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.950
Diane: Probably 2004

34
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:15.390
Diane: Is when it when I started having the pain and then like between 2005 and seven is when I started going to the doctor and and it's just gotten steadily worse Jensen.

35
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.450
Shawn Phalen: Did you have any kind of an accident, like

36
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:34.800
Diane: Honestly, I don't know what what how it originally started with the add one discount and then another one. And then these two are causing this third one to go out. So I think it's just over time. And I've had a lot of trauma.

37
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:47.850
Diane: In been in domestic violence, you know, relationships, and so it could have happened then. And I carry a lot of my stress in my neck right should even be. Yeah, I don't know, I just

38
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.100
Diane: Know what I'm not really stressed out my pain is way better. Right.

39
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.680
Shawn Phalen: And are you are you working now.

40
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.980
Diane: I don't currently work right now I take care of the kids, my son, my youngest is on the spectrum my six year old has ADHD.

41
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.610
Okay.

42
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.090
Diane: And how's your 17 year old. She's doing good. She, she's

43
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:27.330
Diane: My boys his dad got convicted and molesting her from the age of nine to 12 so that happened in 2016 when all like came out.

44
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.190
Diane: And

45
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.650
Diane: She's doing much better now minute counseling and

46
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:45.870
Diane: You know she's brand new stuff with positive people. And she's definitely definitely a lot stronger and I'm very proud of her. All right, good.

47
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.760
Shawn Phalen: And then for liquid depression. Have you ever had any suicidal attempts or suicidal thoughts.

48
00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:10.500
Diane: I've never had those at all. No, and I think that the main reason why is because of my kids like I just, I'm all they have, you know, so I've never really thought of that. I don't think that that's a solution for it. Plus, that's really selfish to do your family, you know,

49
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.050
Diane: Can you hear me.

50
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.660
Shawn Phalen: You broke up. I'm sorry.

51
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:41.520
Diane: I said, no, I have it. I think it's really selfish to do that to your family and I, I'm all my kids have so nothing like nothing. I don't think I've ever been that depressed, where I didn't want to live anymore. It's more like

52
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:59.550
Diane: Like hopelessness and like you know like I just don't see the light, but I haven't been like that since really Suboxone had changed my life. I think a lot of the reason why I was like that was because of the pain pills. Yes, I know. And how many

53
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.730
Shawn Phalen: Said, were you on the pain pills from like starting around

54
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.530
Diane: Oh, six. Yeah, it was often on from

55
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.980
Diane: About 2006 yes

56
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.990
Diane: And then, of course,

57
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.280
Diane: I would be I would get cortisone shots and I didn't really I didn't like being on them anyways and

58
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:35.760
Diane: Then I would get the cortisone shots and those ones mess me up and I just kind of gave up on doctors for a little bit, because I'm like, well, they're even helping me they're just making me worse. And so, but then I got, I had to get back on them because I had to seizures like

59
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:45.210
Diane: The first seizure. I had I tore my rotator cuff, because I just fell backwards. I don't know how I did it. And then I started on those again but

60
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:53.100
Diane: It was intermittent and they almost made me feel worse, like the longer I was on them, the more hurt. Yeah.

61
00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:03.570
Diane: So my friends told me about that program and she said that the Suboxone really helped her with her pain and the only way of course for me to get the Suboxone wants to do this program.

62
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.440
Diane: But it's already gone to me. I'm like, Well, maybe I can benefit from it but

63
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:18.900
Diane: I know I put I put a lot of work into it because I wanted to get better and I wanted to understand things more and, you know, but they didn't offer as much as I, I'd hoped.

64
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.880
Shawn Phalen: Um, so do you feel like you were abusing the pills or was it just you just wanted to get off of them.

65
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:37.110
Diane: I feel like my I feel like at one point I was, but I think it's because like I said, the pain was so bad, even with them.

66
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:45.180
Diane: That are within that I just felt like I needed to either take more and then of course when you get addicted to them. Your body goes through the withdrawal so

67
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:54.870
Diane: I'm like I at least need to take them today don't have the with jaws and I can function every day and then just became a cycle and the cycle. And I wanted to get out of it.

68
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.340
Shawn Phalen: And how long have you been on the Suboxone since

69
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.530
Diane: June of

70
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:10.590
Diane: Know, January, I don't remember January 2019 okay so like a year.

71
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.180
Diane: Yeah.

72
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.770
Shawn Phalen: Okay, good. And then any, um, this addiction run in your family at all or

73
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.920
Diane: No, I mean, my, my dad smoke pot any drink beer. But it wasn't

74
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.950
Diane: Nothing too bad. Okay.

75
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.910
Shawn Phalen: And then any Jeff siblings.

76
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:45.660
Diane: Yeah, I have a brother and older brother and are you guys close. Yeah, I mean, my mom and my brother are really close. It was just a three, pretty much, growing up. So, yeah.

77
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:52.410
Shawn Phalen: So then I'm with the domestic violence relationship. How long were you and not for

78
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.080
Diane: I was in

79
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.450
Diane: To back to back from around 2007

80
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:23.340
Diane: To 2012 is when I started my other one. So it's from 2007 to 2016 I was also molested by my my step dad and I hadn't I hadn't told anybody or really dealt with it at all. So my me and my daughter's dad got divorced

81
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:32.070
Diane: When it all kind of came out because I just, I couldn't handle it. I, I tried going to counseling and it was just, you know, not doing it for me and

82
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:40.530
Diane: Anyway, and then I have, of course, ended up in the abusive relationship. And then from there, my self esteem and self worth went more down and down and down and

83
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:48.840
Diane: I got with my boys his dad and then that one was like that one was horrible. That one felt more like a prison. And

84
00:10:50.400 --> 00:11:04.380
Diane: Yeah, but I got out of it only because of what he did to my daughter, like, you know, like I was forced out of it, which is good. As soon as you said something. I'm like, well, then we're calling the cops but

85
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.150
Diane: I was forced into it, which I think was a good thing because I don't think I'd ever do it on my own. I would have never left on my own.

86
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:19.650
Diane: Fortunate that it was it was that way. Yeah, are you married him no

87
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:27.630
Diane: Oh yeah we I was married to him. But we're not married. I'm not married now. Okay, see the Boise.

88
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.250
Shawn Phalen: Is your dad and do

89
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:40.620
Diane: Yeah, he was in prison for for a while, he actually gets out this month on the 11th, but he's not allowed to be in our county. I'm hoping that we don't have to see him. I'm trying to do the paperwork to

90
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.950
Diane: Terminate rights and change names and

91
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.490
Shawn Phalen: How long was he in for

92
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:55.350
Diane: Little four years. Little less than four years. He got sentenced to six and then

93
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:03.300
Diane: Went September 15 of 2016 units out this year on the 11th or this month on the 11th.

94
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:11.460
Diane: Okay, so not long enough. But you know when it matter what how how long he was in there, the damage was done right.

95
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:23.220
Shawn Phalen: And do you. So are there. Do you have any legal issues from any thing that you're still dealing with or

96
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:41.670
Diane: The only thing that I am dealing with this is the stuff with him and making sure that the divorce and everything is finalized before he gets out and that's it. I've never been in trouble. I've never gone to another. None of that probation jail, none of that. Okay. And any financial issues.

97
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:53.400
Diane: Not really. I mean I i I'm pretty responsible. I feel like okay I definitely am not going to be buying my own home anytime soon. But yeah.

98
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.560
Okay.

99
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:05.490
Diane: And what about friends. Do you have a good support group. I feel like I do. I'm really close with my mom and I have a few friends that I'm that I'm

100
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:15.300
Diane: I I'm more of like a I'd rather be home and not socializing and not just because people are very disappointing.

101
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:24.960
Diane: But, um, the, the few friends that I do have are positive. Like, I don't like to have any, any kind of negativity or drama, you know, still people

102
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:38.100
Diane: In my life and most of them have I've been friends with for a long time, and they've known you know everything that's gone on and it helped me supporting me through it. So yeah, I have a few really close friends and my mom.

103
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.450
Shawn Phalen: Does your mom lives near you. Are you guys close in proximity

104
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:51.000
Diane: Yes, she's about to about 20 miles from everybody else, cuz I live in gassy. But yeah, I see her at least three times a week and we talk every day.

105
00:13:53.850 --> 00:14:03.780
Shawn Phalen: That's good. And then you mentioned that you had done therapy in the past, but you didn't feel it was clicking for you.

106
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:23.340
Diane: Now, and I don't know if that was me because I wasn't really ready for it mentally and emotionally or if I just didn't feel comfortable with the people that I was talking to you because I'd even gone to counseling and rape crisis which helps with trauma and all that sexual abuse and

107
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.820
Diane: I was doing that for a while, but I just, I don't know, I just

108
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.360
Diane: I feel like sometimes

109
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.090
Diane: Maybe I'm like, No, I'm good. I don't need that. And then, I really do. But I always

110
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:48.540
Diane: Like daily I really try to to find something about my life or me that I want to uproot improve on or fix or, you know, I always try to do that because

111
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:58.470
Diane: I've because I've been in shitty situations and I know what it's like to be there. I'm so grateful for what I do have now and I really am just trying to just

112
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:05.430
Diane: Not just stay this way, but just keep going like this, you know, ready for that for the last

113
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:12.810
Diane: Forever. I've been just surviving and I don't want to do that, you know, yeah.

114
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:19.500
Shawn Phalen: So what kinda and so you're doing the you're doing the group right for

115
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:30.690
Diane: Yeah, and so how's that going for you. I like it a lot. I really do. I like Dr. Jackson I like I like everybody there. I feel really comfortable with it and

116
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:46.650
Diane: They always have a topic that I, you know, I'd like to learn about and then once you once a week. I have a babysitter. And I go do something like either with my mom or friends or me, my, my daughter will go to the movies or something and then

117
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:55.410
Diane: I always give myself like a day during the week and morning to where I go to the river or go on a hike or just get out

118
00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:04.320
Diane: Of out of my head, and you're even just driving and listening to music or something because I was it for a long time. I didn't. I was so focused on getting the house.

119
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:14.850
Diane: Perfect. I had like OCD for a while and just everything has to be in its place and organized and because it was the only thing I can control. I think right yeah so now

120
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:29.730
Diane: Now my my house is a lot more messy, which is good for me and and and I really had tried to slow down a lot because I really stress affects me pretty bad physically too. Right. Okay.

121
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:39.870
Shawn Phalen: So then, for your, for your little guy who's on the spectrum. Do you have services through his school. Yeah.

122
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:48.900
Diane: Through his school and there's a place called the regional center and they offer like behavior therapy respite care they

123
00:16:50.100 --> 00:17:07.470
Diane: What else do they have. Oh, the doctor. The doctor that does the assessments do is always helping me with things and could there's a, you know, once I get one thing under control. He moves on to something else. So it's constantly something, but it is getting a lot better and I am

124
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:23.310
Diane: Before I just felt like again like hopeless. Like, I don't know what to do. I don't know how to. So I really want to start going to school to learn more about it, to help him and me and then maybe eventually I can, you know, start working with kids like that, or even adults but

125
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:31.350
Diane: Yeah, it's been a process. Yeah, he get services here and at school or

126
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:40.500
Shawn Phalen: At home. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. So kind of like behaviors like modification at home and all that. Yes. Yeah.

127
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:55.530
Diane: Okay, but he's doing well. Yeah, he's doing much better. He was, he was nonverbal for a long time. So now that he's he's learning to talk a lot more he's he's able to express themselves a way differently so

128
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.030
Diane: Yeah.

129
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.090
Shawn Phalen: And then, okay, and then your other son has ADHD. Yeah.

130
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:13.140
Diane: Originally they put him on the spectrum. And then I'm like, it's let's do another assessment. And now, now he's the prescribed Ritalin, which I

131
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.430
Diane: I don't like so. Is he taking

132
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:32.250
Diane: What he had taken it for about three days and straight and every night he had had night sweats and nightmares. And so I went back to the doctor and he said that it wasn't from the medicine. So I tried it again, and it was

133
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:47.520
Diane: He had him again. So I took. I just took them off completely. And I'm going to try to get in touch with a holistic person or somebody who can tell me like what supplements. Maybe I could use for him instead of prescription meds because I do not want him on those huh

134
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:58.020
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and I do believe there are supplements that work well. Good. So that's, that's good. Yeah, that's a really good

135
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.770
That's a great option right

136
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:11.790
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so are you feeling like like the group is enough for you and

137
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.250
Or do you want any individual therapy at this time.

138
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:32.310
Diane: I feel like right now. I think the group is good, but like if I wanted to talk to you. Could I just make an appointment, I guess, nothing's going on where I maybe need your, your advice your help to work through something

139
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:39.210
Diane: Yeah, totally. Okay, yeah, it's absolutely available to you. So just always know that. Okay.

140
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.410
Shawn Phalen: If you're ever wanting to make an appointment, you just call the call center and they'll schedule you

141
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.520

Shawn Phalen: Okay, any, do you have any questions of me.
