00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.320
Coleman: That period, but it seemed like I don't know.

22
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.030
How

23
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.560

25
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.880
Dr. Figg: Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna stop your video and leave the sound going because I think or

26
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.390
Coleman: Maybe

27
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.230

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.710
Dr. Figg: I stopped your video there but you should still be able to see me, hopefully.

31
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.270
Dr. Figg: Okay, so you were telling me, but let's keep going. You're telling me that you're going through

32
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.230
Dr. Figg: Withdrawal

33
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.980
Dr. Figg: And a friend.

34
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.050
Dr. Figg: Gave you a sock. So, and that

35
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.740
Dr. Figg: Took away.

36
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.420
Dr. Figg: The discomfort draws

37
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.840
Coleman: All. Yeah. And the next day. It seemed like I don't know, maybe it wore off or something. But the sick came back.

38
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.530
Coleman: Then I would eventually used again just for me. My thing is

39
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.150
Coleman: And I want to get away from it so bad. Listen.

40
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.060
Coleman: Draw stuff is so scary. Just to go through this so miserable.

41
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.920
Dr. Figg: OK.

42
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.850
Dr. Figg: So the withdrawal is scary withdrawal keeps you from being able to quit and effectively. Is that accurate. Yeah.

43
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.440
Coleman: Yeah, okay.

44
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.480
Dr. Figg: When did you start using heroin.

45
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.850
Coleman: Well, the very, very first time was way back in 1990 and anyone like that.

46
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.150
Coleman: Then I got off.

47
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.960
Coleman: Then I got off about

48
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.860
Coleman: 2000 234 actually four years.

49
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.010
Coleman: And then

50
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.660
Coleman: I return. Unfortunately, back to the environment that I should never return to and eventually

51
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.840
Coleman: Got it. I got

52
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.610
Coleman: Back into the bad habits. I see. And

53
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.930
Dr. Figg: And when did you start using one

54
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.380
To

55
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.320
Dr. Figg: 2005 okay

56
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.610
Coleman: Has that been fairly low

57
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.080
Coleman: 2002 2000 2009 2008 or nine

58
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.120
Dr. Figg: So has that been fairly continuous for the last 11 or 12 years then

59
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:45.240
Dr. Figg: Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, and over that period of time has the amount of heroin, you're using been fairly consistent or has it been increasing over time.

60
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.650
Coleman: Well, it, it increased but it kicked out.

61
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.800
Coleman: Meaning when I started

62
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:15.360
Coleman: Back maybe one bag a day or so we do and then the tolerance level, get to the point where that's not enough, and then they got two, maybe three, four bags a day.

63
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.900
Coleman: And then kind of peeked out right there. Okay.

64
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.240
Coleman: SO WE'LL BE RIGHT NOW, IS THERE.

65
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.000
Dr. Figg: Anything about four bags of that recently.

66
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.100
Dr. Figg: Okay.

67
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.710
Dr. Figg: Is that all at once, or is it space throughout the day.

68
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.290
Coleman: Throughout okay

69
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.790
Dr. Figg: Do you sometimes use more than that.

70
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.210
Coleman: Rarely, rarely because I'm not a group gotta do. I'm by myself. What

71
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.940
Coleman: I say so. Yeah.

72
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.250
Dr. Figg: But no parties are dangerous, things like that.

73
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.040
Dr. Figg: Now, okay, all right.

74
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:05.580
Coleman: What functioning. I'm a functioning addict, which is I think the worst because you can kind of deal with life a little bit but

75
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.100
Coleman: That's the bad part about it.

76
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.990
Coleman: So it wasn't functioning.

77
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.910
Dr. Figg: Okay. And have you ever having had an overdose.

78
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.640

Coleman: I was supposed to wait until

165
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.160
Coleman: I was feeling, yo.

166
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.120
Dr. Figg: Yes.

167
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.110
Coleman: To take it. Gotcha. Okay. And I did. Okay.

168
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:51.090
Dr. Figg: So let's talk about the way bright side works so bright side is a recovery program that is structured around weekly support groups we

169
00:12:51.900 --> 00:13:07.530
Dr. Figg: Group people with other patients, people who have had similar issues with opiate addiction independence, who are in various stages of recovery to support each other, kind of like an NA meeting.

170
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:17.430
Dr. Figg: The group is about an hour long meets at the same time every week it's led by a therapist who has a history and experience with addiction treatment.

171
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:29.550
Dr. Figg: And it starts with a check in with your doctor to make sure your medications are squared away that you have an appropriate dose of Suboxone or buprenorphine.

172
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:37.230
Dr. Figg: That you're not in withdrawal, you're not having side effects that you have enough of it. Does that all make sense. That's the general

173
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:54.180
Dr. Figg: buprenorphine isn't opiate when we put people on buprenorphine. It's kind of like putting people on methadone. It's a substitution, but it's a substitution moving to something that is controlled and safer.

174
00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:03.540
Dr. Figg: buprenorphine. So if we think about heroin heroin gives you pleasure gives you for you. That's the high, it turns off.

175
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.060
Dr. Figg: And turns off your ability to stay awake and breathe. That's the overdose. Right.

176
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:16.800
Dr. Figg: buprenorphine is safer because it does not tend to have the high doesn't cause euphoria, it

177
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:25.110
Dr. Figg: We know exactly what's in it. Right. It's a pharmaceutical so it's consistent we we don't have to worry about it being mixed with something

178
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:40.620
Dr. Figg: And it does not turn off your breathing and does not turn off your ability to stay away the way heroin and methadone and Percocet and other things too. So it's safer because it's effectively very, very, very difficult to overdose on

179
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.800
Dr. Figg: So it has a much better safety profile.

180
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:58.470
Dr. Figg: It does suppress withdrawal that's important to you. I understand. And that's very important to maintain your recovery and because it helps suppress the withdrawal. It helps suppress cravings when when you take Suboxone and it

181
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:14.490
Dr. Figg: attaches to the receptor in your brain where works. It holds on tighter than other things so that if you're taking Suboxone and you do use something else like heroin, the heroin will essentially have no effect. So it helps eliminate the reward. Does that make sense.

182
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:17.970
Coleman: It does. I have a question.

183
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.080
Coleman: Yes, so

184
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.550
Coleman: it suppresses withdrawn.

185
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.120
Coleman: So the question is, and normally

186
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.800
Coleman: There's like

187
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.300
Coleman: Three or four days of just bad withdraws

188
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:44.070
Coleman: When I'm not using right so if if Suboxone is replaced or used on those three or four days.

189
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:53.220
Coleman: Whenever I stopped using this Matson that means the howling would be out of my system right

190
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.380
Coleman: Oh, what

191
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.150
Coleman: What go right back to

192
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:05.250
Dr. Figg: Know, so Suboxone is taken as a daily medication, kind of like if someone kind of high blood pressure. We put them on medication to protect their heart and brain from

193
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:19.920
Dr. Figg: The ramifications, the consequences of that. And it's not just a one, you feel like it. It's a daily medication Suboxone is used in the same way daily medication to help encourage people to continue in their recovery.

194
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.310
Coleman: But it is addictive.

195
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:35.970
Dr. Figg: It is an opiate and if you suddenly stopped taking Suboxone you'll go into withdrawal, the same as you work with heroin tends to be a mild or withdrawal, but you would be dependent on it. Yeah.

196
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.850
Coleman: Okay, good.

197
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:55.860
Dr. Figg: But, similar to the way we use methadone to help people stop using other things. It's a substitution, because it's it's felt to be safer, it reduces people's rates of death. It reduces rate people's rates of relapse reduces people's rates of overdose.

198
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:02.100
Dr. Figg: And that's what we care about helping people live longer, healthier lives.

199
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:04.650
Coleman: Yeah.

200
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.920
Coleman: Does that make sense, yes. Okay. All right.

201
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.730
Dr. Figg: So what I would suggest we do is to

202
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:23.340
Dr. Figg: Find a group in the schedule. If you're interested in stopping heroin and switching to Suboxone

203
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:39.180
Dr. Figg: With the idea to maintain you on Suboxone for a period of time and then it your decision and nature decision to taper you slowly to help you encourage to help encourage your recovery and to

204
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:48.270
Dr. Figg: Support you then what I think we should do is have the care coordinators set you up into a group that works with your schedule.

205
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:54.780
Dr. Figg: And I would write you a prescription for sandbox. So you should have received an email that has

206
00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:02.970
Dr. Figg: Some materials on how induction works. What we do is we start with a half of a tablet or fill depending on the form that your

207
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.140
Dr. Figg: insurance cover sometimes their tablets. Sometimes our film, but either way.

208
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:16.050
Dr. Figg: You know shoe it, you know, swallow it, you know, break it out you don't melt it. You don't do anything else with it. All you do is put it under your tongue, let it dissolve entirely

209
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:25.770
Dr. Figg: Okay, that takes usually five to 10 minutes and you talked about taking it that way, one time and taking it the wrong way, another time. So that's the way it's taken and then

210
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:41.460
Dr. Figg: We start with a half of the dose and you would do that tomorrow morning, and preferably probably tomorrow afternoon we want it to be at least 24 hours after your last use of heroin.

211
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:55.980
Dr. Figg: To make sure that you are in withdrawal because like I said buprenorphine grabs on tighter. So it'll kick something else out and put you into withdrawal. If you take it too early. So we wanted to be a little bit uncomfortable when you take that first so that it makes you feel better.

212
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:06.090
Dr. Figg: And you would take a half dose, you would wait an hour if you're not feeling better, you would take another half dose. If you're feeling better, you would stop and that would be your consistent dose.

213
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:16.530
Dr. Figg: And you would slowly go up on the dose hour by hour that tomorrow that first day until you are no longer in withdrawal. Does that make sense.

214
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.870
Coleman: Yes.

215
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:27.450
Dr. Figg: It was only you know whether you're in withdrawal, you know, your pattern does so. So you have to be able to do it half a dose of the time. Okay.

216
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.130
Yes.

217
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.570
Coleman: All right.

218
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:43.230
Dr. Figg: And then on a weekly basis we meet you have a therapist has a topic, you have a support group to help support you and you support them and you can share with them.

219
00:19:43.890 --> 00:20:00.960
Dr. Figg: When you're ready, and and the encouraged by other people who are in recovery, you would have weekly meetings with your doctor to make sure that from a medical standpoint, we're supporting as much as we can in recovery and we would kind of adapt the plan number time

220
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.810
Coleman: Okay.

221
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.280
Coleman: Does that sound like an

222
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:05.970
Dr. Figg: Okay plan.

223
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.940
Coleman: Sounds like a great plan.

224
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:23.250
Dr. Figg: Awesome. Okay, so the one I'm going to have what we're gonna do is, I'm going to write your prescription. It's going to go to your pharmacy, which, let's make sure we have a file is Walgreens.

225
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.580
Dr. Figg: On Avenue 48, is that correct

226
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:37.080
Dr. Figg: Yes. Wonderful. Okay, I'm going to send a prescription for you. We're going to get you set up into support group. I'll have, I think you were working with RJ where I go RJ

227
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.350
Yes.

228
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:48.090
Dr. Figg: I'll have them reach out to you to set you up into a group and we'll kind of go from there and make sure everything's taken care of. And it looks like they already sent orders for you to do some labs.

229
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:49.680
Dr. Figg: Okay.

230
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.380
Dr. Figg: Okay. All right.

231
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.100
Dr. Figg: That's about it. Do you have any questions before we go.

232
00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.040
Coleman: So what's my next step.

233
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:12.390
Dr. Figg: So your next thing is the the care coordinators are going to give you a call back to get you set up into a group that works with your schedule and I and then in in an hour, hour and a half or so you're going to go to the pharmacy.

234
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:18.390
Dr. Figg: To pick up your Suboxone and then you'll take your first dose tomorrow. Okay.

235
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.360
Coleman: Okay. OK, I will be able to get today.

236
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.250
Dr. Figg: Yes, that's correct.

237
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.390
Coleman: Guys, great, even without will have to pay for today.

238
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.720
Dr. Figg: Probably it'll be at the pharmacy. I don't know that it costs like that, that'll depend on

239
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.230
Coleman: So, okay, that's wonderful.

240
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:46.920
Dr. Figg: Alright, Coleman. It was nice to talk to you today. I'm glad we got to communicate here, despite the video problems and and I look forward to hopefully talking with you again in the future. Okay.

241
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.720
Coleman: Hey, thank you.

242
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.230
Dr. Figg: All right, appreciate my pleasure. Take care. Have a great day. Bye bye.
