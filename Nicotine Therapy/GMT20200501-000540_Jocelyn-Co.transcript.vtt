Anthony Garcia: But as far as having a relationship.

273
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.930

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.750
Anthony Garcia: For my daughter enough

275
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:52.380

Yes.

281
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:20.610

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.840
Anthony Garcia: She's there.

283
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.900

Jocelyn Corrales: And sometimes you know prayer helps you know try to ease your anger, you know, as you know, you're a Christian and you know it's better to forgive others.

289
00:23:51.300 --> 00:24:00.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Even if they don't ask forgiveness. Try to forgive them in your heart. Although things are not forgotten. But, you know, try to forgive, at least.

348
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.730
Anthony Garcia: Proud of

349
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.470
Anthony Garcia: What I've

350
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.240
Anthony Garcia: Accomplished and

351
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:36.120
Anthony Garcia: Yes, what I what I've done. I know he hasn't easily show it or or express it.

352
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.580
Anthony Garcia: But as far as him.

353
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.680
Anthony Garcia: still willing to to offer that

354
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.290
Anthony Garcia: I believe, yeah.

355
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:53.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, there are actually some type of people, especially males know they're not that they're not that emotional as mothers.

356
00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:05.040
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, and mother emotion you know when mother when they see their kids doing something good. They're very expressive very vocal about it, but sometimes mostly fathers

357
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:14.820
Jocelyn Corrales: They are very quiet about it but you know deep inside. They're very proud of their children also there maybe they're not just that good enough of expressing it.

358
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried telling your dad you love him.

359
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:26.970
Anthony Garcia: I used to, but it to me and what he's

360
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.230
Anthony Garcia: Learned before that.

361
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.900
Anthony Garcia: It kind of makes him feel comfortable and stuff so

362
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.290
Jocelyn Corrales: I respect that. Yeah, it's

363
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.830
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, it's actually cheesy. It's like

364
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:46.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Why are you telling me that. So, something like that, it's you know i know i i can feel you. I know it's a male thing and the, you know,

365
00:29:46.650 --> 00:30:01.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Males are not really that expressive, you know, they don't like you know hearing so so things like that. But, you know, although he doesn't like a, you know, trying to tell him once in a while or title at him feel that you love him, you know,

366
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:13.230
Anthony Garcia: I try to do that by I make them food a lot. I always make sure his bed and I will check on him. I'm always checking in his room.

367
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.660
Anthony Garcia: To make sure he's okay so

368
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.410
Anthony Garcia: I think that gives them a sense of that love that.

369
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:20.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Security, yes.

370
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:27.510
Jocelyn Corrales: Or even if you don't tell him that that I love you, or you can only sell him because sometimes you know it's really good to him.

371
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:37.230
Jocelyn Corrales: I love you, Dad. So sometimes it feels, it feels weird. When I tell him that that always remember that I love you. Something like that. That would be better than telling him I love you, Dad.

372
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.440
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, because there's times where, like,

373
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:42.420
Anthony Garcia: Like

374
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:48.930
Anthony Garcia: I guess it was a time where it was kind of more of a funeral for one of our family members and

375
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.410
Anthony Garcia: We're all there. And I remember giving my dad and I

376
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.090
Anthony Garcia: Were both like love you.

377
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.370
Anthony Garcia: Love you, son, and

378
00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.270
Anthony Garcia: I think that was the only time we said that but

379
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:06.930
Anthony Garcia: I think it was like more comfortable because it was in that moment, it wasn't emotionally

380
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.120
Anthony Garcia: And we just kind of quick so

381
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:22.110
Jocelyn Corrales: And it all happens when there's Elisa funeral. You know, that's why I've been telling you that at least tell him. Do not tell him that because he doesn't want to hear that you're you telling him that data levy way to tell him that

382
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:33.030
Jocelyn Corrales: That always remember that I love you said that he would feel, you know, sometimes there is that, you know, when you tell someone that you love them or assure them that you love them. It always reminds them that

383
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:47.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh am loved by my center. He's always reminded that he's been loved, something like that, especially for especially for older people. Sometimes they want, you know, although detail, you know. Oh, stop telling me that, but deep inside. They want to hear that.

384
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:57.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Not every day, but maybe from time to time, just a gentle reminder that you tell him that you, you know, Dad always remember that I love you. Something like that.

385
00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:03.120
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, cuz my daughter, like when I go to give her a hug and

386
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.070
Anthony Garcia: A kiss on the forehead. She

387
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.510
Anthony Garcia: Gets all like he doesn't want to, you know, the

388
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.010
TV.

389
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.320
Anthony Garcia: To it.

390
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.360
Jocelyn Corrales: And it was like he's like

391
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:20.280
Anthony Garcia: Pushing back like at first you like just that's just the way

392
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.180
Anthony Garcia: To get into it and I think they know

393
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:30.900
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yes. Teenagers are like that, especially now, she's a theme.

394
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:39.570
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, but try to continue on doing that do not stop it because she will miss it, you know, or she might, you know,

395
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:48.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Grow up you know like if you try to avoid when she's telling you not to do it, you know, she will grow up that you know

396
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:58.110
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, daddy start hugging me anymore, something like that. So try to do it. Also from time to time. If you have been doing that as a habit continue on doing it, even if she doesn't like it you know

397
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:10.380
Jocelyn Corrales: I also do that to my daughter something she you know you know she sometimes screens in one stop that. But, you know, sometimes she would tell me, Mom, you're not hugging me anymore, you know,

398
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:11.490
Anthony Garcia: So it's like

399
00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:23.250
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like they miss it, you know, although they cringe. They hate it in, you know, but you know later on they would like hugging them anymore. So something like that. So it's good to make it a habit. If they're used to it.

400
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:32.700
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's normal. If they don't feel bad if they're like that you know you've been you've been a teenager once and you know how it feels.

401
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:34.410
Anthony Garcia: I do

402
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:45.390
Jocelyn Corrales: And sometimes she could be because she's already a teenager and they're already body changes hormonal changes hormonal surges and everything else she tends to be very

403
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.300
Jocelyn Corrales: Tends to get angry easily

404
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:59.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Had some mood swings and try to understand here. Yeah, try to understand her and explain to her.

405
00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.050
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, are you also into reading or not into reading

406
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.600
Anthony Garcia: Me, I read a lot

407
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:19.890
Jocelyn Corrales: You could also try reading about adolescence. You know what changes, they are going through so that you could also explain to her what she's going through so that you know she would understand

408
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:33.510
Jocelyn Corrales: And instead of rebelling. You know, sometimes teenagers, they tend to become rebellious because of you know the bodily changes that they have the physical changes that they have. So it's not only physical but also emotional and also hormonal

409
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.090
Jocelyn Corrales: So that's why they're very eerie to

410
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:44.460
Jocelyn Corrales: irritate to in, you know, gets angry easily. So try to talk to them and you know

411
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:51.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Read something about it so that he could explain to her that those changes are normal. But, you know,

412
00:34:53.640 --> 00:35:11.850
Jocelyn Corrales: Always be yourself, you know, even if you are angry. Try not to be, you know, try to adjust to it. I understand what you're feeling so that you know she would be comforted. Instead of, you know, lashing out to her when she's angry also. So it's better to try to understand her also

413
00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:26.460
Jocelyn Corrales: So you mentioned that you're working. So with regards to financial, are you able to provide your needs and able to pay your bills and you do managing of your bills. Yeah.

427
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.000
Anthony Garcia: So you

428
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.940
Anthony Garcia: Stuck in my almost like a

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:52.920
Anthony Garcia: Disorder.

430
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:57.030
Jocelyn Corrales: I have to. Well, I don't care about the compulsive disorder.

431
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:08.610
Jocelyn Corrales: You just want to be safe, you know, just to be sure, because you're, you know, you come, you came from work and you come home and you don't want that disease coming home with you and affect your father and your daughter.

432
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:09.750
Yes.

433
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:11.970
Anthony Garcia: COPD.

434
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.230
Anthony Garcia: Like every

435
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:13.500
Day.

436
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:20.100
Anthony Garcia: If he was to get this disease jazz chances would be very slim, you know, and I

437
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:32.130
Anthony Garcia: I wouldn't know how to look. I don't know, like how I am it out by a blade myself and then I pride fall right back into square one. Again, and that

438
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.070
Anthony Garcia: Was why I do my best to keep safe.

439
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.150
Anthony Garcia: Yes, make sure everybody's taken care of, you know,

440
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.400

Anthony Garcia: And my dad doesn't go out right

444
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:55.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I think it's better for your debt to stay in instead of going out, even if it's more just tell him that

445
00:37:55.410 --> 00:38:07.770
Jocelyn Corrales: That you can just go to the backyard and walk around there. Walk around the house and go back inside this not go out of the house just reading the premises of the house. It's not safe, especially for older people.

446
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.090
Yeah.

447
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:18.330
Jocelyn Corrales: So with regards to not working well for you. Could you tell me what's not working well for your activities of daily living.

448
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.080
Jocelyn Corrales: You've mentioned to me what's working out for you.

449
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.730
Jocelyn Corrales: And maybe the cramping. Other than that.

450
00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:38.820
Anthony Garcia: That's tolerable right now there's really nothing that's that bad, but I did we do have a friend right now who's homeless.

451
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.460
Anthony Garcia: And then he's

452
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.130
Anthony Garcia: Doesn't want to

453
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:52.920
Anthony Garcia: Like, do anything. And we're trying to help him. And it's just becoming like almost

454
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.000
Anthony Garcia: A HASSLE like a burden and

455
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:04.020
Anthony Garcia: Nobody wants to help them and it's like they're all like leaving it up to me.

456
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:09.030
Anthony Garcia: It's kind of stressful.

457
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.780
I guess.

458
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.360
Anthony Garcia: I have my own problems have my own life. I have a kid out of taking care of

459
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.530
Anthony Garcia: Trying to take care of a grown man.

460
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.510
Anthony Garcia: Uh huh, is more than I can handle and I'm

461
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:33.690
Anthony Garcia: Trying to let them know without hurting his feelings and what I am helping him still, I just can't do it.

462
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:46.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Says he wants me. Yes. Yes. Just let him just let him understand, you know, you also have your own life. And I think he also knows that you also went through some difficulties before and you're still, you know,

463
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:57.510
Jocelyn Corrales: You're still working on it just explained to him so that you won't get offended, but still continue on helping him as much as you can, but not

464
00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:16.080
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, you, you, you have your daughter. And you also have your father. So you can, you know, serve all of them at the same time. So just just explain to him that you also have a family that you need to take care of and but you can also help you from time to time when he needs help something

465
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:17.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes.

466
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:26.880
Jocelyn Corrales: Because if you focus all of your energy on him, you get tired and you are not even sure if he's also helping himself.

467
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:34.590
Anthony Garcia: Yeah. And then if I spent on managing him letting my daughter.

468
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.260
Anthony Garcia: My NFL and they need

469
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.030
Jocelyn Corrales: And yourself also

470
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.060
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, and that's what's important right now.

471
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:46.500
Anthony Garcia: It almost feels selfish, but

472
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.110
Anthony Garcia: It's not I

473
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Know that's really not. I don't think it's selfish.

474
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:54.840
Jocelyn Corrales: I don't think I'm selfish.

475
00:40:54.870 --> 00:41:10.170
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, that is a nice to feel that way like guilty when me that you know sometimes people have their problems and I can't get involved in that. And yeah, only

476
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.420
Anthony Garcia: Offer as much help as I have to offer.

477
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:16.740
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, come on.

478
00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:25.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, just offer what you can offer to a person that needs help, but not all, because you also have your own problems.

479
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:36.030
Jocelyn Corrales: You have your doctor to say yes, you're like, you have your daughter to take care of you have your father to take care of you also have yourself to take care of all the him but you know

480
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:48.930
Jocelyn Corrales: You are also helping him in your own little ways or probably in big ways that is also helpful. So, that is also a good help in that. That doesn't mean you know nothing. It means something also

481
00:41:49.380 --> 00:42:05.790
Jocelyn Corrales: That you are trying to help that is only up to him if he wants to help himself or not. Sometimes that's why you don't need to give in. Because if you give in your all and you neglect your daughter. You get they'd like your father and he doesn't do anything about himself, you lost it all.

482
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:07.800
Anthony Garcia: Yeah.

483
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.510
Anthony Garcia: You mean Lucy, what was the point

484
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:19.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes, yes. It's like you, we said, you will get frustrated because you know you wasted all your energy to him and he doesn't want to help himself.

485
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:38.340
Jocelyn Corrales: And you've mentioned that you know he he he's dependent on you. He's not trying to wake up. He's trying to get up. He's not trying to get on his feet, try to just try to encourage him first, so that you know it's very hard to help someone who doesn't want to help himself to

486
00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:45.060
Anthony Garcia: And then my cousin homes, the shop and he's also friends with this guy and

487
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.850
Anthony Garcia: He's actually letting him live in our tire shop.

488
00:42:48.480 --> 00:43:05.070
Anthony Garcia: So at night on a, like a little hot so as soon as I get to work in the morning. This is the first person I see. And right away. He's expecting things, you know, like, Can you take me to the store. Can you do this, I need to do this.

489
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.650
Jocelyn Corrales: But you're also working less. He also help in the store in the time

490
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.340
Anthony Garcia: He does not happy at all. He sits there all day long.

491
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.550
Anthony Garcia: He's maybe he's not feeling good, you know,

492
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:26.430
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you know maybe you could ask, you know, you could talk about this with you and your cousin, because it's, you know, you would get mad if it's only you so

493
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:35.310
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could talk about that maybe he could help a little in the shop so that you know maybe he always feel style because he always sleeps.

494
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.590
Anthony Garcia: I just, I have to apply for Medicaid

495
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:41.790
Anthony Garcia: So,

496
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:50.910
Anthony Garcia: He's got medical insurance. We're trying to apply for him so you can get like maybe a voucher or something for a couple weeks at a motel well

497
00:43:51.930 --> 00:44:00.120
Anthony Garcia: I've he does tree services and stuff. So like trees and change them down and I've helped them make signs and stuff. We put them up.

498
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:11.730
Anthony Garcia: It's just like with somebody calls and step aside almost where he's trying to ignore it. And I told him earlier that I can help you a little bit but

499
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.380
Anthony Garcia: You're a grown man.

500
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:16.380
Anthony Garcia: You need to figure it out yourself.

501
00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:17.880
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, because that's what

502
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:19.890
Anthony Garcia: I had to do you know

503
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:20.850
Anthony Garcia: Yes.

504
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:28.800
Jocelyn Corrales: I couldn't rely on everybody. He could not stand up if you keep feeding him things he could not stand up on his own.

505
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:42.090
Jocelyn Corrales: He will become very dependent on everyone. If he did that, you know, if you keep on feeding. It's like, you cannot, you cannot always feed. Amen. You know, teach him how to fish so that he will also learn how to

506
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.980
Jocelyn Corrales: Get up there because

507
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:58.860
Jocelyn Corrales: He wants to be able to help him. So, you know, you can't help him if he's not able to help himself. It's, you know, your help your help towards him. Your cousin's help towards him would not be very helpful if he himself doesn't know how to help himself.

508
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.770
Anthony Garcia: And it seems like he gets angry.

509
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.140
Anthony Garcia: When we can't, you know, and

510
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:18.090
Jocelyn Corrales: You know that's that's always part of the process. You know when you you you think about the acceptance process before he's able to accept his he's in. He's still in the angry stage.

511
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.080
Anthony Garcia: Reason I give them the benefit of the doubt.

512
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:26.160
Anthony Garcia: He's been

513
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:38.490
Jocelyn Corrales: Still in the anger stage and he's still not into acceptance, he's, he hasn't accepted the fact that he's already homeless or he's already in that situation, sometimes

514
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:54.900
Jocelyn Corrales: It takes time. He has to be in that, you know, once he is able to accept that he's already in that stage, you know, he could at least slowly get up. But if it's still on the anger stage, you know, you could at least help him realize that, you know,

515
00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:02.220
Jocelyn Corrales: This is very difficult. I know and i know i think it's very stressful to you, but try to hang on it, you know.

516
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:13.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Always think about your daughter. Think about your dad think your daughter and your dad as your inspiration, pray for your friend also not only for yourself. I know.

517
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:21.390
Jocelyn Corrales: I know you feel very blessed because you have your family, but he has no one else he doesn't have a family because no family is helping him but

518
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:33.420
Jocelyn Corrales: All these friends are helping him. So, be grateful to the Lord, that you are, you have a family that you could always go to, but he doesn't have one so also pray for your friend, but no.

519
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:37.200
Jocelyn Corrales: Try to help him emotionally not only

520
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:50.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Not only feed him, you know, not only give him so many things if he's angry just accept the fact that he's angry. You know, you could not please everyone. You don't need to please him everything you

521
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.670
Anthony Garcia: Need to give him and I'm trying to teach of things that I've learned

522
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:59.040
Anthony Garcia: And I know right now is that that angry stage. So everything I'm telling him.

523
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.970
Jocelyn Corrales: It's like coming here and getting out of the other

524
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:08.700
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, but one one day I'm going to keep cuz I'm going to keep on doing it.

525
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.360
Anthony Garcia: And one day it'll get stuck in there.

526
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.970
Anthony Garcia: And when it does it. Hopefully it'll help

527
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, it will it will, you know, always remind him of that.

528
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.490
Jocelyn Corrales: And it's good that you're trying to help out your friend.

529
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:29.340
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I find it, but I don't know.

530
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.540
Anthony Garcia: Where I feel better about myself. Also,

531
00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.980
Anthony Garcia: When I know that

532
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.680
Anthony Garcia: I have the ability to help somebody

533
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.830
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, without it hurting myself, you know, without it.

534
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:46.230
Anthony Garcia: affecting me financially mostly physically. I can do this now and

535
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.760
Anthony Garcia: I'm very proud of myself.

536
00:47:48.330 --> 00:48:02.550
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, yeah. Because you know you you could see that you're a better person now than you were before, because you are able to help someone without you getting very anxious very mad or anything else, you know,

537
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:05.160
Anthony Garcia: Or expecting something in return.

538
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:12.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, these didn't expect something in return, because you know for a while, someone's trying to call me.

539
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.610
Jocelyn Corrales: I'm dropping the call. It's my ad calling me. And in a way, she's calling me

540
00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:33.030
Jocelyn Corrales: As this call her later to worry about her. Okay. So with regards to your spiritual self you you mentioned that you're not going to church and I think maybe you should try

541
00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:35.100
Jocelyn Corrales: For a while,

542
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.660
Anthony Garcia: If I can definitely fit it into my schedule because my schedule.

543
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.030
Anthony Garcia: I'm not going to say, I have the busiest schedule.

544
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:45.480
Jocelyn Corrales: And then, but

545
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.960
Anthony Garcia: I might be able to put an hour in

546
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.000
Anthony Garcia: But

547
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:55.080
Anthony Garcia: Right now.

548
00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:03.930
Anthony Garcia: This, this is just like it's hard it's gonna be hard to fit it in because Sunday is very fast.

549
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:09.180
Anthony Garcia: Fast day trying to fit everything in that one day.

550

Jocelyn Corrales: I heard it also from other patients, they have online school here or there.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.800
Anthony Garcia: I am keeping up with that like keeping track of work.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.360
Jocelyn Corrales: On the weekend.

558
00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:34.320

571
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:25.770
Anthony Garcia: This type of stuff, I guess.

572
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:41.370

574
00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:59.310
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're worried because through relationship, you're still working out and having a better relationship with your daughters mothers.

575
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:04.800
Anthony Garcia: Um, one of them. I'm already doing well so

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:05.670
Anthony Garcia: And I don't

Anthony Garcia: Yeah, and then

583
00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:35.460
Jocelyn Corrales: That kind of relationship, you know, that's the kind of relationship. I mean, just like our friend relationship, a healthy relationship not necessarily getting back together relationship that's, you know, being friendly and working out things for the sake of your daughter Stephanie.

584
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:53.610
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, because when I do see her. It's just, it's great. I mean, it's like one of the best things I could always do. And it's not just her because a lot of times, her sisters who aren't related to me at all.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:54.180
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm.

590
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.110

594
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:21.450
Anthony Garcia: These things

595
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:25.350
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you do that on a weekly basis before

596
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.760
Anthony Garcia: Maybe after every Sunday.

597
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:39.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Maybe when the pandemic is over. I hope it would be over soon. Maybe you could do that as a regular thing you know bonding with your

598
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:51.510
Jocelyn Corrales: younger daughter and your elder daughter and, you know, the youngest daughter's mother and kids because you mentioned that they like you know hanging out with each other.

599
00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:55.110
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, we always go to things and it says fun

600
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:57.060
Anthony Garcia: We don't need nobody out

601
00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:03.330
Anthony Garcia: Yes, they really show a lot of love to me also just like

602
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:14.340
Anthony Garcia: You could, you could tell that it's real, it's, it's not like they tried to do it every bill when they're mad at me, they show it, but

603
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:22.170
Anthony Garcia: You can just tell that they all care about needs just nice to have that many people care about you, you know,

604
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:24.720
Anthony Garcia: There's no history.

605
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.390
Anthony Garcia: I should have realized that before China to take advantage of it and

606
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:34.020
Anthony Garcia: Now things are just starting to be better.

607
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:35.640
Anthony Garcia: learning a lot of things.

608
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:43.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, and it's better to give rather than, you know, and when you give do not expect something in return, you know, at least.

609
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:51.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Do it because you love it, do it because you like it did because everybody's having fun and you're having fun and you feel good.

610
00:53:51.810 --> 00:54:06.780
Jocelyn Corrales: But try not to expect something in return, so that it won't hurt you in the end. But, you know, as you see, you also received some love from them. And that's also a good, that's a good thing already that you receive a little you know love from them or little

611
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:14.640
Jocelyn Corrales: The appreciate and they like you know hanging out with you with your kids in me. That's good. That's a good thing to do.

612
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:35.070
Anthony Garcia: And and I used to be afraid to to say no, I need time for myself and now I'm doing that I'm able to take time for myself and do things for myself, buy things for myself and not feel bad about it and

613
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:37.860
Anthony Garcia: I do that once in a while to

614
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.260
Anthony Garcia: I've learned that with when also like you said earlier, I gotta remember my dad would always gotta remember self.

615
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.760
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Do not forget

616
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.930
Anthony Garcia: Doing that.

617
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.720
Anthony Garcia: And it's that's been really working for me.

618
00:54:53.880 --> 00:55:10.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Because sometimes when you think about other people, you know, you tend to the neck about yourself. So, always, always, don't forget about yourself. No, it's, it's not bad, thinking about other people, especially if they're a family, but always think about yourself and take care of yourself first.

619
00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:19.560
Jocelyn Corrales: So let me share my screen to you so that you'll be able to see and some plans that I had

620
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:27.810
Jocelyn Corrales: Just I'll just edit this later because I placed everything here and what's working well.

621
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:37.080
Jocelyn Corrales: And I'll just gonna change it later because with regards to some other areas there are no problems with your spiritual self. You just need to, you know,

622
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:47.070
Jocelyn Corrales: You've mentioned that you're going, you're attending TV services, but not regularly, maybe we do it on a regular basis. Instead of, you know,

623
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:56.610
Jocelyn Corrales: Doing it sometimes maybe doing it every Sunday for the sunday service. I didn't do it there, but I put it here on the

624
00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:01.020
Jocelyn Corrales: Continue with the Sunday TV services.

625
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.630
Jocelyn Corrales: continue attending

626
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:08.730
Jocelyn Corrales: Read this Sunday TV services.

627
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.590
Jocelyn Corrales: I'll just rephrase its leader on on a regular

628
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:32.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Basis and continue on with your reading you know Bible you read your emails. I have no problems, maybe read your exercise instead of doing it once in a while. Maybe you can do it every day. If you're not able to exercise at least do the stretching everybody

629
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:34.050
Okay.

630
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.910
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, I do want to try to get

631
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.890
Anthony Garcia: My routine, a little bit more consistent

632
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:48.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. Because sometimes, especially if you're already very tired.

633
00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:54.540
Jocelyn Corrales: And you're not able to do exercise. Try to do at least stretching

634
00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Before you go to bed.

635
00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:57.510
Or

636
00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:00.060
Jocelyn Corrales: Before you take a shower.

637
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:08.790
Jocelyn Corrales: And vinegars too sleepy, you have no problem sleeping able to sleep.

638
00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.530
Jocelyn Corrales: Early

639
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:21.240
Jocelyn Corrales: At around 10am it's good that you have a routine because you know you get to do a lot of things when you wake up early and you sleep early if you sleep early, you get up early.

640
00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:30.210
Jocelyn Corrales: Because if you sleep late you also get up late and it's good if you wake up early, you, you're, you're able to do a lot of things.

641
00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:33.780
Anthony Garcia: And more. Yeah. And then I get to get up and

642
00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.430
Anthony Garcia: Have my coffee and

643
00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:40.260
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, take that stuff. I don't try to be rushing to get to work.

644
00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:52.680
Jocelyn Corrales: Have you tried eating at least, at least you know you mentioned, you know, sometimes it's hard to cook in the morning, try to eat. Maybe snacks or sandwich every breakfast trainer to miss your request.

645
00:57:55.110 --> 00:58:00.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, I'll put that here and try not to miss breakfast.

646
00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:08.340
Jocelyn Corrales: Or you could make a sandwich with you and bring it with you to work so that you could eat there.

647
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:16.950
Jocelyn Corrales: You know snacking so that you won't feel hungry. So try not to miss breakfast. But are you able to eat lunch on time when you're at work.

648
00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:22.770
Anthony Garcia: When we are able to eat lunch we use the do eat lunch on time like

649
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.040
Anthony Garcia: Around anywhere from 1230 to 130

650
00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:27.600
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, that's good, that's good.

651
00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.230
Anthony Garcia: We don't

652
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:32.220
Anthony Garcia: We don't do it every day. Some days are very busy and we're not able to

653
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.730
Jocelyn Corrales: You're not able to eat lunch.

654
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.220
Anthony Garcia: On Sundays. Yes.

655
00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.000
Jocelyn Corrales: On some days. Some days in at work.

656
00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:53.670
Anthony Garcia: Maybe Monday was a good day lunch period wasn't very busy and we're able to get lunch, but say that Tuesday was just so busy all day.

657
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:58.470
Anthony Garcia: We just we just couldn't have the time for, you know, that's so

658
00:58:58.770 --> 00:58:59.490
Anthony Garcia: I mean it's not

659
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.860
Anthony Garcia: I can't say it's always Monday or it's all

660
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.430
Anthony Garcia: Day.

661
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:03.780
Anthony Garcia: It'd be any day.

662
00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:04.650
Everyone

663
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.900
Anthony Garcia: Every week goes

664
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.840
Anthony Garcia: Sometimes not sometimes

665
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:15.870
Jocelyn Corrales: But you also try to eat after work, just in case you're done with anything there.

666
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:19.620
Anthony Garcia: After work I come home and where we didn't eat dinner, you know,

667
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:21.630
Jocelyn Corrales: So,

668
00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.250
Anthony Garcia: I don't know.

669
00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:39.480
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I think that's the reason why. Maybe you should try not to miss your breakfast, maybe bring try to eat a sandwich or cereal and or try to bring a sandwich with you. So that just in case you missed your lunch, you know, you're not that very hungry.

670
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:53.790
Jocelyn Corrales: So try not to miss your breakfast, because we lunch. I could not control it, because it depends on the on the crowd or and the customers that are coming in. So maybe I could just suggest, try not to miss breakfast.

671
00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:06.810
Jocelyn Corrales: And continue attending the services on a regular basis. Did I miss anything, or do you want something included. I also included here bundling with kids and your ex kids.

672
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:10.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Axis children.

673
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Every Sunday.

674
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:18.840
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe after the pandemic Breton math right now. Is she far away.

675
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:21.540
Anthony Garcia: No, no.

676
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:23.040
Jocelyn Corrales: That's

677
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.330
Anthony Garcia: A 20 minute drive

678
01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:37.860
Jocelyn Corrales: That's good, that's good, that's good that's feasible. Maybe, maybe not. Now, oh, maybe you could try try know you have a zoom application, you could try zooming with your daughter.

679
01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:44.610
Anthony Garcia: We actually tried. We haven't tried zoom yet because I don't know.

680
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:49.770
Anthony Garcia: But we tried to do the video calling and

681
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.410
Anthony Garcia: working there for a while, but for some reason.

682
01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:55.260
Anthony Garcia: I don't know if it's my phone or her mom's phone

683
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.870
Anthony Garcia: Is not allowing us to do that so

684
01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:01.290
Anthony Garcia: She does like to do the video.

685
01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:09.360
Jocelyn Corrales: Chats yes let's include that here video chats because of the pandemic video calling

686
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.140
Jocelyn Corrales: Or chats.

687
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.480
Jocelyn Corrales: With his daughter younger daughter.

688
01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:24.810
Jocelyn Corrales: So that your other daughter could also, you know, talk with your younger daughter.

689
01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:26.520
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah.

690
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:31.080
Anthony Garcia: Have you, have you tried messenger

691
01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:35.910
Jocelyn Corrales: Facebook Messenger, or that's what you what you've been doing before.

692
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.780
Anthony Garcia: We were actually doing it through. It was like video calling on the phone.

693
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.810
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh yeah, if you're in a fight. If you're on.

694
01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:48.990
Anthony Garcia: Camera sitting right there where you can be

695
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:53.370
Anthony Garcia: Over. Now, when we do it all says video call not available.

696
01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:54.690
Oh,

697
01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:02.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Does this your ex or your younger daughter has a messenger

698
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.680
Jocelyn Corrales: Basically

699
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.600
Anthony Garcia: Nothing.

700
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:14.100
Anthony Garcia: She uses like other older daughters phone. Sometimes when they let her and she

701
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.320
Anthony Garcia: Is the mom's phone

702
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:17.850
Anthony Garcia: My she'll answer, but

703
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:29.670
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could try setting up a zoom on her me. Yeah, maybe you could try setting up a zoom on her phone and you know

704
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:31.920
Jocelyn Corrales: I've asked her mom.

705
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.070
Anthony Garcia: She, she always tells me, she's gonna do it, and then

706
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.680
Anthony Garcia: She tells me, she's busy. She's to a later.

707
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.510
Anthony Garcia: If I keep trying to bother.

708
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.250
Anthony Garcia: I don't want this. She gets upset.

709
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:50.460
Anthony Garcia: So I'm just, I just kind of let it be. I guess the next time maybe

710
01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:52.110
Anthony Garcia: I'm just

711
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:53.430
Anthony Garcia: Like just

712
01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.190
Anthony Garcia: Like she pulls her for maybe

713
01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:14.700
Jocelyn Corrales: Because if your daughter, if you're younger daughter has an iPad on her own. You could set up a zoom there just in case you know you just need. She just needs an Internet if they're if they have an Internet at home, she'll be able to date without a phone just an iPad is fine.

714
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:19.050
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, they all have they all have their little things, but

715
01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.540
Anthony Garcia: For some reason, I guess because she's still only seven

716
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.780
Anthony Garcia: Yeah, that doesn't want her to have her own

717
01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:30.060
Anthony Garcia: Her own device yet.

718
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:32.910
Jocelyn Corrales: But she has

719
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.480
Jocelyn Corrales: She has SISTERS THERE RIGHT older sisters 12

720
01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.850
Anthony Garcia: Yeah. And as they do that.

721
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.590
Anthony Garcia: Or use them sometimes but

722
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:49.650
Anthony Garcia: Our mom really doesn't want the video to be played unless she authorizes it or if she's there.

723
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:51.480
Anthony Garcia: She's very like

724
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:59.130
Anthony Garcia: peculiar about like that stuff. And it's, I understand, and I

725
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:05.520
Anthony Garcia: Mean I used to get mad about it. But now I've found out that I can't change her so I might as well.

726
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.420
Anthony Garcia: Just deal

727
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.130
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

728
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:19.050
Anthony Garcia: I kind of just deal with it until they decide that it's looking do it. I'm just gonna continue to do, how I do it just color.

729
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:28.110
Anthony Garcia: Car sometimes because I've tried to get them to do the video chest on many times it's never worked there for a little loud.

730
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.000
Anthony Garcia: Yeah.

731
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:39.090
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. Okay. Maybe some other time. I hope it works out. Maybe you know your daughter would always be looking for you sometime

732
01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.800
Jocelyn Corrales: You know, she would also miss you and she would ask her, my mom, I want to talk to that. So maybe

733
