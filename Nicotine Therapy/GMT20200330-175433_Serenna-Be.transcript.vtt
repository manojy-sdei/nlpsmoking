46
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:12.270
Serenna Beers: Good for you. For for being proactive because so many folks can take the path of least resistance or the easier way and it sounds like you have a lot of mo motivation, which is which is huge.

47
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.750
ROB: Yeah it to me. It took a while for that to sink in. But yeah, it's pretty. It's a lot for me.

48
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.940
Serenna Beers: You know, I've been running around most of my life.

49
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:33.120
ROB: But the heroines, the one that really got me. But, you know, not to say I wasn't doing things before that, I think I did my, you know, I went to. I was in California youth authority.

50
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.140
ROB: Okay, so yeah. That was terrible. And I went from being a farm boy to that I just gotten a little bit of trouble.

51
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.120
Serenna Beers: Family just

52
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.710
ROB: Just, you know, that was it.

53
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.980
ROB: Yeah, so I've been on my own since probably about 15

54
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.440
ROB: So was

55
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.450
Serenna Beers: In a prison. Okay. Was there chronic pain associated with the

56
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.070
Serenna Beers: heroin use or was it was there some precipitating event that caused you to start to use

57
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.060
ROB: Yeah, it's pretty much what they're saying now is that it was due to our what what my

58
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.270
ROB: Problems. Where was it boiled down to PTSD.

59
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.200
ROB: From my

60
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.660
ROB: Childhood it didn't, you know, I always thought

61
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.370
ROB: Nothing. You know, I thought

62
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.200
ROB: All my life. I ran around

63
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:32.190
ROB: Thinking that you know I'm pretty tough or whatever you want to say, but apparently it really affected me later on, you know,

64
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.270
ROB: So I started using it with Bell goodness. Yeah. And it just killed that didn't that pain. It wasn't physical pain.

65
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.520
ROB: It was mental mental. Yeah.

66
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:57.570
ROB: Okay, never physical. It was always an end, it always started is fun for me, you know, because of my work, I would I would work. A while and then I'd be off for a long time with money. So that was part of it and

67
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:09.090
Serenna Beers: Wow. Well, there's a saying in in the addiction field and it in. It goes like this in the beginning, we used to feel, and in the end we use not to feel

68
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.860
Serenna Beers: It makes sense right

69
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:29.970
Serenna Beers: Pretty powerful, it's pretty powerful. Tell me about any prior history as far as like for mental health or substance use, you know, how many other types of places. Had you saw it help for and I mean if you don't know it exact dates just around about time.

70
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:39.840
ROB: Okay, since I'm since I was a teenager, they've been trying to get me to work with their ambition and psych tech actress.

71
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.470
ROB: And I

72
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:56.580
ROB: I just wouldn't do it until about 2004 and then I well 2004 is when I I just said. Screw it. I'm going to do this and I started seeing a therapist in and she has a PhD out of

73
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.520
ROB: Pittsburgh, California.

74
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:07.680
ROB: And and she just, she said, Man, we can't have you on the streets anymore so got me on social security disability.

75
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.490
And

76
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:18.960
ROB: And that helped that you know I was I was homeless, but I had a vehicle. You know I never considered myself homeless because I'd always been homeless when I wasn't working, you know,

77
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.810
ROB: Right. And you know, I just

78
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:32.040
ROB: I pay child support and everything, but you know my daughter. Right now, we don't even talk. I mean, we talk a bit but you know I just wasn't her dad so

79
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:44.970
ROB: That's kinda was always gone. Yeah. It's all right. It's not, it's, it's cool. We were, you know, I still talk to her mom so I know what's up with her. She's got four kids now so I got grandkids his

80
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.000
ROB: Daughter that I had to, you know. Yeah, so I mean I have all this

81
00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:07.830
ROB: All these people in the past that I've just kind of cut loose and and I cut loose my family finally about 2004 and it's just gotten better, ever since. So I had bad and my yeah it's just not good.

82
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:17.550
Serenna Beers: Well, that's what we're going to get into next but really quick. I have to ask you, do you have any history of suicidal ideation and I don't mean like a plan.

83
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:27.750
Serenna Beers: I mean like it had had you ever have thoughts like, you know, I would be better off dead any homicidal ideation where you wanted to harm another person. Have you ever had those types of thoughts.

84
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.480
ROB: Just no. Not those type of times not not not any more than anybody else will add you know like

85
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.000
ROB: Like you're, you're so

86
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:47.940
ROB: You know you're sick all the time and you're just like we should I just don't have the guts to do that. Anyway, so it's not my thing, you know, and I'm really mad at some of the people that did it.

87
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.100
ROB: Yeah, I grew up with, and

88
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.420
ROB: You're

89
00:08:51.540 --> 00:09:02.730
Serenna Beers: Talking more of like the common thought which would make sense when you're in active addiction, like, Gosh, I just, you know, if I never what What woke up again that I probably wouldn't be upset about that.

90
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.480
ROB: Right, that

91
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.520
Serenna Beers: I feel so bad. Yeah, okay, which which those are, I mean that's a normal way to feel

92
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:14.250
Serenna Beers: It. I mean as normal goes when you're when you're getting high. Right.

93
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.000
ROB: Yeah yeah

94
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.650
Serenna Beers: Um, what about

95
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.370
ROB: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm working with a psychiatrist right now so

96
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.230
ROB: I constantly see him yeah I'm disabled and PTSD and

97
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:39.180
ROB: Social anxiety and all that good stuff. So that's what they say. So anyway, I'm seeing a psychiatrist right now. And so I'm linked if I get those thoughts.

98
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:39.990
Serenna Beers: Oh, good.

99
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.770
ROB: And in a small town. So it's pretty easy to get taken care of here.

100
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.230
Serenna Beers: Yeah now Crescent City. How far away is that from like a bigger bigger city.

101
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:55.260
ROB: Wally we're right at the, the very North border of one on one.

102
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.480
ROB: Right against Oregon.

103
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.500
Okay.

104
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.740
ROB: Okay. Yeah. Beautiful place.

105
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.930
Serenna Beers: Yeah, very, very green right

106
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:10.770
ROB: Oh yeah, we got it we got the redwoods like one mile away and coast is two miles away. So

107
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.620
Serenna Beers: A lot of rain, though. Correct.

108
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.330
Serenna Beers: Right. Okay. Yeah.

109
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:34.200
Serenna Beers: All right, tell me about, okay, growing up. What was your family like specifically. Were you adopted. Were you raised by both mom and dad. Do you have brothers and sisters or your parents still together. Did anybody in your fam fam family struggle with mental health or substances.

110
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.690
ROB: Yeah, we can get into that. Okay. So, as adopted when I was two days old.

111
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:48.120
ROB: And, you know, there's a pretty good. It was a great family. My dad, you know, my mom, they love me and it was great. And she'd they adopted another daughter.

112
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:58.320
ROB: Adopting the sun too, but he ended up going back at some point, I don't really remember him, but my sister and I were raised, excuse me, and

113
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.210
ROB: I said I was raised in in Santa Rosa, California, but

114
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:11.520
ROB: You know, on a on a on a dairy type place. And so I was on a ranch had horses.

115
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:19.770
ROB: Is a great family life is almost like the Brady Bunch type thing. You know, it's just everything was that's how they wanted it, you know.

116
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:34.470
ROB: And miss my dad's perfect and my mom, you know, whatever. But when I was about 12 my mom split. She just one night, we can. We went out to dinner, and we came back. My mom was gone, she was with a friend of ours, you know now.

117
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.900
ROB: Oh, yeah. And anyway, I never I used to

118
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:49.080
ROB: Think about you know who my my real mother. My birth mother was and they always gave me some run around thing but um

119
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:56.250
ROB: Anyway, when I was 14. Like I said, I started running away because my parents were, you know, this isn't the normal thing.

120
00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:09.180
ROB: And my dad wasn't going for that. So he thought that I should be locked up so I could get help. That's what they said because they wanted me on some kind of probate. Why can't you get help, because he's run away, you know, and he hasn't done anything illegal so

121
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.580
ROB: They said, then he threatened our life so

122
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.120
ROB: I got me put locked up and do and instead of where I could leave you know i got i was to a one. I guess they call

123
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.390
ROB: It. And so they got me locked up and then sent me to a place called boys Republic down in Chino

124
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.920
Serenna Beers: first time I'd ever

125
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:38.220
ROB: Anywhere. Yeah. So I mean, I, I'm a farm boy you know i i didn't know anything or anybody that was into crime or anything.

126
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:52.170
ROB: So I went there and it got pretty crazy for me so I split it with three other guys and they got arrested, but I got away because I was pretty slick back then and I got back to Santa Rosa.

127
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.670
ROB: Still some pot plants.

128
00:12:54.210 --> 00:13:05.010
ROB: And went to juvenile hall and they were. And the first thing to judge it is what's he doing in boys Republic, you know, he's never met you know so they put me in a mobile camp youth camp.

129
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:11.880
ROB: There that was, you know, it's the same thing, but it was a lot less than it was. It was there in Santa Rosa and

130
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:28.050
ROB: So I of course I didn't like the idea of being locked up. So I split again and this time I stayed with a friend and his mom wasn't gonna even adopt me because she said, this is crazy, you know, we were we're trying to work and everything I had a car anyway.

131
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:40.080
ROB: And then they told me if I turn myself and they'd let me go, but not to my dad or my dad wasn't hearing out. So I went turn myself in

132
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:47.280
ROB: Wow, they put me back in and shaved my head and told me if I split. Again, I'm going to youth authority and

133
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:55.710
ROB: I did so I left and I ended up going with about four guys that were there that used to do burglaries commercial burglaries

134
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.650
ROB: So we got into that I got into it with them and

135
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.000
ROB: You know,

136
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:15.540
ROB: It didn't last long. And I got arrested. I was just about fifth I was right at 15 and I got busted and of course at those burglaries so they sent in. They were sending me to ya. Cuz I split

137
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.900
ROB: And so I went to California youth authority.

138
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:31.680
ROB: And right away. You know, I'm going to try to do the thing they said was going there and hit the biggest guy. So I tried to do that everyone was gonna back me up and then that's where I found out. That's all BS. No one's

139
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.330
ROB: No one's buying

140
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:33.810
Serenna Beers: So,

141
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:42.390
ROB: I ended up instead of getting released because it was like where you go in and you you get evaluated and

142
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.770
ROB: Go on, but you're on.

143
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.840
ROB: A parole instead of probation.

144
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.630
ROB: Okay, instead of doing that, they put me into a place Carl Holton, which was

145
00:14:52.860 --> 00:15:02.250
ROB: For the most part, for the age. I was so Carl and I ended up not getting out. Go out of 17 and a half. And that's when I got paroled

146
00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:13.650
ROB: Mm hmm. And when I got out, I got a little trouble and my parole officer basically said, You need to get out here because you know I was a good kid. I wasn't, you know,

147
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:27.660
ROB: I didn't hang out with the regular crowd. Now I look back and I you know I was a good kid back then. I didn't think I was very good. And my step brother, my mom's stepson

148
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:37.620
ROB: Was in Louisiana working on boats in the Gulf of Mexico, my load. So, he told me, come here. And, you know,

149
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.470
ROB: You know, because they had a worn out new for me again for burglary.

150
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.170
ROB: It wasn't, it wasn't quite what it was, but

151
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.780
ROB: They said, oh, anyway. Then I split. I went to Louisiana.

152
00:15:51.900 --> 00:16:00.930
ROB: Ended up getting a job on boats having a daughter and getting married and everything. You know, I changed my whole life while I was there, kind of

153
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.790
ROB: And

154
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.670
ROB: With that I

155
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:18.930
ROB: While I was there till about 2007 and came back to California got arrested and had to go back there person check fraud thing. So I had

156
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.500
ROB: And in New Mexico. So I got

157
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:32.970
ROB: Those two charges, but I got joined suspended and did five years suspended time ended up in Washington and got on boats and went to Alaska.

158
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:33.900
ROB: Hmm.

159
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:38.160
Serenna Beers: You mean like that three month on three month off type of thing. Yeah.

160
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.760
Serenna Beers: That's okay.

161
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.150
ROB: At first I was two weeks on two weeks off, you know, so

162
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:47.610
ROB: You know, you get a check in your arm, and I was at 19 in in

163
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.020
ROB: Around New Orleans for seven years. So I was having with them.

164
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:59.100
ROB: But I wasn't doing that many drugs or anything. No more than most people are

165
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:14.610
ROB: Buying a Coke once in a while or something like that. But yeah, I didn't start shooting dope till I came back and got in trouble. And then I I tried crank, you know, the good going back in the day, not the stuff they're doing nowadays, but anyway.

166
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.780
ROB: Uh huh. Yeah. Anyway, um,

167
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:31.470
ROB: So I ended up in Washington and going up to Alaska and I was doing pretty good there. But I ended up in prison for delivery of a controlled substance.

168
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.760
And I was crying.

169
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.840
ROB: And when I got out. I ended up with

170
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.090
ROB: A lady who

171
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:59.910
ROB: Her whole family was into heroin and that whole trip so I ended up doing it and I was working still for a while. And yeah, you know, it just took me down. That was the one that took me down and it really took me down hard and I got my dad told me

172
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.010
ROB: I could come back to Santa Rosa and kick. And so I did.

173
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:21.750
ROB: Mm hmm. But they, you know, started giving me money and buying me all these things and I ended up working for a while for a year and that didn't work out. But in the meantime there. I got all my paperwork from when I was adopted.

174
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:31.740
ROB: My dad went in and got all that stuff. And I was able to look up my birth mother. And so I called her and I ended up going down to LA and meeting with her.

175
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.680
ROB: Cool. Yeah. So I did that when I turned 40 and found out that everyone was bullshit me my whole life, you know,

176
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.660
ROB: It's nothing what they said and I had five brothers and sisters

177
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.940
Serenna Beers: I'm like, most of them were

178
00:18:49.350 --> 00:19:01.380
ROB: Drug addicts and and been in prison, my, my sister. The one knew that some of them were half but my full sister. I've got to meet her is like looking into my own eyes and

179
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:17.580
ROB: Really, and she at the age of 14 ended up in California youth authority. It was the whole wow, it was, it was like, because my family. The one I was raised with did no DRUGS DIDN'T EVEN smoke cigarettes. So I always thought. What is wrong with me, you know,

180
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.170
ROB: Well, that was it. I think it's

181
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:26.010
ROB: It has to be, I don't know, it's just kind of either it's a coincidence or its

182
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:38.790
ROB: Genetic you know I mean yeah there. Everyone has their my niece has she got shot by the cops and killed in rohner Park, California.

183
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:45.120
ROB: She had a mental problem. She came down with a butter knife in the cockpit six bullets into her so

184
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:46.860
ROB: Yeah, so

185
00:19:46.950 --> 00:20:01.830
ROB: There it is. There, it's the whole you know the mental I've got nieces and sisters and brothers that all they have mental problems. Some of them are, you know, upstanding citizens, but most of them aren't you know I got

186
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.300
Serenna Beers: A history.

187
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.870
Serenna Beers: A lot of

188
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.620
ROB: History. So there I am, and here I am now.

189
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.620
ROB: You know that that all stems to me getting up here, I'm

190
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.010
You know,

191
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:18.450
ROB: We ended up renting a room for a friend of mine, and he was sick of it to his wife had died a couple years ago, a

192
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.310
ROB: Couple hours before that and

193
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:28.920
ROB: That's heartbreaking. Yeah, so he was pretty much on a downward spiral we're copying dope together and

194
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:42.270
ROB: We end up saying, screw it, I own this house if you help me fix it up will I'll sell it. I'll buy you a brand new truck. So I did bought me a brand new tracking offer me and Rebecca to come up here so we ended up here.

195
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.210
ROB: Going on for years now.

196
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:53.010
ROB: Wow, and never I haven't I, you know, it's been since 2004 since I've been arrested for anything.

197
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.800

ROB: You know, for my addiction.

202
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:23.910
Serenna Beers: Sure. No. And I've actually heard lots of really good good things about her. So I hope

203
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:30.000
Serenna Beers: I hope one day our paths cross. I don't know if I have any groups with her or not. I might because I'm

204
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:49.200
Serenna Beers: I'm I'm fairly new here to I've only been here about a month. And so I'm I'm picking up some groups and and I swear that. That name sounds familiar. But in any case, I'm excited to meet her when when I do. Um, okay. So what about what was school like for you.

205
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.850
Serenna Beers: Did you graduate.

206
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.830
ROB: Student and

207
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.900
Serenna Beers: Any learning disabilities ever

208
00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.360
ROB: Know I even took that here. I wanted to find out because you know I'm 57

209
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.600
ROB: And I went back to school at 56 and

210
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:09.090
ROB: It was like, Oh my God, but, you know, I've got a 3.8 right now and

211
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.450
ROB: I'm more than halfway through to get my

212
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.780
ROB: Associates, but I'm doing behavioral

213
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.300
ROB: Behavioral and

214
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.930
ROB: Social and Behavioral Sciences some

215
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.250
Serenna Beers: A. Do you have a goal in mind up what you want to do with that.

216
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:33.690
ROB: No, I'm just, I just wanted to get the A and for transfer, just in case. But

217
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:42.780
ROB: I think I just wanted to, you know, because I didn't save any money or anything. So I'm going to have to work pretty much as long as I can work so

218
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.410
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

219
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:52.110
ROB: I was thinking about getting on. It's a small this is the smallest county in California. So it's it I think it'd be pretty easy to get a county job here and I want to

220
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.340
ROB: Really good database. I

221
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:53.970
Serenna Beers: Would imagine

222
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:06.330
ROB: Yeah, that's the whole thing. That's what I need. And I can't survive on Social Security disability. You know, I've been on it for a while and I don't know it's it's it's been a lifesaver for me though so

223
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.170
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

224
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:17.550
Serenna Beers: For you, um, were there any events that stood out to you, growing up either like with with friends or with family members.

225
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.550
ROB: Events good or bad.

226
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:31.650
Serenna Beers: Either I mean just things like, you know, for example, when I think of my childhood, one of my most profound memories is that the day that my mother never came home and I was eight years old.

227
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:46.110
Serenna Beers: You know, another event was performing in a school play and everybody stood up and clapped because they thought that I did so well when you when you deal with poor self esteem or feeling like no one who loves you and those two different things. One can either

228
00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:11.160
Serenna Beers: Make that belief feel more real. No one loves me or or another event can make it could discredit that belief will and make you think, wow, I, I really feel loved right now. So point being, you know, whether it's positive or negative. I mean, in a, in a van an event that stands out has significance.

229
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.410
Serenna Beers: And you're getting better, you know,

230
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:31.890
ROB: The ones that stand out the most is my parents just put man, I can't. It's almost unforgivable. I could never do it to any child. As a matter of fact, but is throwing me in jail and and leaving me there to to rock, you know,

231
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.910
ROB: When I was a kid, you know, I was only 15 years old.

232
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:49.470
ROB: You know, and that's probably the biggest significant thing in my life I was I was, you know, I was trying to keep my grades up because I wanted to be a veterinarian, you know, and I knew that I had to keep you know

233
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.110
ROB: Great score and now it's junior high.

234
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.850
ROB: So yeah, that was my goal as well. We knew a couple of what we knew people we

235
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.560
ROB: Were in a horse club. Right.

236
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:05.730
ROB: Anyway, and I mean, I remember all those times. I remember my first horse.

237
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:16.080
ROB: Was great times in my dad, my mom, I still to this day. I love my dad. But though the lady pick for a wife and me it just didn't work out.

238
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.630
ROB: And it's and she's you know

239
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:29.130
ROB: Yeah, it's a her and I have been to this day, you know, she's manipulative and

240
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:38.550
ROB: You know, not to say I haven't done my share, you know, stealing from them and stuff like that. And I had to when I was pissed off, but, um, and then

241
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:47.220
ROB: The person. I'm with right now. She there's nothing I can do. It just seemed like going through the whole addiction, we're together.

242
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.900
ROB: She got out of a really bad marriage and Adelaide.

243
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.390
Serenna Beers: Okay, yes.

244
00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:13.650
ROB: And add labor kids, fine. But yeah, she said, don't worry. They're my kids and and right now. They talk. They color for everything. So they didn't like they were all mad at her at first, but now they really care about her, but there's nothing I have to worry about or anything, you know,

245
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.020
ROB: My first wife Oh we're

246
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:36.330
ROB: We're friends now and stuff because it's been so long but you know i i got home early from working on a boat and caught her in the, you know, yeah, that was yeah that I almost killed the guy that night, man. You know, we ended up being all right friends later but

247
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:37.230
Serenna Beers: My goodness.

248
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:45.030
ROB: That was. Yeah, that was the end of, I mean, my, my daughter was nine months old. I mean, it was the best thing in my life.

249
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:55.680
ROB: And then, and then Melissa. My ex wife took my kid and move to California and my family took her in where I wasn't allowed to go to California. So

250
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:04.290
ROB: Yeah, it was terrible. Anyway, yeah. So that's another when they took my accent. The only way I can

251
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.840
ROB: Rationalize that is that my daughter had a good life and went to good schools and everything so

252
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.770
Serenna Beers: And and you just have the one daughter, right, the one

253
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:26.640
ROB: In one step daughter, who I raised. I was with another person and I raised her from about three years old, till she was about 14

254
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.860
ROB: Okay, and she still calls me, Dad. We talked all the time she's getting ready to have a baby in April.

255
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.090
Serenna Beers: Oh, wow.

256
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:40.140
ROB: Yeah, so we're closer, I mean as far as her. She's closer to me. And then my daughter, my

257
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.050
ROB: Daughter their, their friends. They still talk, you know,

258
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.760
Serenna Beers: Wow, that, well, that's cool.

259
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:58.830
Serenna Beers: Yeah, I'm just because you leave the relationship doesn't mean you have to leave the kids as well. So I totally get that totally I totally understand that. Okay, what about military are you retired military

260
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.390
ROB: No, I wish I was, I tried to get in the military, but I had a felony. By then, when

261
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:14.070
ROB: I add a felony. And back then. It wasn't war time or anything and. And not only did you have to have your, your all your high school credits, but you had to

265
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:37.050
Serenna Beers: What about, do you have any financial or legal issues that you were concerned about. Okay.

266
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:37.770
ROB: All right.

267
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.810
ROB: Well that's been taken care of.

268
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:45.270
Serenna Beers: Awesome. And then I you did say you're in a current, current relationship with Rebecca

269
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:56.700
Serenna Beers: And you have one daughter. I'm one step daughter and and you said that you lived with a friend of yours you and Rebecca live with the friend of yours right

270
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.030
ROB: Right.

271
00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.550
Serenna Beers: And that's been for the last three years or four years.

272
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:05.970
ROB: Oh, it's been over four years. We actually did our last shot together all of us on

273
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.400
ROB: Five years ago, so

274
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:09.900
Serenna Beers: Amazing.

275
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:18.300
ROB: Yeah, that's incredible. And when none of us have touched anything we don't talk to, you know, we just don't allow that into our lives anymore.

276
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.110
Serenna Beers: That is so

277
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.790
ROB: Yeah, it worked out.

278
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:30.960
Serenna Beers: For one, do any of you on not not any of you do you do you go to any type of us poor groups at all. A na

279
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:46.620
ROB: Only my the groups I have now with Dr groves and there you know have a counselor there open door, and she's you know she's an addiction is since she's been

280
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:49.530
ROB: You know she's had a past too so

281
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:57.630
ROB: It's okay to talk to. I'm not good in in actual groups like a or na I tried all that and it just

282
00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.220
ROB: It doesn't work so

283
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:11.610
Serenna Beers: Well, just as an FYI. There are online meetings just like this zoom. They're really cool. So even if you didn't want to say anything you could log in and mute yourself. I only say this because

284
00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:22.320
Serenna Beers: I also have times when I've got a lot of social anxiety when I get real ramped up I'll tend to stutter more and I just, I don't want to talk

285
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.580
Serenna Beers: So I will mute myself and I'll listen and there's just times when

286
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:34.380
Serenna Beers: A really good message is just, it's like it just really makes the difference. And it might help in to change it if if you're

287
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:42.960
Serenna Beers: If you're having an off day and you don't have access, like say that particular day, let's say Wednesday, you don't have any meetings through bright heart health, and you're just like,

288
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:50.250
Serenna Beers: You're just having some some kind of disturbing thoughts. You know, you might be triggered or, you know, I mean, right.

289
00:30:50.280 --> 00:31:01.320
Serenna Beers: Like, because that is what what happens, you can go online at any given time, and I believe it's it's online meetings.com or you could just put it in your Google

290
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:18.270
Serenna Beers: Google search bar as find me online meetings for na and and it's great. So I just wanted to share that with you because that's just an extra added resource that might that you might find one. One day might actually be of great help. So

291
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:24.870
ROB: Yeah. And as a matter of fact, a friend of mine that struggles with alcohol. He just told me about it.

292
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.770
ROB: So he's been doing that. Why you stuck in the house right

293
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.210
ROB: Yeah, he's actually

294
00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:43.560
Serenna Beers: You actually can't go anywhere. At this point, so you know where there's a will, there's a way. Alright, so I don't think I missed anything but let me just ask you before we get off the phone. I mean, the phone. The

295
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.970
ROB: Video understand

296
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.160
Serenna Beers: Um, Give me, give me three goals that you hope.

297
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.980
Serenna Beers: To work on while you are with us.

298
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:59.520
ROB: I'm actually to oh I want to come. I'm going to start coming down in the summer.

299
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.430
ROB: I don't want to do it one in class. I'm going to try

300
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:10.020
ROB: Right now and then a real I started out at 24 milligrams a day at eight, three times a day.

301
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.040
ROB: And I made

302
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:16.140
ROB: Two, three times a day. So I'm at six milligrams and that's over the last three years.

303
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:26.190
ROB: I'm working on a better diet because I had some problems and some issues. After I got my gallbladder removed so

304
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.680
ROB: There's one my

305
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.980
ROB: Working on a better diet.

306
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:41.100
ROB: Trying to get some of the really bad processed and, you know, I'm a meat eater, so I can't get rid of that but

307
00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.290
ROB: I understand that one. I'm

308
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:44.760
Serenna Beers: Like a great steak or a great

309
00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:55.920
ROB: Burger yeah and and bring in my dose at least down to next to nothing, not maybe not getting off yet because i don't i think i. It helps me really

310
00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:01.620
Serenna Beers: Just be careful, don't put the cart before the horse. I mean, like you're you're feeling good, you're

311
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.960
Serenna Beers: Going to school. But remember, part of medication management is because it's working.

312
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.190
Serenna Beers: Right, so just make sure

313
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.310
Serenna Beers: That you don't do anything without consulting your doctor first

314
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:23.910
Serenna Beers: While I can appreciate your desire and your motivation to want to decrease. Just remember that you're where you're at taking what you take for a reason. And so just

315
00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:37.320
Serenna Beers: Just don't be too antsy to too fast, you know, just just just take it a day at a time and you don't have to tackle everything at once, you know, don't, don't add more pressure and stress on on you just, you know,

316
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.770
ROB: Yeah, and Dr groves. Be gentle with yourself.

317
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:46.470
ROB: Yeah, she yeah she pretty much. Yeah, she's told me all that so I

318
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:47.220
Serenna Beers: See, good.

319
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.860
ROB: But she's got me down to where I am now you know

320
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.450
ROB: Really safe and really slow.

321
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:59.280
ROB: We had a real slow. So I'm yeah I'm not quite ready to totally get rid of it. But I'd like to have more energy, you know,

322
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.700
ROB: I just don't have it. So there's a two goals and my others.

323
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:11.550
ROB: Well, I don't know if both yeah I'm gonna I'll have my associates. By the time I, oh, you know, I'll still be here.

324
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.350
ROB: Okay, so, yeah.

325
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:19.860
ROB: So looking down here at the screen and I noticed that it looks like I'm looking down, but I might things appear so

326
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:29.460
Serenna Beers: Well, I do too. I am okay now I am looking at you. But when I listened to you talk, I'm looking at you on my screen. So it probably looks like I'm not looking at you, but I am

327
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:31.830
ROB: Yeah, you're doing it better. Nice.

328
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.750
ROB: Good, yeah, you know what I have to do a communications class.

329
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.280
ROB: And so, and I

330
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.930
ROB: Can't do it's perfect. So I got it down. No, yeah, yeah.

331
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:43.440
ROB: Cool.

332

Serenna Beers: Well, I was wonderful to me you if you wouldn't mind at some point here within the next day. If you could call and get yourself put on my schedule and

333
00:34:54.990 --> 00:35:06.330
Serenna Beers: I know you meet with your psychiatrist. So I don't know if there's any like timeframe, but I would like to see you at least every couple of weeks. You know, I just want to be able to check in with you.

334
00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:22.080
Serenna Beers: If you feel like every week is is better for you if you feel like there. I mean, cuz I just listening to you talk, I can tell you lots of things from a clinical standpoint that I feel that we could work on, not that I'm saying you're all screwed screwed up. I'm saying

335
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.180
Serenna Beers: We all can ya.

337
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:36.300
Serenna Beers: I'm just saying you you've given me lots of information of things in your past that I think could really kind of stop you from really

338
00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:43.680
Serenna Beers: taking that step and believing in yourself and really just going going forward. You know what I mean. So

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:53.010
Serenna Beers: I would personally like to do some work with you, you know, work, work, work on those goals that you talked about, I could give you some skills and

340
00:35:53.310 --> 00:36:01.020
Serenna Beers: You know, so if this feels like this would be a helpful thing, then I would appreciate it if you would call and get yourself on my schedule.

343
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:29.730
ROB: Because I get into watching TV and kicking back and stuff like that.

344
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:38.520
ROB: So, but, yeah, you're right. And this is definitely the first time. That's why I'm committed to school because I've never finished anything
