22
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:18.390
Belis Aladag: You know, it's such a strange thing you know I'm new to tell them medicine to I just left my in person practice. And I was like, I think telemedicine future and people

23
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.820
Belis Aladag: Yeah, well, maybe I'm not sure. And then this coronavirus like oh my god it is

24
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.230
Annie McNulty: Perfect timing.

25
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:42.570
Belis Aladag: So it's perfect timing. So, um, so what I did was I tried to that there's a database that we look at what's called cures in California and that we can look at to see how what prescriptions, you were given in the last year, whatever that were controlled substances.

26
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.320
Annie McNulty: Mm hmm.

27
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.850
Belis Aladag: And I saw that you had a prescription for you had to prescriptions one was for the four milligram films of Suboxone right on the

28
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.550
Belis Aladag: Seventh of January and then you've got another one like 10 days later, you got an eight milligram film one. Tell me about that. And that was through a pristine Hawkins.

29
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.680
Annie McNulty: Yeah, so that was that Betty Ford. That was my doctor Betty Ford. And the reason that she gave me the two different

30
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:24.390
Annie McNulty: Amounts was my plan was to enter sober living where I wasn't going to be allowed to be on it. So I was gonna have the different amounts so that I could tie treat myself when I left ready for

31
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:38.790
Annie McNulty: But then I had a court date. The next day after leaving for a really old case that I thought was gonna resolve like probation, but it resolved, like some jail time. So,

32
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:48.870
Annie McNulty: I went to jail for two or three weeks. I don't remember. And they continued me on eight milligrams there because I never, you know, I never

33
00:03:49.290 --> 00:04:04.110
Annie McNulty: Traded and then when I got out. I'm the same with my sister had happened the day before. So I came straight out here and it's going to be at least a couple months now, so I can enter that sober living because they filled up so

34
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.300
Annie McNulty: I'm just gonna, I'm hoping I can just do maintenance. Until then, because I don't want to relax. No.

35
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:21.990
Belis Aladag: No and and you know we're not in a hurry. I mean, we can totally taper you off very, very slowly. You know, we could go a milligram at a time, one

36
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.540
Belis Aladag: Yeah, you know, that kind of thing. That's what I

37
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:46.770
Annie McNulty: Yeah, cuz my I use when I took it last year was the first time I tried Suboxone and I took, he only prescribed me for at the start, and I stayed on for for like a month and then we went for to zero. And then I read that steak immediately. So I just don't want to do it like that, this time.

38
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.230
Belis Aladag: Yeah, let's not do that. So we

39
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.560
Annie McNulty: Yeah.

40
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.030
Belis Aladag: We saw that that didn't work so well we so we will taper you that's ultimately and great goal to get you off, of course.

41
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:05.940
Belis Aladag: Yeah, but we're not in any hurry will use it while we while we need to to stabilize. There's so much going on in your life right now. Right.

42
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.900
Belis Aladag: Yeah. When you say you're here. Where are you, where are you saying

Belis Aladag: Yeah, when, when did you enter buddy for you.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.580
Belis Aladag: December 31

71
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.270

72
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:25.440
Belis Aladag: Okay, tell me about the previous five times what, what did you do, was it also residential like whoa.

73
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.860
Annie McNulty: Yeah, I did. Residential three other times.

74
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:36.660
Annie McNulty: And then some of her for other times some of those I graduated, some I didn't, about half and half.

75
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:48.570
Annie McNulty: Okay, and then the ones that I graduated I went straight to sober living in the that usually didn't work out really nothing worked for me until

76
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:58.110
Annie McNulty: Betty Ford this time. And the way that they did their medication management and the way that they approach Suboxone she's made things like a way different for me.

77
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.160
Belis Aladag: Thank God.

78
00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.880
Annie McNulty: Yeah.

79
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.710
Belis Aladag: The previous times, you are not really offered maintenance. Was it more

80
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.630
Annie McNulty: LINO it wasn't allowed

81
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.120

87
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:44.040
Annie McNulty: One of them diagnose me a schizo effective that the more I read about it, that didn't really make sense for me. So, okay, um, anyways, yeah it's helped with all my like anxieties and move stuff to

88
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.140
Annie McNulty: Just feels like it helps everything

89
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.790

91
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.070
Belis Aladag: OK for the bipolar.

92
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.660
Belis Aladag: Yeah okay, who gives you Lamictal. Do you have a psychiatrist or

93
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:10.020
Annie McNulty: So Betty Ford gave me it and I still have a lot because in jail. They wouldn't give me it so I still have like most of the prescription. They gave me when I left and I

94
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:25.410
Annie McNulty: Am because when I got out, I got out like two weeks ago, I didn't want to start back up at 200, which is what I had it because I know you're not supposed to do that with it. So I started at 15 and I have been going up by 50 every week.

95
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.990
Belis Aladag: Okay 50 tied trading weekly. So where you're at now.

96
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:31.860
Annie McNulty: I'm not

97
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.600
Belis Aladag: 100 100 okay

98
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.750
Belis Aladag: But you're you're sweet those was 200 you felt comfortable at that

99
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.670
Annie McNulty: Yeah 200 was really good.

100
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.600
Belis Aladag: Okay, so that's what you're working towards over the next couple of weeks.

101
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.120
Belis Aladag: Yeah, and you have enough for now.

102
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:48.870
Annie McNulty: Yeah.

103
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.180
Belis Aladag: So what we could do is

104
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.590
Belis Aladag: If you like this.

105
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.910
Belis Aladag: We can have a psychiatrist in our system and be in

106
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.580
Belis Aladag: Unified hard health also be able to talk to you like this and give you a manage the Lamictal.

107
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.020
Annie McNulty: Yeah, that'd be awesome.

108
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.380
Belis Aladag: So that you don't you know I'm so you're not on your own.

109
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.190
Belis Aladag: Bad and yeah

110
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:17.400
Annie McNulty: Running out. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I wasn't sure if I should just like try to tie treat myself up without the use of this, I can just say, no, it's probably advised against

111
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.840
Annie McNulty: But I really missed this stability. So I just did it anyways.

112
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.650
Belis Aladag: Okay.

113
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.770
Belis Aladag: So let me do this if it's okay by you all write a

114
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:35.970
Belis Aladag: Note to the team. The virtual care team like when you log in. There's those care coordinators and I can ask that they help hook you up with a psychiatry appointment in the near future.

115
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.860
Belis Aladag: Over the next week or two, or something so that you can talk about this tight ration you're doing

116
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.270
Annie McNulty: Yeah, the awesome

117
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:42.960
Belis Aladag: Okay.

118
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:48.660
Belis Aladag: For the portfolio and then the skin so active yeah you maybe you can talk to the psychiatrist about that diagnosis.

119
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.050
Annie McNulty: Yeah.

120
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.700
Belis Aladag: In a ring true for you.

121
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:58.140
Annie McNulty: But I read a lot about it, and it seemed like there was this thing. The main thing that like I was

122
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:16.740
Annie McNulty: I was thinking that didn't feel right when I was reading all the symptoms but I read a few articles that mentioned that you can't have it. You don't have much fish like the hallmark symptom is not having a lot of facial aspects and so that definitely would make sense.

123
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.750
Belis Aladag: Yeah, I can see your face.

124
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.900
Belis Aladag: You have visual effects. Yeah.

125
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.780
Belis Aladag: Yeah. So yeah, asked. I think it'll be good for you to have established here with a good psychiatrist.

126
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.470
Annie McNulty: Yeah.

127
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:38.880
Belis Aladag: Let's ask for that for those guys and also the anxiety, if you want, but it sounds like things. It was kind of like very mild and it was it's now managed now that you're staying

128
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.110
Belis Aladag: Up on Suboxone

129
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.020
Annie McNulty: Yeah, I used to say Klonopin in high school. And I think that led to a lot of my addiction stuff sounds

130
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.480
Belis Aladag: Good, because that can that is an addictive substance and

131
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.110
Annie McNulty: Yeah, and

132
00:12:52.320 --> 00:13:05.670
Annie McNulty: Some hey I have censored that it's a really crazy amount, but the subconscious that in high school, put me on four milligrams a day. And that was just that and like, now that I've gone to recovery meetings. People are like, that's a huge amount

133
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.400
Belis Aladag: For a high schooler just

134
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.260
Belis Aladag: Wow.

135
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.110
Annie McNulty: Yeah, I was so tired all the time, makes sense now.

136
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.550
Belis Aladag: It makes sense.

137
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.420
Belis Aladag: Okay, yeah, that was in high school. You were like 1516 or younger.

138
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.230
Yeah.

139
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.510
Belis Aladag: That's when okay you were placed on that because you were going and saying you have anxiety.

140
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:33.330
Belis Aladag: Yeah. Um, did you feel like you were asking for early refills or anything. Pretty quickly or or

141
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.500
Annie McNulty: Um,

142
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:48.570
Annie McNulty: I think so. He started me on. We started me on one then went to, um, he because he started me on one being like, we're going to go up. I don't think that'll be there and what few someone to do and then we

143
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:55.680
Annie McNulty: Went to four. And by the time I haven't been on for for a few months. Like, I found that I ran out of it really fast.

144
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.240
Belis Aladag: I see, yeah.

145
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.230
Annie McNulty: Yeah, and I didn't really understand addiction. Then at all. So I didn't think

146
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.500
Annie McNulty: Anything of it much except that like I missed it, when it was gone.

147
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:05.760
Annie McNulty: Yeah.

148
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:12.570
Belis Aladag: So I'm going to say for the record that you have a history, you have, it's in. It's in remission so

149
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:22.350
Belis Aladag: Yeah mission but that you have a sedative use disorder as well, you know, because that's kind of how it all started. You didn't realize it.

150
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.010
Belis Aladag: Yeah, it just circumstances led you to have that

151
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.130
Belis Aladag: Maybe was mild. Maybe it was moderate so to abuse disorder.

152
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.930
Belis Aladag: But it's in remission, you haven't had any any benzodiazepine or sedative in how long now I hear

153
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.100
Annie McNulty: You when I would relapse say sometimes would find some so

154
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.080
Annie McNulty: Yeah, actually, like, a year.

155
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.550
Annie McNulty: Yeah, okay.

156
00:14:49.140 --> 00:15:03.900
Belis Aladag: Okay. All right, good. So, so it's important for you to note that because you have an opioid use disorder, but you also have a sedative use disorder. So just for your own sake, safe and careful in the future if you know life's ups and downs. It's

157
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.890
Belis Aladag: Goodbye, like, okay, that's not a safe substance for me or

158
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:16.500
Belis Aladag: You have to use it under a certain certain circumstance for medical reasons, the doctors like advising I can be open and say, I actually had a problem with that, but

159
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.040
Belis Aladag: Let's be careful and give me small amount, whatever it is. Right.

160
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.940
Annie McNulty: Right, yeah.

161
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:31.410
Belis Aladag: Okay, and any other you mentioned we your sister and brothers took a lot of weed. Do you have a history with that or you don't get any more sense and

162
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:37.500
Annie McNulty: As like a small history. I never really abused it, but I'm not smoking anymore.

163
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.160
Belis Aladag: Okay, okay, and no other substances.

164
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.590
Annie McNulty: No, I'll call is never really my thing. Once I started doing heroin. It was just like anyone do anything else really so

165
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.650
Annie McNulty: Okay, unless I couldn't find it.

166
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:59.310
Annie McNulty: Like really, I didn't have any other issues. I tried method couple times, but it made me really crazy

167
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:07.590
Belis Aladag: Yeah yeah okay but the heroin. So let's talk about that. How did you get to heroin. Was it fills.

168
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:08.880
Belis Aladag: Or what yes

169
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:21.300
Annie McNulty: So I have tried fills it but I'm me. I'm really and in high school I was really interested in, like metropark thick and I Vedic medicine. I like worked at this medicinal tea shop and

170
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:28.560
Annie McNulty: I was taking these online classes like learning how to make tinctures, you know, all that kind of stuff. And so

171
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:35.610
Annie McNulty: I mean, at the time I was looking at college degrees ended up getting into some the deciding to travel. Instead, but

172
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.510
Annie McNulty: I like found ethno bought me as the degree, like the relationship between people lens. And that was just like, fascinating.

173
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:55.500
Annie McNulty: And I was having at that same time, like a lot of big relationship with psychedelics like I loved psychedelics, I grew my mushrooms and synthesize GMT from like the YouTube tutorial.

174
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:56.550
Belis Aladag: And then

175
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:08.370
Annie McNulty: I like to read. Also, so I read this like paper on the psychoactive effects of opium and I read that you could buy the poppies online.

176
00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:23.220
Annie McNulty: So I did and I grew some and I dried out the pods and bundle them into this tea like opium tea and I was drinking that and then I was drinking that like all the time and I ran out of pods and

177
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:32.280
Annie McNulty: That was that, but it was like a year and a half later, I had a really, really close friend died, and I was just having like a horrible time mentally

178
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:44.520
Annie McNulty: I wasn't seeing a therapist or anything at that time. And I remembered like the comfort that the TF given me but I didn't want to like grow it. I just like went out and found heroin, for the first time.

237
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.720
Belis Aladag: In those three years were you going into these other residential

238
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:36.480
Annie McNulty: Yeah, I was trying. I really wanted to be sober, but I just couldn't do it like the last three years, nothing has happened, except like as mental relax streets and residential relapse streets like, that's it.

239
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:38.010
Belis Aladag: It's

240
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:47.400
Annie McNulty: Crazy to look back, I really feel like in a big part of my life makes me sad. But once I started doing stuff. And I'll feel better about it.

241
00:22:48.180 --> 00:23:03.330
Belis Aladag: Exactly, exactly. You're going to be okay. And you know what it was a journey of three years of it sounds like real rough times and trying but falling down and trying and not finding the right thing and then finally you you found the right thing.

244
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:18.540
Belis Aladag: You know, moving away from like being an intensive residential treatment. I like the fact that you're still thinking. Once you can stabilize and find a place to live. It should be a sober living

245
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.410
Annie McNulty: I like the app.

246
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.790

Annie McNulty: I couldn't tell you when. But I have overdosed six times.

273
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.740
Belis Aladag: Six times in the last three years.

274
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.690
Belis Aladag: Mm hmm. Wow.

275
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.620
Yeah.

276
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:42.960
Belis Aladag: Thank God you're here with us.

277
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.800
Annie McNulty: Yeah, I know.

278
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:51.060
Belis Aladag: So speaking of which, so when I'm going to prescribe the Suboxone film is it film that you prefer, or do you

279
00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.880
Annie McNulty: Have now a child, the other one.

280
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.950
Annie McNulty: I've just been on film.

281
00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:00.960
Belis Aladag: If your insurance is covering it and you're comfortable with it will just go with what's been working

282
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:10.470
Belis Aladag: Yeah, but if there's a need to change the tablet. It's actually the same thing. Maybe it dissolves, a little differently, but it's still. Same thing under the tongue and stuff like that. But for

283
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.890
Belis Aladag: Now I'll order what you were used to write the eight milligram film.

284
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.720
Belis Aladag: Yeah, and

285
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.570
Belis Aladag: So we'll do that. And then I'll also order Narcan so you have that

286
00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.160
Annie McNulty: I have to

287
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.330
Annie McNulty: But I'll take another one.

288
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.970
Belis Aladag: For sure. I mean, it doesn't hurt right like

289
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.610
Belis Aladag: Yeah, as you know you already probably know like you can use it on other people. Like if someone's passing

290
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:32.970
Annie McNulty: That

291
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:33.900
Know why

292
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:44.580
Belis Aladag: You try to wake on, they don't. It won't hurt them. If you try to spread this in their nostrils. Let's say it's not an opioid overdose. Will they just won't come back but it won't hurt them.

293
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.090
Annie McNulty: Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's great idea.

294
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.610
Belis Aladag: You know, and then you should always call 911

295
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.830
Belis Aladag: Because yeah reversible it reverses you for like half an hour. But then you can switch that

296
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.800
Annie McNulty: Up in the friends, where they are, because they're in our kin. They're fun and then they passed out again.

297
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.840
Belis Aladag: Who you've seen it.

298
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.130
Annie McNulty: Oh, yeah, yeah.

299
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.960

332
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:17.160
Annie McNulty: I just been a jolly and then I called 16 offices and it was either they didn't take my insurance or

333
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:27.000
Annie McNulty: They were closing or they don't take any insurance at all. It was just crazy. Oh god, I'm so glad. How did you find this just online.

334
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:28.590
Belis Aladag: Okay.

335
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.870
Annie McNulty: Yeah, it shows to you guys as being like a doctor's office like an hour away from here.

336
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.140
Annie McNulty: But then I called in. They were like, we're

337
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:37.980
Wrong.

338
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.370
Belis Aladag: We're closer than that.

Belis Aladag: This is so much better. Okay, good. So dissolve one film under tongue daily. I'm going to give you. So would you feel comfortable. Joining me in a group session where we just check in and say, Hey, how's it going. Is everybody okay what they're doing.

342
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:12.960
Belis Aladag: And so, so that's kind of how we want to do refills. So for now, we're thinking of starting not this Thursday, but next Thursday the 26th at 4pm

343
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.880
Annie McNulty: Cool, thanks for me.

Belis Aladag: Give you 10 just to give you a little extra cushion, just in case.

348
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:32.340
Thinking

349
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:39.720
Belis Aladag: If anything happens, you know, just call that virtual clinic. Now you have that number that's

Belis Aladag: Be good. Okay, let's see.

357
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.600
Belis Aladag: Do you have any questions for me or anything else.

358
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.190
Belis Aladag: Right now. Okay.

359
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.130
Belis Aladag: Like it's

360
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:54.360
Belis Aladag: Okay, excellent. So that went through. And then finally, one. I'll just put in the Narcan to description and I'll also put in a plug for them to contact you about maybe connecting with a psychiatrist for the Lamictal. You know, tight ration you're doing

361
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:54.750
Annie McNulty: Yeah.

362
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.710
Belis Aladag: And the other questions, actual diagnoses.

363
00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.580
Annie McNulty: Yeah.

364
00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:17.040
Belis Aladag: You know, oftentimes, when people have substance use disorders and like in your case very early age, you were started on this Klonopin and then it went into this other stuff. So bipolar people get look bipolar because of some of the substances that are in our system, you know,

365
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.170
Annie McNulty: Yeah, that's good. I think it is.

366
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.220
Belis Aladag: So,

367
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:22.110
Annie McNulty: Yeah, I didn't like I didn't have

368
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.080
Annie McNulty: That was fine. Before I was just anxious that that's all you know I was pretty happy person.

369
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:42.600
Belis Aladag: So I would, you know, encourage you to question question the diagnosis, um, you know, you can say I think they'll make they'll help, which is why I'm on it. But, you know, just explore that a bit more with the psychiatrist for the

370
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:49.170
Belis Aladag: Yeah, this and really say like, I don't know. I mean, there's no history of bipolar disorder in the family.

371
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:49.890
Annie McNulty: Right.

372
00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:57.420
Belis Aladag: You were using, you know, the Klonopin and then when were you diagnosed with bipolar when you're actively

373
00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.610
Belis Aladag: In oh yeah you know you

374
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.620
Annie McNulty: Yeah, when I was using a lot. Yeah.

375
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:11.790
Belis Aladag: So right that's that's questionable. So to me it's like, you know, less is more. If we can get you to a point where you don't need all of these things.

376
00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.240
Annie McNulty: Yeah, I agree. I don't want all that

377
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:24.690
Belis Aladag: Yeah, yeah. You don't need baggage, you're fine. You just need to, you know, go back in and just see that and feel that and

378
00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.000
Belis Aladag: You know, see your own wholeness.

379
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:39.180
Belis Aladag: Right. Um, but for now. If it's helping you. Let's, let's just get you patched up and then you can figure that out as we go. Okay, so I think we covered everything

380
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:47.520
Belis Aladag: What I'll do is I have your email and I can email you some instructions to and guidance and whatever. Once I have a better I'm new to this thing too. I told me

381
00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.220
