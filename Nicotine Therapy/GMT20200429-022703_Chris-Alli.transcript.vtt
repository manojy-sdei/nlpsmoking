37
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.070
Chris Alliman MD: Wonderful. I'm glad to hear that. When was the last time to use heroin.

38
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.650
Sherrie Martinez: It's been about five years ago.

39
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.850
Okay.

40
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.440
Chris Alliman MD: So that's we're putting that about 2016

41
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.120
Sherrie Martinez: Yes.

42
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.240
Chris Alliman MD: Yes, how long, how long did you use heroin.

43
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:46.410
Sherrie Martinez: Um, the first time I used it for three months. And then I got put in jail. And then at when I got out of jail, I used it maybe for a year or more, and then that's something that person showed me the Suboxone

44
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.450
Sherrie Martinez: And then that's when it all ended.

45
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.260
Sherrie Martinez: I never

46
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.520
Sherrie Martinez: Put a needle in my arm again.

47
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.630
Chris Alliman MD: Very good. Why did you get started on Suboxone initially for I'm sorry on heroin initially for those fears.

48
00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.580
Sherrie Martinez: Um,

49
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:13.050
Sherrie Martinez: Because I when I got out of jail, I felt sick and I was craving it. I had the craving for it and I wanted it, and I was I wanted it. So that's first thing I did is I went and did

50
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.550
Chris Alliman MD: And that was

51
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.880
Chris Alliman MD: So that was you had been on it for three months and then you were in jail and then audit for you.

52
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.660
Sherrie Martinez: I was in jail for three days and I kind of broke off it.

53
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.360
Sherrie Martinez: A little bit I hallucinate it I

54
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:42.990
Sherrie Martinez: I poop. Oh, it was horrific what happened. They have to have me and medical they put me in medical insurance. It was awful. And then they they released me. And then when I got out. I told that's the first thing I wanted was heroin. So that's what I went and did

55
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.110
Chris Alliman MD: Why did you, why did you first take heroin. Originally, the first time around. Oh.

56
00:04:49.740 --> 00:05:00.930
Sherrie Martinez: Oh, because I had a doctor, whose name was Dr. London and I wasn't an accident and he gave them to me a pain pills for my back.

57
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.850
Sherrie Martinez: And I love them.

58
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:13.860
Sherrie Martinez: Yes, and I started liking those pink pills and then he got his, his medical whatever taken away from him, so I nobody could see him again.

59
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.320
Sherrie Martinez: So then introduced me

60
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.770
Sherrie Martinez: To the heroin. But then I would just put it up my notes.

61
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.180
Sherrie Martinez: Oh god, you know, and with the needle and squeeze it up.

62
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.320
Sherrie Martinez: And I never saw it. I didn't shoot it for the first couple of weeks.

63
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:38.340
Sherrie Martinez: And then if I didn't do so I didn't do it was helping me and then I guess I wanted more because I had a high dose of medication from Dr. JOHN GREEN.

64
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.810
Sherrie Martinez: Sure, and then

65
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.400
Sherrie Martinez: And then on my friends just told me to here. Let me show you how to shoot it. And then I said, okay, and I did.

66
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.540
Okay.

67
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.340
Sherrie Martinez: You know, and then after that, yes, I started heroin.

68
00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:03.960
Chris Alliman MD: So that's a pretty common story we hear that a lot, where people have some type of injury or trauma or something happens and they've got pain and they're on pain pills for a while.

69
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.360
Sherrie Martinez: And then for some reason it gets stopped.

70
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.400
Chris Alliman MD: And they're trying to find something

71
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.450
Chris Alliman MD: And they end up

72
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.580
Sherrie Martinez: Heroin. Yeah. Yes.

73
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:21.120
Chris Alliman MD: Another thing that we often hear is depression or anxiety and people are trying to escape depression or anxiety through through getting

74
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.470
Sherrie Martinez: It has that you

75
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:35.820
Sherrie Martinez: Know, because I had, I was diagnosed with bipolar and I did, I have my bipolar pills and I see Dr. Miller and Santa Fe. It wasn't that it wasn't the depression in that it was just the addiction.

76
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.690
See

77
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.120
Sherrie Martinez: It was straight up addiction.

78
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.110
Chris Alliman MD: What do you take take for the bipolar.

79
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.900
Sherrie Martinez: Um, it's called low metal

80
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:59.580
Sherrie Martinez: The metal. And then I can't remember the other one. It's to help me kind of sleep, but I haven't taken it lately because this box and helps me and I don't want to overdose and I don't want to do. Yes.

81
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.330
Sherrie Martinez: Good.

82
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.520
Chris Alliman MD: Do you take any of them. Do you take any other medications, besides those two or three

94
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.030

Chris Alliman MD: Another way another

450
00:30:52.170 --> 00:31:03.030
Chris Alliman MD: Another way. Another thing to keep in mind. Sherry, is that when you come to group, you get a prescription, but that goes until your time with the therapist.

451
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:04.380
Chris Alliman MD: So,

452
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.980
