20
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.900
Isaak: As I mean I was kind of upset about like, you know, last month and stuff.

21
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:25.920
Isaak: But I mean, I've kind of, you know, I'm doing all right like thankfully I have like, you know, support a family and stuff. And, you know, they just told me not to worry about it you know and like everyone has grown like route for recovery. You know what I mean. And

22
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.470
Isaak: Not like every person you know has their own way of doing this.

23
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:47.940
Shawn Phalen: You know, you're, you're absolutely right. And I really love that you can identify that you know that you can. Yeah, because I think that, you know, we've talked about this, like you

25
00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:04.770
Yeah, really made huge strides from when we first started making and you should be, you know, really proud of yourself and and you're listening to yourself and you know

26
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.580
Isaak: That's good, that's really at the

27
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.480
Shawn Phalen: End. So, you know, you'll find the right job.

28
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:23.730
Isaak: It'll come down. I mean like I have a friend that's a manager at railings, and they're hiring right now and that probably just be part time like once I start to taper a little bit. I think I'll be

29
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:33.300
Isaak: cool with it because I just don't know how I'm going to be affected by it yet. You know, like if it does make me a little sick. You know, I don't want it to like mess up my work ethic, you know,

30
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.640
Isaak: Like that was brought to why like that. Sorry, what

31
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.780
Isaak: Oh, here. Hold on. My dogs are

32
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.170

Isaak: Okay.

35
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.310
Isaak: Sorry.

36
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.570
Shawn Phalen: So how long have you been on Suboxone

37
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:09.480
Isaak: Um, six months, like I wasn't like part of my original plan was at the six month mark which it just passed, I think, like,

38
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.800
Isaak: Four days ago yeah i think i started like in July or something. So I told myself on the six month I would start to like taper down so

39
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.170
Shawn Phalen: And so obviously the doctors on board with that she's cool

40
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:36.690
Isaak: Yeah, actually, the doctor, he's he's really cool. Um, I kind of like his ID on it. You know, like he's not pressuring me or anything to get off or stay on it you know he's

41
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:59.490
Isaak: He actually we had to change, like I had another doctor before but like he got a different job. So I got a new one. And I, I've only had him a few weeks now. But actually, like, So, what's his name. Um, I think it's Dr fig. Yeah. Yeah, he's cool. Okay, good. Yeah. Okay, so you feel like you're

42
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.660
Shawn Phalen: Ready to taper then

43
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.560
Yeah.

44
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.250
Isaak: That's the plan. Okay.

45
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.180
Shawn Phalen: So is your goal, just to totally be off of it.

46
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:20.130
Isaak: Um, yeah, I mean, I know that I don't want to go like too fast, though, you know, like, I'm just going to drop down like four milligrams probably this week and stamp it for like

47
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:30.930
Isaak: I don't know, maybe a week or two and then try it again. And, you know, but I mean I'm hoping like five, maybe six months, I could maybe be off of it or be very close. Okay.

48
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:42.120
Shawn Phalen: All right. Um, and then what's so Tommy like what's going on with the work situation, you said you know

49
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.800
Isaak: Well yeah, I know I have a friend. He's worked at release forever. And he just recently became a manager now and they're hiring. So like

50
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.870
Isaak: That, that can be a job that I can easily get, you know, and it would only be part time probably so that'd be good, but the only reason why

51
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:16.890
Isaak: We're going to get as like a graveyard shift like it overnight talking and talking. But I don't know, like I just kind of fixed my sleeping pattern like these past few months, like, you know, I mean, getting up early and stuff. And I don't know, just kind of, I don't know.

52
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.810
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

53
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:29.370
Isaak: There's still a proper nice. I mean, I'm not too worried about it because, like, I've noticed that I've just been, I've been getting a lot of job offers you know and like so. I mean, I'm not worried about that.

54
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.390
