Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to open up a note that via just a little silence on my part.

4
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't mean you can't share but just let me know. It can feel a little awkward, much like a phone call when there's silence, but

5
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta concentrate here.

6
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.450

9
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have something kind of present for you as you're coming in here today that maybe you want to start with.

10
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.990
Shaun W.: No.

11
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.280
No.

12
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I have an idea. You want to go with my idea.

13
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you know the expression, the pink elephant.

14
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To know that expression.

15
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.070
Shaun W.: Yeah, the pink open the room.

16
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What do you think are pink elephant is

17
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, well, let's see, for example, how excited, were you to come in here today to meet with me.

18
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.390
Shaun W.: Maybe there's more to as

19
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because we have humor. You and I have sense of sense of humor. We can usually get through difficult moments with our sense of humor. Right.

20
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what do you think the thing is

21
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.630
Was

22
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Anger, irritation, a little bit this morning before coming in thinking, I don't wanna

23
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.000
Shaun W.: I didn't have anger. Okay.

24
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: What about irritation.

25
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.290
Shaun W.: Yeah, a

26
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Little bit. So if that if that part that has to do with where maybe once there wasn't as much irritation. Now there is maybe that's the pink elephant. Maybe it's that piece. Do you think

27
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.840
Shaun W.: No, no.

28
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.490
Gwenevere Abriel: No. No, you couldn't name one, you don't think that you could you could identify one

29
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.520
Shaun W.: Blue just getting this over with the leaders.

30
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

31
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And so there's still this awareness that it's a requirement of probation, that sense that it's get it over with.

32
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

33
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So not really wanting to be here.

34
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: irritation and not really wanting to be here right

35
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And do you think that that might be in the way of being able to take on and learn new things when you're irritated not really wanting to be somewhere. Do you think it might get in the way of being able to take in new information.

36
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, probably not. You think when kids.

37
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, forced to go

38
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.920
Shaun W.: Good.

39
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You think adults would are forced to go somewhere that they can absorb information as easily as when

40
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: They want to be there.

41
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.900
Shaun W.: Will be candle.

42
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Making can Where'd you learn that that they can

43
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.630
Shaun W.: Do they can I know I can.

44
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:11.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You can. Okay. All right. Well, let's go with that then. So I have this little list here that I have had for an eternity and you'll be able to tell because it's all worked and scratchy looking

45
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at it together and that can be sort of our focus today.

46
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So just kind of look through it. It just sort of going with even with irritation today and wanting to get today over with that you can still sort of try on new information and let in.

47
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: knowledge and insight and reflection. So let's look at these together and just notice. Notice if your body responds in any particular way to any of these or if you really have a sense of, but this. Oh, I don't like this one and then maybe

48
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: If you have a strong reaction to one or two or more, just let me know what they are. And let's maybe explore them a little further. So let's look at this list these this, this is a

49
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: comprehensive list of a relapse symptom list. Now, these could either be precursors to a slip that's coming. Because my understanding of a relapse, is that it can take years.

50
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: An individual could be preparing for a relapse long in advance of actually using okay and so that's what's so amazing about this particular dis ease

51
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that it isn't just the use, it's actually the stinking thinking okay so let's just take a look at some of these together and see if you would mark any of them. So would you mark number one.

52
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you might say I start doubting my ability to stay sober. Do you think that you are doing that somewhat

53
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.290
Shaun W.: Low

54
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi. Oh, your audio and out your back. Now, I don't know.

55
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.460
Shaun W.: Yeah, yeah, this thing somebody just called my phone.

56
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that everybody gets knocked out of their audio when they get called or texted did you can you see this and you hear my invitation to just look at each one

57
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.740
Shaun W.: Number one. Yeah, no.

58
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.850
Shaun W.: I'm good.

59
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So number one, I'm good.

60
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.450
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm good. So you're not doubting your ability to stay silver

61
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.420
Shaun W.: Were three

62
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You say number three is uh yeah let me see. Number three, I adamant. I am adamantly convinced myself that I will never use again are you focusing on the drinking. Is that what you're doing with that one.

63
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.090
Shaun W.: Well I don't drink alcohol.

64
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Your focus. Do you see that it says all never use again. Do you see that

65
00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.940
Shaun W.: Yeah.

66
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you saying yes to

67
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.380
Shaun W.: Saying that I see that to myself.

68
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll never use again.

69
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.980
Shaun W.: Your yeah

70
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.850
Okay.

71
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we go back up to number one for a moment.

72
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: When, when we were in group. And you were saying, Well, I don't want to relapse on heroin. Right. I want to take two strips or at least two strips. I want more doc, can I have more. Do you see how it makes me wonder if you are doubting your ability. Do you see how I might have drawn that conclusion.

73
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.680
Shaun W.: Yeah.

74
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. But you said no.

75
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.550
Shaun W.: No, I didn't. What I said I said I convinced myself every day that I'm not using number three.

76
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I convinced myself.

77
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So that word is really a powerful one. Isn't it I convince myself.

78
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:55.710
Okay.

79
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.960
Shaun W.: This is

80
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't know number one is a no. But I brought us back up to number one and I was asking if you could imagine that I could draw that conclusion based on what you were saying, and grew up your concerns about not wanting to relapse on heroin, like I'm wanting to go back and slow.

81
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let's move on. So, number four. What do you think about that one. I decide being asked.

82
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is all I need to which means

83
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm using

84
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Pills, Heroin, then that's it. That's all I need. I don't need this talk therapy. I don't need nothing else. I just need to not be using heroin or short acting opiates. Do you do that thought. Do you have that thought.

85
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Under five I tried to force sobriety on others, you don't

86
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.830
Shaun W.: Stop. I stopped talking to somebody, because he he was getting it. So I told him.

87
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.410
Shaun W.: He just got off so I stopped talking to him.

88
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:15.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now, don't you think that's a little different than forcing my sobriety don't think you just set a limit you protected your recovery. That's different than oh hey you on the street. Come here is another way. Come here.

89
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.980
Shaun W.: No, but at the same time. I'm telling a mom. I'm not going to eat all with you if you're getting high.

90
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's you, setting a boundary Sean it real. That's wise and I think anyone in recovery treatment would say good job to you.

91
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not you knocking on doors and saying, Hey, try this recovery thing. It's better than the way you're living your life you're protecting your own aren't you protecting your own sobriety by pulling away.

92
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you say do you say yes to number five.

93
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:02.430
Shaun W.: Kinda, yeah cuz I was trying to force somebody to get off because he just got out and I stopped in your on them.

94
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me how you forced him to

95
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.740
Shaun W.: I was just, I wasn't forcing them, but I was trying to get him to stop.

96
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.830
Gwenevere Abriel: How to try

97
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.930
Shaun W.: John mccain Kiki with the music tonight. Okay.

98
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So you leverage the relationship. Yeah.

99
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I could see that I could see how you go with a yes on that. Let's go to number six, I became overconfident about my recovery.

100
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.280
No.

101
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: No. So you have some uncertainty.

102
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

103
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Number seven.

104
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I avoid talking about my problems and my recovery.

105
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.370
Shaun W.: No.

106
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So who do you talk to

107
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.430
Shaun W.: Memory. Yeah, talk to you.

108
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:03.660
You talk

109
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: A little a little miss because we're not connecting in group and we're not, we had a little test with every other week and we had

110
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: A mister

111
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.780
Mister

112
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.860
Shaun W.: Mister, we used to have Miss every other week.

113
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I did not

114
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't know

115
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but you're, you're, you're not bothered by only only me you're you don't long to want to have more people that you can kind of let it all hang and just kind of like say

116
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.550
Shaun W.: I really don't.

117
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.490
Shaun W.: Know, I really don't care to think they're talking my palms other people. There's really no other business.

118
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, number eight.

119
00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:15.030
Gwenevere Abriel: You said yes to this one I behave. I think you did. Again, there's some disconnect on today, you said yes to them and I see what yet. Number eight is it's I behave compulsively I overwork are under work I overtalk or withdraw, etc. So what do you feel is your compulsive behavior.

120
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.440
Shaun W.: All of them.

121
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Really overwhelmed.

122
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.980
Shaun W.: Because sometimes I sometimes I will work on the words sometimes I don't shut up.

123
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.700
Okay.

124
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.380
Shaun W.: Sometimes I do it, I don't talk at all. Yeah.

125
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So it swings, like the pendulum swings wide.

126
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I gotcha.

127
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you see that that might be a risk factor for substance use down the line, how, what's the connection between those two do you think

128
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see any connection.

129
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.250
No, no.

130
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's something from us to explore. Let's keep. Let's see if I can get all of this. It's such a long list.

131
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Each one

132
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just going to do. Okay. Um,

133
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I overreact to stressful situations. What about that one.

134
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.180
Shaun W.: Yeah, sometimes.

135
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Think so. Okay, let's see. Yes. And then number 10 I start isolating myself.

136
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

137
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Number 11 I become preoccupied with one area of my life. So that's maybe where the stuff comes in.

138
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Say yes or no. What do you think

139
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.040
Yeah.

140
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I start having minor depressions. So there's sort of right not enjoying activities as much not really appetite might start going down additional sleeping or disrupted sleep things sort of those

141
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: The signs of depression sneaking in

142
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: 12 to know

143
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.300

00:26:38.610 --> 00:27:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Eating and if you're going around most days like this. I don't know about my own life. Isn't that that is listless that's I I'm anxious. I don't understand like you didn't give me sentences. You just said about life about my life but that would be a sign.

295
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Of depression. I think that's an important one. I think we could probably spend quite a bit of time on that. That's a yes let's go to 31 you said yes to I sporadically at a, I don't know whether you

296
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.660
Shaun W.: Know I said no.

297
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:21.090
Gwenevere Abriel: 32 I develop. I don't care attitude.

298
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.740
Shaun W.: Yeah, when I get mad.

299
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:26.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

300
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And has that ever preceded a relapse. Like, I don't care. This is stupid.

301
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.900
Shaun W.: I haven't read launched yet.

302
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me rephrase, have you ever had an i don't care attitude preceded which means came before a slip

303
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:49.620
Shaun W.: Yeah.

304
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty common. That's pretty big. I call it the efforts.

305
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:59.310
Shaun W.: You know what it is. I noticed when I start not carry and I start thinking mom going all out.

306
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that's the buckets right there.

307
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care. They don't care Phuket

308
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a real high risk moment right there because there's nothing to stop you there.

309
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we're adults.

310
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And if we can't think, oh, I'm on probation, parole. Some to keep me on extremely motivated. If I'm not internally motivated. It's a real high risk moment. Are you having any of those recently.

311
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:34.230
Shaun W.: No reason I was when I went on the run, last time. Okay.

312
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: If you start if they start sneaking in I definitely want to know, because those are red flags, right, if there's this like reservation. We're preparing for a relapse.

313
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Slick this this stuff it's it's progressive. Okay.

314
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but I was 33. What's that one.

315
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Ooh, I hoard money sex or power.

316
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.610
Shaun W.: No, no.

317
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: 30 foot above above, for I openly reject help

318
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you recognize if you were doing that. And then that would be indeed a sign that you might

319
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:23.940
Shaun W.: Think that's

320
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.140
Shaun W.: That's gonna be on a person to person basis. Right.

321
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you know, I mean, obviously there's a short little sentences, but Sean has it ever been where

322
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You are setting yourself up for a slip where you were pushing away. People who cared about you, who wanted your sobriety, maybe even more than you did and you pushed it away and you said, I ain't worth it. Don't worry about. I got this. I don't

323
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:53.370
Shaun W.: Know,

324
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:59.220
Shaun W.: I don't know too many people that really gives us. It really that much. So I don't think there's too many people are really

325
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

326
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok I got good

327
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.210
Shaun W.: people sit back in

328
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so help in your life.

329
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, where does that exist where because if most of us are kind of full of shit. We don't really care about you. Right. How can you trust that the help is real and genuine

330
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.790
Shaun W.: Because it's not

331
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just take over the last month, look at number 34 and and honestly answer to yourself.

332
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you do that.

333
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think

334
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:51.840
Yeah.

335
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.690
Shaun W.: You get on me. I hope I can do it myself.

336
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:58.560
Yeah.

337
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The phrase that kind of helps me in those moments are things like this, my highest thought got me where I am today.

338
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: My best thought got my ass using here, right.

339
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.320
That's what I do.

340
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.740
Shaun W.: Almost relapse like two weeks ago.

341
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.980
Shaun W.: And then I said, I said, why would I risk my life for one day.

342
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Here you go.

343
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And you answered back what I just want to know what you answered yourself back with. Why would I risked my life for one day. What did you answer back with

344
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.940
Shaun W.: That's just what I told myself that I didn't do it.

345
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about the life

346
00:31:50.640 --> 00:32:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life that you are worth more than a temporary euphoric experience to me about what you value in your life, Sean.

347
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.660
Shaun W.: You seems like all my value everything I'm valuing is

348
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.070
Shaun W.: I guess I don't think

349
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I get deep right away. You're just trying to give me a little fun to make it all philosophical idea.

350
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:59.730
Gwenevere Abriel: But look what you did, you were able to say instead of i don't care asset you went to. I do care. I'm worth it. I'm my life is worth more than a short term fix high scape what I pressed in just now on was let's name those things and it is a little difficult for you to name them to say

351
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: These are the things that are important to me because, remember, remember, earlier you were saying I have some confusion.

352
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You may not know what it is that you value, but they're there. And I think maybe in here, be able to sort of solidify. Some of those

353
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: A one of them can't one of them be. You know what, there's a fighting chance I might have a

354
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: rockin relationship with my daughter and my son. There's a fighting chance I might. I'm gonna stick around for that. What if that's it. What if it's just a glimmer of like I might. It might be awesome. What about that.

355
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: But is it what kept you from using

356
00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.950
Shaun W.: Using was I want to live. I don't want to live like yeah

357
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice how I'm asking you, what does it mean to have a life.

358
00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, it's hard to answer.

359
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.470
Shaun W.: The thing is, I don't know yet what that is what it is to have a legit.

360
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay these questions that you're sitting with right now I think are going to get you there though your ears. You notice how these are things you probably sit with on a regular basis.

361
00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: They're hard to hard to look at all of us.

362
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:34.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at 35. Let me see if I have done it right yeah 35 I develop aches and pains.

363
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Or, sorry about that. Just. Is that a yes or no. What do you think

364
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:40.890
Shaun W.: No.

365
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll go with that. I'm 36 I'm rationalize that my using

366
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe make my life worse than it is now.

367
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.070
No.

368
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You do you see the how that would be a red flag. If you were starting to have that thought.

369
00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that the justifying use maybe it may be something like that you've made, did you consider it a couple weeks ago maybe could it be even worse or, couldn't it be you probably sat with

370
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: 37 I feel powerless.

371
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.190
Shaun W.: Sometimes

372
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: 38

373
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.030
Sometimes

374
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: 39

375
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I have fantasies about using

376
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.960
Shaun W.: Yeah, sometimes.

377
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: 40. What's that one I begin to lock.

378
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.560
Console.

379
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: My unconsciously.

380
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.880
Shaun W.: July I don't sit there and live like that. Another layer like that.

381
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Is

382
00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:00.930
Shaun W.: I know I hold on, hold on, I know everyone lives, but I'm not one of those people that just sit there and like just make up stories like

383
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:07.320
Shaun W.: If I lie. It's probably to the police's on but it's mostly the lion to my friends and families. And I'll tell you the truth.

384
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And what about omission.

385
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Is omission, the same as a commission, you know the distinction between those two.

386
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.690
Shaun W.: No I don't Oh mission is like your meeting right

387
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's the other way. Our mission is I say here like this. I'm quiet.

388
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:31.290
Gwenevere Abriel: But really, I was thinking of using I didn't say anything.

389
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.020
Shaun W.: Yeah. What is the word omission.

390
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: To not so when you're talking to somebody you say you can you can be

391
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Dissing genuine right

392
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: By co mission, which means I said she's a turkey. Well, that's obviously we all heard it. We saw it, you know, you wrote the text, but a co mission is I deliberately

393
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:13.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Didn't do something I deliberately didn't say something and the whole plan fell apart. But it was a necessary piece. So by omission. The whole thing fell apart you when you're withholding the truth that that's an omission. It's

394
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.860
Shaun W.: Still fun. That's not me. Don't, don't do that.

395
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think of people

396
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That decide not to share what's going on with them.

397
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.850
Shaun W.: I think that's good because that's their, their palms. Everyone has their own problems. So just leave it to themselves.

398
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we'll come back to that. Let's keep going 41 I increase my use of aspirin non prescription medication. So, that can be a red flag to right we're starting to increase King

399
00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes it's drinking. Sometimes it's you're starting to pull out the buprenorphine. Look at it, man. I can take more of it right now, or actually start doing it. That would be

400
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's actually self medicating behavior, actually. But do you ever do that where you're increasing non

401
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.710
Shaun W.: stink. No, but I was thinking about going on buying more you just buy it off the streets.

402
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.130
Shaun W.: But I'm not gonna do that.

403
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm proud of you, because that's

404
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You were faced with something a couple weeks ago and I, I did not know, right, because that wasn't shared and you didn't get the help

405
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You did it on your own. And it's impressive, but it got risky.

406
00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not automatic for you to think

407
00:38:46.350 --> 00:39:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I can reach out for help. And I'm guessing it's because you don't really believe a that I give a shit or that anyone in group gives a shit or that the doctor cares. And so maybe you cut yourself off from health because we believe we don't care.

408
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:06.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Possible.

409
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:12.630
Shaun W.: I know you don't care. You're just you're this, your job is making money.

410
00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.000
Shaun W.: You don't care about this one is nothing nothing to you.

411
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

412
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:26.280
Shaun W.: I know you don't care, man. Just know that this is a job and this is how you make your money. That's how you make your living

413
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you think of the fools that don't think the way you think that they actually feel my unconditional regard for them. Do you think they're idiots suckers.

414
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.450
Shaun W.: Things are global.

415
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:46.590
Hmm.

416
00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm a trickster to

417
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: In its raw form. I'm also

418
00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:59.010
Shaun W.: You're, you're a trickster you use words with which you know which most of us can't

419
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:08.520
Shaun W.: Have the definitions to so you'll start playing with us. I didn't say that. I didn't ask you that. Because a lot of people don't understand love the words you say

420
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:11.280
Shaun W.: The education on here is not good.

421
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you like education on

422
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.110
Shaun W.: Nothing.

423
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what do you mean to help me understand because those are words. I don't understand. What do you mean education not good on here. What does that mean, like,

424
00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.400
Shaun W.: We don't understand a lot of stuff you say because you use words that we can

425
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:35.250
Shaun W.: We don't identify yes we don't

426
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:45.090
Shaun W.: We don't know the definitions. A lot of people won't say nothing goes act like they know the definition, but they don't say nothing. So use words because you're you're

427
00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:51.090
Shaun W.: You're, you're more school did honestly I don't know us you can play mind games with those

428
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.110
Shaun W.: are trained to play mind games.

429
00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:56.970
Shaun W.: Okay.

430
00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it'd be very difficult to accept my care. You really gotta

431
00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.790
Shaun W.: You gotta be anybody. I guess that's just the way it is. It's going to be any counselor, I get

432
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: No, but it's important. And so we just lingered on it a little bit longer. We stayed on a little bit longer.

433
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Or cursor here doing great.

434
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:25.470
Shaun W.: I had a few weird, they didn't want to let me in this morning. They're all i only already that event.

435
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.880
Shaun W.: Like there's something going on. So I didn't know, I started to like do something going on because

436
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:31.680
Shaun W.: He didn't know that I could hear

437
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that doesn't add to your concert people's

438
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:43.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Tear does it

439
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:50.640
Shaun W.: Know, because I haven't. I've read, I'm wondering, to my mind, why you're doing this right here because they haven't we done this before.

440
00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I have no

441
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.680
Shaun W.: You know,

442
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to ask me a question.

443
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.160
Shaun W.: No, I did this ask you a question. You said you have no idea.

444
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't ask me a question. You said I

445
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.540
Shaun W.: Did I said, haven't we done this before.

446
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You said

447
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.260
Shaun W.: You said, I have no idea.

448
00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm wondering if we've done this before.

449
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.930
Shaun W.: I didn't see it, but I'm wondering

450
00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's record it.

451
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.360
Shaun W.: It doesn't

452
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.610
Shaun W.: The replay it back, playing back then.

453
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't right now, we can do it next time.

454
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:23.580
Shaun W.: That's not what I said.

455
00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: So right, we could spend the whole time playing that and then you don't get the benefit of doing the activity, but

456
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:42.180
Shaun W.: You put this on, because you're trying to figure out that you can help me. So just transfer me to another counselor. Then, if that's what you're trying to do.

457
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:51.240
Shaun W.: If that's what you're trying to do, because that's, I think that's why you're doing this right here so you can just transfer me to another counselor. Do you want

458
00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So mistrusting i mean i mean i listened to your stories and I think about how

459
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You haven't

460
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't finished my son's. What was I gonna say

461
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:11.850
Shaun W.: Boy, you can see when

462
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: He's gonna say I think about, like, right now I'm thinking, how can I ask Sean TO TRUST ME WHEN HE HASN'T HAD AN attuned reliable relationship with

463
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.680
Shaun W.: I don't even know what what

464
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Certainly with your mom has been a shit storm.

465
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, I represent that I represent yet one more person who's gonna let you down, not be honest be full of shit have another agenda and and I know that and I

466
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm so I'm still here. I, I know my intention. So even though I hear you. I know, I know how much I care about my clients, so I'm not worried I'm not

467
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:55.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I know how how I care.

468
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: But I just think about how

469
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You robbed.

470
00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Of being able to benefit from this because you don't trust who saying it like all these

471
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:12.690
Shaun W.: I don't trust. Nobody when

472
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, I know. And I know that. And I know I'm in line with everybody else.

473
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm here.

474
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know I all I can do is keep showing up, even when you might be irritated or confused or frustrated, any number of things. All I can do is show up anyway and show you I'm I'm invested

475
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, that's all I can do. Right.

476
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:39.570
Shaun W.: Yeah.

477
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't expect trust to come easily because of your history. I don't expect it. I really don't.

478
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.620
Shaun W.: I trusted you, a little bit though I'm open to you. Sure.

479
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:53.460
Yeah.

480
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And

481
00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And yeah, it is hard. It's, it's difficult to to care to think I have some insight into

482
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: How confusing. It would be for you to be in a world where you want connection with people, but then you don't trust the people that you want to connect with

483
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want, I want to give you these pieces.

484
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:28.800
Gwenevere Abriel: But this thing where you kind of push help away. It does happen quite a bit.

485
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.410
Shaun W.: To get close to somebody to start pushing the morning

486
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, look, in my mind, Sean, that's logical because you're going to get hurt. Eventually, aren't you, someone was why why why Mr. Hardy.

487
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.110
No.

488
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I get it.

489
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:55.020
Gwenevere Abriel: We do.

490
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we do, let's put a little pin in this one for just a moment and just notice just notice what that was like in here who be able to say to me.

491
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:18.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you just, you're just here for money. And I know you don't care about and everybody else believes that you actually care. They're gullible. Like what is that like to be you.

492
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.550
Shaun W.: Know,

493
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that part of the confusion about life.

494
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:30.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

495
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.640
Shaun W.: So cold world out there.

496
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing

497
00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: How sweet and kind people can be

498
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:48.870
Shaun W.: Yeah.

499
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't get to have one another.

500
00:46:53.310 --> 00:47:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: The promise of this life is we're going to love deeply and risk grief. It will seem like it will tear us apart.

501
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But they exist at the same time, we don't get one without the other. That's the deal with being human, and I wish I could tell somebody. Everybody, it'll just be this one thing and just be loving and sweet but to risk that kind of intimacy is to risk BONE CRUSHING heartache.

502
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, just a promise, this being a human. It's just, that's the deal.

503
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: How you doing,

504
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.930
More

505
00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think in our own unique way. You are not

506
00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Addressed in our own style are going to be or Sean way do you think we addressed the pink elephant in the room in our own way. Do you think we did

507
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:08.700
Shaun W.: Yeah.

508
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I do too. Right. We use I saw a little bit of humor. You got to be straight shooter, didn't she got to say straight up what you think, feel, believe and proceed right with me and I stake right here tonight.

509
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't name call you. I didn't run away. I didn't shame you just stay right here.

510
00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:32.250
Shaun W.: Trained

511
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:37.740
Shaun W.: Trained individual

512
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.710
Shaun W.: You mix your words up and confused people

513
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:44.400
Shaun W.: You're good at it.

514
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you

515
00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel

516
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:50.580
Shaun W.: A lot

517
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

518
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:55.710
Shaun W.: Yeah.

519
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know that you can always say, and I thought I was really good at saying three or four different words in case I run across a word that's

520
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:10.590
Shaun W.: Not

521
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.620
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot. But I could do that.

522
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.800
Shaun W.: You're smart. Yeah, you're very smart person.

523
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:21.660
Shaun W.: You're gay. You know what girls with their language like with words. Girls are very good with it like

524
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:27.990
Shaun W.: I don't know if they have to learn to grow up to use that because they're there. The week or the species. I think you guys are smarter. Use your mind.

525
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: We do have. We do have an inclination towards more language we we do females do

526
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.030
Shaun W.: Okay, that's, that's a college for real, because I can notice that

527
00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:39.690
Shaun W.: Girls.

528
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it yeah we

529
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: We, we have this other thing, too. So we have this grass of words. First of all, we can grab them real quick. We also females. And I'm not going to go with were weak but physically yes we have smaller muscle mass and we're tend to be shorter

530
00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: It, but I did not leave her

531
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.060
Shaun W.: Hey, but you and I know

532
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: This is an important piece, though. So when you want to give yourself a hard time

533
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: females tend to have the ability to see connections between things in systems like they're going to see a relationship between something happening. We're going to probably see it so much faster. It's not because better. It's because different brain.

534
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:35.220
Shaun W.: I think it's because you guys had to you guys have learned to have to adapt to be the interior of the species so

535
00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:36.390
Shaun W.: You guys have to

536
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:49.110
Shaun W.: Buy sister. My mom everybody's arguing either. I say, you guys have rights because men allow it.

537
00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.410
Shaun W.: We allow you to have it.

538
00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for giving me my rights.

539
00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:56.160
Shaun W.: You're welcome.

540
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.220
Shaun W.: But you know it's true.

541
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.000
Shaun W.: We allow it.

542
00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:10.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You want me to tell you what the actual argument against that is

543
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:11.280
Shaun W.: What Toby.

544
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You ready

545
00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:13.920
Shaun W.: Yeah.

546
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what your sister and your mother need to come back with that.

547
00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:18.510
Shaun W.: Yeah, you

548
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Need to be like, You are so terrified by the amazing power that I can create life.

549
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:26.370
Shaun W.: Ah,

550
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:32.220
Shaun W.: Oh my god. Hey, bold on your hold on that life and you came from me.

551
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:46.770
Shaun W.: You're just the AIG. You're just a guy that life is the key for me. Hey, every baby has 2% more than that every child has 2% more I watched on the world news he said every single child they found out has 2% more of the dead.

552
00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It terrified. And so you oppress us. That's my finally

553
00:51:51.060 --> 00:52:01.050
Shaun W.: Killed by the right, hey, you know what, that's crazy hunks of the world suppresses women bad, like I feel bad for when when I look at that, like those other countries. I think what the

554
00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:02.490
Right.

555
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing. Have you ever watched that there's a video out there. It is friggin amazing how I mean you watch the sperm and the whole thing and just like this is just, it's a miracle and yeah

556
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.980
Shaun W.: Anyway, I think. Remember that sperm is what gives life.

557
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:24.900
Shaun W.: Just

558
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.100
Shaun W.: Women are equal. I'm telling you, you pick a woman off. There's no though.

559
00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you know, equal but different and right. It's both. It's like you need you and

560
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:41.520
Shaun W.: And as long as I'll never I'll never understand a woman will never understand me.

561
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what if

562
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:51.870
Shaun W.: We don't have to want you because you're a counselor. So you want to understand. Don't it'll bother you, it'll kill you if you don't understand, it'll drive you nuts.

563
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I have

564
00:52:54.180 --> 00:53:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I have science. So I can say, you know what I get, how I might have this inclination to be able to hold on to words and systems, a little easier than maybe

565
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: The male brain might have a more

566
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of ability to sort of store knowledge and sit with sort of concrete information, a little longer than I will. I might expand it very quickly and they might sort of sit with sequence, a little bit more than I will.

567
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And I find it. I don't find it better. I just see it as different and I like it. I see it as more like Yang Yang kind of thing. But again, I'm paid to think that way. Right.

568
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: All right.

569
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to go through this again. When are you going to tolerate me again. When do I get paid again.

570
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.220
