00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.440
Dominique Pozo: Hi.

2
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.070
Dianna Jaramillo: How are you there. I was on hold with them for geez like 15 minutes they kept me on hold.

3
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.480
Dominique Pozo: Oh, no problem. So I say, you know, if you want to take your camera off. That'll save some data for you. Do you want to

4
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay, yeah, I want to do.

5
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.780
Dominique Pozo: That let's do that.

6
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.590
Dominique Pozo: Save your data and then we'll, we'll see if there's times when it would be helpful. Like if you make any art for me to see that, then

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.810
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay, we'll take it off.

8
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.910
Dominique Pozo: And then you can bring it back on. Okay.

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.620
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay, let's see here.

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.720
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay, there

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.900
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. So how are you doing

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.700
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm, I'm okay. I guess it's going to kind of the same, I suppose, is the other day just just here and

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.410
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know. You know, things are just still kind of

14
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Weird it's it's it's weird, cuz like everybody

15
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:18.540
Dianna Jaramillo: Everybody that I have talked to her any of my friends or anything like that. Everybody just feels the same. It's kind of tense, like there's this

16
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:30.300
Dianna Jaramillo: This tense negative vibe. It's just everywhere. It just feels it just feels awful like people really aren't taking care of themselves, right now, and everybody's just really stressed out and

17
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:39.270
Dianna Jaramillo: And handling things very well, you know, so I'm really just trying to stay away as much as I can from from all of it, but

18
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.900
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, it's, it's kind of the same, you know, nothing's really better or worse or anything.

19
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.520
Dominique Pozo: What are you trying to stay away from the people that are negative or from what

20
00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:07.590
Dianna Jaramillo: Or like everybody. Cuz everybody that I've gone around so like last night, my friend and her husband. They came over and everything was fine were cooking were making hamburgers and stuff and

21
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:17.040
Dianna Jaramillo: And after a little while, like they started fighting and it was really bad. And it was like over nothing. And

22
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.790
Dianna Jaramillo: And so we ended up just taking them home and it was just awful. It ended up being really awful.

23
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.570
Dominique Pozo: Shoot. Yeah. So there's yeah there's a lot of stress right now.

24
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:41.100
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, all over the place. And then these are like, we don't really hang out with anybody. And we have another couple that that we hang out with once in a great while and you know and then it ended up like that. So it's sucked.

25
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.340
Dominique Pozo: Um, yeah, that sounds disappointing. It's

26
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.440
Dominique Pozo: Like it could have been really

27
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.870
Dominique Pozo: Special to have some connection with people, but

28
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.060
Dominique Pozo: It wasn't yeah uplifting.

29
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.840
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

30
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.190
Dominique Pozo: Exactly. That's what I

31
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.470
Dianna Jaramillo: was hoping for. But yeah, not so much.

32
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.280
Yeah.

33
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.620
Dominique Pozo: Well,

34
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.090
Dominique Pozo: Did you, how did you take care of yourself for the rest of the night last night.

35
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.090
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh, I was fine. We we

36
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.850
Dianna Jaramillo: We just hung out really me and me and Eric. We just hung out and we just put on a movie and maybe we talked about it, like, you know, what the hell was that and and

37
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.770
Dianna Jaramillo: And it was a queer. We were actually really

38
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.760
Dianna Jaramillo: thankful that we're not like that. And, you know, so it was actually a good talk that we ended up having because of that. So,

39
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.930
Dianna Jaramillo: So, you know, it was, it was fine. It was disappointing.

40
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.100
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm first but

41
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.320
Dianna Jaramillo: But it was it ended up fine. I mean, like we had a good conversation and

42
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.870
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, major s'mores.

43
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.790
Dominique Pozo: Sweet.

44
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.970
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, and it. And so it was good. It was fine.

45
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:56.250
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh. That's great. So it sounds like it kind of highlighted. So what are some of the things that work really well between you and Eric

46
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.170
Dianna Jaramillo: Um,

47
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Um, well.

48
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.360
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, I think, like, we're

49
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.600
Dianna Jaramillo: We're really similar. And so

50
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:24.600
Dianna Jaramillo: We see a lot of the same things the same way we see eye to eye on a lot of things like most things and so things are pretty much stable between us, for the most part we're or

51
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.910
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, we're pretty good match but but like when it, when there is an argument or

52
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.970
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, like, not really an argument, but I don't know it, it can go from the just bad to really horrible really, really fast.

53
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.470
Dominique Pozo: With you and Eric

54
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.340
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

55
00:04:47.790 --> 00:05:04.710
Dianna Jaramillo: Okay but but that doesn't happen very often it happens. Rarely, but when it happens, it's really awful like it leaves me feeling really insecure and and just totally not stable and just really awful for days after

56
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.690
Dominique Pozo: Well, I can imagine, because from what I've heard, you're not working.

57
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.650
Dominique Pozo: You're

58
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.700
Dominique Pozo: You know, you're kind of living there with him. And I don't know if he's supporting you all

59
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:24.480
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. Well, well, not now. I mean, he's not working at all right now. He hasn't worked for a few months now. And so it's been

60
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:36.180
Dianna Jaramillo: Really hard and he's, he's a worker. He's worked his whole entire life, he's a hard worker and so to not be working is really stressful for him, he, he hates it. And he hates just being stuck at home and

61
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.570
Dianna Jaramillo: So there's been a lot of extra tension there for sure.

62
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:50.820
Dianna Jaramillo: And and and you know he's in recovery to, like, they said, and like he doesn't ever want to use it. He doesn't think about using or talk about using or anything.

63
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.480
Dianna Jaramillo: But one thing is that like once in a while. He'll drink water drink.

64
00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.210
Dianna Jaramillo: And that's when I get worried because when he drinks. He completely changes.

65
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.140
Dominique Pozo: Well that's, that's another addiction, for sure. And

66
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:13.890
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, especially you know if he's not doing it every night. But it sounds like there's, it's a it's a way that he's something he's using to cope that

67
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.290
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, exactly. And I've tried to

68
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:25.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Get into that with him and just sort of talk, talk about it and you know just discuss what's going on there and

69
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.960
Dianna Jaramillo: And he kind of clams up. He's not a really

70
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:40.230
Dianna Jaramillo: Open person he he's very, very privately. He keeps a lot of things really inside. He's an introvert like crazy.

71
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:51.360
Dianna Jaramillo: And he keeps things he keeps things, you know, really deep inside, he doesn't get he doesn't. It's like real surface. Most of the time with him so that that makes things kind of weird to

72
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Uh huh. Yeah.

73
00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:03.930
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's focus since he's not here with us today. Let's focus on your part. And what you can do to keep taking care of yourself it, but it sounds like right now things are okay you but

74
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.530
Dominique Pozo: Sometimes, there could be a blow out but right now.

75
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:13.710
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, yeah. Right now, it's, it's, kind of, okay, I mean, there was a thing that happened.

76
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.070
Dianna Jaramillo: A couple nights ago where he

77
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:28.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Did drink and and he just kind of turns on me all out of the blue just totally out of the blue. He'll just turn on me and like for really no reason. He'll just make something up in his mind and just explode.

78
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:42.240
Dianna Jaramillo: And you know that happened a couple days ago. And I'm after a long time to, you know, it's been, gosh, like a month, I guess, and something like that happened and

79
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.710
Dianna Jaramillo: And

80
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:53.820
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, it still feels really unstable for me. And so I I think about it in the back of my mind, like, you know, what if

81
00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:00.690
Dianna Jaramillo: Something happened. You know, like, what, what would I do, how could I take care of myself, how could I be okay.

82
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.460
Dianna Jaramillo: How would they be okay. And, you know, how would I handle things. And what would I do and

83
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.500
Dianna Jaramillo: Just to have some kind of a plan, just in case you know

84
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.880
Dianna Jaramillo: And so that's kind of still where my mind is, I don't

85
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:24.030
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, I just, I'm not, I'm not even really sure, because I don't have anybody. I don't have any fallback whatsoever. I don't have

86
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.630
Dianna Jaramillo: You know family here or

87
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.250
Dianna Jaramillo: Anything I mean my, my parents, but you know the situation there.

88
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:42.300
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Gotcha. Sounds like even more like I know I've been witnessing you with your parents having to just bring your energy into yourself and learn how to take care of yourself and

89
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:59.220
Dominique Pozo: It's not that you don't want to be dependent on are interdependent with Eric, but it also seems like there's another call to keep thinking, okay, how can I best take care of yourself because can't. At this point, I can't expect anyone else to do it fully so

90
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.100
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah.

91
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:09.390
Dominique Pozo: Great. So what are some of the things you've come up with as far as okay you know and I don't want to catastrophizing. I don't want to

92
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.050
Dianna Jaramillo: Wait for

93
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.920
Dominique Pozo: That but I just

94
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.900
Dominique Pozo: Write it whether Eric was in the picture or not. How could you best take care of yourself.

95
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.110
Dianna Jaramillo: Right. Right. Exactly. And I've

96
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.020
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean I all I can really come up with is that, you know, I would just be alone and

97
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.950
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean, my, my only option without him and or a vehicle.

98
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:47.430
Dianna Jaramillo: There's this little gas station. That's really close to where we live, and I could always easily get a job there and walk running back and forth and you know when when they start hiring again and and and and just

99
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:56.040
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, be by myself and then we'd be really weird because we've been in this House, we got it together. And I'm, um,

100
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.140
Dianna Jaramillo: You know his

101
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:11.340
Dianna Jaramillo: all his stuff is here and like it would just, it would be really, really weird. And obviously, I mean, I know that you know Breakups are awful and getting used to a whole new life is

102
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:22.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Awful. And it can be really hard and everything, but you know if that happened. What choice what I have. I would have to just sort of get used to

103
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:33.780
Dianna Jaramillo: Get used to things and just get used to being alone and hopefully I'm sure I would be able to easily get a job at that gas station and at least, I would have that, you know, to

104
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.410
Dianna Jaramillo: Take my time and and

105
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.580
Dianna Jaramillo: Have a job and at least be bringing in some money.

106
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.380
Dominique Pozo: Oh, so do you envision that you would still cohabitate you just wouldn't be together.

107
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.330
Dianna Jaramillo: No, no, he would leave

108
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.710
Dominique Pozo: Oh, he would be okay.

109
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.700
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah

110
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.930
Dominique Pozo: Well, it doesn't seem. I mean, is that something that you're considering

111
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:18.210
Dianna Jaramillo: If, as if worse came to worse and and he ended up leaving or whatever the situation where we just didn't end up making it. That's, that's all I would be able to do there. There's nothing else because I don't have a vehicle. I can get the kind of job that I would

112
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:37.230
Dianna Jaramillo: Want to get, you know, by going to Santa Fe, or traveling whatsoever because I live in the middle of nowhere and the only walk. The only thing that's walking distance is that little gas station. So I would sort of have no other choice but to do that and hopefully try and save enough to

113
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:45.180
Dianna Jaramillo: Be able to get a vehicle. I mean, as a matter of fact, I'm hoping if and when the that stimulus check comes through that.

114
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.040
Dianna Jaramillo: I can you know maybe look at a vehicle or

115
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:57.960
Dianna Jaramillo: Something like that. I mean, I'm a few months behind on the rent already. And I'm really thankful for this landlord was a friend of mine before

116
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:13.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Before I ever had him as a landlord and he's he's really I'm so thankful for him, he's, he doesn't bit your bug about money or, you know, he knows the situation. Totally. So he's he's really cool. He's been really

117
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.080
Dianna Jaramillo: Great to us now. With all this going on so

118
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.510
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

119
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.900
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, so I don't know. I mean, I would like to be able to pay him something if I get that check but um

120
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.240
Dianna Jaramillo: I would also like to have a vehicle, just so I have some kind of backup plan.

121
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.590
Dominique Pozo: Yeah yeah

122
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.550
Dianna Jaramillo: Just in case.

123
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.150
You know,

124
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:46.710
Dominique Pozo: So when I hear everything you're saying it sounds a little bit unsteady like you know

125
00:12:47.070 --> 00:13:00.060
Dianna Jaramillo: David, it is it's it is unsteady in it. It's always been unsteady honestly like there's been very few times that I've actually felt like we were solid like between me and him there's, it's been

126
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.440
Dianna Jaramillo: In the last year that we've been together. It's been like

127
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:14.190
Dianna Jaramillo: Maybe twice that I actually felt like we were actually solid and like, you know, we would be able to work through stuff, but the more

128
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.560
Dianna Jaramillo: The more I

129
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.380
Dianna Jaramillo: Learned him and know him.

130
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.140
Dianna Jaramillo: The less secure I feel

131
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.550
Dominique Pozo: Uh huh huh

132
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:31.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah. And so right now it's, you know, honestly, like I really, really care about him. I really do love him. But, um,

133
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:34.920
Dianna Jaramillo: It just feels like

134
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.280
Dianna Jaramillo: You know anything could happen. Anything could change on on in a heartbeat.

135
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:54.750
Dianna Jaramillo: And like I said, like we do get along, like, really, for the most part, like 90% of the time, everything's good. And we're fine. But he is impossible to talk to if if an issue comes up.

136
00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:07.950
Dianna Jaramillo: He refuses to talk he would rather explode. And that's not me. I, I'll say it down and I'll try and have a conversation and and i'm i'm i know compassionate communication and they know

137
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:17.130
Dianna Jaramillo: How to, you know, communicate in those kinds of situations and he is the furthest

138
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.020
Dianna Jaramillo: From that he does not

139
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:29.910
Dianna Jaramillo: Talk. He does not communicate, he doesn't get deep down into feelings or anything like that like he'd rather just exploded and walk up he would just rather walk out of the situation, walk away.

140
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.700
Dominique Pozo: That's really hard to work to work with.

141
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:42.570
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, it's, it's impossible to to talk to him. So you know I don't know I don't know what's gonna happen or where this is going. It kind of feels like convenience.

142
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.410
Dominique Pozo: Really

143
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:55.830
Dianna Jaramillo: Cuz he doesn't he doesn't really talk to me about our relationship or you know where we're going or where he wants to be or, you know, anything like that. So it just kind of feels like

144
00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:08.100
Dianna Jaramillo: We're just sort of here in limbo, and we get along. We laugh. We have fun. We, you know, do all kinds of cool stuff together. Yeah, but, um,

145
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.720
Dianna Jaramillo: It's like it's kind of like time bomb is what it feels like.

146
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.460
Dominique Pozo: That sounds kind of scary like just waiting for something

147
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.690
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that's

148
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.560
Dianna Jaramillo: That's how it's been for for an entire year.

149
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:36.810
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, like I just don't know what's going to happen any day any day. Anything could happen. And I just feel so thankful on the days that nothing happens. And we get along and everything's

150
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.390
Dianna Jaramillo: Good. And I just try and

151
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.750
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, keep things calm and

152
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:49.140
Dianna Jaramillo: And yeah, he's got a lot of issues. He's got a lot of anger stuff for sure.

153
00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.570
Dianna Jaramillo: So it's hard to, it's hard to know what's going to happen. So I just

154
00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:01.620
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, my gosh, I just felt like the my blood pressure must be a mess, you know,

155
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.070
Dianna Jaramillo: Because I just never know. And I just, I just want everything to be okay but

156
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.750
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, I really just have to take care of myself. I really do.

157
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:25.050
Dominique Pozo: Well, I didn't expect to hear this from how we started the session by you sharing that your friends came and got into a fight, and then you and Eric kind of thing, like how grateful you are that you weren't like that.

158
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.790
Dominique Pozo: And now I'm yeah actually maybe there's more than I thought.

159
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:46.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely. And that's why, you know, I was really, I was really happy because we got to talk about that later. Wasn't any deep conversation or anything, but it was like we saw them treating each other that way and

160
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:55.830
Dianna Jaramillo: And the way he talked to me after that, after we went and drop them off was like you know he was

161
00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.540
Dianna Jaramillo: He was thankful and and he rarely talks like that, you know, like you

162
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:11.040
Dianna Jaramillo: Really will get get into any kind of feelings in a conversation. But he said, you know, said he was so thankful that we're not like that and and you know that

163
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.960
Dianna Jaramillo: That we're

164
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:20.610
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know. I really honestly don't even know how he sees us how he sees our relationship or how he sees me. I really don't know.

165
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:30.210
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, but once in a while, he'll do something like that or say certain things that are just surprising and and makes me feel like, Okay, we're going to be, you know, we're okay. We're going to be okay.

166
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:37.020
Dianna Jaramillo: But i don't know i i can't really see how I could make it in a relationship with someone who is

167
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.570
Dianna Jaramillo: Just, just has serious, serious anger issues.

168
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.300
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it sounds like there's not much intimacy happening.

169
00:17:48.840 --> 00:18:01.560
Dominique Pozo: Right. And, you know, from my experience with you. You're very easy to you can easily. You know, dive down and talk about deep things and really feel through them. And so that's

170
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:07.290
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like it's not that satisfying

171
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:14.100
Dianna Jaramillo: No, no, it's not. It's not. I wish I had the kind of

172
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.860
Dianna Jaramillo: Closeness like a like a closeness with him.

173
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:20.850
Then

174
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.220
Dianna Jaramillo: That you get from, you know, communication and

175
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.160
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, just kind of

176
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:41.970
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know, deeper, deeper than what it is because really it's just been like I said, it's been mostly for the most part it's all surface with him. It's not doesn't ever go very deep or yeah and

177
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:48.420
Dianna Jaramillo: And I don't know. I don't know what it like he really hides. He really really hides inside himself.

178
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:57.210
Dianna Jaramillo: And and and and I don't you know i don't i'm i'm easy I'm easy to talk to him, easy to get along with and and

179
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:18.240
Dianna Jaramillo: And I don't know, there's a lot of trust stuff there. He doesn't trust a lot, no matter what I've done or what I could possibly do. That's, that's his thing. Like there's nothing I could possibly do to make him. See how that you know that I am trustworthy or that

180
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.000
Dianna Jaramillo: I do love him.

181
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.420
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, there's nothing I could do. He'll just

182
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:35.070
Dianna Jaramillo: That's that is the that is the thing that he doesn't trust her doesn't believe in you know that loving this kind of relationship as possible because he doesn't know he doesn't

183
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:43.080
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, it sounds like some some deep insecurities on his end and a lot of unreal hurt.

184
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.050
Dominique Pozo: You know, because the anger is just hiding hurt so right.

185
00:19:48.180 --> 00:20:02.940
Dominique Pozo: Wow. Well, this is this is big and it's what a tricky situation because with this whole coven thing you guys. It's not like you're here, but there's really not much room to make, you know, big changes at the moment because there's not so much support in place for that.

186
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.400
Dianna Jaramillo: Right right at all. Exactly. And it's hard.

187
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.950
Dianna Jaramillo: For me sometimes, because it brings up so much of

188
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.940
Dianna Jaramillo: My own stuff like with my, my parents and and it's like

189
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.700
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm not having anybody you know and like abandonment stuff and

190
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.780
Dianna Jaramillo: And just being being alone and like everybody just

191
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.070
Dianna Jaramillo: Almost like it's me, like, what is it about me.

192
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:49.110
Dianna Jaramillo: That makes people just not want anything to do with me. You know, I don't know. It just brings up a lot of that kind of stuff. Like, I'm just going to be alone and fending for myself with nothing and nobody

193
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.040
Yeah.

194
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:57.780
Dominique Pozo: Yeah i i'm really hearing. It's kind of touching that core wound of, like, what's wrong with me, you know,

195
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.400
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah

196
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.750
Dianna Jaramillo: And I just want to find find a way

197
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Where no matter what happens, I'll be okay.

198
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:17.880
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, because I was alone. I was totally alone with no relationship. No dating, no nothing for you know just over six years before I even met Eric

199
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:29.430
Dianna Jaramillo: He's the first relationship that I got into after all that time six and a half years I was with nobody. I didn't even talk to anybody that will time

200
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:43.290
Dianna Jaramillo: He's, he's the very first one and then for it to end up like this, after all that time, it reminded me away. I said before, you know, like, I don't want to take chances like that. I don't want to give my heart that way.

201
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:54.510
Dianna Jaramillo: To anybody and I just kind of jumped into it because of everything that was happening in my life at that time and and it's it's done so much more damage.

202
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.610
Dianna Jaramillo: Hmm. In this last year, I feel like I've been so wounded in this last year.

203
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:00.390
Hmm.

204
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.520
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

205
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.510
Dominique Pozo: Hmm, well let's um let's take a moment and

206
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:16.290
Dominique Pozo: Give yourself a little empathy, some self empathy just acknowledging that you know you have needs for connection companionship and

207
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:30.120
Dominique Pozo: You know, I'm sure there's other needs like you know touch and warmth and maybe some of the other things that you're getting. So just having a little bit of compassion for yourself and saying okay like I need these things and

208
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.380
Dominique Pozo: And here I am now you know so

209
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:35.820
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

210
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:38.100
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

211
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:56.100
Dominique Pozo: Well, it sounds like you're very clear Diana and I i think it seems like it's just a matter of waiting this timeout to see how, you know, if you really do want to make a chain how that could happen what it would look like, and

212
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.450
Dominique Pozo: And how

213
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:09.600
Dominique Pozo: How you all can dialogue about it in a really mature way and not have it be a blow out because that's going to be traumatizing you know it's gonna re traumatized something if it turns into a big escalation.

214
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.700
Dianna Jaramillo: Great. Right. Yeah.

215
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.290
Dianna Jaramillo: And

216
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:19.170
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, I don't, I don't know how to have that kind of mature conversation with him because

217
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:31.050
Dianna Jaramillo: The couple of times I did try to talk to him and have that kind of mature conversation. It did just exploded my face within a matter of seconds. So I don't know.

218
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.920
Dianna Jaramillo: How to how to do that, you know, really, I just try and

219
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.150
Dianna Jaramillo: I just try and like I said just

220
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.850
Dianna Jaramillo: Keep things calm. Don't go too deep. Don't say the wrong thing.

221
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.540
Dominique Pozo: Tony nice I it sounds to me that you're in an abusive relationship.

222
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.890
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, that's what it. I know I keep I keep thinking that

223
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.510
Dianna Jaramillo: To myself.

224
00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:58.950
Dianna Jaramillo: To

225
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:12.720
Dominique Pozo: The things that you're telling me, like, okay, just keep it calm, be nice. Don't go too deep. Don't don't like upset him because what could happen would be horrible. So that sounds, it's you know it's walking on eggshells around someone who

226
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.260
Dominique Pozo: Is it like you said, is a time bomb.

227
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.250
Yeah.

228
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:33.930
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, it is. That's what it is. It's I've, I've thought about that so many times. And that's exactly what it is. I haven't actually said it out loud to myself but but that is what it is that it is. Yeah.

229
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.230
Dianna Jaramillo: And I don't know.

230
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.120
Dianna Jaramillo: What the hell I'm doing or

231
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.810
Dianna Jaramillo: Or what to do about it.

232
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:53.310
Dominique Pozo: Do you have a friend. I'm not going to go into fear, although I am going to say, I'm just concerned for you because I see how well you're doing in your recovery and

233
00:24:53.790 --> 00:25:05.340
Dominique Pozo: You know, through our individual work. I just, I've gotten such a sense in your, in your own psyche. I feel like you're in, you know, a healthy place and i just i i wonder

234
00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:13.650
Dominique Pozo: Do you have a friend that you could move in with if you if you decide, because who knows how long this is going to last you know

235
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:19.560
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, exactly. And and no I have nobody I have absolutely nobody

236
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:35.340
Dianna Jaramillo: I have nobody. I mean, I have my, my friend and her husband from last night, but they already have like four people living with them because she moves people in and she has a really big heart.

237
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:44.700
Dianna Jaramillo: And I know you know i i could actually live over there, but they already have a bunch of people living there and

238
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:51.360
Dianna Jaramillo: And that's it. I don't have anybody. There's not one single person that I feel like I could run to

239
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.520
Dominique Pozo: Does he has

240
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:54.900
Dominique Pozo: He could

241
00:25:55.110 --> 00:26:05.160
Dominique Pozo: Could he does he do you think he could figure out somewhere to go this is total hypothetical. But if you just, you know, express that you're not happy in this

242
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:06.810
Dominique Pozo: And

243
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.870
Dominique Pozo: You know, could he find somewhere to go with what he have a place to go, or is that not

244
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.800
Dianna Jaramillo: I will yeah I yeah I think so. I mean, he has his parents and

245
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:26.010
Dianna Jaramillo: He has other friends and stuff in in town in Santa Fe and like, I'm sure he would, he would be okay for sure if you have

246
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:35.100
Dominique Pozo: I'm wondering, I do you want to put your camera on for a second. I feel like this is we're getting into some Yeah, really. I kind of want to track you a little bit

247
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:38.820
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

248
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:48.720
Dominique Pozo: I definitely don't want to lead you down this road, Diana, I'm just thinking of, you know, different scenarios.

249
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:55.110
Dianna Jaramillo: So I thought, I thought about it so many times I've thought about it a million times and

250
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.310
Dianna Jaramillo: It's almost like I don't know which is worse, keeping

251
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:16.860
Dianna Jaramillo: The relationship going keeping him here or being alone. I don't know which is worse because I don't know what I would do, I don't have anybody to give me a ride to the grocery store to get groceries or to go get my medication every week or whatever, you know, like, I don't

252
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.420
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't have any help. I don't have anybody that I could ask for help.

253
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.380
Dianna Jaramillo: At all. You know, so it's a being

254
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.560
Dianna Jaramillo: With him at least

255
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:42.210
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, there's that I get. I get that out of it, but I don't know which is worse. I really don't. I would be scared to death to be alone with nothing and nobody would be really, really scared.

256
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.110
Yeah.

Yeah.

261
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:11.670
Dominique Pozo: And if there's any other neighbors that you could do some sort of exchange and say, you know, these are the few needs. I have every week. Could we work out an agreement.

262
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:22.350
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, they don't they don't have a vehicle or anything. They don't have anything. They have a shitty, shitty little house, and one of them gets picked up to go

263
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:32.160
Dianna Jaramillo: Work hard labor, because, you know, and I mean this guy's in his mid 60s and he's doing hard labor and they don't have money, they don't have a vehicle. They have nothing.

264
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.230

Dominique Pozo: You can get rides to appointments or things so

270
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.230
Dianna Jaramillo: Appointments like medical appointments

271
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:06.660
Dianna Jaramillo: And therapy appointments, you can, but they don't do rides to like pick up medication to go get prescriptions and stuff like that.

272
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.530
Dominique Pozo: They don't

273
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.460
Dianna Jaramillo: You know,

274
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.630
Dianna Jaramillo: And that's, that's it. They don't do rides for anything else at all. It's

275
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.370
Dianna Jaramillo: Like strictly for appointments

276
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:21.990
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, because I used to work with them a lot for that for my job that I used to do. Okay. Yeah.

277
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.760
Dianna Jaramillo: So,

278
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:31.260
Dianna Jaramillo: It's, it's like a rock and a hard place. This is the worst it's ever been. For me, I never thought I would be in a position like this ever again.

279
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.040

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.720
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

289
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.730

Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

291
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.470
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, twice the last time was like probably about

292
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.010
Dianna Jaramillo: Like six or five or six months ago.

293
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.240
Dianna Jaramillo: twice in the last year. Yeah, so that's always in up there.

294
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.400
Dianna Jaramillo: To like that's always in the back of my mind to

295
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.490
Dianna Jaramillo: You know things about bad enough, and he

296
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:41.730
Dianna Jaramillo: got mad enough. I know that he's capable of that. So that's always kind of in the back of my mind.

297
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:52.080
Dianna Jaramillo: I really never thought I would let this happen again. Yeah, be in this kind of relationship. Yeah.

298
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.300
Dominique Pozo: I don't know what Esperanza is doing right now.

299
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.520
Dominique Pozo: But I just wonder if the shelter.

300
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:10.710
Dominique Pozo: An option or possibility at this time. It seems like everything so kind of weird with the whole coven. I don't know if

301
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.330
Dominique Pozo: That would be

302
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:14.970
Dianna Jaramillo: I don't know. I

303
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.600
Dianna Jaramillo: Don't even, I don't know.

304
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.470
Dianna Jaramillo: The thing is, is like

305
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.490
Dianna Jaramillo: He kind of

306
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:28.920
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm

307
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.170
Dianna Jaramillo: Like this thing he does when he gets mad.

308
00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:50.190
Dianna Jaramillo: It's like, I don't care. I don't give a shit. I don't care about you. You don't mean chick to me only right now. So it's not like like this weird possessive thing at all. You know, like he doesn't do that at all. Mostly it's like I don't give a shit about you. You don't mean shit to be

309
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:59.970
Dianna Jaramillo: Only right now you know and like, and he said that a million times, and he's actually left a couple of times for a couple days and then he comes back and

310
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.770
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean, not that frickin hurts to

311
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:06.750
Dominique Pozo: Yeah.

312
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.470
But, um,

313
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.090
Dianna Jaramillo: Um, you know, so it's not like he wants to

314
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.750
Dianna Jaramillo: Keep me

315
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.370
Dianna Jaramillo: Or like, you know, you know what I mean, like, yes.

316
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.360
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, and like that like like he's, he doesn't care like He'll. He'll leave, he doesn't care.

317
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.610
Dianna Jaramillo: At all, you know, and he knows he'll he'll leave me with nothing. He doesn't give

318
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.520
Dianna Jaramillo: You said it's about leaving

319
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:47.160
Dominique Pozo: So yeah, so what I'm hearing is your, your tiptoeing around him to not have any eruption. And you're also you need him on some level for some very basic things right now.

320
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.780
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah

321
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.970
Dominique Pozo: Well, I really, I'm going to invite you to think about in the next week.

322
00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:59.910
Dominique Pozo: How do you get those needs met in another way, because this doesn't sound so safe and

323
00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:01.110
Dianna Jaramillo: Yet it's not

324
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.880
Dianna Jaramillo: And it doesn't feel safe.

325
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:13.950
Dominique Pozo: And it also doesn't feel a seam with with all of the gifts and talents and everything you have. It seems like it keeps keeps things a lot more compressed than they

326
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:25.830
Dominique Pozo: Then they could be, you know, with everything you have. I just have this image. Have you been able to really open and like flower into your fullness, but having to hold back in such a way

327
00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.200
Dominique Pozo: Yes, I get really compressed is who you are.

328
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.120
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, definitely.

329
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.840
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, yeah, very much. Very, very much so.

330
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:42.120
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, it's like Mei Mei whole world has just gotten so small and

331
00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:51.810
Dianna Jaramillo: And and and it's it's amazing, it's the absolute polar opposite of what my life was. Yeah, a year ago.

332
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.490
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, you know, because like I was doing all these big things. And I had this really great

333
00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.970
Dianna Jaramillo: Career going for myself and I was winning awards and I mean congressmen were giving me awards on

334
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:06.390
Dianna Jaramillo: Them for of the the roundhouse at the Capitol.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:15.210
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, a couple thousand people. I was doing speeches about my recovery in front of hundreds and hundreds of people

337
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.190
Dianna Jaramillo: They were calling me to

338
00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:22.980
Dianna Jaramillo: Do these speeches i mean i mean i won that award out of like 600 and some people

339
00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.180
Dominique Pozo: Wow. Wow.

340
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.180
Dianna Jaramillo: You know, like those are the things I was doing. I mean, I was, I was really growing in and

341
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:38.580
Dianna Jaramillo: I was like people knew me the whole recovery community in New Mexico, New me. They all knew my name and

342
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:56.430
Dianna Jaramillo: I mean, I was doing huge things building programs and I was asked to be on a on a task force for a congressman for women in recovery and, you know, and now it's, it's like, yeah, yeah, I'm just not at all what I was a year ago.

343
00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:04.380
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I really get that what what happened. Was it because of the relationship at things just you just kept getting more inward or why did all

344
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.250
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh no, what happened was I

345
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:19.710
Dianna Jaramillo: That this PMS took over Presbyterian took over the Medical Center. I was out because the CEO.

346
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:36.720
Dianna Jaramillo: He actually embezzled a whole bunch of money and so they couldn't afford to keep going. So they had to bring in somebody to rescue them. And so PMS came in and took over. And when PMS came in and took over. They said they didn't need peers anymore. They didn't need

347
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.420
Dianna Jaramillo: You know certified peers anymore.

348
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:49.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, so, so they all out of the blue, like this was totally unexpected got rid of me and this one other male peer that I was working with

349
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.870
Dianna Jaramillo: And running this whole huge program with

350
00:35:52.530 --> 00:36:09.060
Dianna Jaramillo: And it was just so all of a sudden I really kind of flipped out like I was not prepared for it and I freaked out and I i made mistakes I made some mistakes and I I was drinking there was like it was like a week.

351
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.230
Dianna Jaramillo: Straight that I was drinking and me and my mom actually own the

352
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.430
Dianna Jaramillo: Own the house together.

353
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:22.290
Dianna Jaramillo: That we bought together we live together. I mean, I had a beautiful vehicle at everything. And when she

354
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:32.490
Dianna Jaramillo: She saw me like that. I mean, I was really like losing it. I just really freaked out during that time, it was like to a two week period. That's when I met Eric

355
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:39.360
Dianna Jaramillo: And I was drinking and I was not doing good. I was really freaked out depressed and

356
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:48.900
Dianna Jaramillo: And that's when I met Eric. And so I just kind of went with him. I just went with him and we ended up on this month long

357
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:55.350
Dianna Jaramillo: Just we were all over the place. I didn't. I wasn't using or anything like that. I was really just drinking

358
00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:02.940
Dianna Jaramillo: And him to. He didn't use or anything like that. He was just drinking a lot like all day, all night every day for like a month.

359
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:11.670
Dianna Jaramillo: And then when that started coming down like my mom was already like you get the hell out of here and I don't want you here and

360
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:23.850
Dianna Jaramillo: She changed the locks on me, even though my name is on everything. My name is on the house. My name is on the land and I just said, How is it. I don't want to be here anyway. And so I just let her. I just kind of let her get away with that.

361
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.280
Dianna Jaramillo: Now I didn't really fight for it at all.

362
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.950
Dianna Jaramillo: And and so that's how I just ended up

363
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:39.810
Dianna Jaramillo: Here I found this little trailer because I knew that my friend, the landlord rented little trailers and then we just moved in. And that's just where we've been ever since I

364
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.320
Dominique Pozo: Got it.

365
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:44.940
Dianna Jaramillo: But it was, it was like a drunken blur that whole month enough

366
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.320
Dianna Jaramillo: That I ended up with him.

367
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.290
Dianna Jaramillo: So it came from shit and it ended up being shit.

368
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.060
Yeah yeah

369
00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:08.550
Dianna Jaramillo: And I lost everything. I lost my my house, my beautiful brand new vehicle my land I lost everything because I chose to stay with him to be with him.

370
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.280
Dominique Pozo: How did you lose your vehicle. Did your mom with it. And her name or something.

371
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.720
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, she was the main

372
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.150
Dianna Jaramillo: On it. She was the main person on it and

373
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:28.200
Dianna Jaramillo: It was paid off. I paid it off and everything, and she kept it and she sold it when I didn't know like two weeks after she gave me a chance. She didn't even give me a chance to

374
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:42.360
Dianna Jaramillo: Really to fight for anything. She didn't give me a chance at all. She sold it. She right from under me. She didn't talk to me. She didn't tell me anything. She just sold it. She got rid of all my stuff. Everything that I had in the house. She got rid of everything.

375
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.760
Dianna Jaramillo: without saying a word to me.

376
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:59.670
Dianna Jaramillo: Just everything was gone. All of a sudden like like within two weeks, all of my stuff was gone after me and her living together for seven years within two weeks she completely got rid of me from her life.

377
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:11.400
Dominique Pozo: Well, it sounds like, I don't know how many times you all had had situations when you were using, but it sounds like that was the last straw for her.

378
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:20.040
Dianna Jaramillo: Eat after all those years after all that time everything we had built. I mean, we were so so close.

379
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.810
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, and

380
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:29.190
Dianna Jaramillo: And she knew what my job meant to me and she knew why are hurt me so bad.

381
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:36.180
Dianna Jaramillo: To lose that and and and it was like she totally turned on me. The minute I didn't have my job anymore.

382
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:48.840
Dianna Jaramillo: And I wasn't bringing in all this money and you know stuff. It was like she totally she turned on me before I even left the house before I even met Eric or went on this binge. You know, like she told me turned on me.

383
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:54.240
Dianna Jaramillo: And she wasn't supportive at all. She was being. She was being a real bitch.

384
00:39:54.600 --> 00:40:03.930
Dianna Jaramillo: For for the first couple weeks after I lost my job and then that's when I started everything here. That's what my better. So I mean, really, she did. She turned on me first.

385
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:14.850
Dominique Pozo: I get that and gosh this what a what a wake up to you. Around relapsing whether it's with an opiate or alcohol or whatever, how much can be lost.

386
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.660
Yeah.

387
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.320
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, very, very quickly. Everything was gone.

388
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.570
Dianna Jaramillo: Everything my whole entire life. Everything that I had worked so hard for was gone.

389
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:42.390
Dominique Pozo: Well, I have a lot of faith in you and I see how well you've done so far been in the program. And I think this is just this is a really tough part of the passage and I really believe you know I believe in you to get through this.

390
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.690
Dominique Pozo: I do. Yeah.

391
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.820
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah me too narrowly do. I mean, this is like the hardest it's ever been in my life and

392
00:40:51.240 --> 00:41:03.000
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, but I do. I feel like you know one way or another. Something's gotta give and and I'll figure it out. Like I always have. Yeah.

393
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:11.250
Dominique Pozo: How do you feel about me sharing with Joan some of where you're currently at the doctor, Dr. Kendall

394
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:12.420
Dianna Jaramillo: And she yeah

395
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:22.680
Dominique Pozo: She's a really resource to women. And I just, I kind of want to be a team and see, you know what, how we can help you to to to get back into a better place, you know,

396
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.640
Dianna Jaramillo: And that's fine.

397
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:33.240
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I want to ask her, you know, what resources because I'm not living in Santa Fe anymore. I'm kind of disconnected from what's going on at the moment there.

398
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:47.790
Dominique Pozo: But she might have some ideas of, like, oh, here's a resource or here's a resource that Diana could could utilize at this time to help herself. Get back on her feet. And actually, you know, if and when you choose to, you know,

399
00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.130
Dominique Pozo: And relationship that's not in your highest

400
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.940
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah yeah cuz I know that days coming

407
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:29.520
Dianna Jaramillo: Oh, gosh.

408
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.130

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:32.550
Yeah.

Dianna Jaramillo: It's a lot to

413
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.350
Dominique Pozo: To bring up but um I just

414
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:47.640
Dominique Pozo: I just, I, I do believe there's more support out there and I just don't know exactly what it is.

415
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.150
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, yeah. And there, and I know there is a be nuts. That's what did I used to

416
00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:04.650
Dianna Jaramillo: help a lot of people with was, you know, these resources and and I've racked my brains and I look stuff up and I can't, I can't really find anything.

417
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:11.910
Dianna Jaramillo: But it's been a little while so i don't i don't know there might be a lot of new stuff out there. No. Okay, especially with all this that's going on.

418
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.430
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

419
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:22.890
Dominique Pozo: Let's take a few moments and just switch gears to a little more resourcing and not continuing to going into the problem. So,

420
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:32.460
Dominique Pozo: I think I just, I am having this image that image of the fire and your heart, you know, and I just want to remember that.

421
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.410
Dominique Pozo: Yes, yeah.

422
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.040
Dominique Pozo: So let's just

423
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:39.510
Dominique Pozo: Let's be with that for for a few breaths and just

424
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:48.360
Dominique Pozo: Keep your vision on that fire that you carry and it's yours, you know, and nobody can take it away. Nobody can blow it out. This is yours.

425
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:52.050
Dominique Pozo: And really

426
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:57.120
Dominique Pozo: imagining that this is like the most precious flame. It's like

427
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:08.640
Dominique Pozo: You know, it's, it's your essence. It's what keeps you going, what keeps your body warm with vitality and life.

428
00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:11.370
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, just

429
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.350
Dominique Pozo: keep seeing that fire.

430
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.500
Dominique Pozo: Burning strong steady

431
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:33.540
Dominique Pozo: And, you know, really acknowledging the fear to it's real. And it's, it's like

432
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:53.700
Dominique Pozo: It's a signal saying, Wow, something's off if there's this much fear, something's off. So just really honoring the fear to, you know, it's your it's another ally, it's your voice. A voice saying, hey, how can we not be so afraid and just, you know,

433
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:55.500
Dianna Jaramillo: Right.

434
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:11.940
Dominique Pozo: And then I am going to invite you to, I don't know if you've ever had this experience, but sometimes. Have you ever sat around the fire quietly long enough and ideas start to come

435
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.890
Dianna Jaramillo: Yes, oh yeah, I love it. I love doing that, actually.

436
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:34.710
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so just so just, just know that you have this, you know, eternal flame inside of you that you can sit with and maybe putting some trust in that that fire you carry that if you sit with it long enough, the answers will come, you know they're there.

437
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.560
Dianna Jaramillo: Right, exactly. Absolutely.

438
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.650
Dianna Jaramillo: I'm just that.

439
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:45.510
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, really making the time for that and and

440
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:56.370
Dominique Pozo: And yeah, just trusting your wisdom, you know, you know what you need to do for now to survive in a safe enough way and trusting not to

441
00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.820
Dianna Jaramillo: Do. Yeah.

442
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:21.360
Dominique Pozo: What's a good healing color that you can imagine that you can just wrap your body. If you can imagine like wrapping yourself in this light that's protective and it's strong and it's filled with goodness and grace. What color would that be or colors.

443
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:23.730
Dianna Jaramillo: White

444
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:25.710
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

445
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:37.740
Dominique Pozo: Just take a moment and imagine two feet below your feet. So just imagine a space two feet below your feet right now and just

446
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:49.020
Dominique Pozo: Start to imagine that white lights spiraling up and it's spiraling around you even like a foot out on each side. It's your protection. It's your buffer.

447
00:46:49.620 --> 00:47:05.010
Dominique Pozo: And that white light is just coming up up and it's going along your hips along your belly along your chest and it's spiraling up above your head. Another two feet, and it's like this, the shell of strong protection.

448
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:07.980
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah.

449
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.390
Dianna Jaramillo: I used to do a meditation, very similar to that that was

450
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:17.250
Dianna Jaramillo: Is very similar to that. And that's really good.

451
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.200
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, just

452
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:21.270
Dianna Jaramillo: Keep

453
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:32.160
Dominique Pozo: Keep yourself, you know, strong until you move through this for me because I see you're, you're really in it, you're like in the middle of it, and you're going to get through it. But right now, you're in the middle of it.

454
00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.600
Dominique Pozo: Right, yeah.

455
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.550
Dianna Jaramillo: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

456
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.290
Dominique Pozo: ALL RIGHT, DIANA. Okay, thank you. See you in two. Okay.
