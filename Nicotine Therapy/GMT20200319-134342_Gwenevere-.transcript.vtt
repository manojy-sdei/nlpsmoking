00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: James Johnson.

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning, James. Can you hear me.

3
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes.

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got, let's see. Let's check on technology, a little bit.

5
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you able to hear me on time. Is there any delay.

6
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.230
TCL A501DL: Oh no, I'm able to hear you.

7
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And is the video, have any delay.

8
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.870
TCL A501DL: I don't know. Yeah. The video has a little bit of a way

9
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm noticing it to, let's do a couple things just to set up this morning. Look around your room. See if you can build up.

10
00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:02.340
Gwenevere Abriel: A little a little maybe stack of books or a little space where you can take a towel. Maybe tuck the phone on top of it someplace where it can rest and you'll be able to

11
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Sit and have it free. See what you may be a desk table, something that's set aside nightstand that you could build up. You can take your time.

12
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And I got to look for a document any way for us.

13
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.150
TCL A501DL: All right, of course.

14
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.490
TCL A501DL: Hey James Yeah.

15
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So you've logged off twice. Was it intentional or accidental

16
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.310
TCL A501DL: Looking around my room for weird

17
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So in this in this whole time while you were looking you logged out twice. So the connection there is a challenge.

18
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's keep

19
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: stay on top of that and keep investigating how we can improve it. I don't remember that happening when we did the bio psychosocial. The first time we met.

20
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.610
Yeah.

21
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I can't hear you.

22
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.380
TCL A501DL: But it was because the first time.

23
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.910
TCL A501DL: My

24
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.610
TCL A501DL: I had data.

25
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you using now.

26
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.330
TCL A501DL: My phone

27
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but what service Wi Fi internet or data.

28
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.210
TCL A501DL: Data

29
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so how do you keep is it that you are running low on it that you don't have enough. What do you think's going on.

30
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.200
Hmm.

31
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.410
TCL A501DL: They don't have enough of it.

32
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So one way to kind of think about data is the same thing as maybe not having enough gas money to get to my office. Think of it like that.

33
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a different. It's really a different kind of mindset. If you don't have enough gas money then we borrow a car then we make sure you get to the POS office. To do this, this session or we have to change the timing. So that is

34
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the third

35
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you just logged off a third time.

36
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.020
TCL A501DL: Yep. Yeah.

37
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just logged off a third time. So let's keep experimenting trying to give you an analogy to kind of understand the value of keeping the data on there. Do this for me. If, let's just do a little something different. Hit your stop video so that it's only on

38
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Audio and the bandwidth may expand a little bit, we might be able to to get through today while we're planning. How does

39
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: The future services. Okay, so

40
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: If you absolutely had to use the POS computer. How could you pull that off.

41
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.730
TCL A501DL: Oh, I don't think I can. I'm not how not to use a computer because he has sensitive information on it.

42
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, my understanding is, you did your initial intake there so I'm confused.

43
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.500
TCL A501DL: thousand watts almost they click

44
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:29.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I don't know if you can hear me. But that was, that was the fourth log off. I don't know that today is going to work. I'm not even sure that this service is going to work for you. So have you investigated somewhere else that you can

45
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Comply with

46
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Your court order treatment.

47
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:42.540
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I have Wi Fi on my work, I just need to get there. And I can use Wi Fi because I used the Wi Fi yesterday to call it bright heart hell.

48
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what is this thing my appointment is not until nine. What does that mean,

49
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.430
TCL A501DL: We're doing

50
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I sent the wrong I sent a message for zoom and send it to someone else. He's like, why

51
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: No, he okay so

52
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: When you originally did your, your lock in. And you registered for bright heart. My understanding was you are with your PO

53
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.540
TCL A501DL: Yeah, Monica. Yeah.

54
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's what I'm talking about that.

55
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.280
TCL A501DL: Goes like I was saying before you got

56
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.910
TCL A501DL: Cut off or whatever and on the course the clothes don't follow most because of the coronavirus

57
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.780
Okay.

58
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is a unique time. So, and, in fact, there are more people using Tele health and zone than ever before.

59
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So it would be good if you could create

60
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:53.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A really clear confident plan around keeping data on your phone. So where is your. Where are you making sure you're allocating money to keep data on there. That sounds like a first step.

61
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.800
TCL A501DL: cash in hand at all times.

62
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.170
TCL A501DL: I need to go buy

63
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.330
TCL A501DL: A data package.

64
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do you get that

65
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.480
TCL A501DL: Smith. It's a prepaid card prepaid card cuz I bought one of those $20 burner phone

66
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

67
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get low on data. Is that what we're seeing a symptom of it kind of flaking out and logging out

68
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.580
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

69
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. I mean, I'm not, I'm not an IT person but Dr. Maria was saying she was having a challenge once with you as well.

70
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're probably I would say one of your first pieces of responsibility is going to be to make sure that you have that data package from Smith's paid it sounds like that's like one of the that's the equivalent of having gas in your car to make sure you get all the way to the office.

71
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.520
TCL A501DL: Yeah, like I was saying, a good on my work and workplace in us, the wife and my workplace.

72
00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's a different solution because now if you're saying you can get to. So, for example,

73
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:12.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not there. Now, I don't know how many miles away. That is, are you going to be able to get up early enough to get there in time to use the Wi Fi.

74
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, but

75
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.600
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

76
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.300
TCL A501DL: I would be able to just Today was my day off.

77
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:19.950
Okay.

78
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So that part is

79
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:32.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Not cards up to you to sort of say, I need to make sure that I have a good connection. Just think of it as having gas in your car that part. You've got to do otherwise you can't get there.

80
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.170
TCL A501DL: Alright, I understand.

81
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, cool. I can't do anything about that piece. All I can do is say, hey, he didn't show up.

82
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so, um, now I can be helpful in that way. Um, do you have any problems. Would you say happy as anyone in your family or maybe you've noticed yourself.

83
00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Any challenges with short term memory, like, Oh man, I can't believe they just told me that. And I forgot. Like are you noticing any challenges with short term memory.

84
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.810
TCL A501DL: Sometimes just depends on how much I pay attention to stuff.

85
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how much. All right. So right now, let's will let me see what how much looks like. So zero to 10 how much you paying attention right now.

86
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.460
TCL A501DL: Got a six or seven waking up to

87
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Six or seven. All right, so maybe what we could do, since it's not a at

88
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Not at an eight, nine or 10 and there may have some implications for your, you know, your commitment here to this program, maybe grab a piece of paper and this way it'll help since you said your attention might be low. Or maybe you could just write it down to want to grab paper.

89
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.070
TCL A501DL: Oh yeah, I have a paper and pen right here next to me.

90
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, why did you write

91
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you write

92
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.480
TCL A501DL: For the

93
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.580
TCL A501DL: For what, oh you're for them data Packard.

94
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What can you write to be a reminder. Just keep it really simple, just to do like do this, something action that you can do because your next service, you're going to have to have it done easily by Sunday or Monday.

95
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.550
TCL A501DL: Oh, I just put need data or Wi Fi. Okay.

96
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's no you don't want to put a deadline, because most people they need a deadline. Otherwise they'll push it to the last minute and doing it.

97
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: On Monday night might be too late. What if it because we've got a lot going on stores close. What if Smith closes, you might want to get ahead of it. So maybe give yourself a deadline of maybe Sunday night or Monday on a lunch break or something. What do you think

98
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.890
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I'll put it for Saturday.

99
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Even better. That gives you lots of wiggle room.

100
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.250
TCL A501DL: Good stuff done. The simpler. It is

101
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I know right now. How many minutes. How many minutes away is work for you.

102
00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.280
TCL A501DL: Know I'm

103
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.600
TCL A501DL: Like maybe 1015 okay

104
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's that's kind of a nice thing.

105
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:20.490
Gwenevere Abriel: When you let's say on Tuesday morning if you do run into a problem you have time to drive over to work, get on their Wi Fi and still login to group. Okay.

106
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:21.450
TCL A501DL: All right.

107
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, but that's on you and I know it's kind of an inconvenience thing, but once you get this figured out, it's going to feel a lot more comfortable.

108
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.060
TCL A501DL: Yeah, no, I understand.

109
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, cool. Now it's not ideal. Yes. I wish I could see you and that would be really great. But we're, you know, I'm kind of working with you this morning.

110
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So far, we haven't had a fifth. I don't think log out. So we're doing okay with with the production with the video.

111
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to do is login to know

112
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, I write blink, then you

113
00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do before you disappear on me, there's another, there's 2020 questions. It's a

114
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's sort of a survey to assess kind of the symptoms of maybe some PTSD, that might still be around. I kind of like this one. It only takes a couple minutes. Can I share my screen with you and you can be like, Oh, yeah.

115
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.450
TCL A501DL: It's about this.

116
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: one or that one. Yeah, it kind of gives me an idea of, of what it's like kind of be in you. These days, so it's on a scale.

117
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So what you'll do is you'll take a list. Look at these one through 20 and you can put it

118
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:49.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like art scale. So you can say, not at all. And I'll put zero next to it. The question or or you could put one for a little bit. Your response might be moderately or quite a bit is a three are extremely is a four.

119
00:14:49.410 --> 00:15:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So, these questions are these, these are a list of problems that people sometimes have in response to a very stressful experience. Please read each problem carefully and then you won't be circling you'll just tell me what the number is. And I'll write it down.

120
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.700
TCL A501DL: All right, it's it's loading right now.

121
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So I should be sharing my screen. Can you see it.

122
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.620
TCL A501DL: Oh, no, no. Yeah, it's loading. Yeah.

123
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you think if you swipe your finger. Well, you said the data. I don't know what

124
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.520
TCL A501DL: The Father, it is

125
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay.

126
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, alright, cool, cool, cool. Alright, so let's let's start with the first one to see how this goes. So I'll read the all doing the full question way and then you'll get the groove of it and you won't need me to keep kind of mentioning the like art scale. But let's do one of them together.

127
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:39.900
TCL A501DL: So,

128
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.430
Gwenevere Abriel: In the last

129
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:47.040
Gwenevere Abriel: 30 days. All right. That's what this is. It's the last 30 days.

130
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you had repeated disturbing and unwanted memories of the stressful experience. And so you might say, not at all a little bit moderately quite a bit or extremely

131
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.110
TCL A501DL: Not at all.

132
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Repeated disturbing dreams of a stressful experience.

133
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:08.910

258
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: What you did to adjust your behavior so that you didn't get in trouble, right, because if we talk, talk, talk, talk, we're going to get ourselves.

Gwenevere Abriel: A referral. We won't pass our classes can't concentrate. I'm just wondering if you make an adjustment in your behavior on your own to compensate for some of the symptoms of ADHD.

260
00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:05.280
TCL A501DL: Oh yeah, I found know the thing. It will find other ways to keep myself calm and glass and Sophie from being so fit fidgety

261
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you do

262
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:18.120
TCL A501DL: I started to like fucking with my pencil and doing stuff with my pencils and pens. Instead, and then also I would start, I would have a piece of paper that doodle on or you're

263
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:24.030
TCL A501DL: Right down random shit on and sometimes I'd even write my notes on it to every now and then.

264
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And have you learned any other kind of cool techniques around having

265
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:40.020
Gwenevere Abriel: A certain type of music in the background. Have you played with that a little bit. When you're trying us

266
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Does that work for you. It's almost like trance music, you know, the ones that you can't aren't singing along because it can't have your full attention, but it can be sort of a really predictable. Music

267
00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:02.250
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I always listen to music, no matter what I'm doing. I always have my one of my earbuds in listening to music, even at work. Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: And this concentrated per se. Yeah.

269
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's pretty consistent with the condition that you're describing

270
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It helps to have a particular type of music going on, just in the background. And then you can focus people that don't have what you're describing

271
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very distracting. So I'm glad you got that. All right.

272
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, let's see. Um, okay. So some of the responses. You do not seem to be experiencing.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The stress response from trauma. Does that sound about right like you feel like there's nothing really happening, day to day, that is

274
00:30:53.580 --> 00:31:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not having panic attacks, you're not having an elevated heart rate, you're not reliving a past traumas that true

275
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.550
TCL A501DL: Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's what this looks like. That's what these these

276
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:16.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Questions kind of show it so it doesn't look like you're you're in a traumatic stress disorder response. I know you were you mentioned you are diagnosed with it sometime ago I think when you were younger.

277
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:17.580
Yeah.

278
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember having some of these symptoms, years and years ago.

279
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.180
TCL A501DL: Um, yeah, some somewhat of a little okay

280
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: But not but not recently. So it doesn't seem like you're meeting criteria for PTSD at this time. Does that surprise you know

281
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. Um,

282
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But the pieces that you did. Let's see if we can make some use out of some of these questions here. So having strong negative beliefs about yourself. Other people or the world.

283
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what you think of when that question was asked what does it make you think of

284
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.500
TCL A501DL: Or just some of the stupid shit that I've done in been through.

285
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me into what you consider stupid shit.

286
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.420
TCL A501DL: Argument here at home.

287
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:11.850
TCL A501DL: Being in jail.

288
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:13.890
TCL A501DL: Being arrested.

289
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:19.800
TCL A501DL: Dealing with cops dealing with the judges dealing with IPOs

290
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.150
TCL A501DL: Dealing with stupid people

291
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:35.820
TCL A501DL: Okay, sometimes putting myself in a risky situation that I could have completely avoided from the beginning, but I decided not to. Because I knew is gonna be risky. So I was like fuck it full said. Uh huh.

292
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Do you know what, but you did a way, kind of thing.

293
00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:39.870
Yeah.

294
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I think that was another one that you actually had said a little bit to let me see.

295
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.600
This one around that one.

296
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think we only had one of the world's completely dangerous.

297
00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:03.240
Gwenevere Abriel: The one. The other one you put a one two was

298
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I find that one where you put yourself in risky situations. I don't see that one in here anymore.

299
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.510
So I remember asking it.

300
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it

301
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

302
00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.070
TCL A501DL: Hey, I got a quick question.

303
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:42.030
TCL A501DL: Uh huh. So the schedule is like, sorry. I was just looking at my notes on so the schedule is on Thursdays. I meet with you now in the morning at eight o'clock every Thursday.

304
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: For a little while. And so we figure out what's next for you. Yeah. All right.

305
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.370
TCL A501DL: And then the groups are there on Tuesday at what time

306
00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.070
TCL A501DL: Seven.

307
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.940
TCL A501DL: Okay, I'll just double checking because I didn't want to miss this one. Yeah.

308
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That one you'll you know you're gonna have to set that alarm in your phone pretty early.

309
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:02.250
Yeah.

310
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

311
00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You do seem to have some insight.

312
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you noticed that the problem is for you and your assessment of yourself that

313
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a challenge around

314
00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of, you know, the word inhibit

315
00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So do you have a challenge in inhibiting a first impulse like

316
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Screw you.

317
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.770
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

318
00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:49.500
TCL A501DL: I'm bad at the lady tells me something I don't like to hear it straight up. Tell him as it is like, fuck you. Go fuck yourself.

319
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:52.620
TCL A501DL: Somewhere along those lines. Yeah.

320
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And then is that the stuff you were talking about earlier, when you said

321
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes me think of the fights being in jail dealing with cops judges stupid people putting myself a risky situations. Is that what you're talking about, like,

322
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.540
TCL A501DL: Yeah, okay.

323
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

324
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we call this when you speak, your first thought. Can we just call that

325
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Poor impulse control. Can we label it that that feel true

326
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:28.710
Yeah.

327
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you know that lines up. That makes sense.

328
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you know much about the brains, you know, we're part of the brain is responsible for inhibiting screw all y'all statements.

329
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though we're saying right

330
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.070
TCL A501DL: Oh,

331
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.510
TCL A501DL: No, not really.

332
00:35:45.720 --> 00:36:02.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Really. Okay. Well, this is cool. Then, so there's a part of the brain actually that does that. So watch this. It's pretty neat. Um, and, and, unfortunately, that part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex won't be fully online until you're

333
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.310
Gwenevere Abriel: 21 oh you wish.

334
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

335
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: For men, unfortunately, it takes you guys an extra couple years beyond women, it's going to be 2728

336
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's like

337
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I know for women. It's about 25 it's about 2426 it's right. Obviously it's humans. So it's not precise, but it's right in there. That's when we

338
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Are the gals have done growing all the brain areas that they're going to they're still neural plasticity, which means we can learn new things and make change. And we can evolve and grow. But as far as like the parts of of the brain called the prefrontal cortex.

339
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be a while and I have you ever heard anybody say executive functioning.

340
00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:01.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, that's the part of the brain that's responsible for it. So this is the cool thing. You might recognize yourself in this

341
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:10.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So executive functioning. Does, does a lot of cool things is our most evolved part of our brain. In other words, like I'm not

342
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:16.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not chilly been here see

343
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:17.400
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

344
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: He's fantastic. He has a lot of the same

345
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: parts of the brain that I do.

346
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Except up here in the front.

347
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't have a really big executive functioning brain, which means if he sees

348
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: He sees a big chunk of chicken in front of him.

349
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:39.480
TCL A501DL: He's gonna take it.

350
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: He's gonna

351
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: He's gonna take it right now. What he can't do is he can't both wants a chicken now and be thinking later.

352
00:37:50.700 --> 00:38:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to. I need to save room for some dessert for some beef jerky later on today so he can't both be thinking about the present and be thinking about the future. He just wants what he wants right now.

353
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.490
Yeah.

354
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.350
TCL A501DL: No, I understand that.

355
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm you and I

356
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Developed our grains very similarly. I'm

357
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:31.590
Gwenevere Abriel: In general, right, though, that stays on time. We all sort of develop it, male and female, about the same time. So somewhere between 2527 28 right in there. We're pretty much done by then. But that last part is the last to come online.

358
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:38.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Now for you guys. The ones that identify with the ADHD condition or the symptoms of it anyway.

359
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not a big fan of labels so I don't really like to say it. He is the thing I just talked about the symptoms. So typically, there's about a two to three year lag. So, you know, you're kind of logically about night you're 19 right

360
00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:57.810
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

361
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So that would put you at impulse control and attention challenges at about 16

362
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So in some ways.

363
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:25.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Our culture, our community might work better for you if we treated you in your ability to pay attention to something and follow through and and inhibit impulse control as if you were about a 16 year old.

364
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: In that part of the brain, but we don't we hold you accountable to be what a full adult because you're 18 right, yo.

365
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's kind of messed up.

366
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But that that's just you know this this information isn't disseminated to everyone so. So notice how earlier today.

367
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I was very concrete. I was like, write it down. I mean, I say it in a nice way. I'm like, Hey, you know, maybe you want to get a paper. And did you write it down.

368
00:39:54.750 --> 00:40:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's because I believe you. I believe you really may have a challenge in in attention being able to focus decide, oh I just need to focus on this one thread one thing. What, what, what kind of you're saying, and the importance of it.

369
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the ability to not say Fuck you.

370
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.630
TCL A501DL: Yeah, no, I understand that.

371
00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:28.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know that and I accept that. So you're going to hear me do things that are very concrete like in a text I might say, make sure you schedule.

372
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: An alarm for 630 or 645 I might not do that for someone that doesn't self identify having the same attention and impulse challenges. Does that seem fair

373
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.360
TCL A501DL: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

374
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you ever get offended by it, then just let me know as polite as you can.

375
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.050
TCL A501DL: On, I understand.

376
00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so I think we're on the same page so far. And I think, I think the key is to acknowledge it in yourself, Hey, this is just where I'm at. This is a neurological

377
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Challenge. You didn't ask for it.

378
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Some pieces of it have to do with genetics. Some of it has to do with what was going on in utero with your mother.

379
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:34.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And some of its just a mystery, but there it is. This is what we've got. So we've got to find a way to use resources in our environment to support your goals. Okay, phones are great alarms are great telling people, Hey, don't take it personally.

380
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I might forget some things here and there, I welcome reminders from you, you know, like doing those kinds of things.

381
00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:45.150
TCL A501DL: No one has done that my answer. I

382
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.720
TCL A501DL: Just want to

383
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Get out and play with, you know,

384
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have any pets.

385
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:59.850
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I have two dogs. Well, yeah, I have two dogs. I'm taking care of one's mine and one's a

386
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:06.600
TCL A501DL: Ones have friends dog died, he kind of brought over to my house to my mother's house, a while back and kind of forgot to pick her up.

387
00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh no, we don't forget to pick up our dog with teaches you just got dumped on

388
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.250
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I basically did. So I've been taken care of both of them.

389
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.980
TCL A501DL: Well, it's fine. They sisters. Anyways, they came from the same lady.

390
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.370
TCL A501DL: That's kind of nice. Yeah.

391
00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:29.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm assuming they're not tiny little, little Chihuahuas and they like Rottweilers or something. What you got over there.

392
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.510
TCL A501DL: On their German German Shepherd husky mix us

393
00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice and fuzzy

394
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:44.430
TCL A501DL: Oh yeah, we've had, I've had the well I've had my dog since she was about

395
00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:54.360
TCL A501DL: Two weeks old. I guess the muddy was hit by a car or something so that they were kind of the people that had them were kind of just wanting to get rid of them.

396
00:42:54.690 --> 00:43:01.890
TCL A501DL: So me and a couple of my friends went down and what we picked up like basically the whole family. I ended up with Saskia which is my dog.

397
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:09.720
TCL A501DL: She's the oldest one in the biggest one. Then there is being which is my homies dog that he dropped off that I'm also taking care of

398
00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:22.110
TCL A501DL: And she she's kind of about the same size as ASCII, but they're both like the older ones are the letter. And then there's Nikki, which is another homie his dog and she's a runt of the litter.

399
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:34.530
So,

400
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.060
Gwenevere Abriel: This other piece that you mentioned.

401
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a one on which had to do with feeling super alert.

402
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: watchful or on guard. Now, those are the words of this particular inventory. What does that

403
00:43:49.770 --> 00:44:02.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Translate in your life to like do you feel super alert at home when you're about to leave on a freeway at work when a particular type of persons around you, like, when do you notice being super alert.

404
00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:18.330
TCL A501DL: Usually when I'm in Los Alamos, or sometimes when I'm at work when the fucking bombs and shit come around because usually they tried to steal it was still our tools. And the short answer is I don't know. I've always been the hyper vigilant. Pretty sure

405
00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.640
TCL A501DL: It's kind of grew up that way.

406
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:31.350

464
00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:41.130
TCL A501DL: Oh, no, no, no. Because usually, once I turned around. I figured I could identify who it is right away. Okay.

465

Gwenevere Abriel: You put your name in there. The right way and I can look at structure and format, but you don't want me crunch the numbers for you.

549
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:28.920
TCL A501DL: Yeah, no, I understand that.

550
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So keep your eye out. Right. The more we talk about it, the more it manifests

551
00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:35.610
TCL A501DL: So,

552
00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep that going go all right now.

553
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:44.400
TCL A501DL: You saw asking the universe shall provide

554
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, yeah, we got to be tricky for what we asked for. Right. You're like, you want to

555
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:55.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Structure and accountability. You got yourself some probation.

556
00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.030
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

557
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You did it the hard way, man.

558
00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:04.680
TCL A501DL: Yeah, tell me about it.

559
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, there are other ways to do it, maybe, you know, over time, you and I can explore some of those things. But you've got you've got a good

560
00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: A positive attitude about how to reframe something positive make something, you know, sunny and shiny out of something kind of dismal. You know, so

561
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah alright so what we've got so far the pros are the positive attributes of yourself.

562
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: First of all, you have a good positive attitude. You're making the most out of this opportunity for

563
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Accountability around your sobriety. You have to answer to your PO, it's going to help you stay clean you are working out you're running you're eating right, my mind.

564
00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Is hyper vigilant, you'd like that skill we talked about in the front end of this session, and you're mentally preparing for it and you've been studying the as the AP

565
00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:56.610
TCL A501DL: Yeah, that's fun.

566
00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: As that

567
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

568
00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:03.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, what else, what else

569
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Do we have going for you as far as looking ahead and thinking, what do I need to do to get into admission for one or both.

570
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:21.270
TCL A501DL: Oh what before I got got arrested. I was talking to a Marine Recruiter okay

571
00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was he saying

572
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:41.040
TCL A501DL: He's telling me basically keep all at the time he was just telling me to quit my ship whatever shenanigans. I might impede my list, along with us was telling me to complete my probation do what I gotta do. So then I could join

573
00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And he knew you run provision at the time.

574
00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:46.800
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I told him. Oh, I had to tell him.

575
00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: But he didn't say that was gonna be disqualifying

576
00:59:52.800 --> 01:00:08.610
TCL A501DL: No. Okay. Just, just during the time that I'm now on probation. I can't join because this qualifies me but once a month probation and the judge dismissed or seals my case with the prestigious prejudice down. I'm good.

577
01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:11.520
Okay.

578
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, is there anything more on the pro positive side before we go to what some challenges and barriers might be for you.

579
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:23.370
TCL A501DL: Not that I could think of right now.

580
01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You want me to put the math is difficult over on that. It's a challenge side.

581
01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. So I'll put challenges as

582
01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Difficult. Now how difficult when you were in high school. Were you able to pass those classes where you had to skip a new kind of got some decent

583
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:49.470
TCL A501DL: Um, I was barely able to pass some of those math classes when I was in high school. Okay.

584
01:00:49.800 --> 01:01:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you know do you know, see this is an interesting thing. Sometimes it's not that we can't do the equation. So it's so precise, it might have had had something to do with attention.

585
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And impulse control member those things we were talking about earlier.

586
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes we do it, but we're we weren't allowed to have the music on in class and we didn't want to

587
01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Focus on that math problem for another 20 seconds or 30 seconds we you could me. I don't know. This was I wasn't there, but I just wonder if you could do it.

588
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: If you knew that you could like, I wish to have classrooms for like this, you looked at it, you looked at it just once, and then you walked away. You did something else for

589
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Like two minutes you came back to it and you crunch the number. Once you you look at it again and then you went and did some jumping jacks or whatever you played and then you came back to it and then you went out at that problem again.

590
01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:56.460
Gwenevere Abriel: For for you. That might be an approach that we might play with

591
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:57.630
Or

592
01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that it's a learning or in a stored knowledge issue, you have a great grasp on vocabulary and

593
01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I don't know that it's that you can't do the math, it might just be an issue of being able to focus your attention on that when it's a lot more enjoyable to look out the window and to doodle, but

594
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: It's with them. We got to come back to that math problem. We just got to give ourselves permission to look at it.

595
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And take a break and come back to it. Focus on it. Take a break, come back to it, but not give up on it. It's got it. We've got to be able to give ourselves permission to have

596
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: To turn our attention, you know, whether it's the doodle and or jumping jacks or something and coming back to the problem. I'd be curious to see do you um

597
01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know this one cost money. It's called Xcel learning. Where is an online program that like gives you math problems and teaches you how to do the math, like you do it online. Have you ever app. It's free for Mac.

598
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.000
TCL A501DL: No, I haven't really spent that much time looking for, you know,

599
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, like, what if we start with that.

600
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.200
TCL A501DL: Yeah, good.

601
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:26.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. What is it, what is there's a free event there is like a free. What if we do that for the next task research.

602
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:33.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Free or affordable. I mean, I don't know how much they are. How about with free slash affordable.

603
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: As app for

604
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:42.990
Math tutoring.

605
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, I mean,

606
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.060
TCL A501DL: Yeah, I know what you mean.

607
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you know what else there's

608
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Virtual School you ever played with that idea.

609
01:03:56.610 --> 01:04:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Yeah. So some of the kids out here will let's say they do poorly in class or their life is just completely chaotic and unmanageable. And they can't make their way to school, they, they take high school courses in college courses online.

610
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's really neat. And I mean, everybody's on board with it. The sometimes it's a combination. You'll have a high school, high school

611
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: guidance counselor will be like, Yeah, okay, that's fine. Go ahead. Go for it. They say an iPhone it they take the class and then they're, they're also a lot easier. That's the truth. And then they get A's and their GPA goes way up.

612
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because they count equal to a regular in person brick and mortar class. So that's another idea. See if there's something also in your community and you have any kind of community college or church that might offer tutoring. What are your thoughts there.

613
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.660
TCL A501DL: Are the trial.

614
01:04:58.050 --> 01:04:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: come in through the, through native

615
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:06.210
TCL A501DL: Possibly through travel, but there is also the community college here that I went to, for a little bit. Okay.

616
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to anything. There's some kids in there straight up trying to make a few dollars, you know,

617
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so so through community college. And I'll say, possibly

618
01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: tribal community. Now, if I say something that's wrong or off, please feel free to correct me. So I say it in a correct way right

619
01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:27.600
All right.

620
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh,

621
01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:36.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so what are some other challenges that you're going to be facing

622
01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.030
TCL A501DL: Probation

623
01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. When's that gonna

624
01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:42.810
November.

625
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: December 2020 probation ends now probation is just a word floating around just like banana peel don't actually have any meaning.

626
01:05:55.710 --> 01:06:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Unless you tell me what it is. So what's actually what's the real barrier with probation, what's the challenge about being on probation.

627
01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:08.730
TCL A501DL: It's tedious and it's a hassle. Some most of the time.

628
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Like being here today.

629
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Hope you're laughing at me to get my joke.

630
01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:20.430
TCL A501DL: No idea. I'm sorry.

631
01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:24.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't even get the laugh.

632
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Listen, I keep telling the same joke until I get the laugh I need, so you might as well get it over with. Now,

633
01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:35.670
TCL A501DL: All right.

634
01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, I said like being here now tedious and a hassle.

635
01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.290
TCL A501DL: Yeah, more or less.

636
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.580
TCL A501DL: Said, except this is a little bit easier.

637
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a lot easier than schlepping somewhere. That's why, that's why. First thing on your list on your piece of paper in front of you is day

638
01:06:56.430 --> 01:07:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That's no joke like gas in the car. Gotta have it, your boss don't care marine need, you know, Navy, then we hear you. We got it, we got to make sure we have those basic fundamental we've got asleep.

639
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Got to eat. We got take care of our body so that we're ready. Because you are the resource this body right that's what you are to the Marine Corps. That's what you are in the Navy. You've got to take care of this body.

640
01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, right. Okay, you already know that I can already hear it, you're eating right, you're running you're keeping yourself fit very smart.

641
01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it's tedious and I will. So because there's so much detail. I think that's what you mean by tedious, meaning you have to be on time.

642
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.670
TCL A501DL: Yeah.

643
01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And when attention and impulse control are the challenge.

644
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you using everything you can with this. Now you've got a burner phone. I don't know. I don't know what kind of phone is it, is it still a data phone, though.

645
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.340
TCL A501DL: Yeah. Data phone right

646
01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it have all the alarms on it that you need.

647
01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.300
Yeah.

648
01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Alright.

649
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be your best friend.

650
01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:13.620
TCL A501DL: Has been

651
01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.380
Gwenevere Abriel: A practice.

652
01:08:17.790 --> 01:08:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're going to probably do some work with that to really use it even more.

653
01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so to see if we can afford getting you on visual for just a moment, as we kind of come to a close here today. Let me see if you and I can at least make a little bit I contact

654
01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:36.030
All right.

655
01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

656
01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:38.580
All right.

657
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what today was like for you.

658
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:45.420
TCL A501DL: It was good.

659
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:46.860
TCL A501DL: Okay.

660
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: What was important for you that you're coming away with today.

661
01:08:51.960 --> 01:09:01.950
TCL A501DL: A more or less all the planning and stuff, how it's gonna go made me feel a lot better than this. It's gonna be easier it's going to go by you. Okay.

662
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So knowing what its gonna look like helps

663
01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:07.440
TCL A501DL: Yeah, okay.

664
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And how are we are we are we at clicking. Are we gonna. Are we good

665
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:17.580
Gwenevere Abriel: summer holidays go

666
01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:18.540
TCL A501DL: Yeah, we're good.

667
01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. I thought so too.

668
01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So the main thing has to do, I just want to say one

669
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: One challenge in here is going to have to do with this data because you won't benefit from

670
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:50.010
Gwenevere Abriel: The psychotherapy part, you don't get the ability to stay on video where you can actually have a really nice smooth flow and hear what I'm saying in real time and I can hear you, in real time, what you got.

671
01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What you got today was more like a PO more like a counselor, not a therapist. I

672
01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't transfer. Mm.

673
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.280
Hmm, yeah.
