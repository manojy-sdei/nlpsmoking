00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.180
Tracy Jackson: Really important to you and they're your motivation to kind of

23
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.390
Tracy Jackson: Try to heal a little bit

24
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.280
Rachel Weatherbie: Yeah, I've been

25
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:59.250
Rachel Weatherbie: Really unmotivated, the last month or just I quit using drugs. So I'm feeling better now.

26
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.260
Rachel Weatherbie: There's like all those guys and then you

27
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.090
Rachel Weatherbie: Know, kind of trying to get back on my feet.

28
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:10.110
Tracy Jackson: Good. We're glad you're here. And, and what are you good at. Tell me some of your strengths

29
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:27.570
Rachel Weatherbie: Well, I'm the oldest of six kids so mostly my life is taking care of them a lot. My daughter and and put it are. I was going to school for a long time. I didn't graduate or the my last year to be a teacher. And it was all I wanted to do.

30
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.970
Rachel Weatherbie: I really want to find

31
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:41.220
Rachel Weatherbie: I wanted to go into like peer support specialist work and I was mentioning sobriety. My and then I fell down the last dream.

32
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:54.870
Tracy Jackson: Okay, so it sounds like you've got resilience. So even though you stumble, like all of us. Do you get right back up and try again. You've been a caregiver a dedicated caregiver for a long time and you have a little bit of a creative side.

33
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:09.120
Tracy Jackson: With your art. Okay, awesome. And so I am a, I'm a pain specialists that bright heart so you will keep Dr candela who will help manage your medications any medications you need and make adjustments in that

34
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:21.030
Tracy Jackson: My specialty. I'm also an addiction specialist, but my i'm also boarded in chronic pain and I was at Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tennessee, for

35
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:34.530
Tracy Jackson: 12 years running their pain program and prescribing medicines and doing injections and procedures and at some point began to appreciate that our system actually hurts people was paying an addiction and

36
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:42.150
Tracy Jackson: So I kind of became a yoga instructor and an acupuncturist and a health coach and started doing killer medicine so I could

37
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:52.680
Tracy Jackson: Get to know patients and be be able to answer your questions if you have any when you first come into the program because that's sort of practice on all sides of the pain management spectrum.

38
00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:00.900
Tracy Jackson: And then if it makes sense for you after we talk over the next 45 minutes to

39
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:14.100
Tracy Jackson: Determine if maybe some ongoing meetings group meetings with me and other people that struggle with pain is one of their triggers for their youth, if that might be something that's useful for you going forward. So that's my role with bright heart.

40
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.000
Tracy Jackson: Okay. All right. So in these 45 minutes that we have to talk. What do you want to make sure

41
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.900
Tracy Jackson: That you get out of this meeting with me.

42
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.140
Rachel Weatherbie: I don't know, it's just pretty open to the idea. I wasn't really sure what the best

43
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.190
Okay.

44
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:47.430
Tracy Jackson: Well, maybe we can start with this. What do you I know doctors have given you a bunch of diagnoses through the years, and I was kind of thing. But what do you think are all the components that are contributing to your pain all the things that contribute to your pain.

45
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.250
Rachel Weatherbie: Well, I was in a big accident.

46
00:20:51.450 --> 00:21:02.850
Rachel Weatherbie: And so my body was just never going to be the same. And so I it's something I have to live with and learn it's fairly recent it was at the end of 2016 and so

47
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.130
Rachel Weatherbie: I just had to

48
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.930
Rachel Weatherbie: Adjust my life to the way my body is now. Okay.

49
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.840
Tracy Jackson: So prior to 2016

50
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.410
Tracy Jackson: Did you have any pain anywhere.

51
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:24.390
Rachel Weatherbie: No, I'm a left shoulder, which is injured. Now I had problems with it, but I had just finished physical therapy.

52
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:25.320
Tracy Jackson: Mm hmm.

53
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.410
Rachel Weatherbie: It was just like adult pain. It was like nothing major.

54
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.690
Tracy Jackson: Like a rotator cuff something

55
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.280
Tracy Jackson: Kind of thing and or impingement. And now, where is the

56
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.180
Tracy Jackson: Most to say, what are your most disabling symptoms. Now, but keep you

57
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.230
Tracy Jackson: What you want to do.

58
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:47.670
Rachel Weatherbie: Well, I had total knee reconstruction surgery. And for some reason, and the surgeons that is just comes with the territory.

59
00:21:48.090 --> 00:22:04.980
Rachel Weatherbie: When I do regular activities. My leg swells up really bad, to the point where I can't walk up the elevator and it's just awful. It's like, it seems like glue almost my legs and his veins and also I have open nerve endings on my left arm. My whole left side was broken.

60
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:17.160
Tracy Jackson: All right, and that left foot when it swells up and changes colors. Is it very sensitive to light touch. Like a sheet for the water in the bath or something like that. It's a very

61
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.360
Rachel Weatherbie: Definitely it's

62
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:29.010
Rachel Weatherbie: Yeah, it's both my legs now also because he said my right leg is our greatest. Now, it's not as bad as the left late, but my right one swells up also

63
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.710
Tracy Jackson: Can I see. Can you point the camera at your left leg. Is it possible for me to look at this swollen.

64
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:35.280
Rachel Weatherbie: Yeah, it's

65
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.560
Rachel Weatherbie: It's not slowing right now.

66
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.880
Tracy Jackson: Okay, and so it's the same color is the other leg right now as well.

67
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.290
Rachel Weatherbie: Yes, it'll only happens like when I'm just doing regular activity.

68
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:55.230
Tracy Jackson: Okay, and then have you noticed any changes in the hair growth or the nail growth on that left foot compared to the other one.

69
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.540
Rachel Weatherbie: Um, no.

70
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.070
Tracy Jackson: Okay. All right.

71
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:01.980
Tracy Jackson: And

72
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:18.540
Tracy Jackson: I want to back up just a little bit. Why don't you walk me through. And I know you're in transition, but walk me through what a typical day is like for you. And by that I mean when you wake up, what sorts of things you eat the kind of things you do during the day.

73
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.270
Tracy Jackson: Particularly sort of to address your pain and then kind of your bedtime routines.

74
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:32.940
Rachel Weatherbie: I haven't had written. Like I said, I just went to the park because we do go so I've just been doing nothing, pretty much.

75
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.760
Rachel Weatherbie: Like a giraffe at all. Okay.

76
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:46.980
Tracy Jackson: How about when you normally eat. I mean, when you're not throwing up and having diarrhea and what's, what's your diet. Like, what sorts of foods to eat normally

77
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.190
Rachel Weatherbie: Oh I chatty just normal, you know,

78
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.120
Rachel Weatherbie: like oatmeal and itching.

79
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.710
Rachel Weatherbie: Like easy stuff. I don't cook this much as they used to.

80
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:05.730
Tracy Jackson: Okay. Have you ever made any dietary modifications to try to improve your pain experience.

81
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.190
Rachel Weatherbie: No. Okay.

82
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.690
Tracy Jackson: Is anybody ever told you that that might be a way that you could address your pain.

83
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:21.120
Tracy Jackson: And and we'll talk about some of this stuff at the end. I'm just going to gather some information right now for me. Okay.

84
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:29.280
Tracy Jackson: And you mentioned before that you only have pain on the left conference accident and before that.

85
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.630
Tracy Jackson: You had low shoulder pain, but any headaches painful menstrual cramps irritable bowel symptoms, any of that kind of stuff.

86
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.450
Rachel Weatherbie: Yeah, period. It's like

87
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.550
Rachel Weatherbie: really heavy.

88
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.550
Tracy Jackson: Okay. And did that cause you to miss any school or miss work in the past or something because with

89
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.070
Rachel Weatherbie: I've missed work because

90
00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.640
Tracy Jackson: Okay, and how about headaches, any kind of headaches.

91
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.060
Rachel Weatherbie: Once in a while. Okay.

92
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.830
Tracy Jackson: It's not, it's not a common thing for you.

93
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:08.580
Tracy Jackson: And in terms of activity and exercise things that you do for movements, what would that be

94
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:17.610
Rachel Weatherbie: Well, I haven't been doing any since I moved to before. I will tell I was going for a walk or I had an extra surgery tonight do at home, they

95
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.130
Rachel Weatherbie: Have seen everything. Okay.

96
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.930
Tracy Jackson: So when you're able

97
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:28.830
Tracy Jackson: And as you get going again your preferred type of activity is to walk is

98
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.970
Tracy Jackson: Walking for exercise.

99
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.960
Rachel Weatherbie: Come strolling swim. There's a swimming pool for swimming pools.

100
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.550
Tracy Jackson: Okay.

101
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.600
Tracy Jackson: And if you do need, you know, sometimes swimming

102
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:49.140
Tracy Jackson: Clubs will get discounts to people if their doctor writes a prescription that they could use the pool for aqua therapy or something like that.

103
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:58.860
Tracy Jackson: So if you need, or would like to consider getting involved in something like that and Albuquerque, and you find a pool. Let us know so we can give you a prescription

104
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.770
Tracy Jackson: Okay, maybe you didn't get a discount on those rights.

105
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.250
For that

106
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.530
Tracy Jackson: And how about your sleep.

107
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:16.290
Rachel Weatherbie: Sometimes I don't we get prescribed. Well, I need to see a doctor here. No, I don't have a doctor, I need to establish here. So they were prescribing me sleeping pills, because I had

108
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.890
Rachel Weatherbie: Problems like going to sleep. Sometimes, and then sometimes I just think too much. Okay.

109
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:31.440
Tracy Jackson: So it's not consistent and when you do have trouble falling asleep. Is it or sleeping. Is it trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.

110
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.730
Rachel Weatherbie: staying asleep.

111
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.330
Tracy Jackson: So you can fall asleep pretty quickly normally with a sleeping pill. But then you wake up multiple times in the night.

112
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.440
Rachel Weatherbie: Yeah.

113
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.190
Tracy Jackson: And when you wake up. How hard is it for you to fall back asleep.

114
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:49.350
Rachel Weatherbie: It takes a long time because some night and had I used to be up like all night.

115
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.670
Tracy Jackson: Okay. And have you ever been tested for sleep apnea.

116
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.060
Tracy Jackson: No. Okay. Do you know what that is.

117
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.020
Tracy Jackson: Yes. Okay. Do you know if you snore.

118
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.150
Rachel Weatherbie: No, no, no.

119
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:10.860
Tracy Jackson: You know, no. Okay. And the reason that I asked about sleep apnea is a lot of times if people snore, or if they

120
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:21.570
Tracy Jackson: Have a certain shape in their mouth, you know, just you're born with it, whatever, and you can't get enough oxygen we lay on your back and your tongue sort of salt falls in the back of your mouth.

121
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:33.840
Tracy Jackson: That can cause you a couple of things. Number one, you your body thinks you're choking. And so typically, when you wake up you wake up fully in fight or flight syndrome right you wake up like heart racing.

122
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:40.140
Tracy Jackson: Sort of breathing quickly, all that kind of stuff. And it's sometimes hard to go back to sleep and also

123
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:53.010
Tracy Jackson: When you're not getting enough oxygen because your tongues in the way, that's when you don't get oxygen to those muscles into the nerves and so you can wake up with your pain actually flaring

124
00:27:54.270 --> 00:28:10.350
Tracy Jackson: And so a lot of times if you can get a sleep study like as you get established and as the clinic sets and backup is he can be evaluated for that the treatment is a is a machine, you know that that see pat machine which a

125
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.620
Tracy Jackson: Lot of

126
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:22.200
Tracy Jackson: People don't like. But I tell people that, it obviously works wonders, because nobody on the planet would wear that thing, unless it was a really significant improvement that people felt

127
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:38.790
Tracy Jackson: So it's one of those things that we do know with people with chronic pain that if they have difficulty sleeping and if they get tested and do have some obstruction and where that machine that everything comes to get better. Better sleep better pain.

128
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.650
Tracy Jackson: That kind of thing.

129
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:54.540
Tracy Jackson: So it's something that I can write you a prescription for that we can email it to you. And once you start to establish care and look around for clinics in the area. If that's something you want to look into. You can get that evaluated. Okay.

130
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:55.440
Okay.

131
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.530
Tracy Jackson: Do you have any nightmares or flashbacks of the accident or anything else that wake you up.

132
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.170
Rachel Weatherbie: I'm not, I don't remember that.

133
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:12.720
Tracy Jackson: Okay. All right. So have you ever experienced anything that you consider to be really traumatic in your life that causes you distress.

134
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.710
Rachel Weatherbie: Was an alcoholic kinetic muscle.

135
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.000
OK.

136
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.340
Tracy Jackson: And

137
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:29.550
Tracy Jackson: Now that you're getting you're getting clean now on a is your mood. How would you describe your mood now.

138
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.290
Rachel Weatherbie: I've just been so tired. I haven't been wanting to do anything. Okay, but I'm

139
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.760
Rachel Weatherbie: Starting to feel better.

140
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.930
Rachel Weatherbie: So just

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.990
No. Okay.

171
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.900
Tracy Jackson: And is there a particular reason and

172
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.720
Tracy Jackson: But you haven't explored any of that.

173

Rachel Weatherbie: Um, no. Like I pretty much I've just been moving around a lot like busy with that. Okay.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.460
Rachel Weatherbie: And my mom's visiting right now.

186
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.720
Okay.

187
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.800
Tracy Jackson: So even though you're looking for a job, you have

188
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:54.480
Tracy Jackson: A stable enough financial situation and somewhere to live and enough money for food and your medicines and all that kind of stuff.

189
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.820
Rachel Weatherbie: You know, my mom's been helping me

Tracy Jackson: What um

192
00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:13.980
Tracy Jackson: What else do you feel like I need to know to be able to understand your story with regards to your pain.

193
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.560
Rachel Weatherbie: Um,

194
00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.930
Rachel Weatherbie: I can't think of anything.

195
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:24.030
Tracy Jackson: All right. Did you have a pain doctor in a Cinderella. Did you have a somebody that

196
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:25.950
Rachel Weatherbie: I was

197
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.310
Rachel Weatherbie: Going to physical therapy.

198
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:36.120
Tracy Jackson: Okay, did you didn't have anybody to offer do any sort of nerve blocks or injections or any medicines or

199
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.190
Rachel Weatherbie: No, I wanna

200
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:47.580
Rachel Weatherbie: I want to start seeing some kind of specialist or something like I just had a really bad luck with doctors and also getting my disability like I've just had the worst.

201
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.980
Tracy Jackson: Okay, so you're you're looking to do you're applying for disability. Now, is that right

202
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.310
Rachel Weatherbie: I have applied and been denied. And then I don't know.

203
00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.450
Rachel Weatherbie: Going on it right now.

204
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:02.580
Tracy Jackson: Okay. And then what kind of work are you looking to do or did you do before

205
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.240
Rachel Weatherbie: I don't even know.

206
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.800
Tracy Jackson: Okay, you're not sure what you can do, what did you do before

207
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:18.930
Rachel Weatherbie: Well, I was in school for a long time. I guess I just did like stages. Now, as a life coach for quite a while.

208
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:20.400
Rachel Weatherbie: I work with people with

209
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.410
Developmental Disability

210
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:33.240
Tracy Jackson: And so you mentioned you might want to go see a pain specialist because there might be some procedures and other sorts of things that may be helpful, particularly for that left leg pain.

211
00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:44.340
Tracy Jackson: Because you may have some nerve injury and there are a lot of kind of procedures where they can go in and if you have a irritated nerve. They can activate that nerve or burn that nerve. So it kind of

212
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:50.790
Tracy Jackson: Calm down a little bit. And that might minimize your pain and allow you to be more functional and move around.

213
00:34:52.680 --> 00:35:04.200
Tracy Jackson: There's also a pain condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome that can sometimes result in swelling and really extreme pain and color change and that sort of thing.

214
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:14.580
Tracy Jackson: And so I really would like somebody to evaluate you in person to look at that, because there are some procedures that can be done to help that. And since special medication.

215
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:27.870
Tracy Jackson: I'm going to recommend that if he when your leg is swollen up and change colors like that, take a picture of it so that you can show the doctor because it does tend to come and go.

216
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.520
Tracy Jackson: Yes, right.

217
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:36.780
Tracy Jackson: And so they want to make sure that they can see it when it's at its worst to get a good idea of what it looks like.

218
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.550
Tracy Jackson: That help them with the diagnosis what insurance. He has

219
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.800
Rachel Weatherbie: To change Centennial

220
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:45.600
Tracy Jackson: I'm sorry.

221
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.180
Rachel Weatherbie: Presbyterian Centennial

222
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.400
Tracy Jackson: That's the insurance.

223
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.380
Rachel Weatherbie: Yes. Okay.

224
00:35:54.180 --> 00:36:05.790
Tracy Jackson: So what I would recommend is and this is a little I can give you a referral to an interventional pain. Doctor, you know somebody who can actually see you. We just need to know

225
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:16.920
Tracy Jackson: You'll just need to figure out who and who is covered in your network and in your area. Now that you're there, but all these sorts of referrals and I might give you for sleep study and a pain.

226
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:34.620
Tracy Jackson: In person pain evaluation, you can then take or fax to your insurance company or that provider, because the, the one or referral right to be able to see you and I can, I can make that referral for you. We just need to know where to send it is in your network.

227
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.890
Rachel Weatherbie: Okay, so I need to look up, Dr.

228
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:45.930
Tracy Jackson: Yeah, so normally an insurance plan will have a list of doctors that are in your network. So if you look up

229
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.640
Tracy Jackson: Pain doctor and I'm gonna

230
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.990
Tracy Jackson: She's nice see

231
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.470
Tracy Jackson: On your phone if I do this chat here.

232
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.470
Tracy Jackson: If I chat and i right

233
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.410
Tracy Jackson: interventional pain. Can you see that

234
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.450
Tracy Jackson: Yeah, the city.

235
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.790
Tracy Jackson: So that's what you'll need to maybe take a screenshot of that or something because it'll go away when

236
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.260
Rachel Weatherbie: When we end all but

237
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.370
Tracy Jackson: Or write it down or something. But that is what you'll want to look up

238
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:37.410
Tracy Jackson: You know in your network and see what's covered by you or who is covered by your insurance and then I can, you'll have the prescription referral, but I will, or the referral that I can email you that then you can send to that office.

239
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:38.790
Rachel Weatherbie: Okay.

240
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:43.350
Tracy Jackson: All right, so that's one way to get that evaluated and

241
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.190
Rachel Weatherbie: The interventional pain doctors

242
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.750
Rachel Weatherbie: That are hot and it already went on.

243
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.840
Tracy Jackson: That we'd already did. Okay, let me try this again.

244
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:59.010
Tracy Jackson: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, or C or PS. I also want you to have that term.

245
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.020
Tracy Jackson: Can you see that

246
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.870
Rachel Weatherbie: Yes. Okay.

247
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:12.720
Tracy Jackson: So there's a possibility that that might be going on in your leg and so you'll really need a pain specialist to evaluate that for you. Okay.

248
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:14.790
Rachel Weatherbie: Okay.

249
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.560
Tracy Jackson: Are you having any

250
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:24.750
Tracy Jackson: Any changes in your bowel or bladder function like you're leaking urine or stool. When you don't intend to

251
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.450
Rachel Weatherbie: Know, okay.

252
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.350
Tracy Jackson: And do you have any pain in your spine in your neck or your back.

253
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.590
Rachel Weatherbie: Just a shoulder, since it was broken.

254
00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:42.450
Tracy Jackson: Just read this episode for concealed or open. And then the other thing I'm going to right here for you is a sleep study. And again, I'm going to

255
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:47.010
Tracy Jackson: Not

256
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.640
Rachel Weatherbie: Do that.

257
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:54.210
Tracy Jackson: Yeah. Uh huh. You don't have to, but I'm just writing this down so you can because it's a lot to remember. But you don't have to do

258
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.770
Tracy Jackson: That. And like I said, if, if

259
00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:02.160
Tracy Jackson: A lot of people, I say if you're not willing to wear that machine. I wouldn't even get the study. Right. And a lot of people just aren't willing to wear them.

260
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:04.590
Tracy Jackson: Understand

261
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.390
Tracy Jackson: The other thing about

262
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.100
Tracy Jackson: Diet is that, in general, it's

263
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:22.980
Tracy Jackson: sugary foods foods with a lot of processed sugars like that come in boxes and cans with a bunch of ingredients.

264
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.280
Tracy Jackson: They tend to cause inflammation in the body that can worsen nerve pain and muscle pain like you have

265
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:42.330
Tracy Jackson: And so, and arthritis pain can be worse. And so I tell people that more like a whole what you hear about whole food diets, or Paleo kind of diets, or Mediterranean diet where you have like

266
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:51.840
Tracy Jackson: fish and chicken and lean meat and vegetables and that kind of thing is a much better choice. And I know people can't just like

267
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:59.190
Tracy Jackson: Cut out all their foods and some of those foods like meats and vegetables are more expensive, but just be aware and maybe notice

268
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:11.010
Tracy Jackson: You know when you eat really sugary drinks or snacks or soft drinks for that kind of thing, if it affects your pain and if it does just some people just cutting out sugar and soft drinks or

269
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:22.080
Tracy Jackson: Not adding sugar to their coffee or not eating as many sort of chips and cookies and that kind of thing. They can notice an improvement, a significant improvement in their pain.

270
00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:39.780
Tracy Jackson: Some people like to try fad diets like whole 30 or keto diet or Paleo diets, or whatever. And it's not necessary. It's just being aware that those types of sugary foods really do increase the inflammation in your body and staying away from those

271
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.690
Tracy Jackson: As you can is going to improve your pain over time.

272
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:48.990
Rachel Weatherbie: Yeah, I wanted to get my like what I eat on tracks. I'm getting older.

273
00:40:50.040 --> 00:41:00.330
Tracy Jackson: Yeah, and you know, as I've looked around at a lot of these kinds of diets and there's no one size fits all right you know if you feel crappy on a certain diet or or it feels like you're pulling teeth.

274
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:16.920
Tracy Jackson: You know, then it's not worth doing. But there's some diet like a keto diet where if you already eat a lot of sort of fatty foods like bacon or cheese's or eggs or things like that and you enjoy eating them that way.

275
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:33.210
Tracy Jackson: That's a way that doesn't make people feel as deprived and it's also not as expensive, you know, the other kind of diets, the organic vegan kind of diets, although they might be healthier tend to be hard to stick harder to sit with for a lot of people and more expensive.

276
00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.110
Tracy Jackson: So again, just trying to stick to sort of

277
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:45.630
Tracy Jackson: Meat and colorful vegetables as much as you can eat fish colorful vegetables that kind of stuff is an oatmeal will be fun, you know,

278
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:55.650
Tracy Jackson: There's a, there's some good rules of thumb, and you can look up things like low sugar diets, or anti inflammatory diets and see

279
00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:06.270
Tracy Jackson: I don't like the word diet, you know, if you can't stick with it. It's not worth doing. That's why I say just maybe knock out a couple of things that you think, or maybe really sugary and see if you're paying improves

280
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:07.620
Rachel Weatherbie: Okay, no.

281
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:16.650
Tracy Jackson: And the last thing that I offer for people at bright heart and you can talk to Dr candela about it.

282
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:35.760
Tracy Jackson: But I have groups that I do for people within the bright heart system, who have chronic pain. Okay. And in those groups. We don't ever talk about medications or anything else but we get together. So, my group of eight or 10 people and I'll give some

283
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:45.240
Tracy Jackson: Some options for things that you can do for free, right from your house to manage pain right

284
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.450
Tracy Jackson: So it's really important to me that it's accessible for everybody and they have to be things that have scientific evidence

285
00:42:51.930 --> 00:43:04.170
Tracy Jackson: So I'll talk about the evidence for what it is. And then if it's something like chair yoga or breathing exercise or nutrition recommendation or like this the next six weeks we're talking about sleep.

286
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:12.000
Tracy Jackson: Things that you can do or different techniques or apps or education about why people don't sleep and how to improve your sleep.

287
00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:19.740
Tracy Jackson: You know, and make sure that everybody has access to that. And can you know practice it at home and that kind of thing.

288
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:29.100
Tracy Jackson: And so if that's something that you just want more information about different ways to manage your pain without having to go to a doctor or take a pill or take a shot, then

289
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.700
Tracy Jackson: We do those groups on Thursdays every other week at 530 Pacific time

290
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:38.760
Rachel Weatherbie: And we'll

291
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.790
Tracy Jackson: send you an email about that. And if that's something you're interested in, and normally

292
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:55.020
Tracy Jackson: You know, I don't know if that's your candle Posey but normally at bright heart we see you every week, particularly when you're first getting going. You know, to make sure that you're doing. Okay.

293
00:43:55.530 --> 00:44:06.480
Tracy Jackson: You'll see Dr. Candle every week. But over time, if you want to. So often say, you don't have to see her every week. You can see me if pain you know if your medicines are stable and you just want to

294
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:12.270
Tracy Jackson: Discuss things about pain. So those are some things that we could do in the future.

295
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:13.380
Rachel Weatherbie: Okay.

296
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:21.090
Tracy Jackson: That sounds good. I know it's a very overwhelming of a lot of information. But I think the major thing is to try to get your referral to a

297
00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:30.900
Tracy Jackson: interventional pain doctor to see if there's some procedures to be done for that leg and if you might have that Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, because there's some special medicines, they can do for that.

298
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.220
Okay.

299
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:35.790
