Monica: It. Yeah, okay.

58
00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:02.310
Michael Hoefer: Let me see. I'll try to Google that because it's, uh, I'll see if something comes up that's close to that because I'm not totally familiar

59
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.390
Monica: With that was it.

60
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.590
Was it baclofen

61
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.800
Monica: I think so. Okay.

62
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.430
Michael Hoefer: And what was, what was that medication supposed to do for you.

63
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.740
Michael Hoefer: Like how did it help you

64
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.530
Monica: I'm not sure if it was for anxiety.

65
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.490
Okay.

66
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.980
Michael Hoefer: How many times did you did you take it multiple times a day, or once a day.

67
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.480
Monica: Know, multiple times. I think I was like four times a day. Okay.

68
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.470
Okay.

69
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:46.080
Michael Hoefer: All right. So that might sue. So that may have been a medication that the closest thing that I can think through is the medication called back within which is like a muscle relaxer, and it also can sometimes make you feel tired and can help with anxiety.

70
00:08:47.520 --> 00:09:01.410
Michael Hoefer: Okay, so that was maybe one of them. Do you have any like, you know, papers with the with the medication names, or do you have any old bottles or anything that we could look at to kind of see, just so I have an idea of what you've been on

71
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.760
Let me see.

72
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.320
Monica: I'm not sure I'm not sure if this is one of them, but I'm

73
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.240
Monica: Hydro foot know that's all we're talking about

74
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:37.590
Monica: You know what, like I I just moved to I just moved. Like, like, like, a week ago and I'm

76
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.180
Monica: Okay.

77
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.100
Michael Hoefer: Well, we can try to figure out a way around that the medication. You just picked up was that hydroxyl.

78
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.870

79

80
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:07.590

Okay, that's nice.

399
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.040
Michael Hoefer: Okay. And then, you know, one other question I had for you.

400
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:43.320
Michael Hoefer: In the past, any issue with, you know, cocaine or math or other substances even like a long time ago. You ever feel like you had a problem with anything.

401
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.820
Monica: Yeah, growing

402
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.300
Monica: Up. I used to only be grown up by spirits.

403
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:49.890
Monica: When I

404
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:55.260
Michael Hoefer: Gotcha. So as a teenager used most things, at least you know

405
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.160
Michael Hoefer: You know, try and try it almost everything essentially

406
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.140
Michael Hoefer: And did you feel like anything.

407
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:09.270
Michael Hoefer: Did you feel like anything at that time that were you ever worried about like this. Hey, I think I might have a problem with alcohol or I think you might have a problem with math or I think

408
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:16.440
Michael Hoefer: Was there anything that stood out as, like, you know, feeling like that you had an addiction to it or you were worried about a specific one.

409
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:21.540
Monica: Yeah, I, I would say alcohol and paint oka

410
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.640
Michael Hoefer: alcohol and caffeine pain.

411
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:25.950
Michael Hoefer: Though, you're saying, yeah.

412
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:31.290
Michael Hoefer: Yeah. Okay. And is that like spray paint or is that a different types of paint.

413
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.400
Monica: That you would use yes scraping. Gotcha. Okay.

414
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.700
Michael Hoefer: All right.

415
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:48.660
Michael Hoefer: And then just a couple last questions. One is, have you ever had experiences like hearing voices talking to you when nobody else is around

416
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:55.620
Michael Hoefer: Yes. Yeah. Does that happen recently. Yeah, okay.

417
00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.610
Michael Hoefer: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

418
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:07.530
Michael Hoefer: And how about like, you know, feeling like people are watching you are out to get you, and you don't know why.

419
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.420
Monica: Yeah, so I had cameras.

420
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.570
Michael Hoefer: Okay, so that's kind of like paranoia and that's the cameras help with. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

421
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.280
Michael Hoefer: All right.

422
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:36.690
Michael Hoefer: All right. Well, those are kind of the major questions I have that I wanted to ask you. Thank you for answering them all. And so I know a lot of them do you, um, do you have any, anything that I left out or anything else that you think it's important for me to know right now.

423
00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.810
Monica: I don't know. I think pretty much everything

424
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.730
Okay dancer.

425
00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:08.790
Michael Hoefer: All right. And so, and then I guess the other question has had is, you know, the anger that you struggle with how does it negatively affect your life. Does it, does it cause you to get in fights to the cause you upset relationships is just cause you to stress how does it. How does the angrier.

426
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.100
Michael Hoefer: Cause you impairment

427
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.570
Monica: I just get everywhere on people take the best out of me and I

428
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.430
Monica: Feel like

429
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.950
Monica: You know, like everybody else was going on, you know, with like, except you.

430
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:40.950
Monica: Know it makes me mad about that I have friends and people betrayed me in

431
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:49.380
Monica: Britain much all I kind of think about capacity and kind of the wall and my word.

432
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.590
Monica: Is just not easy. It's hard.

433
00:39:53.040 --> 00:40:01.950
Michael Hoefer: So yeah, and have you and you mentioned your social worker earlier. Do you, do you do kind of counseling or therapy or anything at the clinic that you're at

434
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.110
Monica: Yes.

435
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.920
Michael Hoefer: Okay.

436
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.570
And how often do you do that.

437
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.370
Monica: Because three times a month.

438
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:18.000
Michael Hoefer: Okay, gotcha. And can you remind me the name of the clinic that you're at the mental health clinic.

439
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.730
Monica: It's valid choice.

440
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:29.160
Michael Hoefer: Valid choice. Okay. And the name of the Methadone clinic, you remind me the name of that place.

441
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.790
Monica: Oh, that's what that is so far. Oh.

442
00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.470
Monica: My god, I'm

443
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:44.040
Monica: Glad I can think about it. Okay.

444
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.270
Michael Hoefer: That's okay.

445
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.320
Michael Hoefer: All right. Alright, but the Methadone clinic is called Valley choice.

446
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.450
Monica: Yeah. Yes.

447
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.440
Michael Hoefer: And then the

448
00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:04.170
Michael Hoefer: I guess so. So the Methadone clinic is valid choice. Is that where the social worker is you work with, is she also at the Methadone clinic or

449
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.160
Michael Hoefer: She had a different clinics.

450
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.620
Monica: Oh yeah. Her name is Ashley.

451
00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:10.350
Michael Hoefer: Ashley and she's at the Methadone clinic as well.

452
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.590
Michael Hoefer: And then your primary care doctor is that a different clinic.

453
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.120
Michael Hoefer: Or

454
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:15.840
Michael Hoefer: Yes, yes.

455
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:16.950
Michael Hoefer: She's okay

456
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.140
Monica: And the hospital. Okay.

457
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.760
Michael Hoefer: Let's see the hospital. Okay.

458
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.570
Michael Hoefer: All right, and so

459
00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:34.170
Michael Hoefer: What I think would be helpful now is what I'd like to do is, is give give a call over to your pharmacy, because it would be helpful for me.

460
00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:44.970
Michael Hoefer: Before we start to think about, like, what would be, you know, potential medication options for you, it would be important for me to get a better sense of kind of what your make sure I know everything you're already taking

461
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:50.100
Michael Hoefer: And also gets if potential to get some information from your

462
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:59.070
Michael Hoefer: Your primary care doctor about your med history. Like what kind of things have been tried and you know this work, this didn't work. You know, because I'm

463
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:09.780
Michael Hoefer: I don't, you know, it sounds like you're already on some medications that are actually usually pretty good medication. So I don't want to just come in and mix things around without understanding the medication history a little bit better.

464
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.440
Michael Hoefer: But we certainly can.

465
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:27.120
Michael Hoefer: You know, our, our company can certainly you know take you in as a psychiatric care patient and start to work on, you know, the ongoing stress and the ongoing anger and the things that you're struggling with, and see if we can

466
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.880
Michael Hoefer: Help you out from the medication side and also from the the therapy side.

467
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:34.050
Michael Hoefer: To

468
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.670
Michael Hoefer: Get you feeling better.

469
00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:50.040
Michael Hoefer: So, so what that would look like. Was I would I would, you know, once we got off the phone today. I'd call the pharmacy, I'd get that I get the information of what you're on right away and then we would call for records to your primary care doctor

470
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.430
Michael Hoefer: To get you know all your medical history that we can

471
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.050
Michael Hoefer: And then hopefully within

472
00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:01.200
Michael Hoefer: What I'd have is probably have one of my care coordinators reach out to you tomorrow or the next day to

473
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.400
Michael Hoefer: Talk to you about getting

474
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.030
Michael Hoefer: Into like

475
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:08.910
Michael Hoefer: Our program usually runs. We run groups that meet once a week via your phone.

476
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:19.800
Michael Hoefer: And then we also have visits with psychiatrists, or, you know, psychiatric nurse practitioners or things like that that we can help try to make your improve your mat regimen. So

477
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:21.300
Monica: Okay.

478
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:31.890
Michael Hoefer: And and it sounds like you know if we usually try to focus on, you know, we make a list of things but we try to focus on like one thing at a time, you know, just to try to make progress. So

479
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:39.360
Michael Hoefer: Would it be most would it be most helpful for you to get, you know, do you feel like would you want to really focus on the anxiety. Most anger most

480
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:47.070
