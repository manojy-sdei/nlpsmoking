00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.330
copia

2
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

3
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.430
Debbie Barker: There we go.

4
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.750
Debbie Barker: Hi.

5
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.060
Debbie Barker: Just said preparing for meeting. So I've been there for a while, and I'm just didn't go through, I guess.

6
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, well, let's check on that. Are you saying that there was a technical issue for even these 11 minutes or you're saying the last, like, two minutes.

7
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.320
Debbie Barker: Oh, I've been checked in for like the last 20 minutes

8
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Into this room into this

9
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.800
Debbie Barker: 761. Mm hmm.

10
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the first time seeing it.

11
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.700
Debbie Barker: Preparing for the meeting at the top is what it said.

12
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So then

13
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Angelina reached you and then hung up and then went back and logged in.

14
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so keep that as a as just an extra technique. If you notice, something's off is kind of toggle in and out.

15
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because your name wasn't there. And now it's here so that might just be one of those things that your phone is funky or who knows what. But

16
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You're here now.

17
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.030
Debbie Barker: That we're not Robbie would own anyway.

18
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, exactly. So, um, I noticed you had something sort of weighing on your mind during group. Something was sort of pressing for you.

19
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, was that

20
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:12.090
Debbie Barker: Probably still the Kathy thing. Yeah, he's gone to she'd been gone for a day or so she'll be back. Okay.

21
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you end up having that little talk, you were thinking about having

22
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.960
Debbie Barker: No, no, yes and no.

23
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

24
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.940
Debbie Barker: Yes, I'm fixing to put my foot down all around.

25
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So hard to do that.

26
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.340
Debbie Barker: Well, I can't can't keep letting it interfered with my life, all the time.

27
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.660
Debbie Barker: I deserve to have a life to 2038 years. Oh my god, what

28
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you do

29
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.440
Debbie Barker: I deserve to

30
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.610
Debbie Barker: Have some peace and quiet and so on and

31
00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:05.370
Debbie Barker: We just got more. We don't let people in and out, not so much knocking at the wind and and the bad thing was they were going through her bedroom window like three o'clock in the morning and things like that.

32
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.030
Debbie Barker: So that was getting to be totally out of hand.

33
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.530
Truly

34
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.810
Debbie Barker: What must my neighbors think

35
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Not like you've got a teenager in the house.

36
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.840
Debbie Barker: TX like one Jack's words in it. Some done

37
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.030
Gwenevere Abriel: How much do you know about because I know you've had some some really good

38
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Good therapy in the past and I'm so grateful that

39
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How much of

40
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: This concept of enabling. Are you familiar with, like, I probably heard the word. But how much do you know about that word.

41
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.520
Debbie Barker: Been real good at down

42
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I was trying to think of you might know that one inside now.

43
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.960
Debbie Barker: Oh,

44
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: So would it be useful to hear my definition of it as opposed to kind of how you might define yours.

45
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.480
Okay.

46
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is how I sort of meet people, when they say

47
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:31.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, but it's my son or, oh, it's my daughter. Oh, it's but it's my sister and I love them and I can't just let them live on the street. I hear that all day long, because I'm not only treating you

48
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm kind of also trying to treat the whole system that you're in this whole family, right, in a sense.

49
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean it isn't. We don't just operate individually. We're in families were in intense sometimes abusive relationships. And so I all address it as it comes up and so

50
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I see enabling as doing for someone

51
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Without a plan on teaching them.

52
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: How to do it for themselves.

53
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So doing for them without a plan on how to show them how to do for themselves. So it's that like feed them a fish, teach them how to fish kind of thing.

54
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's kind of like that.

55
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: And indeed doing for someone what

56
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Kathy could if she was not an active addiction, she could do for herself. Now the addict isn't going to do anything. The, the way I look at people as they're sort of divided

57
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: The addict is going to keep hustling going to keep lying to people is going to keep using unfortunately that's probably the case.

58
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think we've probably talked about that you'll recognize your daughter when she is in her authentic self when she's in her right mind when she's not in active addiction, you'll recognize the difference in her behavior, right.

59
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm here. We talked about that last time that you'll be able to see the difference.

60
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.060
Debbie Barker: Yeah I know the difference. Okay.

61
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, teach me what I will hear from you as evidence that Cathy is

62
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Not listening to addiction. She's in her right mind. She's making healthy choices. What are you going to see in here it's a little different in Kathy's behavior.

63
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.190
Debbie Barker: She's gonna throw my addiction. What little bit. I've done right back in my face.

64
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When is that when when the addict is making the decisions or when the authentic self is

65
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.290
Debbie Barker: When the attic is making the decision.

66
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.400
Yeah.

67
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.460
Debbie Barker: Just like your father.

68
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.220
Debbie Barker: Something you need to know.

69
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:58.740
Debbie Barker: Um, she was raised by a guy that did 17 years in prison and was on the run for 747 years

70
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And you were with him or she was with him alone. And they were kind of hide now.

71
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.680
Debbie Barker: No, I'm I didn't meet him.

72
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.570
Debbie Barker: I met him when I was 19

73
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.840
Debbie Barker: Hid probably been on the run on maybe over 20 years at that time.

74
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:36.030
Debbie Barker: I didn't know what if he was telling me a story because he tell the story about, you know, things when he was drinking, but he got arrested.

75
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:47.520
Debbie Barker: All probably about eight or nine years ago the grandson found some articles about his grandfather getting shot. Well done 17 years and

76
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:58.950
Debbie Barker: Went on the run. He didn't want to, you know, stay in California and check in and and that kind of thing. So the guy hired a private detective and they found been

77
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.510
Debbie Barker: arrested him and send him back to Montana and that's where he died.

78
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.320
Debbie Barker: But he also killed another wife. Meanwhile, we tried to prove and could improve

79
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.130
So,

80
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: He was convicted of murder.

81
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.560
Yes.

82
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So you didn't mention that part.

83
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.710
Debbie Barker: Victim to murder. Yes.

84
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And you said that you wonder if he hurt someone else or killed someone else.

85
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.550
Debbie Barker: Oh, I know he did

86
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:50.640
Debbie Barker: Whoa, I know he did I even went to Albuquerque and talk to the colon detective and and all that and they just, they don't want to take it to condemn her dog on that property they cut down the tree where the barrier, but she's still on that property underneath the tree.

87
00:09:52.320 --> 00:10:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It seemed like something you could you could call a TV journalist station and get this thing investigated through the media well

88
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.500
Debbie Barker: They did a movie about his life.

89
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.960
Debbie Barker: And so on. It's

90
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.010
Debbie Barker: Been i think you know him on the run and

91
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:22.350
Debbie Barker: Her saying you know that you can get by with so much and of course he let her get by with things all the time. Yeah.

92
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:33.690
Debbie Barker: I would tell her knowing we when we divorced we separated our property. I took the front nature and he took the bank acre, so we kind of raised the girls together.

93
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.770
Debbie Barker: So when they got mad at me, they would go back to their debts.

94
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:50.010
Debbie Barker: And then when I moved to New Mexico, when she got mad at me she'd call her dad and get pay a bus ticket and off should go in, you know,

95
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: The ability

96
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.010
Debbie Barker: You know, come home. Yeah.

97
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that won't work.

98
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Here she is.

99
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Not having anywhere to run to but to drugs.

100
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: For the easy way out. And so now there's drugs or there's you and she's you don't take the easy road out

101
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.630
Debbie Barker: You don't want to go to counseling.

102
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.280
Debbie Barker: Things.

103
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: She needs it.

104
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.810
Debbie Barker: Yo, she does does

105
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:38.610
Debbie Barker: I had a heck of a time went through the other night I was trying to rest and I had to tell her five different times to quiet down her room is connected. I mean, my beds. Just right there next to, and she kept tossing things right there next to my

106
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:45.480
Debbie Barker: You know the other side. The Room five times. I went in there. She wouldn't know like me. The sixth time

107
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:55.320
Debbie Barker: On site so much and then down. She goes, I don't hurt her anything but I just put her to the floor.

108
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: See. So tell me, tell me what to translate that though, I just want to know, are you, are you still got the strengthen you, to wrestle someone down to the floor.

109
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:04.740
Debbie Barker: Or do

110
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.910
You know,

111
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.800
Debbie Barker: I sure do.

112
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:08.610
Wow.

113
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So you'll you'll do it for your tipping point is usually about five times you'll ask nicely. You'll be firm and clear and then you've had it. Yeah.

114
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And how bad you to get like last night.

115
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.190
Debbie Barker: She finally quit.

116
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, thank goodness.

117
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:44.070
Debbie Barker: Asking or five times to quiet down words the respect. She don't you know she works here and there, some time and all that money goes into drugs, won't she gonna stay here. She's going to start paying me a little bit.

118
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:55.020
Debbie Barker: We're tired of taking all the responsibility of all the bills and everything else. Why should she lived here for free and sit back there and do her drugs and do nothing.

119
00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, so here's my question to you, I'm on your side 110 I'm on your side. I want you to have someone who's paying rent to you, respecting you following your hours of, you know, when you can curfew whatever I'm on your side 110%

120
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: My question has to do with your expectations for an attic. So if you asked me to do it or you ask someone who's not using to do it, they're probably going to hear

121
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Number one, they're going to hear, Oh, I didn't even know that I was noisy. I didn't know the walls without sin. I'm so sorry. And we're going to shush.

122
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And we're not going to need to be asked. So that's when when we're in our right mind, it's not going to take you five times. So that's number one. Number two, I'm going to be offering to pay you rent your my mom. I'm an adult. Of course, I'm going to do that. I will be working

123
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So here's the thing.

124
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You're asking an addict that only cares about escape and and euphoria to show you respect.

125
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, and not spend money on a substance.

126
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.770
Gwenevere Abriel: What if first you need to get your daughter back

127
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Because your daughter's not there, the attics there.

128
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that's the case.

129
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: What if it means

130
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Ultimatum drawing the line you know that sixth you know when you've had it line, you're probably getting close to it at this point.

131
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:48.780
Debbie Barker: Why I am she's gonna job and she'll probably go back to Congress for a while and be making pretty good money but again to spend it on that.

132
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.920
Yeah.

133
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:52.560
And

134
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:55.710
Debbie Barker: Also

135
00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:12.240
Debbie Barker: Got two more seamless, you know, just about offer things and then started right back on things on, you know, why didn't you go through that little bit. We'll just, you know, stay on top of him when he wrote, almost there.

136
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're thinking that they are opiates, or you're not sure

137
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.740
Debbie Barker: It's heroin and speed.

138
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, OK. So maybe might be math like crystal meth and heroin. Okay.

139
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:32.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

140
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: If there's no

141
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: buprenorphine right to mitigate those withdrawal, it's going to feel like death.

142
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You know she's going to really want to have something in place to to treat that

143
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, I forgot.

144
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.780
Debbie Barker: Somebody was trying to call in. Oh.

145
00:15:59.220 --> 00:15:59.490
Alright.

146
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:10.110
Debbie Barker: And we might have an issue with the phone here and tell me send the payment off but it hasn't got there yet.

147
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:17.430
Debbie Barker: So I'm not sure I'm not be without a phone for three or four days, maybe a little bit longer. I'm hoping

148
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.490
Debbie Barker: Bill's been paid it just

149
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:40.680
Debbie Barker: I don't know if this office will send it on to Illinois or just one, but the outfit fear said I'm to send the payment and stuff to Columbus. So that's what they did, but I don't know what Columbus will send that to annoying now to take seven to 10 days, according to that guy.

150
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.710
Debbie Barker: But we got back on for three days.

151
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.850
Debbie Barker: Would be

152
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:56.760
Debbie Barker: Willing to take you. When you you do the right thing. You know, when paint to build and mean don't need to one know how to get online and do that kind of thing.

153
00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you're sure doing pretty good for someone who doesn't know how to do stuff I'm

154
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.010
Learning

155
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.410
Debbie Barker: You're

156
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.240
Debbie Barker: doing really good

157
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:07.260
Yeah.

158
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so let's let's play this out, Debbie. Have you ever had to kick your daughter out. Is it ever gotten to that point where you see

159
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.420
Debbie Barker: Many

160
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's all right.

161
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that where it's at, at this point.

162
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:25.320
Just about.

163
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.980
Debbie Barker: I want my peace and quiet my sanity back

164
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.660
Debbie Barker: I'm gonna have to put up with the little brat that has no respect from

165
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.950
Debbie Barker: My old one is mad at me because I'm

166
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.950
Debbie Barker: The youngest one stay here.

167
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you changed your expectation of Kathy, not only

168
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you said you've asked her to leave a couple of times a few times in the past.

169
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Each time maybe letting her back was just hope as the plan. Like, I hope she's better

170
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Or was there.

171
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.820
Debbie Barker: Will do better for quite a while and then she'll fall right back into rabbit.

172
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.840
Yeah.

173
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.290
Debbie Barker: He's going to

174
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:25.410
Debbie Barker: Go to a treatment center and be there for quite some time to get that mindset back where it should be. Right.

175
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And I guess that's what I'm getting at that you might start feeling a little nuts because the same thing happening over and over

176
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:46.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That if you set a different expectation. Hey, you're welcome to come back, but I am going to need to see this amount of treatment done otherwise knock on someone else's door.

177
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is one of many different approaches. What is what comes up for you. What do you think about when I even bring the topic of sort of setting up different nation.

178
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:09.750
Debbie Barker: I'm just gonna talk to her when she comes home to Dana Joe or one, I expect her to do know we're expecting

179
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:24.420
Debbie Barker: Some kind of money. I don't expect you to pay me a whole lot, but I want her to contribute. And I wondered, to think about doing the dishes, you know, on a few things around the house, don't just leave it up to me to do everything.

180
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.280
Debbie Barker: Aren't on

181
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're going to expect the attic to clean up after herself.

182
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.690
Debbie Barker: she cleans up a room.

183
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. Well, that's something

184
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a good sign. So maybe she does have a dinner, maybe what's when she's

185
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Taking the meth.

186
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.550
Debbie Barker: Know mine and she's lost six kids.

187
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Six. As in, she's lost them to spontaneous abortions, or miscarriages.

188
00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Know custody.

189
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.770
Debbie Barker: Through the state.

190
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.300
Whoa.

191
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.230
Debbie Barker: Which as a grandmother's been heartbreaking.

192
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Heartbreaking you could have had those little ones running around.

193
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you could have had. Cute, cute. Cute, cute all over the place.

194
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's not much that motivates Cathy, there's not much to leverage. Yeah. So here's what if she gets sober, all of that all six of those stories will come to her awareness. I don't think she's going to want to do that.

195
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:41.310
Debbie Barker: No.

196
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:49.260
Debbie Barker: She's gotten some London live with what's happened in the past and and go on somehow

197
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:59.940
Debbie Barker: Yeah, I mean, terrible things is happened to me in the past but you gotta go on with life. You can't let that negative hold you back.

198
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:16.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What if no one actually put it to the test one if no one really put their foot down and kept the foot down. What if this is the time

199
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I was wondering if you're willing to actually this time say

200
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I need you to send me money when you're over there and close this.

201
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Show me. You can be responsible and then show me that you're in treatment. Show me your, your admission paperwork, show me a progress. No sign a release of information. Let me see that you're serious about your recovery.

202
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you can

203
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.470
Debbie Barker: You know, get your ID.

204
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.430
Uh huh.

205
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:48.240
Debbie Barker: She got a burst of different and I hope you don't lose she moves us everyone

206
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:59.640
Debbie Barker: I'm Tara to hang on, and things like that. I'm spending money to try to help her get her license and stuff. And it just ain't happening.

207
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:09.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice my definition right of of enabling right. How is what you're doing.

208
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Like the definition of enabling or different from the definition would you say

209
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.840
Debbie Barker: What do you mean

210
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, are you doing for Kathy what she can plan or learn to do for herself.

211
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:29.550
Yeah.

212
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you going to do it another 10 times before you're sick and tired of it.

213
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no. One more time, three more times.

214
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.900
Debbie Barker: Maybe one or done

215
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, maybe.

216
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.090
Debbie Barker: No.

217
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.490
Debbie Barker: No, no, no.

218
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.790
Debbie Barker: I'm 62 I'm getting up in my age.

219
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on your side girl I am

220
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm on that. It's all about you. You're my client, I want you to, you know, have sanity your life. I want to protect you from the chaos.

221
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.280
Debbie Barker: Wonder to to get a wife and be happy with yourself.

222
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:19.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But the problem, I wonder, Debbie is whether you can picture from her perspective that if

223
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: GETTING HER KIDS BACK isn't motivating enough how

224
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.980
Debbie Barker: DON'T GET HER KIDS BACK. I doubt that.

225
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.520
Debbie Barker: Most of them are in homes.

226
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I'm talking about motivation.

227
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it seems unlikely that since Kathy's not motivated to get her kids back it's unlikely that she's going to be motivated by you.

228
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.140
Gwenevere Abriel: yelling at her.

229
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.150
Debbie Barker: On it. Yeah, I don't

230
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You see it.

231
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:50.640
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

232
00:23:50.880 --> 00:24:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, forget the yelling. It's not letting him talk about motivation, it's unlikely that if she's not motivated to get her kids back, which is a really for most females and men, right, they're very motivated. They're very motivated, they'll start to get into a rook recovery program.

233
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, for reunification to happen.

234
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So that hasn't been motivating for her.

235
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Her addiction is simply your

236
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.060
Debbie Barker: Yes.

237
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, I think, and I'm way out here. And honestly, I don't know.

238
00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But it sounds like

239
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything you say saying it alone is not going to motivator.

240
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Know. Is there something besides telling her

241
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: That could motivator. If you ever seen anything that got her a few months clean that motivated enough to actually do it.

242
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.160
No.

243
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:51.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Those months that she did get clean. What did the trick. What was she doing, and are you 100% sure she was clean.

244
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.610
Debbie Barker: Yeah, she was going

245
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

246
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.780
Debbie Barker: Yeah, had her kids and her husband.

247
00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:59.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

248
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:04.560
Debbie Barker: But when she lost her husband when things just slowly went downhill.

249
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And

250
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:27.150
Debbie Barker: She had a house. She had a car that she might I think nine months to finish paying for a new car, nine months to finish paying for had a home to live in all she had to do was file for his social security and work a part time job and she let all that go

251
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.460
Debbie Barker: Including the kids.

252
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So I will be here with you.

253
00:25:44.100 --> 00:26:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: When you go through this again months from now, perhaps, and you give it another try. Um, let's just, we'll just see. Let's just see. Which version of empowerment, or whether you want to set some boundaries with your daughter at some point. Let's see. Let's see how that goes.

254
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey, if you're honest completely honest with yourself. Do you believe that your daughter can benefit from going to treatment, going back to school, going back to work and that she can get her life on track. Do you think she has it in her

255
00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:21.810
Debbie Barker: I hope so.

256
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.040
Debbie Barker: Yeah.

257
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:32.100
Debbie Barker: I've dealt with this for so many years, ever since you've been a teenager.

258
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Will you soccer do well when she was

259
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: She had her husband alive. So you have witnessed that you've seen something

260
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.960
Debbie Barker: Oh, she's got a boyfriend. Now, that puts her down, like you're her dad would

261
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.370
Debbie Barker: Write and

262
00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:00.780
Debbie Barker: Get a custom them because I i wouldn't be with anybody that talk to me night get

263
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:02.970
Debbie Barker: They would

264
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.550
Debbie Barker: I just have more respect for myself than that.

265
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright.

266
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, um, let's come back to you for a little bit and talk about how you're doing okay um

267
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.310
Gwenevere Abriel: How is she doing, she she okay

268
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.810
Debbie Barker: Who

269
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I think your was it your onto your sister.

270
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.040
Debbie Barker: She's doing better. She's doing better.

271
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: She hadn't pneumonia.

272
00:27:50.190 --> 00:28:04.740
Debbie Barker: Yeah, they're putting her into an assistant nursing home here my other and still in town and getting everything arranged and so on and packing her little apartment up. She's gotten to the point where

273
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.190
Debbie Barker: We don't think she can take care of herself.

274
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:18.810
Debbie Barker: To furnish to give her her medicine and within about 30 minutes will mark the thing she needs her medicine again.

275
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:28.140
Debbie Barker: And he's been living on on it and doing real good with my other ants help, you know, coming over and helping her and my sister's been

276
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:41.070
Debbie Barker: Cooking on Sundays, you know and and taking it over there. But I think it's just come to a point where Martha needs to go into an assisted living to make sure that she saved it sounds like she's

277
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.610
Debbie Barker: Going into dimension, like my grandmother did

278
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:56.910
Debbie Barker: My outcome would wake up and the reno grandma, you'd have to run out the door, you know, and go look for him, you know, things like that.

279
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's hard to watch that.

280
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:01.500
It's very

281
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:02.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

282
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.140
Debbie Barker: For a grandmother that raised nine kids.

283
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder what that's like to put all those years of putting memories together and then start losing them like you can't even go back like a photo album to your memories to visit them and enjoy them.

284
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.910
Debbie Barker: I'm going to imagine that's very difficult and very scary.

285
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.040
Debbie Barker: Yeah, being

286
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.380
Debbie Barker: Yourself, you know,

287
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:44.310
Debbie Barker: Very scary you if I fall or something happens, I've got a button to peruse took my phone. He ain't near but I can imagine.

288
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:50.550
Debbie Barker: It's hard to watch Martha go through that because she took so much time I'm on

289
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.230
Debbie Barker: Been like a second Montenegro, you know, all my life.

290
00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.620
Debbie Barker: She's a wonderful little moment, but she's a board don't make your mic.

291
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do something a little different. Today, um, I'd like to just check in a little bit. We've been doing some discussion about, you know, your daughter and a little bit of dipping into some some sentimental some emotional space around your on

292
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to check in on the other side of your brain, which is the right side of your brain. I want to kind of see how you are around some imagery, could we kind of do a little activity together.

293
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:41.400
Okay.

294
00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to give some instructions and there's no wrong way to do this. So all the examples of what other people do so that you can see there's no way to do it.

295
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to ask you to come up with three

296
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Three figures and they're going to be calling them your resource team their imaginary

297
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

298
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll give you some examples. So the three fingers that I'll be looking for. And I'm going to help kind of help you develop are a protective figure a nurturing figure and a wise figure

299
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:29.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And the way I instruct is it can be real or imagined, we can start with the first one. So try not to let censoring well

300
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's plenty

301
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:32.580
Know,

302
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: We just want some privacy.

303
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.790
Debbie Barker: Injuries, okay.

304
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

305
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:53.670
Debbie Barker: Grown or something on the phone. I just didn't like what I heard someone to look

306
00:31:54.330 --> 00:32:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: No worse. So the instruction is this, I'd like you to think of real or imagined.

307
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone something could be an animal could be something from TV a book or movie.

308
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That embodies

309
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective figure. In other words, they're like this ideal protective quality. What's the first thing that comes to mind.

310
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.800
Debbie Barker: Maggie, my dog.

311
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Me how beautiful that's a common one. People picking their dog, sure, sure, sure. I've also heard

312
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.610
Gwenevere Abriel: For from the movies, right. The Avengers.

313
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So Maggie and what kind of dog is she

314
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.120
Oh,

315
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of a

316
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.100
Debbie Barker: Key part

317
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.780
Debbie Barker: She just a mixture

318
00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.480
Debbie Barker: A little pit bull.

319
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and that's perfect. Let's go on to the other one which is a nurturing figure. So, nurturing, think of nurturing as having the quality of wanting for you, your full potential wanting for you, your full growth. It may or may not include affection.

320
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't have to just kind of be thinking real or imagined who embodies the quality of someone that would want for you.

321
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.220
Gwenevere Abriel: your full potential to be reached.

322
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.800
Debbie Barker: My boyfriend, Tony.

323
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Tommy.

324
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. And then a real or imagined a wise figure

325
00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.590
Debbie Barker: I would say my amp and I'm not so sure of that right now.

326
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:55.980
Debbie Barker: Talk to my elders.

327
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And when

328
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:07.290
Gwenevere Abriel: When you think about your on which artists. This is Martha.

329
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:07.980
Uh huh.

330
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So for Martha is the reason why you're second guessing your first response because she's starting to have some deteriorating memory. Okay. Well, you might still be able to use her and let me show you why.

331
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: This has to do with our imagination that this has to do it. There might be times when I'm going to want to interweave some imagery three figures.

332
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And as long as your experience of her is that she's wise and that she you know it doesn't have to match that she has this cognitive

333
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:51.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Challenge. Now if you remember her in this particular way, if that's how you picture her in your mind, then this

334
00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Might be Martha, but we can keep looking. See if there's anyone else that represents someone who's sort of really knows how to use stored in lots knowledge has common sense if

335
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: They say again.

336
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:15.150
Debbie Barker: Big my aunt fun

337
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Aren't there we go.

338
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:22.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can kind of describe her a little bit to me.

339
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:31.140
Debbie Barker: She's always worked in the medical field and always been in kind, loving person.

340
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.650
Debbie Barker: But again, she got right here and she's a board.

341
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you say a way. Does that mean she's got some aggression inner

342
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.970
Debbie Barker: Bo. Bo,

343
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.380
Okay.

344
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So that might not be quite there.

345
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.420
Debbie Barker: It's not a bad thing.

346
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:05.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so sometimes aggressions good if it's keeping what it's protecting say sometimes aggression is a good thing.

347
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:22.050
Gwenevere Abriel: It has a protective quality to it. So now what you've chosen for fern is a wise figure. So give me a story about why you kind of feel like when I think about for my own firm, I get this picture of wisdom.

348
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what the image you get kind of described that

349
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:34.110
Debbie Barker: She's always been a very hard working person and always been somebody I looked up to

350
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You ever asked her questions and she had sage advice.

351
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Good advice.

352
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:45.870
Debbie Barker: Good advice shall

353
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.380
Debbie Barker: I have older and to

354
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.270
Debbie Barker: My mom was one at a nine.

355
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But for and kind of stands out when I asked about a wise figure

356
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.860
Yo,

357
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So does this feel comfortable kind of weird and uncomfortable that we're doing some imagination, because it feels kind of strange or this is stuff you've done before.

358
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.250
Debbie Barker: Kind of strange.

359
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:24.120
Okay.

360
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought it might, for some people it feels a little odd.

361
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:36.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But I've written them down and I've got some notes. And so in a future if we decide to

362
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Access some positive imagery. I kind of know where to go. So this is pretty helpful.

363
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do. Let's do another one. What the heck, it's already strange might as well keep it going.

364
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

365
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's do this. Let's say you and I are doing some work together and you have a big emotion come up. Let's say it's a scary one or maybe a sad or afraid.

366
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might say to me, I don't want to deal with this right now. Or you might be thinking it. I don't really want to have some distance from

367
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't feel like feeling it right then we might use or I might bring us. Do you think of a distancing metaphor, but I want the metaphor.

368
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: To be yours uniquely yours. So I'm going to give you some examples of what other people have used as a distancing metaphor, so

369
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: On to just give you some examples. Now, so some people have used the idea of

370
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:49.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say I'm in emotional distress and I'm picturing being with my resource team. My protective quality nurturing wise and I'm on the riverbank

371
00:38:49.770 --> 00:39:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a river, and I can picture the river and I'm picturing a little leaf. That's sort of just sort of floating down and I've put in my imagination. I've put on that leaf my anger or whatever my frustration my sorrow or some memory and I'm watching it get further and further away.

372
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be a distancing metaphor. Another one I take whatever distress whenever, and I might picture, putting it inside of helium alone right and tying it up.

373
00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:23.760
Debbie Barker: Right.

374
00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.040
Debbie Barker: Now, yeah.

375
00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.060
Debbie Barker: Yes.

376
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The other might be, let's say I'm driving this way down the road heading to my destination and what comes whizzing past me is my negative thought of myself or negative memory goes through and passes right by it's going the opposite direction. And I look up in my rearview mirror

377
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And I continue the destination. I'm going. But I can see that negative stuff. It's getting further away, it's going in the opposite direction. That's another image or rocket ship takes off right away.

378
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: For some people it's slow. Yep. In the ocean and we're on the seaside and you're just watching it slowly.

379
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.050
Gwenevere Abriel: get further and further away.

380
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:25.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So for you. If I would have a distancing metaphor. If I was going to use this clinically sometime whenever don't know when. But just for me to have some notes to be of use at a later date. What, what would be one that you like.

381
00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:28.410
Debbie Barker: Mullen therapy.

382
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay and sounds like you've actually done that.

383
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So this isn't just a metaphor, you've actually put something in it and you let it go.

384
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it off.

385
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:54.750
Debbie Barker: I wonder if I could find that tape if Kathy would listen to that.

386
00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: What was the tape up

387
00:40:59.400 --> 00:40:59.970
I'm

388
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:13.650
Debbie Barker: A guy named Frank baranovsky and that was one exercise that he had done, he was a hypnotist and took me in my past. It was quite interesting. How would I know

389
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:19.080
Debbie Barker: How to load a bow balling captain, things like that, you know,

390
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:23.400
Debbie Barker: Never know loaded evolving camp.

391
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting.

392
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

393
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Which which brings us to this idea of that there are audio books out there if Kathy had an interest or if you wanted to continue sort of along your, your self growth and self discovery. There are some audio books to explore a lot of audiobooks.

394
00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It was this Frank baranovsky was he recommended by a therapist or you just happen to run across it.

395
00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:05.280
Debbie Barker: Why did I don't remember how I come across. I did been some years ago I paid for an hour session with them.

396
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:15.750
Debbie Barker: Back in my early 20s. Yeah, in quite some time.

397
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And he did regression therapy to past lives, um,

398
00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, wow, why don't share any

399
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What was described as as your past life.

400
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:38.040
Debbie Barker: Why don't remember what all I just remember the ball. And again, I didn't think about it until you said something about the bloom therapy.

401
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:45.000
Debbie Barker: Even have you walk down the sands of time and go up the hill.

402
00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:56.460
Debbie Barker: And then that he on the heel would be, you know, the bloom and you write on the bloom. What all hurt you. And that's the thing, and then let that one go. Yeah.

403
00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Does that seem like that was an effective technique.

404
00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:03.330
Yo,

405
00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so good. I learned something that some of this imagery has been helpful. It has been a useful thing for you. So that's good for me to know

406
00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:21.810
Debbie Barker: You know something when we're talking I'm Google Frank baranovsky

407
00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:22.680
Debbie Barker: I mean,

408
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.300
Debbie Barker: baranovsky I'm
