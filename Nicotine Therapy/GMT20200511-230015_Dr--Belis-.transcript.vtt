23
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:34.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: What's going on now and and then let's go back to childhood. Like, when did you first start any sort of substance alcohol, whatever.

24
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.150
Oh, sure.

25
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:48.120
Jack Porter: So right now, so the last, the last year, I've been using blow like more than normal or four months was kind of a more severe type of abuse.

26
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:58.620
Jack Porter: So I kind of built up slowly over that year. The last four months was like more like the significant time period. So that's like, why this mine is all messed up right now.

27
00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I see.

28
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:07.380
Jack Porter: Reading was I went to the I didn't really need to you, but I found one of these other emergency room to get checked out just to get it right away because

29
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: We bleeding like that like just trickling

30
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.100
Jack Porter: Yeah, pretty much. It's still drive right now but I went to the ear, nose and throat I saw your turn on Friday at the emergency room.

31
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:28.590
Jack Porter: Because they're saying you want to, you might want blood work too. And I got a lab test so blood, blood work, but I don't really know what they did on Friday.

32
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: You did they give you results they give you copies

33
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:44.160
Jack Porter: Yeah, I haven't looked at it. Honestly though, but I can send you whatever lab results they took that CT scan and a cobra test, which I'm negative, so that's

34
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.460
Jack Porter: The goal just suck.

35
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.710

Jack Porter: So this is all getting take care of. I'm not planning on Thursday.

37
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.570
Jack Porter: This is just looking

38
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: At this, it's all due to your over use of the

39
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.480
Jack Porter: You know, yeah, totally from damage from inhaling because it's all the way to do it.

40
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.370
Jack Porter: I know how to sew right. I don't really feel like learning

41
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let's try to find other ways.

42
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is good, but not for this.

43
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.130

45
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Now,

46
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know,

47
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.840
Jack Porter: Okay, yeah. Anyways,

48
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um, so the consequence of like the how. How long ago did you start noticing this trickling thing happening.

49
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.280
Jack Porter: Just started in February. So the last four months is the big time my

50
00:04:51.390 --> 00:05:07.860
Jack Porter: Christmas is like really stressed stressed out and then so it kind of like I've been slowly doing it like Little bit. Little bit. Little bit and then like that kind of accelerated it and then February my face started to swell and then

51
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.960
Jack Porter: Then the blood followed

52
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.850
Jack Porter: Using

53
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:23.640
Jack Porter: And so this has been swelling swelling for last four months or not even. What if I if I'm not using it might as well. Might as well.

54
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.960
Jack Porter: And having issues with the side of my face before to with my teeth so

55
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:39.360
Jack Porter: Not sure why it's so it was really slow on Friday. It's kind of like a lot of times, like when I sleep I sleep a certain way it'll just pool or something but

56
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.190
Jack Porter: I'll follow up on that side. Naturally, the way

57
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know your anatomy is maybe just tends to pull

58
00:05:49.170 --> 00:06:00.360
Jack Porter: The one I used out of always and then this one. That's not sure I've never really been able to breathe out of, like, I probably have I bet you have had a deviated septum. My whole life, the doctor looked at on Friday. So my septum look fine.

59
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.150
Jack Porter: The other big word was obliterated. They said the thing that filters here on the side.

60
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.570
Jack Porter: You probably know the name of it, but I have no idea.

61
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.940
Jack Porter: She said something I was

62
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.200
Terrible.

63
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.100
Jack Porter: Okay, so anyway, so that's this is all getting fixed

64
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:28.860
Dr. Belis Aladag: Fixed point yeah so swelling facial swelling on that right side, what's happening. And then, and then the blood came

66
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.150

73
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:06.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Good. Awesome. That you stopped. So, so tell me about the stopping and what happened was it on do you live with your family, your parents.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.740
Jack Porter: I live with my girlfriend.

75
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:21.510
Jack Porter: She found it got mad went down to her parents and slow. So I'd stopped. And then after she left. I was still at the apartment by myself. And so it was like

76
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.720
Jack Porter: They were aware of the problem.

77
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.770
Jack Porter: I started remember exactly how all this came about, but then

78
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.070
Jack Porter: I was going to stay at my friend's apartment. Every night. He's like a mile or two away.

79
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:42.060
Jack Porter: And so one night. It was the first night I stayed at my apartment is fine. The next night I was too tired to walk over there. So I texted

80
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:50.970
Jack Porter: My girlfriend's like I don't really feel like walking the two miles. So I'm assistant sleep here fell asleep and I woke up to my sister and my apartment waking me up.

81
00:07:51.690 --> 00:08:04.620
Jack Porter: Like freaking out because I guess I guess she hadn't told other people and then they woke up to a whole bunch of texts. So everyone was like waiting for me to text them those into asleep or something like that. So I was like, pretty shocking to me.

82
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: They were waiting for our news from you that you were okay and in bed or they were

83
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.790
Jack Porter: Yeah, I was gonna

84
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:22.170
Jack Porter: Go to sleep. I'm still a little confused about the whole thing, but it was like I was supposed to go to my friend Kevin's so I was with someone I said I wasn't gonna go. They said, that's fine. So I fell asleep.

85
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.450
Jack Porter: And it just was like poor communication amongst amongst my siblings and my girlfriend.

86
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:36.480
Jack Porter: And then my brother ended up going down and staying over and then I told him everything in the morning because now it's kind of like in this big pickle.

87
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.580
Jack Porter: No Way Out so

88
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.350

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:40.590
Jack Porter: Yeah.

90

122
00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.060
Jack Porter: It was more like a grumpy teenagers kind of syndrome, kind of thing.

123
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.010
Jack Porter: So I haven't had those thoughts, like, ever since, you know,

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.660
Jack Porter: But then I got get caught good ground for two weeks drinking and get grounded for two weeks after

217
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:34.500
Jack Porter: Freshman year I didn't really drink again till senior year of high school. Let's say intermittent drinking here there but like nothing nothing shocking or anything like that. You don't mean and just just beer.

218
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.770
Jack Porter: Okay wasn't thinking hard alcohol.

219
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.880
Jack Porter: Or blacking out

220
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it was at parties social events or were you doing it by yourself to

221
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:51.330
Jack Porter: Know, myself, who's always like you go everyone goes to the park and stand in a circle drinks, drinks a 40 ounce beer.

222
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.950
Jack Porter: And then I tried to try and get home, stay with the bus.

223
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Don't don't drive. That's good.

224
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.740
Jack Porter: Okay, before Uber.

225
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:11.490
Dr. Belis Aladag: Uber days right I'm speaking of driving. You've never had legal issues DUI or any issues like that. Right.

226
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.530
Jack Porter: Now, I'm not a real big drinker. Okay.

227
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:20.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, so let's move on. So then what happened when did you start using this this cocaine.

228
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.770
Jack Porter: So I use it. My first time freshman year of college in Vegas.

229
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:35.970
Jack Porter: I did it one night and I hated it but at the same time with the back of my mind. I was like, I want more was like very aware. I was like that's like last night's sucked.

230
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:47.610
Jack Porter: What happened was I did it I sobered up realized my date was just horrible. I got set up with her and then like just didn't have a good time. There was tonight. Right. So it's like why would I like those just stupid.

231
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.980
Jack Porter: Just showed me up. I didn't have any more fun like everyone was super hammered so

232
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: Anything you were drinking. But then when you took this, it kind of sobered

233
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.510
Jack Porter: Up and everyone else has to offer know loopy and now I was sitting there, just like

234
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.070
Jack Porter: Like what are you feeling

235
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:13.890
Jack Porter: Like, I don't want to know. So, but at the same time, I was like, oh, I want more, so I was like that's making sense. So then that was the last time I did it until senior of college, I would say.

236
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, you

237
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.210
Jack Porter: Didn't do it for four years after that.

238
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: Did you did you purposefully stay away, you think, or was it just

239
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.880
Jack Porter: Yeah, totally, because

240
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.320
Jack Porter: I always thought back and I was like it was just a bad experience and I gotta like get caught up in it.

241
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.520
Jack Porter: And then I would do it, then I started to do it every now and then.

242
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:40.710
Jack Porter: Senior. Yeah, I think it's fine, but like I never bought it is the thing I got only do it if someone else had never bought it.

243
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.580
Okay.

244
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:51.180
Jack Porter: But then it was like, kind of like my girlfriend and I she would be like no night. She's like, I want it. And one of them was like, Well, I want it to.

245
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.970
Jack Porter: So if they're buying it. So you have to

246
00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.110
Jack Porter: Try and find it late at night.

247
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:03.300
Jack Porter: But I never had probably college, I would say, like, it sounds like I'm doing a lot does didn't I couldn't afford it.

248
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.520
Jack Porter: Because I was in college, and there's nowhere to get it either down there. Yeah.

249
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.880
Jack Porter: I was I was cowboys, you know, Cisco. Okay, so it's very small, small town.

250
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.710
Jack Porter: I like I don't like going out either so

251
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:25.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so the girlfriend was there. That's the same girlfriend. You're with or a different one.

252
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.610
Jack Porter: Yeah, but she's not she was using like at all pretty much

253
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:30.720
Jack Porter: The same girlfriend.

254
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.830
Okay.

255
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.850
Jack Porter: It's kind of like a stage of life. We went through together, if that makes sense.

256
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.430
Dr. Belis Aladag: Together and it was occasional and

257
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.410
Jack Porter: Very occasional very like

258
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:48.810
Jack Porter: Afterwards, be like, Oh, it's you know need like wouldn't do it for another four or five months and then it would just be in front of us and not sure why not. You know, I mean,

259
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.610
Jack Porter: Like kind of pure, pure pressure, group, group settings. Okay.

260
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.810
Jack Porter: Typically when we would do it.

261
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then you and the girlfriend moved after you graduated

262
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.830
Jack Porter: Graduated came up here to

263
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:10.110
Jack Porter: To the city San Francisco and kind of the same thing, or like group settings.

264
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:21.690
Jack Porter: Very rare, though very rare, maybe once a month, once every two months. Once every four months, something like that. Those are the first year and then

265
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:31.320
Jack Porter: We live in my parents apartment or parents house. My girlfriend. I did for three months. And I was just horrible is very stressful for both of us. We were sleeping in different rooms.

266
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.360
Jack Porter: This is how my parents house is laid out. I slept on the air masters for three months.

267
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:44.370
Jack Porter: But all my stuff like right behind me on this, on the couch. Yeah, she's living out of like bags basically for three months.

268
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.240
And get

269
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:59.670
Jack Porter: Yeah, and then post my girlfriend's living with my parents. And so when we were apart, we can ever have any load time because we're very like very much like our alone time yeah and privacy and we you know we can't do anything.

270
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: With them for three months or so.

271
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:09.330
Jack Porter: Three months. Yeah. So yeah, about three months open air mattress. She slipped in this room that I'm in right now.

272
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.950
Jack Porter: And it was really, really hard. And then we finally got an apartment from so that we know studio apartment. We moved there.

273
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.950
Jack Porter: Close by to my parents to

274
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.790
OK.

275
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:32.100
Jack Porter: And then Mike, you are my commute was like killing me because I did go to go to San Leandro which is across the Bay Bridge and I was driving my car kept breaking down

276
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:39.300
Jack Porter: It's like an hour and a half, one way, so be three hours. So we're driving past my question. We can down or if I take the bus. It's

277
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.300
Jack Porter: Probably an hour and a half, one way, but come on a bus.

278
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.040
Jack Porter: No matter which way you cut it.

279
00:23:52.440 --> 00:24:04.200
Jack Porter: Say, I was just really hard and then plus I'm working out of the city and she's working in the city. So if she ever wanted to do something after where I can play. I can't. I gotta go home and wanted to go home and drop off my staff or you know whatever so

280
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.400
Jack Porter: It was very tough. It was very stressful. That was, like, kind of, when I started to use

281
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.280
Jack Porter: Just to kind of get through the society with the commute. Can I come home, just like exhausted.

282
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:28.530
Jack Porter: There's just like this pure exhaustion, that there's nothing you can do to fix it. Just because sit in the car for an hour and a half. And she's like, you know, one of the Hangout. I can't hang out. So

283
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.400
Jack Porter: It's like, oh my god, like I can only do this for so long.

284
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:39.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you would use like when would you use when you came home, or would use it in the mornings and what like what a

285
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.790
Jack Porter: Little bit of the mornings and I came home.

286
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:47.820
Jack Porter: Just to kind of pick myself up because just so tired all the time. But that was still read

287
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.480
Jack Porter: It and then

288
00:24:52.710 --> 00:25:00.420
Jack Porter: Right around Christmas right before Christmas, she started to look at apartments and they've got an apartment by the Ferry Building works where we live now.

289
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.380
Okay.

290
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:15.600
Jack Porter: So we moved and I would say right around that moving time is when it picked up to where it was getting at, and that's because Christmas is very stressful. It was like the peak of my commuting stress.

291
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:22.110
Jack Porter: Christmas time with my family's always very stressful because I like a lot of it gets put on me.

292
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:30.840
Jack Porter: With my commute and everything else and and plus. Now we're moving to on top of it all. You got the apartment. It was like, holy crap you know

293
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: Tell me about why is it put on you. Are you the you're the baby of the family.

294
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.520
Jack Porter: Yeah, but I'm also the

295
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.430
Jack Porter: Let's see my family's very traditional

296
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.550
Jack Porter: Like the men, does this or the man does this

297
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you're the guy. You're the man.

298
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:53.580
Jack Porter: I'm the dude I'm the only guy and I got two sisters and a mom. So it was always usually this. Yeah, I think the perfect example is

299
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.490
Jack Porter: We have to have salad dressing from some restaurant. My sister lives two blocks away. For me, it's a 40 minute drive one way. A 40 minute drive back to the way and I was wanting to get it.

300
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:03.840
Jack Porter: When you feel

301
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:11.700
Jack Porter: It's just like little stuff like that. Well, my, my girlfriend's in there to, like, oh my god, it's just like most ridiculous thing every

302
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Day on related. So have you ever said anything like Hey, oh yeah.

303
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.810
Jack Porter: Maybe you use it all the time and

304
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.900
Jack Porter: It's just to the fights. I just learned to accept it and

305
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.750
Jack Porter: I'll never went because I got both my sisters and my mom against me.

306
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:26.880
Jack Porter: Always

307
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: You

308
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.100
Know,

309
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:39.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh wow, okay. I see what you mean. So you had that, you know, like a holiday preparation whatever moving and

310
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:53.160
Jack Porter: Moving or girlfriend's parents came up and we're staying with us. And where's the studio single room one bed and accounts that are touching each other and the bathroom that you can see from the same room we got four people now on there.

311
00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:01.230
Jack Porter: So I gotta deal with them. They want me to do one thing, my parents wanted me to pick a salad dressing, an hour and a half way with no car.

312
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.350
Jack Porter: Stressful.

313
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: I can understand that.

314
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: You felt

315
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:28.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Would you say it's accurate to say you felt kind of stretched thin and you were using partially because I mean yeah you enjoyed it. There's that addictive like this makes me feel good, but also, did you feel like you needed that you felt you needed it to like get you going or

316
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.420
Jack Porter: Yeah, I said I needed to bounce back

317
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:37.200
Jack Porter: Because that's the work like this, how I would describe it. So I always feel like I'm getting stretched in all different directions.

318
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:45.330
Jack Porter: It sounds like my family wants to do one thing, my friends want me to another thing. It's like, for some reason, every, every time. Everything lands on the same day.

319
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:51.210
Jack Porter: My birthday, my girlfriend's marathon just got pushed to my birthday.

320
00:27:54.750 --> 00:28:01.590
Jack Porter: Versus on that day or I think we were going to go to Toronto and and it was like for people's birthdays that day and then

321
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:10.950
Jack Porter: So like it's just everything always lands on the same day. And it's always three events that I get to choose which one to go to, I don't know. You know, that's how I've always been

322
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:12.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Kind of

323
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.220
Jack Porter: Got a big family lots of friends. So it's lots lots going on.

324
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Which is a blessing, but it can also be, you know, stressful. I can see that. Yeah.

325
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:24.090
Yeah.

326
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.550
Dr. Belis Aladag: Good to have friends and family. But that's a lot to like balance.

327
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:37.530
Jack Porter: Yeah, balancing. It's hard because I want to let somebody down and I never know who make the choice of which one I'm not let down essentially

328
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.960
Jack Porter: But where was I going with this.

329
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're feeling like, go, go, go. I'm going to end. You just kept using

330
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:56.910
Jack Porter: Just mostly just honestly just, I was just like, fuck it. You know, I mean, there's, I didn't really see the benefit will stay early

331
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.360
Jack Porter: But I was just like, whatever, something to do

332
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:07.890
Jack Porter: I say why not keep doing it. There's no like logic or, you know, this is this one really make me feel good, you know,

333
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: I see you just kept it was on automatic pilot kind of things.

334
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:18.150
Jack Porter: Yeah, just why not. I was like, maybe as well, maybe this will help, but he was just like, I don't even know I'm doing it.

335
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, and then were you

336
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Have you need for months, especially the last month, I guess, were you using daily

337
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.750
Jack Porter: Yeah, I'd say all four months to do the daily

338
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:38.130
Jack Porter: But there'll be days ago, or even a week or two. I'd go without it, and it'd be pretty easy for me just to totally stop.

339
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: Really, okay.

340
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.320
Jack Porter: Yeah.

341
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:49.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: So you do feel pretty confident now like that you're going to carry. Like, how do you feel about sobriety. First of all,

342
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.230
Jack Porter: That's a pretty good. I feel pretty good because

343
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.130
Jack Porter: I just think back to my freshman year in college when I first did it.

344
00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:01.830
Jack Porter: And I was able to stop for you or not do it for 44 years and say no straight up to

345
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.890
Jack Porter: The answer to get back in that mindset.

346
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:11.820
Jack Porter: Of it's like why, you know, I mean, where's the benefit and they know I can see all this shit I fucked up.

347
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, the physical stuff on your

348
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.820
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes. Yeah, that's not cool.

349
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.000
Jack Porter: What's the great benefit of it. I would feel weird for 20 minutes, whatever.

350
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.830
Jack Porter: Yeah day so you know some Dad's gonna happen. Yeah.

351
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:32.340
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah because okay today. It's your nose in your face, but like tomorrow. It could be your heart, you know,

352
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.930
Jack Porter: You can

353
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:49.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: Have a stroke, you know, God forbid, things happen even if, you know, and the thing with cocaine that come like like let's say alcohol. Alcohol usually cumulative. It depends on the amount, people can really dive poisoning.

354
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:58.500
Dr. Belis Aladag: But yeah, most of the time it's a cumulative toxic effect with cocaine, though, it's like it's a cute like it could hit you right then and just

355
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, and we don't want that that's just, that's terrible. Yep.

356
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:13.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, okay, good. So I'm glad like somehow it all this stuff led to you, snapping out of it and being like, wait a minute. Yeah. What am I doing

357
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:24.630
Jack Porter: Yeah, that's all I need. I just need to take a second to start like there is what time when I always told my buddy about it. Just, just because I you know I didn't want it to get out of it. I kind of felt like it could do anything about it.

358
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.590
Jack Porter: I think I always knew I needed something else to push me. Yeah, but I never had the balls to do it.

359
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:45.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gotcha. And your girlfriend, she know she kind of occasions with us back in the days and stuff. This this last four month thing she didn't really know about or you kind of hit it.

360
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.460
Jack Porter: Off I did all of yourself.

361
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.050
Jack Porter: Secretly

362
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:54.540
Dr. Belis Aladag: Which is also different. Right. So that tells you also the time problematic.

363
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:58.860
Jack Porter: You're like, yeah, that's, that's why I wanted to tell my buddy was like she was sleeping there, and I was still awake like

364
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:03.240
Jack Porter: In pain and like, see what are you doing man like I don't you know

365
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:13.140
Jack Porter: Why am I get a waste with, you know, my girlfriend. I have over what, you know, just something that's going to make my face, or even more. Yeah, exactly.

366
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:22.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Okay, well I'm glad I mean I'm glad for you that things came out at this point, instead of later or whatever when things got worse.

367
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.410
Yep.

368
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:34.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: And it's good. You went to the ER. Yeah, it's not fun. You had to wait all that time, but at least you got the EMT appointment and in this whole world. It's really difficult to get appointments and things

369
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.690
Jack Porter: But yeah

370
00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: So that you

371
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:45.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Get the healing whatever they're going to help you with, you know, make sure you're talking about the swelling because EMT, they know

372
00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:50.700
Jack Porter: She saw she saw it's going to take a picture of that because he was swallowed up on Friday. I like that.

373
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.800
Okay.

374
00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.100
Jack Porter: Yeah, so they decided, okay,

375
00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:11.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm okay so that's, I see. Um, so now. So it sounds like you were hoping and kind of trying to maybe do something about it. And then it just kind of happened, and now it's all out there.

376
00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:20.970
Dr. Belis Aladag: How do you feel now, do you feel like, okay, good. And you feel motivated to stay sober and stay away from this stuff, or how do you feel

377
00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:31.440
Jack Porter: Yeah, I just want to change a lot about me life. I haven't really had a routine. I think it's the biggest thing is I haven't had a routine obviously having an email to try to have a routine last week.

378
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:33.840
Jack Porter: It's been all over the place.

379
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:35.940
Jack Porter: But

380
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let's give you some wiggle room in the last week or so.

381
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: I mean it's not your fault, you have another team, but

382
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.060
Jack Porter: Yeah, that's the one I don't want to, you know, start working out and you start

383
00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:49.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes.

384
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.620
Jack Porter: I think the big, the big thing with me is like my commute. I never could have a routine because I'd get home at

385
00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:00.870
Jack Porter: Seven. Gotta go sleep. I gotta wake up at six or if I'm going to work out. You like about five

386
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:11.970
Jack Porter: Which means, are you asleep right away. I can't go from wants to talk to me. She wants to stay up cuz she's you know how to be essentially an easier day travel why it's not necessary work wise.

387
00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:14.790
Jack Porter: But

388
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:21.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: So now that you're from home. What happens to be able to switch things around or change your job or what happened.

389
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:24.810
Jack Porter: Well, no, because I was doing which blows. I could have Richie

390
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.060
Jack Porter: I was always awake.

391
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:35.760
Jack Porter: That's the thing. Like I you know I should use this time to get a good routine my work stress is definitely way down, but I think

392
00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.820
Jack Porter: I just did not. I should have stopped by it stopped, everything will be hunky dory. And I probably be

393
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:50.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so, because they have you working from home. You want yes Affleck thing because okay okay so this is

394
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Temporary. I mean, until we know when the coven thing is over.

395
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.770
Jack Porter: So is there anything to us. I'm planning on quitting my job and applying to other places in the city.

396
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:09.270
Jack Porter: And then I gotta leave into why because July will be my two year anniversary. I'll get a credentials, be a professional engineer and then also be

397
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.090
Jack Porter: Money wise, it makes a lot more sense. I'll be

398
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:21.630
Jack Porter: 50% vested that was always the plan. And I've been applying to jobs and stuff like that. The coded hits and it's like okay well I'm not going to get a job anywhere anymore.

399
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:29.400
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, right now, but I can, I can still jump ship to a different locations near firm pretty easily. Honestly,

400
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.160
Jack Porter: The only issue is, most of them are in Oakland and

401
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.700
Jack Porter: You stay where I don't want or don't go

402
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: You don't want to

403
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.190
Jack Porter: I need to work somewhere in the city.

404
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, I think that's been clear like you need that.

405
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.390
Dr. Belis Aladag: For balance in your life, you need to be close to where you work.

406
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:52.680
Jack Porter: Yeah, it's like it's just no life to have to commute like that. So yeah, you can have a life. You can't do anything.

407
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, and it's not it's not healthy for you.

408
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:56.400
Jack Porter: Know,

409
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:06.990
Dr. Belis Aladag: Hey that's viable. So I, yeah, I definitely agree with that, in terms of timing, though, like the the fortunate thing is because of the circumstances, you get to be at home.

410
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:21.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: So, so, like you said, Now that you have the. You don't have to deal with traffic you should though start now creating a schedule where you're waking up at the same time, approximately sleeping at the same time.

411
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:40.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: Feeling like a sense of accomplishment, because you get your workout like half hour, two hours, whatever workout, you do you, do you know and you okay check, you know, did that for the day, or whatever, you know, you maybe start with the day with something maybe the exercise, maybe

412
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:47.430
Jack Porter: Yeah, that's what I wanted just like it's just been hard obviously like Friday of every eight hours. And I'm just like, trying to catch up on sleep or then

413
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:55.500
Jack Porter: Pretty sure when pain pills making me feel tired because, you know, I mean, so I've been trying to get in there. A team has just been hard mainly with my since

414
00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.270
Jack Porter: I already get that back. And then I think a lot of things will fall from there.

415
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:06.780
Dr. Belis Aladag: And your body is adjusting to, like, Okay, well, now we're not, you know, constantly being

416
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.000
Jack Porter: Yeah. Usually I wake up a lot more right

417
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:09.630
Around now.

418
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:22.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it's an adjustment. You got to give it time. Okay. Um, what else do I need to ask, Oh surgeries. Have you had any surgeries.

419
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.520
Jack Porter: No.

420
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: Have you had any allergies to medications.

421
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.400
Jack Porter: No. Okay.

422
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:35.370
Dr. Belis Aladag: Are you on any meds are you taking any Well besides the antibiotic Roxanne and things they gave you

423
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.430
Jack Porter: That's, that's it. Okay. Okay.

424
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.270
Dr. Belis Aladag: And

425
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.460
Jack Porter: I do take, I take, I'll take edibles every now and then.

426
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.820
Jack Porter: Every now and then to help you sleep, sleep.

427
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.080
Jack Porter: Yeah, but that's

428
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:46.710
Jack Porter: That's it.

429
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you

430
00:37:51.810 --> 00:38:02.880
Dr. Belis Aladag: The eighth grade thing was happening, and you did the Brief Therapy. Do you think you have any depression or have you ever been diagnosed with depression or any other mental illness.

431
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:12.870
Jack Porter: No other therapists are trying to say I like a mood disorder. I think he was I just never talked in those therapist sessions. I think he was just trying to say a diagnosis or something.

432
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:21.690
Jack Porter: I don't know. I don't think I honestly have ones. But no, I mean, other like just dealing with this situation I'm in right now, not being super pumped about it.

433
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:27.690
Jack Porter: I don't have like chronic depression. I wouldn't say it's more just a product of my environment.

434
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:28.470
Right.

435
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.240
Dr. Belis Aladag: Situation.

436
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:37.590
Jack Porter: Yeah, like being exhausted, or you know things not going super well but not like a bottomless pit.

437
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.600
Jack Porter: Kind of feeling

438
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay. Yeah, that's good.

439
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.930
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so

440
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:59.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: So okay, so I think I have a good idea of what's going on. I think I asked everything I need to ask from you. Is there anything we didn't touch upon that we should

441
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.350
Jack Porter: No, I think my only question is, are going to be group from here on out. Correct.

442
00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:08.790
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes.

443
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:20.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cool. Okay. Um, if, if, if you have a situation or whatever. And you're like, you know, I really would prefer an individual session to discuss in more depth with you.

444
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:34.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Rather than in the group. You can always ask for individual you know schedule that but but i think i think it'll be good because ok so the other portion. So I forgot to mention the other thing is that you are assigned a therapist.

445
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: In our program, so you

446
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.510
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's a man. It's kind of mandatory that you do a one time.

447
00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:50.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: It's called bio psychosocial like a brief introductory kind of thing assessment.

448
00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:51.330
Jack Porter: Okay.

449
00:39:51.690 --> 00:40:06.000
Dr. Belis Aladag: With the therapist and then once that's done in that visit you in and that person will decide, okay, do we want to do therapy and how frequently do we want to do it. It could be weekly. It could be monthly, you know, it just varies

450
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:24.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Gotcha. And so I think that for you for your particular situation. I think that actually would be really good to have like it's almost like having your own personal coach like personal time with the with the therapist to do individual therapy and then you'll do like group with me and

451
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.690
Jack Porter: Yeah.

452
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:25.590
You know,

453
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: In the group. I have another therapist helping me run the group so

454
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:41.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay that's there too. Okay. And it's a mixed group. So like, not everybody has the same problem. I have a lot of people opioid addiction problem.

455
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.450
Jack Porter: Oh, I bet.

456
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:54.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah. So, but, you know, everybody has things in common they can relate to, like, oh yeah, you know, I felt like things were out of control or, you know, I just felt compelled or whatever it is. And we can

457
00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.050
Jack Porter: Read

458
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.290
Dr. Belis Aladag: So it'll be cool. I think it'll be good. You can

459
00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:06.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Join us. So in terms of priming. There's a okay there's a

460
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: Friday or Thursday.

461
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:09.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or PM.

462
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.250
Jack Porter: Let's do

463
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:13.950
Jack Porter: Some tough ones.

464
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.640
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or there's Monday mornings.

465
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:21.240
Jack Porter: And was supposed to be recurring so let's do a

466
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.790
Jack Porter: Thursday at four.

467
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:25.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, that's a good group.

468
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

469
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.190
Jack Porter: Groups stink.

470
00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:36.750
Dr. Belis Aladag: Don't tell me

471
00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:40.590
Don't tell them

472
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:52.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: As its own personality. You know, like there's, you know, the crowd is different and whatever the Monday. For example, the Monday morning. One is all guys and

473
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.650
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, it has its own kind of feel to it.

474
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: Feel and it's cool. It's like a

475
00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: Brotherhood type

476
00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:09.360
Dr. Belis Aladag: But the Thursday group is a nice one males and females. And I think majority are young, like your age range.

477
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:16.770
Dr. Belis Aladag: So yeah, I think it'll be probably a good you'd like crowd. Yeah, okay.

478
00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:24.480
Dr. Belis Aladag: Cool. Okay, so we'll see you. So what you do is you log into the virtual clinic that you just did today. Yeah.

479
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.070
Jack Porter: And they'll give me your code or whatever.

480
00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:33.450
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, exactly. You say, hey, go in at like 330. That's my advice because it gets booked up. You know, so just going through

481
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.640
Jack Porter: So I can go to any group technically

482
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:42.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: No, no, what I mean is you know that that zoom numbers for the virtual clinic.

483
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:48.240
Jack Porter: Yes. Yeah. So I go in and I I tell them I want to go the four o'clock at 330

484
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.250
Jack Porter: When would you say gets booked out

485
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:54.210
Dr. Belis Aladag: Meaning the virtual clinic gets full

486
00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:57.210
Jack Porter: Oh, sorry, the waiting room for like 45 minutes

487
00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.660
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, it's like it's like the front desk right so like you're at the

488
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.610
Jack Porter: Hotel. You're saying no.

489
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:11.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Oh, like three or 330 it's better because even if you have to wait. You'll still make it to four o'clock and not miss the group.

490
00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.670
Jack Porter: Yeah, just throw your phone off to the side for the blog or whatever.

491
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:15.750
Exactly.

492
00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:17.700
Dr. Belis Aladag: Um,

493
00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:24.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: When you check in, they're going to ask you to do a survey about, you know, your addiction, like where

494
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:35.670
Dr. Belis Aladag: You're at how are you feeling today. Are you having cravings, whatever. All those things are in the survey and that takes some time like 510 minutes. So that's why it's also good to do it early and I can early so that by four, you're ready to go.

495
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.320
Jack Porter: Gotcha. OK.

496
00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.100
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK, so I'll see you Thursday at

497
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.660
4pm

498
00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: Until then,

499
00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:51.570
Dr. Belis Aladag: Do call the virtual clinic and say, hey, I need to make my therapy appointment my

500
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:52.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: One on one therapy appointment.

501
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.360
Jack Porter: Okay, I'll share after this

502
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:55.590
Dr. Belis Aladag: Don't

503
00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.060
Jack Porter: Forget and schedule.

504
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.010
Dr. Belis Aladag: That you have it in the book because it's like

505
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: Kind of part of the processing.

506
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.140
Jack Porter: So it would be able to do the Thursday meeting without that kind of thing.

507
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:05.730
Dr. Belis Aladag: Well,

508
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.680
Jack Porter: I mean, I made me do it.

509
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:08.160
Dr. Belis Aladag: I just

510
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.850
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm gonna I'm gonna encourage

511
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.810
Dr. Belis Aladag: You I'll keep badgering you so might as well just do it.

512
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.700
Jack Porter: Oh, zero right now. See if I get tomorrow.

513
00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:35.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: OK. OK. So I'll see you Thursday. I think I'm glad that you know you're on this side of the fence. Now, and that you have some thoughts about what you need to do to be well. One is getting some routine down in this new phase.

514
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Not having to commute and to trying to figure out how to not get back to community.

515
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.630
Dr. Belis Aladag: So those

516
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Two things that

517
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.660
Jack Porter: Just let me work from home.

518
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:55.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, so those two are essential for your health. Right now, so

519
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.130
Jack Porter: I'll say it.

520
00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.500
Jack Porter: Requires factors.

521
00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.370

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:02.700
Jack Porter: Copa

523
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:08.040

532
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.070
Dr. Belis Aladag: Same shot or something.

Jack Porter: I just get it done.

537
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.690
Dr. Belis Aladag: Is there a slab near you.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.460
Jack Porter: I think it's at the same place going on Thursday. Oh.

539
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.030
Jack Porter: Sure. Oh, that's why I've heard questions for it because I got it before.

540
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, perfect. Yeah. And yeah, I mean,

541
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:41.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, send me your results. And if I can sort through I will if not just go to question you tell them on a bright heart health patient and they have a standing order that they order for every patient

542
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.180
Jack Porter: Oh, cool.

543
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:43.050
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you do

544
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: The blood and you do the urine. There's a urine test so

545
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: You should just go and do it. I mean, I don't know.

546
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.410
Jack Porter: Yeah, I think it's right next door to the hospital. So

547
00:46:53.370 --> 00:47:01.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: You could just do it all. I mean, there's probably going to be some repeats, but there's probably stuff in there that they didn't do like there's STD screening HIV see

548
