All right.

11
00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I just turn the volume down a little bit. Well, you kind of settle in. It's okay. Take your time. It's worth it. All right.

12
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.470
Alrighty.

Bianca Garcia: Good.

15
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.390
Bianca Garcia: We usually use this thing to hold my phone up

16
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's check on audio and video, make sure we have good sound today.

17
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.820
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

18
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah. You sound great.

19
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, nice and I sound good. You can see and hear me pretty good.

20
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, excellent.

21
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.510
Bianca Garcia: Gaming here.

22
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.640
Bianca Garcia: Can you see me good or

23
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean,

24
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:47.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, yes, I wish I could see you more. I wish it was brighter, but I love how solid maybe if you can turn the camera just down slightly. So you see less of the ceiling and more of your body.

25
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Since I mentioned

26
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.000
Bianca Garcia: Okay, let's

27
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Start at the top of my head.

28
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.050
Gwenevere Abriel: image that we want to also having coming from your side because more about other messages that come from here, like my hand.

29
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.310
Bianca Garcia: Sorry, I

30
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.500
Bianca Garcia: Usually I'm in the living room now but they're up. So this is like

31
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.360
Bianca Garcia: How was that

32
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And cast it. Okay. All right. So now we can kind of set intention kind of turn all that hectic finding a place and taking care of the baby and making sure hey I need this time to sort of do this work with this appointment so you made that happen. You did a great job.

33
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And remember the last time I'm looking at the note here and it's in front of me, and there was

34
00:05:47.460 --> 00:06:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Some discussion around authority figures and the stress or, you know, certain way of being around people, and I had wondered if you spent more time thinking about it or if anything more was needed or wanted to be talked to on the topic.

35
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.480
Bianca Garcia: Um,

36
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:17.880
Bianca Garcia: I did think about it. And I said, maybe I'm overthinking it but i don't i don't know a few a few I'd like to talk about it. No, no. I think we've got it cleared.

37
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:37.110
Bianca Garcia: up pretty well. I mean, but I didn't think about it afterwards. And I thought to myself, oh, maybe I was overthinking it or, you know, but that's just something I hate about myself, is the whole worry Nance and overthinking that's just that happens a lot.

38
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'd like to understand that more

39
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.220
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

40
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.180
Bianca Garcia: Let me close

41
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.740
Bianca Garcia: My door really quick.

42
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I can hear somebody you're shouting

43
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.770
Bianca Garcia: Okay, I told to be quiet, but they never listened

44
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to create a goal, and then we'll look you know all create something that maybe will help you reach that goal.

45
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:16.050
Gwenevere Abriel: There might be behaviors. It might be trying on some behavioral experiments might be learning new skills, things like that. So, in a word in your own terminology. What would you like to do. What's the goal.

46
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.510
Bianca Garcia: I'm with the individual therapy.

47
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Just said it earlier, you just labeled a topic.

48
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.220
Bianca Garcia: Oh yeah, okay.

49
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:27.630
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, though.

50
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.530
Bianca Garcia: The overthinking it. I'm always like over worrying about things.

51
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So, put it in a full goals full statement you ready

52
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, to love that.

53
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:54.390
Bianca Garcia: Well, I would like to help myself. I guess I'm just have them in control or or manage them better.

54
00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, but again. Okay, let me, let me say what I'm doing. You're doing a beautiful job. It's just that I happened to be typing exactly what you're saying. And so it's going to be in quotes, and it's going to be your goal. So let's maybe

55
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Just sort of this is what I have so far, I would like to now. Typically, this is a neat way to to find out what the verb is I would like to increase something or decrease something

56
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it you could say that goal, I would like to this or I would like to that. What is it, what is it, you'd like to increase or decrease

57
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.280
Bianca Garcia: I would like to decrease overthinking

58
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.580
Bianca Garcia: I would like to decrease

59
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.850
Bianca Garcia: I just, I guess, is it

60
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it isn't, it isn't that really what we're up to. That's what you want, I want to decrease it.

61
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess as much anxiety. Now how that's up to the therapeutic intervention. That's the stuff. We'll get into now that's beautiful. I love that. Cool. Nice and precise right

62
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So now I'm going to go over to objective and this is the stuff that we can kind of measure over the coming 30 days we can play with something that

63
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: We can look at and see if it works over these next 30 days, sometimes it takes longer, sometimes years. I don't know. But let's go find out.

64
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: One thing that I had taught you, is the belly breathing.

65
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Have there been times when you have been in a thought, you know, a thought loop right

66
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this is the worst thing that happened. Well, not only would that be awful but less than anything was close to that it was. It really was awful. I couldn't handle it. And then we didn't have running water, and then

67
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know where it goes right but it can really circle around in there. You can really get get stuck in that neural network and

68
00:09:49.410 --> 00:10:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: When it comes to this bottom up intervention that I taught you about the breathing. The fact that that expanding breath belly can signal the Vegas got a little guy coming in.

69
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.090
Bianca Garcia: But

70
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's worth talking with them. You can you can say, hey, look, they're gonna keep coming in, unless I go give them something to do, to play, you can always tell me that

71
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.500
Bianca Garcia: Okay, thank you. Well, I just give her the little signal mall and she's like,

72
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't

73
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.220
Bianca Garcia: Be nosy

74
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: This is the long version of

75
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you remember

76
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: To do the belly breathing when you are in your ruminating

77
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.680
Bianca Garcia: Yes.

78
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how many times a day would you estimate

79
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:46.440
Bianca Garcia: I know it's probably like like once a week or twice a week. Not daily

80
00:10:47.700 --> 00:11:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: That's beautiful. That's nice. We can say it's at once a week and how often do you find yourself in. So such anxiety and overthinking overthinking about how often is that coming at you.

81
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.210
Bianca Garcia: Oh daily

82
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.160
Bianca Garcia: Probably like a few times a day is and

83
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Any pattern. Is there any way. If we were to rewind when it comes about. Do you ever notice that it's first thing. And as you wake up or when someone walks into the room, or someone leaves the room or you read something. Here's something. Do you ever catch any patterns.

84
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:42.840
Bianca Garcia: I know I'm not really good at keeping track. No, but I just noticed that it is like reading or informing myself of whatever you know if that's like seeing it on the internet or reading or

85
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:50.940
Bianca Garcia: Hearing somebody or, you know, of all the problems going on right now. It just seems like it's been constant now.

86
00:11:51.660 --> 00:12:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah. So now you've got really something to sink your teeth into right with with this, you could really get yourself worried about what's going to happen with the coven

87
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.690
Gwenevere Abriel: With the corona. Okay. Okay.

88
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.050
Yeah.

89
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And so when you see something on the news when you see something on social media. When you hear someone talking about it.

90
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a few times a day. And then how many minutes do you spend what you call over thinking about how many minutes do you spend doing it.

91
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:34.500
Bianca Garcia: Oh. Oh, probably depends on on like, what's it like this Corona thing. Yeah, it's been daily and it's like hours a day. Like, I'm just, yeah.

92
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.050
Bianca Garcia: I'm really concerned about it.

93
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:48.360
Bianca Garcia: It's only because I have four little kids that I want to do everything I can to protect them protect us from a, you know, I, it's very scary.

94
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.250
Gwenevere Abriel: It is, I got you.

95
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:51.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

96
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You're giving me really good information very useful so we can kind of do some detective work and see where we can

97
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Kind of, take a look at the chain of events that happened link after link and then with each link, we can say, well, maybe in there, there's something we could do before this other thing happens. So maybe we can look at those. So I am hearing that

98
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Just move this part down to the bottom here. Okay.

99
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do

100
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:34.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's come in. I have to check on one thing, because you and I already have had a conversation about there is a possibility.

101
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Of something happening between you and I, meaning

102
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I'm supposed to say a particular thing to blend, you know, maybe there's a right way to do this. Maybe there's a wrong way. I'm always wondering if people are trying to say something when they think I want to hear it or if they're just saying it wrong. I always want it all.

103
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.120
Bianca Garcia: Okay.

104
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:07.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's my professor. Now I'm going to ask my question. Why do you think you're not remembering the breathing.

105
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.310
Bianca Garcia: Oh,

106
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Your first response.

107
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:22.920
Bianca Garcia: Why I'm not remembering the breathing. Maybe it just blows over my head. And I'm just thinking I could

108
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:30.060
Bianca Garcia: Do something else or just be like, oh, just try blow it off whatever I'm worried about, I don't know. I really don't know. I just

109
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:40.740
Bianca Garcia: But I do, I do, calm about it and use it when when I think about it, but there is times where you just blow it over and those probably the times you need it the most.

110
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Okay, so here's what I heard. I just do a different technique you. It sounds like you're when you say blow over.

111
00:14:54.870 --> 00:15:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's another solution so belly breathing is a solution substance use is a solution sleeping raging breaking something running exercising eating any number of things are perceived solution to a distress.

112
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So I want to know more about blow over. I want to understand that a little bit more so if mitts happening to me. And I'm like, Oh, I just walked past the the TV.

113
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: How many people have died and I start then I go, what if it happens to my family. And then I keep feeding that thought and I keep playing it out. Oh, I would feel so awful.

114
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: awful, awful, awful, awful thoughts and now I'm just sort of stuck in this right. Tell me what blow over is I, I will try it will blow, blow over is

115
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.290
Gwenevere Abriel: What off. What does that mean,

116
00:15:45.600 --> 00:16:02.100
Bianca Garcia: Well, it just means that I don't think about it and I do, I probably just continue thinking or I do something else. I go smoke a cigarette or, you know, or something. I think that might work.

117
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.930
Bianca Garcia: Then that yeah

118
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me know when you're

119
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Not distracted, you're, you're good. We're together here.

120
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes. So here's what I heard.

121
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Distraction

122
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.260
Bianca Garcia: Right. Go.

123
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And

124
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk to them. Oh.

125
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:35.550
Bianca Garcia: Yeah. Well, he, he took off. It took the swing and didn't close my door. Knowing these kids are loud. Okay.

126
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.530
Bianca Garcia: I don't like to be distracted. It's not good for me.

127
00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.150
Bianca Garcia: Okay, so sorry proceed.

128
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: What you do when you notice that the negative thinking has really taken the whole is you try smoking, you try a distraction.

129
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:06.990
Gwenevere Abriel: You do your best not to think about it, but I want to hear the things that you're doing are smoking and what else

130
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:13.320
Bianca Garcia: Oh, just whatever cleaning or cook.

131
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.810
Bianca Garcia: You know, take care of the kids.

132
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:29.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how long can you keep that negative thinking that overthinking at bay. How long can you keep it at bay with staying busy with cleaning or cooking. How long can you keep it out of your head.

133
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.800
Bianca Garcia: Probably a few hours.

134
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a pretty good technique.

135
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

136
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.960
Bianca Garcia: I'm gonna say, so I guess so.

137
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.570
Bianca Garcia: I never thought about it like that. I don't think about stuff like that. So I'm glad I could

138
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:49.770
Bianca Garcia: Help

139
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. Think about this. Just imagine you are about to quit smoking or, well, we'll just stick with smoking. Let's say you're like, I've had it with a cigarette and I'm coming at heart. And here we go.

140
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: If you could distract yourself from that cigarette for a couple hours. How many few cigarettes. Would you smoke a day.

141
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a huge progress.

142
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.740
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

143
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're already in really good solutions you just naturally already knew distraction. I'll just get busy cleaning. Some people can take it too far.

144
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:35.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And now they become angry, upset when they can't clean angry, upset if it doesn't stay clean and so it can be overboard. We can overdo anything. Right.

145
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's how long is it working. Is it working anymore, do we add need to add more more skills to it. Okay, so, um, do you think in general. Oh, I know. I found a good way to come with this wonder how you remember to clean.

146
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.050
Bianca Garcia: How do I remembered clean. I just look at the mess.

147
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay.

148
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, so, so here you are right now, let's say,

149
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm laying in bed and my mind is starting to go

150
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.990
Gwenevere Abriel: How am I going to see the mess. I mean, does it ever start first thing in the morning or no.

151
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.250
Bianca Garcia: Never start that

152
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It does like

153
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:32.520
Bianca Garcia: The overthinking. Oh, it could be anytime of the day. Yeah. In sometimes they would be like waking up or like I say, it varies on on what's going on. But yeah, definitely.

154
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:48.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So looking, you've got to see something to clean and then you do what, how do you then get to cleaning mode because plenty of people see the mess and they go, a really different direction.

155
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:54.630
Bianca Garcia: Yeah yeah yeah that's that happens to I'm not gonna deny that.

156
00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:07.350
Bianca Garcia: But no, I think when I just when I feel like I'm overstressed I'm like okay let's and then it will just start with the little thing like oh let me slip this up.

157
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.570
Bianca Garcia: And then we'll proceed from there like increase, like, oh, now I'm mopping and now I'm

158
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:25.680
Bianca Garcia: You know, making sure it's nice and perfect and once I get the whole house clean and I see like little speck on the forum like picking him up and I don't know. Just, just like that. Like, this is what I do.

159
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take what you're already doing. And let's capitalize on that. Let's do you already have a thing that already works. And that is, you can rely on the fact that once you start a little step.

160
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: I can you know what i'm just all I'm going to do is just go around the room.

161
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:58.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, now that I've cleaned it. Oh, I see some money spots. And now I'm going to get them off and it will continue to move forward. So you can rely on that. That is a style you have that's a

162
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Skill you have that if you start something you it might continue to be used. So that's good. And it can last a couple hours. That's kind of neat.

163
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you notice that it came from seeing something

164
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:13.830
Bianca Garcia: Mm hmm.

165
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's take that you had to see it with your eyes. How can you take site.

166
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And then remember to do the belly breathing. How can we do that.

167
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:44.250
Bianca Garcia: When you first came about it and you taught it to me. It was more in my head, and I was using it a lot more. But as time goes

168
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.760
Bianca Garcia: I have used him. I'm not going to deny that I have. And then there's tend to have it but um

169
00:21:51.090 --> 00:22:05.130
Bianca Garcia: I don't know i was i think it's not when I'm cleaning because I'm not stressed. I'm just, you know, a little stressed, but I think it's when I'm about to have like panic attacks and that I use it and it's helped that I

170
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Really back a little bit, we got off topic a little bit. Remember, you remember my, I had a very precise question and it didn't quite get answered. Let's try it again. Ready.

171
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that you had to see the messy house. Ah, I can clean that with a broom going to take that the fact that you are getting information coming through your eyes.

172
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:41.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to use this as a metaphor. In other words, this is happening, you're taking in the signal from the eyes, I can just go clean. Now I want you to just take in information from your eyes, something you could see in your environment.

173
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That would remind you to do the belly breathing.

174
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What would that be that you would see what could you see

175
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.810
Bianca Garcia: Me. Think about that.

176
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.270
Bianca Garcia: New sure

177
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:03.330
Bianca Garcia: I don't know if I start to think I've thought about it to use it if I

178
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, but we already know that seems something helps you, so we might as well use works. Look at this. What if you had around a little Buddha belly. What if you had belly breathing on a sticker or beautifully DRAWN BY YOUR CHILDREN AND YOU, AND IT WAS THIS BEAUTIFUL THING OF THE SENSE OF

179
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: finger painting painting thing that you guys all made together for maybe you do it yourself. Or maybe pull something from the internet or maybe you how to set timer for you that you saw came up that came up every hour.

180
00:23:46.350 --> 00:24:07.170
Bianca Garcia: Actually, now that you say that I'm the means on Instagram. Yeah, there's like this. This breathing. This guy that was doing this breathing and and that made me remind me of a bit and I didn't use it that day, but I do remember seeing that. So yeah, I see.

181
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:13.590
Bianca Garcia: This through with the big belly and he was breathing in and out. It was a funny thing, but that reminded me of it.

182
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So notice how it's to site and that's most people we take in a lot of information from our eyes a lot from our ears, live from our nose to

183
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: But a lot from our eyes and you remember the skill that worked. You can distract your mind by busying so if you could use that same thing. What could you have around your home that would help you remember what could you put around what could you do

184
00:24:47.010 --> 00:25:00.600
Bianca Garcia: I think that's a good idea, the sticker or a sign from them, making it the kids, you know, I think that's a wonderful idea. I would not. I would definitely use that that would be a good one.

185
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:10.830
Gwenevere Abriel: And what if we made that an objective meaning a small task that would help your goal, which is, I would like to decrease overthinking and anxiety.

186
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What if what it was, was I will create one of the tasks, just the next week or two.

187
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:24.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, the ears are acting up. What if over this next little bit of time it is

188
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Client will. What do you want to do. You tell me.

189
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.500
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, me go.

190
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.430
Bianca Garcia: Up like a picture of it.

191
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, it

192
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.560
Bianca Garcia: Makes my kids would be happy to do that.

193
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:49.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a picture of it with kids and we're going to post it wherever you see it. Yeah. Where will you see it.

194
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.240
Bianca Garcia: In it definitely put up, put it up on my room.

195
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.330
Bianca Garcia: Place on the wall or on the door.

196
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice door. So that's the task for the next week or however long it takes you client will make a picture of

197
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:24.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Image of belly breathing. You can even take a meme. If he had get get calling you don't want to do with kids just get it done can do that until you get the drawing done right breathing with kids and posted in my room or on all now.

198
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there a fading away of knowing how to do it.

199
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.320
Bianca Garcia: Is there a fading way of knowing how to do it.

200
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Again did. Do you remember how to do it.

201
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.280
Bianca Garcia: Oh, yes.

202
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. And if you do forget you can always ask plenty of people kind of forget and and then they're right, forgetting the important part, which has to do with that expansion of the belly.

203
00:26:52.650 --> 00:27:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so now look at that you have used detective work you've real the back and said, What Am I already doing. Let's make use of that skill.

204
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:17.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Can use the breathing now afterwards and maybe you only do a few cycles. And the really now we're left with that only took 60 seconds or you know even 60 seconds is a long time when you're working that part of that breathing or maybe it was two weeks to two minutes, then what

205
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: We want more distraction, let's say, the house is clean. He claimed it yesterday. Don't want to do it again. Your hands are all pruning. So let's say you want to do something else. Let's list some more things that could work as distraction.

206
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.660
Bianca Garcia: Okay, um,

207
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.190
Bianca Garcia: You want me to say what I could use

208
00:27:43.740 --> 00:28:02.010
Bianca Garcia: Well, I'm right mate, maybe helps a lot with that because I'm constantly like playing with her, or we're singing and dancing or changing her putting your bed. You know, there's a lot to do with her. So she's a big distraction. So that's, that's number one.

209
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So here's the thing I hear that I remember. I already know something I already know.

210
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: A few times a day. I hear somebody or it's on the internet and it last hours. So as much as that baby takes your attention.

211
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: There's hours that it's. Gotcha.

212
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah I

213
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Hear you, but while you're putting the baby diaper PLAYING Are you also thinking

214
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: About those negative thoughts.

215
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:56.490
Bianca Garcia: Um, some things, and sometimes know like sometimes it's like I said she, it's a good distraction. I get distracted. And I also have yeah but maybe I do think cuz I yeah I would think so, yeah.

216
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.780
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not

217
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: New

218
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not difficult not, I don't mean emotionally. And what I'm saying is your brains habituated to it knows how to do a diaper. You could do it in your sleep. If I can probably have sleepwalking at three in the morning when the baby's crying.

219
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you're so used to doing it. What we want distraction works when we get out of that thought over here, this clumping and we go somewhere else. So we want something new or something we're learning

220
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: A cult something that we have to really focus on and then we're not going to be thinking about the worry thought

221
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

222
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: What else can we do

223
00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.500
Bianca Garcia: Well, I read

224
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice. I like it. What books you have around or, you know, or something. What are you doing for reading

225
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:58.860
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, it's on my phone. It's a Apple books or whatever is called

226
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You

227
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.590
Bianca Garcia: Actually call books.

228
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.250
Bianca Garcia: Sorry.

229
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been able to be in a what if something happens to my family and you were able to read

230
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And get out. Yeah.

231
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:23.670
Bianca Garcia: Well, I think when I not the family part but I went to have other negative thoughts and I do that but um

232
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:42.120
Bianca Garcia: I don't know, I, I'm just like you say, I'm so used to it that I just have different things that I just tried to take those dots of that is just goes away. By doing that, by helping myself by all those random things that I told you. That's what's helped a lot. So I don't know.

233
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.280
Bianca Garcia: What else to say.

234
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, they're not random. They're really, it can take hours of cleaning right and it results in good results. There's also cooking.

235
00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm we're just staying really focused on this distraction technique. There's lots of other things to do but just really honing in on this one. There's you remembering and we've got a way for that to happen right through the eyes. We're going to see the poster can tell our kids.

236
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:25.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, let's remember to breathe, you know, let's all kind of get into it and then we got our kids on board and we're all doing this breath work. Now we have distraction. You said you you kind of minimize the work that you're doing and I don't know that that

237
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, try again.

238
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: You do little things you said

239
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think they're trivial. I think they're important.

240
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all it's made. I want to reduce the anxiety and and worrying and overthinking it's made it all the way on to the treatment plan that's how big a deal. It is. It's, it's, big deal.

241
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: For people that thing you're talking about the overthinking

242
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: When we do the live chat analysis and we go back, back, back, all the way back in time for most people, many people. That's the one.

243
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That led to substance use to begin with.

244
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.400
Bianca Garcia: Um,

245
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't think it's a small thing. I think it's really worth looking at. And the more you know what to do with it in a healthy way in a constructive way. I think you're on track with relapse prevention.

246
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.160
Bianca Garcia: That's good to hear.

247
00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Like yeah

248
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So we've got. Let me just see.

249
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.770
Gwenevere Abriel: won't talk about reading one more time.

250
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know,

251
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: We'll revisit let's just see how far you get with this piece. OK, let's go over to a cognitive intervention. It's not a physical

252
00:32:55.230 --> 00:33:06.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Drawing it's not physical cleaning. It's not this kind of distraction. It's all mental cognitive. Let's see if we can come up with something that you could be saying to yourself.

253
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Even while you're doing a mindless habituated it's not mine was obvious. You love taking care of children, but you know, I'm trying to say like you already know how to do it.

254
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:15.570
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

255
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Because watch. Look at my wording mindless if I'm doing a mindless activity, you know, my mind is going to do worry

256
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.690
Bianca Garcia: Oh, I thought it would do less

257
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's gonna get busy worrying. So we've got to keep that mind occupied

258
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do, let's do what's called a sort of a cognitive intervention here. Let's see if we can

259
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at. Let's consolidate for a minute.

260
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to hear your sphere.

261
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:57.870
Gwenevere Abriel: consolidate all that information from the internet. All of it from. And let's just hear it. What's the fear.

262
00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.110
Bianca Garcia: Right now, um,

263
00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:11.820
Bianca Garcia: Oh well, I don't like to say it out loud because they say the tongue is like a powerful thing. You know, but um

264
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:21.300
Bianca Garcia: Um, yeah, just, you know, I just, I would just hate like any of them getting sick. Okay.

265
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.850
Gwenevere Abriel: worst fear is my child getting sick. Right. Yeah.

266
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, absolutely. I can see that. And that pretty much gets it. And where do you, where do you feel that just now even sort of me saying it.

267
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.130
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, it just, it just worries me and it scares me.

268
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Where did you feel it though just now as I oh

269
00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.500
Bianca Garcia: I felt that in my heart.

270
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Heart. Yeah.

271
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and you said you worry about it as much as a couple hours, you can take every day, you know, consume you for a couple hours right

272
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:07.650
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

273
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

274
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.190
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna go nice and slow on this. Okay.

275
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that worrying.

276
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Kept the virus away.

277
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.110
Bianca Garcia: I don't think it would keep it away. But for now, yeah.

278
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's let's let's see how true that is so if I

279
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: overthink about it for two hours.

280
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It keeps the virus away. Now I know I'm being really I'm focusing on exact words here. But let's just see how much of it is fantasy. How much of it is rational. Let's really look at it. Let's see what's going on in there.

281
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:08.160
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, no, I don't think the worry would help keep it away at all. No, I don't think so. I don't think that's a rational model.

282
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:15.870
Bianca Garcia: That logical, but I think that it gives ideas of how to keep them safe, I guess.

283
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:22.590
Gwenevere Abriel: We go. It gives me ideas of how to keep them safe.

284
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes sense.

285
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So after a two hour I know I'm slowing time way down and it might be uncomfortable, but we're going to pick it this until it can't be picked up anymore.

286
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It's like I'm looking at something. Those clothes.

287
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Are normally its way out here. That's what I do. I really get right up close to it. So if I am looking at the we're going to call it two hours two hour chunk today.

288
00:36:53.400 --> 00:37:03.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And if I worried. I should think back yesterday's to our day before was two hours. Well, during those two hours is that when you came up with the good idea while you were worrying.

289
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.130
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I think so.

290
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, where'd you come up with. And that would you yeah

291
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.670
Bianca Garcia: Well, I'm

292
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:26.640
Bianca Garcia: Like if I or their father goes out we wash our hands right away and disinfect like cat door handles and or what things we touch and

293
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:31.590
Bianca Garcia: One thing for sure the kids don't go anywhere.

294
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Really important. Are you saying, watch, watch the difference

295
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:48.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I hear a TV show and in five minutes I here. Make sure you spray down with Lysol the light switches

296
00:37:49.170 --> 00:38:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. That's taking in data. This is not worried. This is just I'm listening to information that's 60 seconds that's five minutes I turn the TV on I got on the Internet, the time period. I'm not talking about those five minutes.

297
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:05.760
Bianca Garcia: Well,

298
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: This isn't, this isn't the part I'm really too concerned about I'm concerned about

299
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: The hours that follow. So listen really listen to this. Here it comes. Here on the set again during those two hours. I already know you heard data coming in from the TV show for now I'm just going to say that TV show.

300
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: That was five minutes, but you spent two hours worrying and you said, I come up with good ideas during those two hours and I'm checking to see if that's really true, because he did say yes.

301
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:46.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me what you came up with that wasn't from here wasn't from those five minutes, but came from you.

302
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:57.930
Gwenevere Abriel: just stirring that pot of thinking. Will you just sat there and mixed it around and Fred it and you had ran it through all kinds of scenarios over and over and over two hours.

303
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're telling me you came up with the idea of washing hands and spraying things down, or did you get that in those first five minutes.

304
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.660
Bianca Garcia: Oh no, yeah, probably got that thing. Quick Thinking of

305
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys probably from

306
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.360
Bianca Garcia: From. Yeah, I did.

307
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:19.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

308
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's see what I'm doing, am I hiding much here. I'm pretty transparent. Let's just see. Because you said the benefits of it are I come up with really cool ideas and I want to make sure

309
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:39.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That that is true because I'm not a wanted to go away if you really did come up with a genius idea well then let's see.

310
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it true that because you sat there and worried worried and weren't really maybe playing with your kids and you had kind of a crummy day for those two hours you worry.

311
00:39:52.380 --> 00:40:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you had a great idea, right in the middle or at the end of those two hours. You're telling me you had a great idea from all that wording.

312
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.420
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, then probably nothing

313
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:18.030
Bianca Garcia: That's a good point. I thought they were good. But, well, I mean, that's the only thing I guess I just take from the data were like you said, and do that. But maybe I guess I don't have good ideas.

314
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So what is what's happening and I don't know what it is for you. I'm trying it on just to see here's what I'm wondering. I'm wondering if what you do is you take data. You guys, this is this. This is how long a virus sits on a surface and you go, oh, and this and then you say, well,

315
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are people getting it. And what are the symptoms and how will I know so you're hearing information come in the ears. Couple of visuals to they're coming data is coming in.

316
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you go write them down.

317
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

318
00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:56.010
No.

319
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:03.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep them in head and you think about them. Again, think about them again.

320
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And not only do you think about them again. It's almost like

321
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: In order for you to remember what you do to yourself is, you're kind of like you run all these native scenarios, so that you remember

322
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Almost like this negative Inner Parent like well you better remember because these horrible things are going to happen. And she you know what you need to remember

323
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That thing that horrible thing. And it's this negative reinforcement. And I just wonder if we looked at that and we said wait a cotton pickin minute

324
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's kind of mean

325
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:49.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we flipped the script and instead I sat there with my recorder on my phone, or good old pen and paper.

326
00:41:50.670 --> 00:42:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just wrote it down or I print screen change. Oh, he is going to be this is going to be our list of things that we do. Are these are our

327
00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, our coronavirus values for the month, you know, I mean like these are going to be our new habits of health. Well, I like that one new habits of health. So I wrote them down. Like, what do you do, do you do I got him out of my head, those first five minutes. I wrote them down.

328
00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I told my family. You guys willing to do this all be in charge of this part, can you be in charge of this part's hard stuff to remember because we already have like habits in place that Martin contradictory to our new health habits, but they're out on paper.

329
00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:42.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, there's no punishment to you. There's no having to sit with this horrible, awful imagery in order for you to remember your hometown.

330
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:56.430
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I guess I should do that. I do that with everything else I write stuff down you know appointments grocery list. So yeah, I think I should do that. That would be a good idea.

331
00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:04.140
Bianca Garcia: A lot of people do that poetry. Write them down, or they. Right. Right. You know, I think that would help a lot to

332
00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: could post a list and kind of maybe out wherever it's nice blank piece of paper.

333
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what I'll do, I'll take in my five minutes because probably you're getting some data you oh

334
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: That's true. I that's hot off the press, that's a new statistic. I didn't know that. That's from a doctor that's from a credible source. I'm going to go do that.

335
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not going to torture myself by having to keep thinking about it. I'm going to go write it down. This is the stuff I went to talk with my family about tonight or I can go do it now.

336
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.360
Bianca Garcia: Yeah.

337
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Now it's out of your head.

338
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.390
Bianca Garcia: Like that.

339
00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:41.520
Uh huh.

340
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But you

341
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Run it through in

342
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:47.700
Bianca Garcia: Sports really

343
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean you brought it to this mean it's so mean.

344
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.950
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, it is.

345
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: What good does it do you to threaten all of that that horrible thing.

346
00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, so hold that thought. I don't want to ever take something away unless or something that's coming back to you. What if that negative consequences. Something bad might happen to my

347
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:29.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Two kids, maybe that's what's motivating me to follow these precautions. What if that's how you do work. What if the threat of something negative is what motivates to what if that's true, you tell me what do you think

348
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.120
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, you could be, it could be that was seems like

349
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.620
Bianca Garcia: It seems like that's how I run

350
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:55.410
Bianca Garcia: Yeah, I know we talked about it. I mean, saying it out loud. You wouldn't think like that, you know, so I'm glad you said that because it makes me think, is that really how I am no

351
00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I don't know. That's why we're talking. We're trying to figure out what's already there. And if it's working. If it's getting you to follow through with safety precautions. Do we really want to remove it.

352
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you need that return. Maybe you want to beat yourself up every hour, you know, two hours a day, maybe do a three hours.

353
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

354
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:30.270
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean paradoxical. I mean, kind of, what would be the equivalent of like sarcastic sort of just to see what you say back to me.

355
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't you do it four hours a day.

356
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:37.080
Bianca Garcia: That

357
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: beat yourself up are

358
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:59.670
Bianca Garcia: Doing now, man. Hey, even before these these a Corona things. I kept him why handwashing Happy birthday. That was way before that and now even twice. It seems like I have to do it twice as much. That's what it seems like

359
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

360
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:08.730
Bianca Garcia: So that's beating yourself up a little bit more than where you were already

361
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I don't know how you, I would like to hear what your inner voice sounds like

362
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:20.010
Bianca Garcia: And on that.

363
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:24.300
Gwenevere Abriel: On anything. But yes, this we can stand this topic, if you like, yes.

364
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.220
Bianca Garcia: What is your voice sound like like

365
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch. You said I beat myself up that's a metaphor. No, you're not actually sitting here going, you better remember to Lysol the handle. Yeah.

366
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:59.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Still a metaphor. So I want to hear how you sound. If I was in your head, and you just heard. Well, it's better that you wash your hands every single time you touch a door knob. How do you eat yourself up. What's the inner voice.

367
00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:04.110
Bianca Garcia: It's just saying it over and over and over.

368
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.040
Bianca Garcia: I think that's what is doing.

369
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you ever been able to learn a lesson. Another way.

370
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Besides repeating it over and over for two hours straight, getting your heart racing your breath shallow palms sweaty jaws tight muscles clenched, have you ever been able to learn in another another way

371
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.110
Bianca Garcia: Just doing it just, just do it. And that's it. Yeah, I know, I know.

372
00:47:50.220 --> 00:48:00.060
Bianca Garcia: We just do it. I don't know. Yeah, we'd like because I'm constantly saying it, but the we just, we just do it. I don't know.

373
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:05.010
Bianca Garcia: I guess that's the only way. Right. You just gotta do it.

374
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's just go with that. So we're at the top of the hour. But I want. Let's just see what you did here today. You did a lot more very hard.

375
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: You identified a goal.

376
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You identified ways that you're already effective right in addressing overthinking and then we took that skill we said, well, how can we apply it to this virus crisis that we're in. Okay. And what I'm suggesting is

377
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:53.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if you're ready to let go of the two hours of boring. I can't tell you because I we don't have quite enough time for me to really hear what I didn't quite hear what the inner voice was we went to just do it.

378
00:48:54.360 --> 00:49:02.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you want to experiment a little bit to see what happens to you, you could just spend your five minutes, maybe it's only once a day.

379
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Only on this is my our Where's my credit all listen to CNN or I'll listen to Dr. Whatever.

380
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where I'll get my information a limited budget my amount of time because I'll get really preoccupied now and do that. I'll just, hey guys, I'm going to walk out of the room. I don't want to hear right now.

381
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I just going to have this amount of time, I'm going to take it in when I write down my ideas and you're out of my head. And I'm going to do them. And that's it. No, no.

382
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.990
