00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.460
Dr. Figg: So let's talk about the way Suboxone works.

158
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.520
Dr. Figg: And the way right side right heart works. Excuse me. So you mentioned before that you feel like Suboxone

159
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:14.280
Dr. Figg: Will help you prevent prevent you from using it. So when you take other opiates the things that they do in your brain are kind of like light switches, they turn things on or they turn things off.

160
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:21.000
Dr. Figg: So when we think about opiates, they fully turn on that pleasure center. That's the height of euphoria.

161
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:31.020
Dr. Figg: They turn off pain they turn off being away. If you take enough and they turn off breathing. If you take enough. That's, yeah, that's right.

162
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:45.750
Dr. Figg: buprenorphine Suboxone is an opiate but it's what we call a partial agonist. It doesn't have the full effect like other opiates do so it doesn't tend to have the for your high. The other ones do.

163
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:54.300
Dr. Figg: It does not turn off your breathing, like the other ones do. It does not turn off your wakefulness. The way to do

164
00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:03.690
Dr. Figg: It does turn off pain. So it is a mild payment legally, but because it doesn't turn off your breathing doesn't turn off your consciousness.

165
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:21.210
Dr. Figg: It's almost impossible to overdose on socks on by itself. So makes it a much safer medication even compared to Methadone methadone, you can overdose on Suboxone it's pretty pretty hard to unless you mix it with other things and slow your breathing down like alcohol or bentos

166
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.070
Dr. Figg: So that's why I asked about this.

167
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.730
So,

168
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:31.980
Dr. Figg: It's important to understand the interactions that can hurt you because we want to be as safe as possible and

169
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.680
Dr. Figg: The other important parts.

170
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.360
Ashley Martin: Of Suboxone is that

171
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:44.130
Dr. Figg: When it's grabbing hold of the receptors in your brain, those lights, which is that it affects it holds on tighter than other things do.

172
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.260
Dr. Figg: So when you're takes a box. So if you take something else Percocet, for instance.

173
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.780
Dr. Figg: The percocet won't be able to attach to the receptor, which means it won't have the effect

174
00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:06.480
Dr. Figg: As long as you've had this box on your system. So it helps block the high and the the beneficial. The pleasure from using other things which helps reduce addictive behaviors.

175
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:19.230
Dr. Figg: But because it's so those those switches, it will prevent the withdrawal and it will prevent the cravings to use other things. So it helps prevent people from using other stuff. It helps prevent people from being withdrawal.

176
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:25.410
Dr. Figg: And it's a safer medication. So that's why we like to use this when it's approved for

177
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.940
Ashley Martin: Outpatient use who can

178
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.670
Dr. Figg: write a script like any other medication basically right

179
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.990
Dr. Figg: Okay, you don't have to show up at a clinic every day to what someone wants to take

180
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.530
Dr. Figg: It provides people with a lot more

181
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.790
Dr. Figg: Freedom and functionality and that's what we want is

182
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:49.860
Dr. Figg: We want you to feel like it's a normal medication, you're going to see your doctor day and probably get pills for your blood pressure.

183
00:12:50.280 --> 00:13:02.310
Dr. Figg: And we want you to associate with in the same regard. It's not something to fix. It's not something is when you feel like it is dependent. I take every day so that I don't have withdrawal or it's every day.

184
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.680
Dr. Figg: But so I don't abuse other stuff. And in that regard. It's just a normal day with medication.

185
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:20.100
Dr. Figg: The way Brian heart works is, in addition to using medication. We're structured around weekly support pics. So we put people into support groups. They're kind of like an NA meeting.

186
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.320
Dr. Figg: With other people who have a history.

187
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.970
Dr. Figg: Of substance abuse or

188
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.930
Ashley Martin: Opioid addiction.

189
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:34.050
Dr. Figg: Or in various stages of recovery. That way they can share and support each other. The groups are led by a therapist with a history in addiction treatment.

190
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.370
Dr. Figg: It's about an hour long and it starts with a check in with your doctor.

191
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:47.190
Dr. Figg: To make sure that your doses good that you're not having side effects, you know, some people are talking about tapering and things like that. And those are being tested.

192
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.930
Dr. Figg: Make sure you're not having withdrawal. Make sure if something's coming out, someone's going to have a surgery or something like that. All those medical issues are addressed on

193
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.760
Ashley Martin: Pretty much weekly basis so we

194
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.890
Dr. Figg: Want you to have lots of access to the doctor.

195
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:10.290
Dr. Figg: And then it's about an hour long after that for the group and the therapist talks about relapse prevention or stress management or coping skills or something. Something along those lines.

196
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.570
Dr. Figg: does all that makes sense.

197
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.250
Yes. Okay, great.

198
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.920
Dr. Figg: So,

199
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:35.160
Dr. Figg: That's kind of the way the medication works. That's why I like the medication. That's the way Brian heart works. What we would do from here is two things. One, figure out a schedule for you for a weekly group that you could attend and to write your prescription. Okay.

200
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:47.760
Dr. Figg: See I have groups that have openings on Tuesday or Thursday at 3pm would one of those work for you.

201
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.520
Ashley Martin: Um, yeah. Tuesday would work.

202
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.600
To say

203
00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:03.570
Dr. Figg: Okay. All right. So what you do to go get into the group. It's done through zoom, just like this. It's just more people right

204
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:09.510
Dr. Figg: And you're going to call into the virtual clinic, the number you call before me.

205
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.350
Dr. Figg: Just like the front desk of a clinic, if you walk into a doctor's office, they're the first people you talk to. So you're going to call into the virtual thing.

206
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:29.310
Dr. Figg: The first time we want it to be about 30 minutes beforehand, just to make sure any additional paperwork or things like that are taken care of. And after that, it's usually doesn't take that long, but they do have you felt like questionnaires and things like that sometimes

207
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:35.910
Dr. Figg: And then they'll give you the number the zoom number for the group which changes every week.

208
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.630
Dr. Figg: Just to make sure people log into the virtual clinic first

209
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.600
Dr. Figg: No. That makes sense.

210
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:51.240
Dr. Figg: Yep. Okay. Cool. So let's see tomorrow. Today is Monday. So tomorrow would be Tuesday. Would you be able to come tomorrow to start tomorrow.

211
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.130
Dr. Figg: Yes. Wonderful. Okay.

212
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.100
Dr. Figg: And then the last thing.

213
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.530
I don't

214
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.900
Dr. Figg: Actually want. There we go. Sorry, your chart kicks me out. I need

215
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.290
Ashley Martin: To make

216
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:14.370
Dr. Figg: Sure, I have the correct pharmacy for it with every Walmart on Washington Boulevard East one right. Okay.

217
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:26.130
Dr. Figg: So it's been a long time since we've been on Suboxone. It sounds like you're on a 32 milligram dose, but your dose, then does not necessarily mean that sure does now.

218
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:34.740
Dr. Figg: Our goal of dozing Suboxone is to have the lowest effective dose effective means you're not in withdrawal, you're not having cravings, you're not being, you know,

219
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.150
Dr. Figg: You're having the blocking effect for other stuff.

220
00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:51.390
Dr. Figg: And lowest effective means we're not having side effects by being too high, major side effects of Suboxone. Some people have like nosh or abdominal pain, like if they took too many opiates, they drowsy.

221
00:16:52.140 --> 00:17:06.150
Dr. Figg: Or dry mouth, those are the and constipation. So it's an opiate it has the typical side effects that opiates have. So we want to minimize side effects. We want those to be high enough that you're not a witch rolling, you're not having cravings. Does that make sense.

222
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.360
Dr. Figg: Yeah. So what I would suggest we do is to start you on

223
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.920
Dr. Figg: A dose of

224
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.310
Dr. Figg: eight milligrams. It's been a week.

225
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.240
Dr. Figg: Since we last had anything. So you're not in withdrawal currently right

226
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.320
Ashley Martin: No, no.

227
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:29.700
Dr. Figg: In the major the, the biggest measurement that we're going to have is whether you feel like your cravings to use other things are suppressed.

228
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.040
Dr. Figg: Okay, which only you can no

229
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:32.910
Ashley Martin: Right.

230
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:46.440
Dr. Figg: To measure that. So it's very much can be driven by you. We do, we do regular urine drug screens. The purpose of the urine drug screen is always to have proof of what you're saying.

231
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:54.390
Dr. Figg: So that you can say that if anybody ever asked a question, we can say no. She says that she's only taking Suboxone or during shows that

232
00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:01.290
Dr. Figg: The second reason is so that we can have a conversation if something else comes up because

233
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:15.570
Dr. Figg: If you have high blood pressure and you're treated for your high blood pressure, you go see your doctor. Your doctor takes your blood pressure and go wow your blood pressure is really high. They don't then say, so I'm going to stop your treatment and good luck to you.

234
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.930
Dr. Figg: We continue training in the same way a person who is dependent on opiates. If they relapse.

235
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.340
Ashley Martin: That's particularly true

236
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:29.760
Dr. Figg: So it's not a reason to kick them out of a program. It's reason to have a conversation so that we can help them more. Does that make sense.

237
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.200
Dr. Figg: Yeah, good. So

238
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.540
Dr. Figg: That's my, that's my stance.

239
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.930
Dr. Figg: And so I just wanted to understand we do your

240
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.680
Ashley Martin: Screens

241
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.990
Dr. Figg: But those are the reasons that we do that so

242
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.920
Dr. Figg: We're going to work to continue your recovery.

243
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:51.870
Dr. Figg: I think we should start you to dose of eight milligrams, which comes in either to millionaire mentoring programs for the tablets.

244
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.070
Dr. Figg: And then start you to just once a day.

245
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:13.500
Dr. Figg: And then kind of have a conversation in the coming weeks. Do you feel like that's doing the right job for you. Do you feel like you need more. Are you still feeling cravings to use other things in various moments of the day. Does that make sense.

246
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:19.500
Dr. Figg: Yeah, and at the same time make sure that we're not, you know, giving you side effects and things like that. So, okay.

247
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:28.950
Dr. Figg: You use the tablets before the form of the medication is often dictated by what the pharmacy or what your insurance company will pay for

248
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:38.310
Dr. Figg: So generally, what I do is write a prescription for just brand name Suboxone and ask the pharmacy to submit to whatever is the preferred form.

249
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:46.290
Dr. Figg: You need to make sure to put it underneath your tongue and let it dissolve 100% that means don't chew it up.

250
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:57.510
Dr. Figg: There's a bunch of things underneath your tongue with very little skin in between. So when we certain medications are small enough that they can pass through the skin and go directly into

251
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:11.700
Dr. Figg: The bloodstream Suboxone has two medications and buprenorphine which is the opiate that helps block cravings and things like that that we want and then naloxone, which is the reversal agent. So that's what they give to people when they overdose, the spray it up your nose and

252
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.890
Ashley Martin: Just like that reverses it

253
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:25.560
Dr. Figg: When you dissolve it underneath your tongue, you get all of the buprenorphine and none of them lock so so you get the effect you want if you chew it up and swallow it. You don't get any of either of them. It's like

254
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.220
Dr. Figg: I think, neither of them are absorbed very well through your GI tract.

255
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:37.380
Dr. Figg: If you crush it and then shoot it snorted smoke it. Take it some other way that some people who you're going to get a whole bunch of the lock so

256
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:38.490
Ashley Martin: It's

257
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.790
Dr. Figg: Going to push you into withdrawal and they're going to hate the fact that you did.

258
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.740
Dr. Figg: So it's an abuse deterrent.

259
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:51.180
Dr. Figg: Formulation of the medication. I want you to understand that, so that you know it's important that you take it the right way so that we get the effect that we want.

260
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:51.780
Okay. All right.

261
00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.600
Dr. Figg: dissolve it on your tongue. It usually takes about five to 10 minutes. Don't eat, drink or smoke for at least 15 minutes afterwards.

262
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:01.530
Ashley Martin: Okay.

263
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:07.410
Dr. Figg: Because you don't want to wash anything else down your throat, and then you won't get the full dose of medication. Okay.

264
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.220
Okay.

265
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:09.900
Dr. Figg: That's

266
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:23.730
Dr. Figg: I think all of the stuff. So I'm going to issue a prescription to your Wal Mart pharmacy for eight milligrams once a day, and what it was the way the prescription is going to be written is for twice a day.

267
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:30.030
Dr. Figg: And I want you to start at once a day. I'm going to write it for twice a day so that you have enough if you need to go up on the dose.

268
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.440
Ashley Martin: In the next week.

269
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.030
Dr. Figg: Does that make sense.

270
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:33.660
Ashley Martin: Yeah.

271
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.960
Dr. Figg: And then we'll look to see you tomorrow and grew

272
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:37.770
Ashley Martin: Okay.

273
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:43.050
Dr. Figg: And you'll meet Levada rooster therapist that I work with, for those spirits and she's wonderful

274
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.640
Dr. Figg: Okay.

275
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.480
Ashley Martin: All right, all right.

276
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.240
Dr. Figg: That's all the stuff that I have, what questions or concerns you have

277
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.660
Ashley Martin: No, not me right now. Okay.

278
00:21:51.990 --> 00:22:00.990
Dr. Figg: If you think of a question or concern or something needs to be addressed later if you have any problem at the pharmacy, your first point of contact is the virtual clinic or 24 hours a day.

279
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:11.460
Dr. Figg: And they're the first ones who can they can sort out most things, if it's something that gets relayed to me or they can relay messages to me if it's something I need to address. Okay.

280
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:12.300
Ashley Martin: Okay.

281
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:24.240
Dr. Figg: All right, awesome. Actually, I'm gonna write your script, let us know worried about an hour. You know, before going to the farms saying count things but and then let us know if you have any issues and we'll look to see you tomorrow at three, okay.

282
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:24.750
Ashley Martin: All right.

283
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.760
Dr. Figg: All right, awesome. So nice to meet you. You

284
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.460
Ashley Martin: Need to take care bye bye

285
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.270
Bye.
