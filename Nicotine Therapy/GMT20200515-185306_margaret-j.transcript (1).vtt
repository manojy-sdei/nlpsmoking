Geanie polo: Yeah, that's good.

167
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.630
margaret johnstone: Yeah. Have you ever taken any psychiatric medications.

168
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:25.590
No.

169
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.610
Geanie polo: I don't think I don't think I need any other

170
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:38.160
margaret johnstone: Well, let me, let me tell about the treatment for anxiety disorders is what you have when you have panic attacks.

171
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.830
margaret johnstone: The treatment for anxiety disorders is a depressant.

172
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:51.090
margaret johnstone: It's a drug that you take every day long, they're a whole new class of drugs. They're not addictive.

173
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.080
margaret johnstone: You don't

174
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.270
margaret johnstone: You start on it and you have any side effects that you're comfortable with. You can just

175
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.530
margaret johnstone: It's not like an opiate but can't just stop.

176
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:17.610
margaret johnstone: Withdrawal the antidepressants actually helps keep you calm help you manage the anxiety and so the treatment actual anxiety disorders is a depressant.

177
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:24.660
margaret johnstone: Xanax is ok for a short period of time, but you don't want to do that on a regular basis.

178
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.890
Geanie polo: Well, I'm not looking for something

179
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.370
Geanie polo: For forever. You know what I mean.

180
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.360
margaret johnstone: Yeah, just

181
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.860
Geanie polo: Something for now and I don't feel comfortable taking stuff that I don't know.

182
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.900
Geanie polo: What it is probably right. Not right now because that'll probably give me more anxiety. Just because if I take it and I don't know what it is.

183
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:54.810
Geanie polo: Mm hmm. So, um, yeah. I mean, I just feel comfortable taking what I know and I know my body is okay with the Xanax

184
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.650
margaret johnstone: Okay, well you don't do prescribe them for you.

185
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:07.050
Geanie polo: Yeah. Well, she gave me a few, but told me to talk with you and you would be able to describe me

186
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:09.780
margaret johnstone: Yeah, that

187
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.280
Geanie polo: To describe the sonic medication well

188
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.800
margaret johnstone: I really would like you to try to present first to see that's helpful for you.

189
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:33.510
margaret johnstone: We can use the Xanax as a backup in case it's not for you know for major I have many people who keep a fuse and just in case they have a major panic attack when they have something they have to

190
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.330
margaret johnstone: Go to, or if they have a job or they

191
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:44.520
margaret johnstone: They don't want to have a panic attack on the job. But, you know, the minor. There are different kinds of panic attacks to

192
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.520
margaret johnstone: The ones that just incapacity you

193
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.270
margaret johnstone: And then there are minor ones that if you just can calm down, and yet they go away and they don't want

194
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.320
margaret johnstone: To take you

195
00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:01.320
margaret johnstone: So that's where I think the antidepressant might be helpful for you to know man.

196
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.280
Geanie polo: Well, when I went

197
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:10.950
Geanie polo: One time, my friend. When you know because she has panic attacks to so she went to the ER.

198
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.720
Geanie polo: They gave her

199
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.340
Geanie polo: I forgot what was the name of it, but it wasn't and I present

200
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:36.210
Geanie polo: So that's what I'm saying. I wouldn't feel comfortable trying that because I tried that once. And it just got me to like a point where I was just more depressed. It actually the pill that she got from her. I don't know. What was the name of it. I forgot, but

201
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:41.820
Geanie polo: She did get a phone number. Sure. And was it just got me depressed instead of rather not.

202
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:58.320
Geanie polo: Depressed. So as of right now, I, I mean maybe eventually later I can try something. But as of right now, I just want to stick to the same ropes, if that's okay. For now, and maybe be more open a little bit later.

203
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:07.770
margaret johnstone: Okay, so here's one. Are you going to be going to some of the groups and some of the sessions. Okay, so tell me in

204
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.670
margaret johnstone: On average, how many panic attacks a week you think

205
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.120
Geanie polo: Um,

206
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.820
Geanie polo: I don't know, it's like, it's hard to say. I don't want to make it seem like I

207
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:35.160
Geanie polo: I'm like, like I'm not, I'm not crazy. Or I don't like you know need crazy pills or anything like that but I mean I do get panic attacks frequently like

208
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:42.210
Geanie polo: Like just kind of on a daily basis because it'll come to me like when I think, you know, oh well.

209
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:50.100
Geanie polo: I wish I did this to friend and I wish I had this job and I wish I had this life like my brain just goes like

210
00:14:50.910 --> 00:15:12.570
Geanie polo: Unhappy with the things that I do. And oh well you know I shouldn't have been on this drug. And then it just, I start getting like hyperventilating, and I'll get panic and um, but I think it's just because I'm not happy with the way I'm doing things. So that's why I'm in this program.

211
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:33.990
Geanie polo: And going, you know, taking the strips to get off of what I'm on and I'm trying to change myself around. I know it's something that I'm not going to be that I have to be on for the rest of my life. But just for now. So I can cope, so I can get released from this whole circle.

212
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.390
Geanie polo: That I'm going through right now with, you know, opiates.

213
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.460
Geanie polo: And the addiction with the auctions and stuff.

214
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.830
margaret johnstone: Okay, well you know zanna was highly

215
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.440
Geanie polo: Yes, I do.

216
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.480
margaret johnstone: And it's one of the hardest drugs to get

217
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.170
Geanie polo: Yes, I'm super very aware

218
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:03.720
Geanie polo: And if I thought and to myself that I was in danger in myself anymore. I wouldn't do it but

219
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:11.730
Geanie polo: For what I'm doing now, like I need it because I'm going through something in life where I'm

220
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.750
Geanie polo: Getting you know changing my life around and and I do get panic attacks and

221
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.640
Geanie polo: On the daily basis and

222
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.500
margaret johnstone: I know, let's talk about the leave chain you were reading

223
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:27.450
margaret johnstone: Before you

224
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:29.850

Geanie polo: Where you want to know.

228
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.470
margaret johnstone: Okay, so you've always been on Suboxone pretty much

229
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.310
Geanie polo: I just started taking Suboxone I'm

230
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.650
Geanie polo: Like a few months ago.

231
00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:47.820
margaret johnstone: Okay, okay.

232
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.630
margaret johnstone: Very comfortable on the phone right now.

233
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:52.980
Geanie polo: Yeah.

234
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.340
Geanie polo: Yeah.

235
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.340
margaret johnstone: It's a good dose and it's holding not having

236
00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.620
margaret johnstone: Not having

237
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:01.890
Geanie polo: Oh, no, no.

238
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.630
Geanie polo: Those i'm doing is good bone. I talked to my doctor, we're talking about

239
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:17.910
Geanie polo: You know, maybe next month or in a few weeks, or whenever I feel comfortable anonymous start to lower and lower and lower it until I'm

240
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:36.420
Geanie polo: Completely off, which would be the same with Xanax when I'm ready to, like, okay, I'm going to try to, you know, just stop everything. It's not going to be right. See right at the moment because everyone knows it's addictive. So you have to lower the adults. Lower. Lower, lower

241
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.340
margaret johnstone: Here is very slow.

242
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.070
Geanie polo: Very slowly and

243
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.210
Geanie polo: Yeah, so

244
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.250
Geanie polo: Good. So I kind of, I kind of know

245
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.400
Geanie polo: Have a mindset of I know what I'm doing.

246
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:53.010
margaret johnstone: Yeah. Okay. So let me tell you what my worry is we'll, we'll work this out. We'll figure it out.

247
00:17:54.030 --> 00:18:02.640
margaret johnstone: My worry is when he starts or she starts lowering Suboxone the number one symptom, you're going to have is increased anxiety.

248
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:12.180
margaret johnstone: And if the only thing you have to depend on is going to be Xanax, then you're craving for Xanax, it's going to go up. Do you understand that.

249
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.090
margaret johnstone: And I'm we're not going to do that. That's substituting one addiction for another

250
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.590
Geanie polo: No, that's right. That's, that's not how I'm planning to do it so

251
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:31.350
Geanie polo: I'm gonna regardless of the situation. I'm I have a plan in my hand on how I'm gonna

252
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.690
Geanie polo: Fight this these issues, but I will, I will get there and I'll do it.

253
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.470
Geanie polo: Okay.

254
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.690
Geanie polo: And I'm confident about it.

255
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:41.730
margaret johnstone: So if you had

256
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.870
margaret johnstone: Today, the cake when you had a panic, something that was overwhelming.

257
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.510
margaret johnstone: You would be comfortable

258
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:55.770
Geanie polo: I'm not getting it.

259
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:02.040
margaret johnstone: Okay, because I'm take Xanax

260
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.870
margaret johnstone: If you have more than one panic symptom again.

261
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.140
margaret johnstone: You're not going to be able to use it five times a day, or four times a day.

262
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.000
margaret johnstone: You're gonna have to develop

263
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:23.190
margaret johnstone: Other methods for coping with anxiety. If you have. Okay, so, like, that's one of the reasons

264
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.700
margaret johnstone: syrupy is to learn some deep

265
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.170
margaret johnstone: Breathing relaxation

266
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.430
Techniques.

267
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.310
margaret johnstone: And there are other medications that

268
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.050
margaret johnstone: Will help with anxiety and they're not as powerful

269
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.990
margaret johnstone: But they were all

270
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.500
Geanie polo: Right.

271
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.600
margaret johnstone: We'll just take the edge off so that you can get

272
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.370
margaret johnstone: And then it'll go away.

273
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.230
Geanie polo: Yeah. And that's definitely something I'm willing to

274
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.230
Geanie polo: Do get into and and stuff but

275
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.120

338
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.770
Geanie polo: But yes, that is something I'm willing to do

339

margaret johnstone: There. Correct. Yeah, yeah.

354
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.550
Geanie polo: I wanted to ask a question mark.

355
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.140
Geanie polo: Is what what is valuable, is that for like helping you sleep is that for

356
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:20.490
margaret johnstone: Yeah, let me tell you all about the benzodiazepines. That's the class of drugs Xanax is in

357
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.210
margaret johnstone: There are short acting and long everything

358
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:32.880
margaret johnstone: Valium was the first one ever invented. It's a very powerful drug exposing your system, the one

359
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.970
margaret johnstone: highly addictive and ugly addiction to get off.

360
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:45.660
margaret johnstone: Xanax Klonopin and out of Van are the three short

361
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.230
Acting

362
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:48.660
margaret johnstone: Drugs.

363
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.340
margaret johnstone: And

364
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.090
margaret johnstone: Have those three

365
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.700
margaret johnstone: Xanax is the most addictive.

366
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:12.840
margaret johnstone: And add a van and Klonopin or about the same. Although kind of stays in your system a little bit longer. So those are all members of the volume family, and they all go together and they're highly addictive.

367
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.230
Geanie polo: So they're all for panic attacks or

368
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:29.310
margaret johnstone: They were originally in the way we use them now is for very short term episodes. Not long term, if you take any of the more than two weeks, you will have withdrawals.

369
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.010
margaret johnstone: And there was no symptoms are

370
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.170
margaret johnstone: attacks and anxiety.

371
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.350
margaret johnstone: So, all right. We get them for that and you're getting them.

372
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.430
Geanie polo: All right.

373
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.440
margaret johnstone: So that's why we want to keep you on

374
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.080
margaret johnstone: And get you more comfortable. So you need

375
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.590
margaret johnstone: Because you're already got one addictive substances.

376
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.170
margaret johnstone: Enough for anybody.

377
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.130
margaret johnstone: To deal with

378
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:56.730
Geanie polo: Okay.

379
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.100
margaret johnstone: So Xanax

380
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.260
margaret johnstone: We use it in very limited amount for short periods.

381
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:15.480
margaret johnstone: In when it was first invented and Valium is first thing for people is not a dictator, there's no problem. You can take

382
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.470
margaret johnstone: A horrible, horrible.

383
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.310
margaret johnstone: Horrible addiction or to get off.

384
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:29.040
margaret johnstone: So it was a big deal right so now it's all restrict

385
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.870
margaret johnstone: And so every, every tablet.

386
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.330
margaret johnstone: And with

387
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:50.700
margaret johnstone: With Suboxone and opiates its contract indicated, meaning the government watching those prescriptions and you cannot be on the mountain.

388
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.950
margaret johnstone: Yeah, so I think a month is what you

389
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.980
margaret johnstone: AND I ARE will

390
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.230
margaret johnstone: Want to get off of it because it's a very

391
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:12.060
margaret johnstone: Very bad combinations can stop you from moving those drugs and with another

392
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.110
margaret johnstone: Your, your whole breathing apparatus can shut down.

393
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:21.270
margaret johnstone: Uh huh. And you're not, you know, so it's very lethal, and there have been

394
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.230
margaret johnstone: Lots of deaths due to that combination

395
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.710
margaret johnstone: So it's, it's a combination.

396
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.420
margaret johnstone: So as long as you show that you're moving towards getting off of it.

397
