1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Good morning.

2
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you having a rough one,

3
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.040
Brittney: Yeah.

4
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.330
Get

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.430
Brittney: My mom's gonna walk through briefly just to get a shirt upstairs and her dogs are gonna bark. So I'm just making you aware of

6
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: These are things I am used to his clients, no worries.

7
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me get get a note open here. All right. How much sleep did you get last night.

8
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.480
Brittney: Oh, six hours.

9
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Not too shabby.

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.960
Brittney: Yeah yeah

11
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.810
Brittney: I'm just going some pain. This morning, a better my pains increased a lot this last couple weeks.

12
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.570
Brittney: To get my IUD changed out tonight and I'm pretty terrifying.

13
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's scary. You're afraid of what what doctor will say,

14
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.440
Brittney: I'm afraid of the pain. What's actually really painful.

15
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: During the procedure.

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.770
Brittney: Yeah, because they're pulling it out of your cervix. So they have to like open your cervix to

17
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.360
Brittney: Shake it out and put it back in. And I've already been like the pain of

18
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:42.870
Brittney: Like menstrual cramps, but I also have hip pain that flares and it's just it all seems to be connected. I really think I've had to meet your SS, but there's no way to get natural like this is without surgery so

19
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.130
Brittney: I'm hoping that getting my ID renewed like the hormones will help with the payments.

20
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.680
Brittney: Okay.

21
00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. You're in the solution. So it's just a right now at some data gathering and you do have some fear about about additional pain and

22
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: That pain is similar, because you've had it removed before. And how many years ago is that

23
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.720
Brittney: How to Remove that it put in

24
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.300
Brittney: Close was the first time I'm having it removed and replaced so

25
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: What is this the same doctor that you worked with before.

26
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.140
Brittney: You though.

27
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you talked with this doctor gods or fears.

28
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.310
Brittney: About this and this person before. Okay.

29
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And what do you feel like you're ready to talk with them about hey I had this pain. What it, what are some ideas of what she can do

30
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.800
Brittney: I talked to them about it already and I talked to the

31
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:58.260
Brittney: endo specialists and he said, I would be a candidate for surgery of others, no definitive answer unless you go have them open up your insights. She's kind of discouraging.

32
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But on the immediate IUD removal replacement that part though the pain management has that discussion happened.

33
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.370
Brittney: Um, no, no, not really.

34
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.140
Brittney: I mean,

35
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.570
Brittney: They're giving me a muscle relaxer about four years ago. And I'm just going to take a bunch of person so

36
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:36.810
Brittney: I think I'll just try to breeze through it, you know, just trying to because I feel it's going to make the quality of my life better. Richard Pryor, it does because it's been three weeks.

37
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.990
Brittney: I just hope. Yeah.

38
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's say you're on a little. I don't know. Just remind me and the doc was asking. And I didn't know how much Suboxone you're on right now.

39
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.290
Brittney: point seven five milligrams or

40
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.910
Brittney: They haven't been able to taper much more from

41
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay point seven five.

42
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.290
Brittney: Milligrams yeah yeah I tried. I tried to talk down

43
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.880
Brittney: Working

44
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

45
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:27.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, so obviously outside my lane, but I've certainly seen Dr. Aubrey yell and Dr. Solomon, of whom I there is a group today at noon just it's just information do with it what you will

46
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What they've done is when there's, you know, wrist surgery or gallbladder removal or something's going on. I've watched them use the Suboxone for pain management right you're at such a low dose. The only risky part. Well, not the only let me change the change that.

47
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is then we're revisiting coming back down again which right you've worked really hard for this progress.

48
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.200
Brittney: Yeah, I don't know. I don't want to do that.

49
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.460
Brittney: Sir, I'm just going to try. I mean, people do this every day when the time though so right.

50
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.060
Brittney: And so

51
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm saying all of it, saying that part and then I'm also talking about pain doesn't kill you right. We think it does, because that message coming through.

52
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But we can say this is this is going to help me this pain is a message something if I'm doing something important.

53
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe we can spend some time if if you wanted to.

54
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Do whatever you want today.

55
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But if you want to. We can do some desensitization. Let's say we really do that somatic focus

56
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And we put in some positive imagery and right as she or he is coming in and they're starting these procedures, you're hearing the Clanking of metal, you're

57
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. You're starting to become aware you're pulling in that that old feeling thinking it's going to be like that again.

58
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: But maybe we can kind of weave in some positive imagery, so that you can very much go somewhere and you say, oh, there it is.

59
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then it's okay. And is it more or less, and is it staying the same. What is it doing now, which is very different than

60
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I shouldn't be happening. It shouldn't be happening shouldn't be happening, which is what most people are doing this is, this is awful. I shouldn't have to be in pain. I've been a fan, my whole life. Right. So that's this whole other way of mindset of approaching the relationship to pain.

61
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: What we you what what do you want from, say, oh, we

62
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.790
Can go back to

63
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.670
Brittney: That game plan now. Okay.

64
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So goal shifts relationship to pain this morning. Really, that's kind of the orientation. All right, let's do it.

65
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

66
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.990
Brittney: My mom was pulling in just

67
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it gets

68
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.110
Brittney: Really

69
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not doing trauma history stuff so right.

70
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.540
Good timing.

71
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.370
Brittney: And they're gonna keep forcing

72
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.980
Brittney: Those

73
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey got something to say.

74
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.740
Brittney: Mark

75
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I picked up an overpriced.

76
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, truly. I'm not even say how much it was it was bought at

77
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: The airport. Right.

78
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So it was, it was really expensive, but it's actually, it's cold here.

79
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so he's got this on and and

80
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.200
Brittney: My mom has them in these little jerseys are

81
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.070
Brittney: Fast sweaters. But, but the next keep them from sleeping comfortably because there was

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.580
Brittney: A big like hoodies, he said he's

83
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.050

103
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.610
Gwenevere Abriel: worst pain.

104
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Physical pain you've ever been.

105
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.020

Brittney: Like all pain is different.

108
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:35.970
Brittney: Ways.

109
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:49.110
Brittney: Go to the most pain. I've ever had. It wasn't when I got my finger off getting a tonal removed and getting the shots and your toes pretty horrific.

110
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.730
Well,

111
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.810
Brittney: I went through a ton of really terrible like constipation.

112
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:23.760
Brittney: Yeah, like towards the end there. And then even when I first switched over to the Suboxone that was excruciating Lee painful, like, to the point where I was doing enemas multiple times a day, like

113
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.860
Brittney: Go had to like assist at times like really asked you.

114
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Did we ever give you, um, I forget who because you're not in group, but often did I give you the poop potion that what to take for just on a regular basis.

115
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:51.330
Brittney: I have a tea that works well for me. I tried a bunch of other stuff. And it wasn't working, but the team works very

116
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.210
Brittney: It's easy to drink so

117
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, maybe I'll look it up.

118
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.330
Brittney: And grab it.

123
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, what if we did if those aren't really distinctive from one another. Cut finger off off your finger.

124
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.020
Yeah.

125
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I never even noticed that. Look how clueless. I am

126
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.110
Brittney: People doubt and we're on video, you know, makes it hard.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:09.090
Brittney: Trying to do it or was trying to do a willy of a bike came up and I like push it away from me. The seat and I fell on top of it. Yeah. And I guess my hand went into the chain and it just

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.270
Brittney: But I didn't hurt so bad and

130
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.740

Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, we're gonna get there get there.

135
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So we have the endorphins.

136
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Kicking is that that body new to take care of it. I knew what to do right there. And you also work. It was no trepidation no build up. Hey, I'm not 20 seconds.

137
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's all right that piece. So if we have maybe dirt, by no toenail. How about toenail horrid terrible constipation zero to 10. What are we thinking

138
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.930
Brittney: internal politics.

139
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.810
Brittney: so awful.

140
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: My stomach turns. Every time you say

141
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:19.410
Brittney: I had cut out where the words to you, but one time. The doctor, though the way

142
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.560
Brittney: But yeah, horrible.

143
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: This this this is not like, you know, going into medicine. You don't have to be sure about the number. Just give me one. So we can go to the IUD stuff.

144
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.060
Okay.

145
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.420
Brittney: Let's close this.

146
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go. Oh, so really high. Okay, there we go.

147
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.140
Brittney: Well, I mean, out of as far as like

148
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. Yeah. You know what I've got this this to our squeaking. I'm wondering if yes up I'm going to drop him out. But while I do. It's only takes a second now be thinking about go back to that three year

149
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to think about right maybe giving a number two the psychological anguish of predicted right that future apprehension and if there was any or and then the physical pain. There was probably a press of pressure pain, too, isn't it, right. It's a pole maybe kind of thing.

150
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.470
Brittney: Yeah, it's just like a deep weird

151
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Mood, yeah.

152
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

153
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: See if we can find a number for that one. And I'm going to drop this the shaky animal off here.

154
00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, what do we think

155
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.780
Brittney: I would say

156
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.380
Brittney: Six or seven

157
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Now as you study

158
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.460
Brittney: Something, but the emotional

159
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.040
Brittney: Emotional that like a

160
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:20.910
Brittney: Okay.

161
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You know the story I'm making up about it. I've got one in my head.

162
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.030
Got a little hypothesis.

163
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.720
For you.

164
00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.290
Gwenevere Abriel: The connection between right what an IUD does right what is

165
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.930
Brittney: That whole concept of it, you're

166
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Using it sort of for this byproduct of the emotional right the hormonal regulation piece but like I just wonder if there was a connection to

167
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.330
Brittney: Something else.

168
00:15:53.490 --> 00:16:02.700
Brittney: Yeah, I think it's all, it's all especially because I don't know what's going on with my body right now. So I've just been really stressed out about my mental

169
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So, not knowing

170
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.820
Brittney: Yeah, that's it's hard to

171
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.980
Brittney: To deal with not knowing because then you're just like, constantly speculating so

172
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.020
Brittney: Okay, there's something missing. Don't want to be with

173
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.750
Brittney: Web MD over here.

174
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:28.590
So,

175
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Today,

176
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your

177
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at some some beliefs for a minute.

178
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your belief about yourself when you picture.

179
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's two things. One is going to be this past image right when you

180
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.260
Brittney: Sort of picture that worst moment.

181
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Of three years ago, having an IUD place.

182
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what's your belief about yourself.

183
00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Today, so hold that negative picture, three years ago. And what's your belief about yourself today.

184
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.470
Brittney: No, I don't see a clear

185
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It's okay. Try these are hard. They're hard for everybody to get to try, try, and I am so

186
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.190
Brittney: Pull up from memory nervous.

187
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a feeling

188
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.410
Brittney: And terrified.

189
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Also feeling

190
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:33.510
So let's be

191
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.370
Brittney: Fearful

192
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, feelings. So let's now let's go to a belief about the self. So how about we change the phase two, I believe I am

193
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Never emotion.

194
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.750
Brittney: Oh,

195
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.220
Okay.

196
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: See

197
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You get the concept of like identity. Right.

198
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.510
I'm a good person.

199
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the belief about the self. I'm worthy.

200
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:13.290
Brittney: Week.

201
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.920
Brittney: I'm not so

202
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:24.900
Brittney: Sure. When I think about that moment, I don't feel like I okay a week. Yeah.

203
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:40.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's probably because this week strong are good at these polarities you've brought up before so that that actually might have some some truth to it. So I am weak. See, picture, picture that right

204
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:41.910
Brittney: Your

205
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Where are you, you're laying on a table, kind of, where are you in that

206
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.210
Brittney: Yeah, you know, like a little

207
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.390
Brittney: Thing with your feet and the things

208
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: On loving those moments.

209
00:18:54.330 --> 00:19:00.690
Brittney: SO HORRIBLE. You know, there's just so much negative association with just the table.

210
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:10.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Are there other negative associations with that particular table like that with the strap thing. Are there other history of

211
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:27.300
Brittney: Yeah, I had at one point I got HPV, that was causing some cellular mutations. So they have to go in and like burn those cells off of my cervix. So that sucked.

212
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.860
Brittney: And I got the Gardasil shot to so so much for that.

213
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Sheesh. That's discouraging.

214
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.560
Really thought, though. Yeah.

215
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:46.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so we've got all right, some history in there. And was it effective

216
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.110
Brittney: That treatment. Yeah.

217
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.990
Brittney: As far as I'm aware, I have had a bad Pap smear, so it's okay.

218
00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So uncomfortable experience.

219
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: When they were doing the burning. You could feel it or did they

220
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.870
Brittney: Did they. Yeah, they did shots and then

221
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:16.410
Brittney: What was probably the most painful thing to do a biopsy. So they go in there with like this little basically like a paper.

222
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.690
Brittney: hole punch.

223
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.950
Brittney: You like take a chunk better you that really sucked.

224
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And how long did the suck part, meaning

225
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.100
Brittney: Is just quick but

226
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, like

227
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:40.710
Brittney: It's just, it's such an uncomfortable part of your body. This is like, whoa, this isn't supposed to be happening.

228
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.530
Brittney: What are you doing, and there

229
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Has to be a happy place in there.

230
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.450
Yeah.

231
00:20:51.330 --> 00:21:05.070
Brittney: I don't have happy associations. Now, especially with if I do have endometriosis. There's chances of infertility. It's pretty much a lifelong pain so

232
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:07.440
Brittney: That sucks.

233
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:08.880
Brittney: Though

234
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: That was my hypothesis was that one. That's what I wonder

235
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.430
Brittney: Yeah.

236
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you say my emotional pain attached is 15 I was running this little thing behind my my mind like this because a lot of your stuff. I mean, when I listened to you tell me if this is wrong.

237
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: But your, your, your stuff is hip.

238
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Right here.

239
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:36.090
Brittney: Like

240
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.140
Oh, here.

241
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been sitting here and I'm

242
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:46.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, little, little bit of time anyway that we've been working together, and it's just I keep going.

243
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh, you know, like

244
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Having children.

245
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Not having children.

246
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:57.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Having not

247
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:06.120
Brittney: Yeah, I feel like at some point I want them. I think that option would suck.

248
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, not having the option. Okay.

249
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, just for a second. What would be nice about not having children.

250
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.450
Brittney: No chance to screw up any humans.

251
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:25.710
Brittney: Like from birth.

252
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey,

253
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.150
Brittney: I'm scared about the the world and

254
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:41.970
Brittney: Events that may or may not happen in the future. So, those, those things are positive.

255
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:44.280
Brittney: Yeah.

256
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.450
Gwenevere Abriel: But you, you want the option.

257
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because right maybe your perspective on yourself in the world may change maybe through

258
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:01.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Psychotherapy or you're on self reflection and growth and development and healing.

259
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.090
Gwenevere Abriel: That may change. It'd be nice to have that option.

260
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.160
Brittney: Yeah, okay.

261
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're also missing some information. So you've decided to be what tell me which feelings, you're feeling when you say an emotional edit 15. What are those feelings. I, I know there's some no doubt here, but I really do want to hear your words.

262
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.010
Brittney: I feel I'm lovable.

263
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Really around that.

264
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.490
Yeah.

265
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, you mean like romantically. Is that where you're going with it. Oh.

266
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Dear yeah

267
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.510
Brittney: Now I see why does it seem

268
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.560
Brittney: Like a very social, emotional person that

269
00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:55.860
Brittney: You hear myself complaining about being at the top there's not. No, I'm not.

270
00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.100
Brittney: obsessing

271
00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.570
Brittney: I feel like I'm annoyed with people be talking about it.

272
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not annoying.

273
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Not to me not.

274
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.550
Brittney: Using me for an hour.

275
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:26.070
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also. But it's also a prolific complaint, like I could if I wanted to get annoyed. I could

276
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Write

277
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but instead I hear it as a for me right my worldview. Is there some real messaging going on in that part of your body. That's what I do with it. So what am I going to not listen, not be very clinical

278
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:57.690
Brittney: So what I've been doing for four or five years. I think that was a big A big field for my addiction that I didn't even realize it was trying to avoid feeling

279
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:10.050
Brittney: It made it easier to work out and stuff like I was working out five times a week, even after I quit or in the last month I've struggled to go twice a week.

280
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.490
Brittney: Yeah. Do you

281
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember, you remember the original goal is, we were going to kind of talk about this relationship with pain so

282
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, um, let's get a little history of

283
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.140
Gwenevere Abriel: The earliest time you've had that i'm i'm unlovable.

284
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to force it into a box just see if you can go back to the earliest or most intense memory. You don't have to stay there long. You don't even have to tell me what it is.

285
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.490
Brittney: But how old you associated with pain or just

286
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Know I'm unlovable. I feel unlovable.

287
00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.850
Brittney: I can't remember.

288
00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

289
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:17.190
Brittney: To some degree, um, one of the biggest moments that comes to mind is when my dad basically told me and Haley, that if we could, if we can't fix stuff with our step mom we're going along with her. So he was getting rid of stuff. Just stop saying, guys.

290
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And

291
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.160
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you believe about yourself just now.

292
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do it that

293
00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I know these are hard to get for free.

294
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:35.490
But

295
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.690
Gwenevere Abriel: He did that he said that I

296
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.350
Brittney: wanted my mobile

297
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.100
Yeah.

298
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you see that as a young girl what you did, or whatever age. Right. I think you were much younger. Right.

299
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.950

Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to know more of

457
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.640
Brittney: Just want to know what's

458
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:15.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're getting information from professionals, let's get those appointments, but this piece about

459
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: The explanation of why pain is necessary.

460
00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You think you have enough just as necessary for what, what's it necessary for

461
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.890
Brittney: biologics terms of keeping yourself.

462
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: And without it, which I did not stay alive.

463
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.390
Brittney: Likely

464
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.800
Brittney: More likely, uh huh.

465
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go with this pain helps me stay alive.

466
00:44:54.090 --> 00:45:00.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to pull this future fear you have up this one in the future. That's coming up.

467
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Pain keeps me alive.

468
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:18.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing in a specifically nice deep belly. Because if you're blowing up a balloon down in their belly out

469
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: A future worst image you're holding in your imagination, you're projecting into the future picturing Oh dear. And then there's pain it's necessary to keep me alive.

470
00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Speed it up a little bit.

471
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's breathe into your inhale.

472
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And then exhale, it all out.

473
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your belief about

474
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:29.820
Brittney: Yourself.

475
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: In your relationship to me. I am

476
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I am weak and how true is that from one to 10 today.

477
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:50.310
Brittney: Spectrum.

478
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: On the I'm weak or I'm

479
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:55.350
Brittney: unlovable one

480
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.600
Brittney: Week, because

481
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:05.310
Brittney: I feel like I've gone through a lot when it comes to my body.

482
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.110
Brittney: I'll be okay.

483
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.480
Brittney: All parts.

484
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.250
Brittney: Pretty high

485
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's not emotional and that's that.

486
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: 15 minute

487
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:29.520
Brittney: Scared that it's gonna isolate me from having family or future

488
00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I get it. So,

489
00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you um

490
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you witnessed

491
00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: what love is. I mean, do you have a pretty good grasp on on what what unconditional love looks like because you've gotten so much conditional love that thing. What I did was, oh

492
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: So conditional

493
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Painful

494
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that's why I'm saying in here if you just so I'm going to say it, you decide to say fuck you want to hear. I don't believe a word you're saying I'm paying you to say this nonsense to me.

495
00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: How I feel about you isn't going to change.

496
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:23.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You may leave me, you probably will. You'll get up and you just stop, most people do is walk away, but how I feel about

497
00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: My beliefs and you will not change.

498
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:35.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you, you may not believe me, because who am I am over here, you're over there, but I know that to be true because plenty of people have

499
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This stuff you guys go through it's I wish you'd stick around, you know, for a couple of years and see it through.

500
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So you could see yourself on the other side. What unconditional love looks like.

501
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not based on what you do. You're exceptional

502
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because you were born.

503
00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: You're beautiful and lovable and wonderful because you're human. You know, it's one of the, I think the reasons why you like that.

504
00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Mother Earth stuff. It's like

505
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:17.610
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just linearly clear and just, there's no mixture. There's no condition to it.

506
00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.560
Brittney: Just is

507
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It just is. That's right. And you're a part of it.

508
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: We have to go there when the people in our life didn't, didn't do the bare minimum. We're supposed to get about 30% of a reasonably good parenting and I don't know that you caught just enough of it.

509
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So unfortunately, or whatever.

510
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to do that growing. Now, you can do it together. Eventually you're going to maybe absorb. What's going on in here. It'll you'll own it.

511
00:49:52.110 --> 00:50:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll own your, your little therapist inside this unconditional love and you'll pull in this nature thing and it is you are a part of that.

512
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And this body does have wisdom and when you keep denying it, and rejecting it and saying stop hurting me. And I don't want to have this pain anymore. Why bother why resisting

513
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:21.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Resisting the fact that it knows what it's doing lean into it. Try and understand its message.

514
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Because maybe on the other side of it will be

515
00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:45.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Something you and I have no idea. I want to go on that journey with you and find out because that that that abdomen area and your parenting and you know endometriosis and to me, they're all like, I think they're connected, you know, and, um,

516
00:50:48.540 --> 00:51:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you really ready to have children and have a family or first, do you want to be your own parent and love yourself and know what unconditional love is the for you right bring a family. So let's do that.

517
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: First

518
00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:10.530
Brittney: Here.

519
00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: And. But really, that was very honest right and so now as we kind of come what let's do some processing near the end of the session here. Let's go to

520
00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember what you said earlier you said you know what, maybe he said lower end, you said on the I'm weak through. It's like, what, like a two or three or one or something.

521
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.050
So,

522
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:36.750
Brittney: It's all over.

523
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.160
Brittney: Maybe a three.

524
00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.690
Brittney: finalists week just get up now.

525
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you also said something else in here. He said, I've, I've gotten through

526
00:51:55.020 --> 00:52:04.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Really difficult me dude he lost a finger you had your tone helpful to off you've actually gotten through it's actually, it's the opposite. Your

527
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:12.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Your tolerance for pain is actually pretty high. Your, your strength or however you're working it

528
00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know whether you've been getting it bounced off of other people often enough to hear how how strong you are

529
00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:32.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes a lot to keep persevering when you have this much intense emotional triggering going on. Takes a lot every day.

530
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:46.410
Gwenevere Abriel: But you see, you have to put that thought in the front. I'm in my strength look again this morning, I met this emotion I sat with it.

531
00:52:47.370 --> 00:53:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, those are some memories. Those are some images, that's me projecting in the future. I am strong. I'm going to meet them with these skills with these resources. It's very different than why me it's helpless in line me, isn't it.

532
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.830
Brittney: Yeah, it doesn't get you there.

533
00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.170
Brittney: I mean, I still go there sometimes.

534
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.980
Brittney: Especially if I'm like in the middle of a flare up you know

535
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.420
I know

536
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: You got to start to ask yourself, is that solution, why me. Is it helping or does it just feed that negative network with more reasons of your helplessness that you got the right into this deal

537
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I haven't seen anybody get motivated behind those those kind of gatherings, what I've seen. Be useful is when they say

538
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just going to have me really down on myself really negative. I've got to put those aside that thought stopping dead. I'm going to use my skills that get me back into strength, get me back into a positive mindset.

539
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I did not grow up with unconditional love. This is just freaking harder for me than the than the guy next door. So I've got to really use this and this and this, a little harder.

540
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:23.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't know the other guy next door has these other challenges we humans living. It's hard. It's exciting and beautiful and amazing but it's hard to

541
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: It's hard, even with the best of parents and privilege, it's still hard

542
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:29.880
Brittney: Yeah.

543
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you said. Pain is pain right

544
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotional Pain.

545
00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:44.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Is the way I'm told is experienced in the same place part of the brain as physical pain. It feels awful.

546
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:46.920
You know,

547
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: self compassion.

548
00:54:54.150 --> 00:55:00.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Really, where, where, where have you been a witness to that to somebody really saying, Boy,

549
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're really hard on yourself.

550
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Why are you doing after you know somebody who really saw

551
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:09.720
Like

552
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.150
Brittney: My friends,

553
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.850
Brittney: On Christmas. So if I'm

554
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:28.500
Brittney: If I like apologize for, you know, dragging on about a topic or something you know they reassured me that I have a lot going on that most people don't have to deal with.

555
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: It's true. It's true. And again, one of the things you're missing out as is hearing other people you know in group tell you that are hearing like oh my gosh

556
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not alone in this. But I'm glad you have your friends pointing that out to you, and I hope you've heard me say it to you have a lot coming at

557
00:55:48.990 --> 00:56:03.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It. I know it sounds and it's and I don't mean to insult your intelligence or other people's but we're literally reinforcing and it's growing what we think about that network, literally, you're making more synaptic

558
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Connections.

559
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: We sit there in that whatever thought it's getting bigger.

560
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got to hurry up. Not going over to the side and remember what we did today.

561
00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm spend time building that so there's more tissue growth. It's tissue growth.

562
00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:31.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, those synapses, the dendrites, the whole deal. It gets a grows when we sit there we go. Okay.

563
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm strong. This is how I'm strong. Most people don't even go through this I'm going through this. Look, what I'm doing. I'm breathing through it and focusing on the positive

564
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm using my resources. I'm using imagery. What can I do right now that's consistent with my values.

565
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:52.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I can go

566
00:56:54.060 --> 00:57:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: put lotion on my hands. I can go eat something nutritious, I can stretch instead of overtaxing my body. I can rest.

567
00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:16.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I can look at something beautiful. I can paint. I can write, I can read, I can spend time with people that that fuel my soul, and my spirit and stay away from toxicity. I can plan my future. I can save money.

568
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That's getting in your solution.

569
00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me, tell me what what you noticed about today for you.

570
00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:32.370
Brittney: I like the imagery. I got when you're talking about referring to. She froze.

571
00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:36.450
Brittney: positive versus negative, you know,

572
00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. That's, that's a good thing for me to know

573
00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he's like the science.

574
00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:42.630
Part

575
00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:48.900
Brittney: Yeah, but I feel like I feel like since we've started to go straight towards

576
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:54.570
Brittney: More imagery them over analyzing what you're saying.

577
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:59.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But good, but that imagery is it is um

578
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a different part right your we

579
00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.270
Brittney: Feel like it's been pretty beneficial. Yeah.

580
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And as

581
00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:11.490
Brittney: For what go

582
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.610
Brittney: Along with a going

583
00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:18.180
Brittney: Like a dark place, getting brighter instead of

584
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Darker. Yes.

585
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And with that bright

586
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: The shame.

587
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Dies.

588
00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:33.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't exist with all that light that's that and and

589
00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it's so worth the effort that it takes to go there in the brain. I know the automatic is going to go to that, how what F and why me. I know it's automatic.

590
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:49.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm glad you're going to imagery. I'm really glad

591
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And hearing my voice in there too. Like what would she do, what would she say

592
00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:08.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Over time, that will become probably a part of your adult self. If we go to sort of psychoanalysis, they'll be parent there's adults in the child self.

593
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That will start to really grow, they can modulate the rules of of right and wrong and community and the creative and impulsive maybe

594
00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: needs of the child. They adults starting to grow the one that can can take care of both aspects but that's kind of the idea. When do you want to meet again because I think you're able to do it weekly now right

595
00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.400
Yeah.

599
00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right, right. Well, I did. Tuck aside on March 5 which is you just can't believe that that's next week.

600
00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:57.540
Brittney: Yeah, goes way too quick.

00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But yeah, I put my penciled in your name seven o'clock on a Thursday.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.900
Brittney: Okay, awesome. All right.

603
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you need his medication. I think when were you thinking of going in.

604
01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.100
Brittney: I think I'm gonna trigger Monday.

605
01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's march 2 I'm gonna put

606
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Cool. All right. I will see you then.

607
01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Be good to have you.

608
01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Bye.

609
01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

610
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's do sound check and video checks and how we're doing. Check, check, check, check, check, check. Yeah, you look good, sound good. I'm going to grab one more layer.

611
01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:53.670
Freezing

612
01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.810
It's actually cold here.

613
01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And how's the environment over there, meaning. Are you feeling comfortable and to talk and do some work today.

614
01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:13.770
Yeah, okay.

615
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you have a sense of where you want to start. Or you want me to kind of take the lead.

616
01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.820
Magan: I mean, I don't know where we're supposed to pick up. I know we're supposed to work on stuff. So I'm just gonna

617
01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: You want me to take charge

618
01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

619
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So what

620
01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:52.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Emotions just in the last, like, half hour. Have you been going through, though. Let me just get touch.

621
01:01:56.190 --> 01:02:07.500
Magan: Well, I had some anxiety because I had to deal with my I'm dealing with power struggle with my boss, the women. I had to file the investigation on. Yeah.

622
01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:15.210
Magan: She gave up lost and found and I stepped up and I said that I would like to take on that responsibility.

623
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.950
Magan: And hopes that it would show that I'm taking initiative and then I want to

624
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:22.110
Magan: Move up

625
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.040
Magan: But Lost and Found was hers before that.

626
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:38.730
Magan: But she gave it up. She wasn't she didn't want anymore. And as soon as she found out that I had it. She was not happy about it and she said that she felt that I hadn't been here long enough and

627
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:41.940
Magan: She didn't want me to get

628
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:51.570
Magan: The overtime hours which we go to drop the items off that gets sold into the auction. So she told me that she would be

629
01:02:53.640 --> 01:03:11.190
Magan: She would be dropping the items off not asking me not telling me or not requesting it of me. She told me, and then she just sent me an email saying it looks like you got it all. I didn't ask her to go over my work, I know I got it all. I know I did it fine because I triple check work.

630
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:30.840
Magan: And I essentially just told her. No, thank you. I got it covered. And she's very pissed off about that. And then I drove home and I logged in with right art, not a really big fan of the lady that I talked to, they're really not like are very much

631
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:38.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Lord, Lord, so maybe Lord has a baby. Oh, Jamie.

632
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:40.170
Name.

633
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:41.820
Magan: Yeah.

634
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You're, you're a couple of people have said that. I wonder if she needs to retrain and or some

635
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.690
Magan: She's very rude. Very, very rude and she doesn't have any

636
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.540
Magan: People skills.

637
01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

638
01:03:56.310 --> 01:04:05.670
Magan: Or customer service skills and she's antagonistic. And so she pisses me off last time I talked to her. She goes, excuse me, excuse me.

639
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.650
Magan: I need to talk.

640
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.440
Magan: And I'm like, which

641
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.480
Magan: I don't care if you need to talk or not.

642
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.090
Magan: I'm not here for you. I'm here for me.

643
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah, you need a therapist for that.

644
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:33.180
Magan: Yeah, if you need to talk to take it up. Somebody else because you're getting paid. So you're providing me a service, not the other way around. That's

645
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:38.190
Magan: Okay, yeah, she's rude and I don't like her, and she really really

646
01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:45.480
Magan: When I log in, she she sets me off. She, she sets me off.

647
01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah okay so

648
01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I wrote it down.

649
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:51.750
Magan: And

650
01:04:51.990 --> 01:05:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Quick validation, you're not the only one. I'm definitely making note of it. Let's go back to the power struggle with, let me have the players here. Um, who's, who's the woman you filed the complaint against and the one that you're in this power struggle with.

651
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.470
Magan: The investigation.

652
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:21.360
Magan: I found that against Sydney. She is a supervisor, one of my supervisors, but she's not my direct supervisor, but I used to be on night shift with her. She's the one that called me the little girl and everything.

653
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.720
Magan: So I thought that investigation against her, and then

654
01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.920
Magan: Like I said, I took over. Lost and Found and she's not happy about it. Okay.

655
01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So anxious

656
01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:41.910
Magan: More of just, I don't want any

657
01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:45.450
Magan: Conflict. I just want to go home.

658
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:50.160
Magan: I'm, I'm really anticipating her

659
01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:01.950
Magan: her neck or negativity her next move towards me her

660
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:08.370
Magan: She, she she wants to control every aspect and

661
01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:14.940
Magan: She doesn't have it right now. And it's bothering her. It's very apparent that it's bothering her

662
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:24.390
Magan: It bothered her that I filed a complaint against her. It bothered her that she found out that I am

663
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:29.250
Magan: The one who took over. Lost and Found it bothers her that

664
01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.570
Magan: It was bad or sure anything to do with me bothers her

665
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:36.120
Okay.

666
01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:44.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a look at power struggle. I think that was pretty cool that you that you labeled it

667
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.690
Magan: It's a power struggle because

668
01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:53.130
Magan: I'm tired of being walked all over. I'm tired of being

669
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:58.470
Magan: Silenced I'm tired of be

670
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:10.830
Magan: Placed into a box or a place because I am beneath her in her eyes and just because she is a supervisor.

671
01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:19.980
Magan: Does not mean that I don't have a voice and it does not mean that I'm not right or that I'm not capable or that I'm not

672
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:23.010
Magan: Just as qualified as she is

673
01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Is there any margin.

674
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:42.030
Gwenevere Abriel: For since you're not as rehearsed at speaking your truth daily 20 3040 times a day since you're not as rehearsed at it as you've been

675
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, a kid and an adult, since it's sort of this new territory for you.

676
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: That there might be

677
01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: An over

678
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.330
Magan: There might. Yes, I see what you mean.

679
01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:06.090
Magan: Because

680
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:21.030
Magan: I'm really trying very hard to set boundaries with her and let her know especially after everything that's happened, then I'm not someone to be fucked with. I'm not going to

681
01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:30.510
Magan: Just sit quiet and deal with it like I did for over a year. Okay, so that's my problem. So I'm

682
01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, this is the one we've been in we've been in this one in this moment in this discussion with different players on the stage, many times. And I think it's going to continue to be our work.

683
01:08:47.610 --> 01:08:50.880
Magan: So, did you want to work on em Dr today.

684
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:55.830
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter what we do, we're going to, we're going to get to the same place.

685
01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Because what you're talking about me.

686
01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:02.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't fuck with me.

687
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Is something

688
01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That you go to

689
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you do not want to be victimized.

690
01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:15.060
Magan: I don't. And it's but it's a two way.

691
01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: To extreme

692
01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:20.340
Magan: Yeah, it's a to a very exactly it's it's

693
01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.220
Magan: Very excessive.

694
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that's all we need. You just have that self awareness.

695
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And loud and clear.

696
01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to remove it from your toolbox.

697
01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It's yours forever fighting

698
01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.270
Gwenevere Abriel: For your safety.

699
01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Glad you have it.

700
01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just want to add options.

701
01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:52.770
Magan: Am I am safe.

702
01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You are unsafe to be Sydney's friend.

703
01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:07.140
Gwenevere Abriel: You're unsafe to tell her plans that you have unless it's, you know,

704
01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:24.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Part of a work responsibility to report to her. She's an unsafe person to brainstorm with she's an unsafe person to collaborate me if you have to. Okay, fine, but I would be as content driven as possible. You do understand that.

705
01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:27.690
Magan: That

706
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's you, setting a boundary with your eyes and your ears and your big brain you analyzed this woman has shown herself to be untrustworthy.

707
01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Period. It has taken MONTHS AND WE PROBABLY KNEW IT IN immediately, but then back to back to back. Evidence of on trustworthiness.

708
01:10:52.140 --> 01:11:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's put a pin in power and power struggle. Let's just say those are facts. That's right. Now we're in a boundary self awareness. Self validation conversation. You saw it. You watched it. You saw it again and again and again and again.

709
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

710
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: The

711
01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Boundary setting that your style, right, is if I'm not going to be a victim. I'm going to be a

712
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:23.880
Magan: force to be reckoned with.

713
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: A persecutor not a perpetrator, but it's it's this thinking about this, um, you know, that drama triangle right

714
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:50.070
Gwenevere Abriel: We go from victim to rescuer persecutor than to victim right there too intense there to polarized and they're too rigid and we've got to shift. So if we're in

715
01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.950
Gwenevere Abriel: For example, I know. Victims, victims, not, not at not an option for you.

716
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:57.480
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's exciting.

717
01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: But persecutor isn't a great one either. Nor is the absolute need to be rescuing people right because it put someone

718
01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.040
Magan: In another problem, like all of those I've done

719
01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:16.860
Magan: Them and I fall into one of those categories at one point in time or another.

720
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and and but it's it's cool that you can recognize it, because there is an opt out for each one of those. So

721
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I'm not going to pull up the screen. We'll see if we can put what you're talking about. And yes, we can do some em Dr with it, possibly, let's just let me just looking this network, a little bit further. So, um, let's talk a little bit about options that you can have for

722
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:49.530
Gwenevere Abriel: setting boundaries where the needle right isn't

723
01:12:51.240 --> 01:13:03.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, psychological and physical victimization right emotional victimization. It's also not I'm going to lose my job because I popped off on someone, you know, those are real extreme right punch somebody in the nose. Plenty of people do that.

724
01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, you know, it's kind of like we want to get this year. Like here we want to get get that needle. Just a little, little up

725
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is one way to get there. Do you see in yourself, the grain of truth of your need to be in control.

726
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:38.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so there's there's some awareness there. So in that space when, if you can hold on to that instead of, How dare she that's where the needle moves.

727
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:40.770
Magan: Well, there's some manipulation for me to

728
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so then you on that.

729
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:46.080
Magan: I mean, I'm a little vindictive

730
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.400
Magan: I'm not gonna lie I am right now. Right now I feel like

731
01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.460
Magan: Yeah, I know.

732
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:00.930
Magan: Okay.

733
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So if that is true. Number one,

734
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, it's really powerful that you can that you can say, you can say okay I i I've been vindictive and I'm going to show her I'll show her the pain. I was in. I'll show her. I want her to feel I felt I want her

735
01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:22.710
Magan: I don't know if it's to that degree.

736
01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:23.640
Magan: Okay, so

737
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.570
Magan: It was more

738
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.200
Of

739
01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:30.150
Magan: I want to show her that I am just as capable

740
01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:34.500
Magan: As she is I want to show her that

741
01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:38.940
Magan: I am not a little girl. I am a grown woman.

742
01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:42.330
Magan: That I can handle myself professionally.

743
01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:44.250
Magan: That I can

744
01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.480
Magan: Be the bigger person that I can

745
01:14:51.360 --> 01:15:07.080
Magan: make the right choices. I can look she's looking for problems in my work like I put in a call yesterday and she as a supervisor. They pick up the line and they listen to your calls. Yeah, he has a bad habit of just starting to talk while you're on the phone.

746
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:22.470
Magan: To the person that you're talking to. And so at that point I will hang up the phone and she'd be like, did you hear that other like, well, you listen you took the call over you start speaking so I hung up and let you handle it because you began to speak to that person.

747
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:32.940
Magan: It's a conflict and there's missing information when that happens. So I just let her do that but I put in a call yesterday, and it was at alpha three

748
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:49.440
Magan: And she said, before she even open the call because she was dispatching at that time. And I took the call before she even opened it up and read it. She said you didn't put the call, you didn't put the location in and I turned to her and I said, Yes, I did.

749
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:56.580
Magan: And then I said, I can also put it in the info tab if if necessary.

750
01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:01.410
Magan: But it just right there.

751
01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:12.540
Magan: Right there in her saying that it's her trying to number one find problems in my work number to put me in a place, put me

752
01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:17.910
Magan: Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me I'm inadequate she does it to me constantly

753
01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, sending

754
01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to be seen by Sydney as capable

755
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Of I put women versus not a little girl you want Sydney to see you as capable, a woman in a as a bigger person. Hold on. Why, and so in the back of my head. Right. Hmm, Cindy.

756
01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me ask you something. Is she your hero.

757
01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.190
Magan: No, it's because she's in a

758
01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:58.200
Magan: position of power. She's also sleeping with the boss.

759
01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:01.710
Magan: Which is a conflict of interest.

760
01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: We already agree it's a mess.

761
01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's an hour. Yeah.

762
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. So his ear so above her. This is a, this is a a means to getting this fellow above her whose name is there sleeping together. What's his name.

763
01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Chris, it's a means to get chris chris to see you as capable

764
01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: As an employee.

765
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:31.500
Magan: Is that right at you, but I think there's more to it.

766
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:33.750
Magan: There's more there like

767
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.530
Magan: It's not just, Chris. It's also her, but I don't know why.

768
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so right. That's why we're talking about it. So we're going to take Sydney here.

769
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: And Sydney let's describe her instead of, of what we do see we let's do some some adjectives for her.

770
01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.840
Magan: Like, what do you mean like

771
01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Immature vindictive retaliatory

772
01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:11.280
Magan: Small idea here, small minded immature than addictive spiteful

773
01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:14.820
Magan: Controlling okay

774
01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:19.530
Gwenevere Abriel: She's in appropriate she's having an

775
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:23.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Inappropriate sexual relationship. She shouldn't be doing that. I mean,

776
01:18:24.570 --> 01:18:26.010
Magan: Yeah, inappropriate.

777
01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:28.530
Magan: She's

778
01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:32.640
Magan: Control controlling

779
01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I

780
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:38.940
Magan: Mean unprofessional.

781
01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:42.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I thought so too unprofessional. So I heard some stories. Okay.

782
01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's just a few. So here we go. Listen, I want you to picture Sydney

783
01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Think she's done that we're controlling things she's done and we're unprofessional in mature.

784
01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Inappropriate you know she's called you that little girl thing totally doesn't belong there.

785
01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And me.

786
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want you to go into your own family of origin and I want you to picture.

787
01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Who behave like that.

788
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:21.660
Magan: It just got real, real quick.

789
01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.350
Gwenevere Abriel: That's why they call it therapy.

790
01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:30.990
Magan: Coming.

791
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.360
Magan: My father. Yeah, okay, my mother.

792
01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:41.430
Magan: My brother.

793
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:45.570
Magan: also probably be the top three

794
01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:48.000
Magan: My husband.

795
01:19:49.860 --> 01:20:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So if I'm you, Megan, this is, this is my, this is, this is what's going to take all the energy in my life and I'm going to keep pulling this story in until I fix it and get it right and heal.

796
01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.060
Magan: Okay.

797
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I recognize you. You're just like my family. If I can get you to see me.

798
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything will be okay. Again, I'll heal. I'm going to keep you around this. This is familiar. Yeah, I need you you you to see me love me value me

799
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:46.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Why, then, then I will see myself as capable, but it's got to look like, Mom, dad, brother husband you

800
01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, someone who's sweet and kind

801
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And doesn't have any of those attributes those negative attributes those qualities from from your childhood.

802
01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Unconsciously you may be minimizing their value.

803
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to hear it from these if you can get it from them.

804
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.000
Magan: Then that's right

805
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Because this is where the wounding occurred. Say it again. Right. I was wounded by these fucked up kind of people. And so I need to heal myself with these fucked up. People don't quote that believes. Don't put that in the transcription

806
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:30.720
Magan: There's somebody listening.

807
01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:33.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Not right now. But she said Sarah.

808
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So I know that I want me swearing, I don't know, was with on the big square and this organization, but I anyway so

809
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:54.840
Magan: I think if the clientele is okay with swearing and is I swear it's a good way to communicate. Yeah.

810
01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:56.760
Magan: swear a lot

811
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let me see if it works, though.

812
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:01.260
Magan: It pissed me off.

813
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.140
Magan: You know, right.

814
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:19.830
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's because naturally we want to heal. If our listen if our wound was interpersonal our healing will be interpersonal

815
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: It's all it took was reading a self help book called by your little self. Okay, fine, but it isn't. You want to feel it looking into another person's eyes. These people you keep bringing in your life are like mother, father, brother there invalidating and appropriate mean

816
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:44.400
Magan: How. How. Okay. So, these people are around the no matter what.

817
01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.470
Magan: In my day to day

818
01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:55.470
Magan: But I know that I am choosing to engage and that's where I set myself up for the for that.

819
01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:58.620
Magan: For that context to keep happening.

820
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you have to do if this is news to you right now if this is like an aha moment if it's true. If this hypothesis. I'm throwing out is true.

821
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:09.480
Magan: It's true.

822
01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If it is, right, because I always hold that room for them. I'm no genius, but let's say it is then

823
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:21.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not a kid.

824
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:39.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You're getting new information you're learning new information not only sort of self reflection, you know, sort of how to use cognitive reframing and imagery and breath work and grounding and resourcing you've got these new skills coming online.

825
01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:43.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't have them when you were little.

826
01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:49.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Those people like you just said they're going to keep showing up a hot mess you changing

827
01:23:51.390 --> 01:24:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Will be the healing experience they're going to continue to be a mess. But you are an adult, you are not that child anymore without resources.

828
01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You have them.

829
01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:19.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It is the one you go to, because you have this grown physical body is you go to don't fuck with me and I get it, and I don't want you to get rid of it. It's yours forever. But there's other ways to be

830
01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:23.220
Gwenevere Abriel: The don't put you right. It's such a

831
01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:25.110
Magan: Polarity state.

832
01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:27.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Such a clarity so

833
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If we stop asking why we already have an answer that's good enough to cover the why, for now it's and if we stop saying why me why I'm drawing these people in if we stop going to that sort of fantasy, then we just say

834
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: This is my classroom. Am I going to learn this lesson, this time. And I know that's gets annoying because you guys hear from me a lot, but

835
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.580
It's not

836
01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Then when yeah

837
01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:57.270
So,

838
01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: This has to do with

839
01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are interested in not being in a power struggle with the Sydney's of the world.

840
01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:18.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And not feel like a doormat. What you got an idea.

841
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:20.700
Magan: I did something

842
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:25.290
Magan: With a power struggle moment.

843
01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.170
Magan: I was

844
01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:34.380
Magan: Power struggling with Andrew

845
01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:43.110
Magan: And I literally stopped like mid sentence. And I told him.

846
01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.870
Magan: I'm going to

847
01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.650
Magan: Take a break from this conversation.

848
01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:54.300
Magan: This is going this is going

849
01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.320
Magan: Nowhere quickly and it's

850
01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:09.840
Magan: Only as I don't know the exact words, but I said right I am done with with this conversation and I stopped it. And I walked away.

851
01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.530
Magan: And it was like made fucking screaming match.

852
01:26:14.010 --> 01:26:14.460
Mm hmm.

853
01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.510
Magan: Yeah, and I thought he was going to slip into fucking shot.

854
01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.220
Magan: But I did it. Yeah.

855
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:26.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You stopped it. You stop mid screaming

856
01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:33.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It can be stopped, we can catch ourselves in it and shift gears.

857
01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:36.510
Magan: But

858
01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:53.550
Magan: He's that dynamic is different than someone like a Sydney Sydney is not an interpersonal relationship. Yes. Like I don't I yes and no. I don't mean but like I might have accepted her, and I'm not married to her and

859
01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:57.330
Magan: I don't have to live with her. I have to work with her.

860
01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You probably spend a lot of time in that place.

861
01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So, well, what

862
01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:05.610
Magan: One more time with them and I do with my family. Yeah.

863
01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:23.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's talk about I need, what would I need to take a break. What would opt out look like with a Sydney. So let's, let's get, let's get into that and just hear what you could do if you weren't trying to show her

864
01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:39.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, in other words, you be the teacher, she will be the student, because that's kind of what's happening in a power strip lie, you'll teach her. You are going to change her real changes organization. You'll to do that. But if that's not what you're up to.

865
01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: If you say, well, okay, you're just going to be what you're going to be all protect my rights and you move forward and you've you file this this grievance and complain, etc. You've taken care of it. That part is already on moving forward, but the day to day moments.

866
01:27:58.170 --> 01:28:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: When you make a decision. So let's just hear some content from you.

867
01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an example.

868
01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:04.680
I

869
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:06.180
Actually

870
01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.310
I could

871
01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:20.430
Magan: Instead of like when she's talking to me, or she, she talks at me, and she talks down to me. She doesn't talk to me and she does not listen to me.

872
01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:29.880
Magan: But I'm always quick to respond very quick like I need to attack, attack, attack, attack, attack because you're attacking me

873
01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:44.850
Magan: Yeah, I'm coming up with a response. So I too am not listening because I'm always thinking of a response before she even don't getting the words out of her mouth. Okay, so I know I'm not actively listening, either because I choose not to.

874
01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:56.910
Magan: Because she lost that right with me. That's how I personally feel, but what I could do instead of trying to submit an answer before she even gets the word out.

875
01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:01.020
Magan: I could do that, pausing exercise.

876
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.360
Magan: That we worked with

877
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm fine. I could just you breathe and you, you just sit here.

878
01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:16.110
Magan: And I don't have to respond right now. There's no reason in the world why I have to respond right now.

879
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so right in there. You notice how your finger away right now so you can find your defiance in there.

880
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:27.420
Magan: Even that

881
01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's good. It's a good thing. It's a

882
01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Instead of showing I'm smart by I have this really quick really content driven fact, and I'm going to say it quickly and throw it in your face and make you feel as small as you're trying to make me feel

883
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that's the power struggle.

884
01:29:52.470 --> 01:30:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to opt out of that. If you want to play with this and say maybe my power is going to come from the quiet serenity of me not having to prove myself is the next step.

885
01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one where you walk away.

886
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: From your husband. That's the one where you are quiet with a Sydney where you're like,

887
01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you're breathing and they said, what do you what

888
01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You say I'm I'm listening to what you're saying. It sounds like it's a really important issue for you.

889
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:37.980
Magan: And you can validate, you know, expecting a response.

890
01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Who cares that so here's, here's the off the

891
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch sorry is

892
01:30:47.610 --> 01:31:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: That what you're doing is my is my mind reading you are analyzing so many, so many people do this it's automatic. And I know it's a protective mechanism but

893
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: All that analysis you do i i'm i know you can tell I know what the next move is what I'm supposed to say what I'm supposed to do what her and underlying intentions, is what the little conniving thing she's doing. And I know what you may all know all of that.

894
01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:21.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's none of your business.

895
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, take that in

896
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning, she wants to have that game going on that's her business. I've already told you you protect yourself with boundaries. She ain't going to be your friend.

897
01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to brainstorm and probably won't sign on the project with her.

898
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to continue to be doing that and your role is just to if you want to opt out.

899
01:31:51.030 --> 01:32:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: turn all of that you yeah if you want, you turn that skill of analysis that you're going over on her side and trying to figure out what she's up to turn it in here.

900
01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.240
Magan: I can you give me some exam.

901
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I can

902
01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:10.500
Magan: So I'm constantly thinking like, this is why she doing this. This is what he's doing.

903
01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:12.690
Magan: Because of it.

904
01:32:13.050 --> 01:32:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Up Sydney and attack me and all the you

905
01:32:16.890 --> 01:32:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: attack me

906
01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:29.940
Magan: You know what, Megan, I was looking over Lost and Found and we didn't know okay job but next time you need to be looking at the Salvation Army received so that they can sign it and

907
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:35.040
Magan: I'll go ahead and I'll take the control items down to Andrew. I'll take care of

908
01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:36.960
You

909
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:44.550
Magan: But I don't want her to, I want to say.

910
01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:48.090
Magan: Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

911
01:32:51.570 --> 01:32:52.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, hold on.

912
01:32:54.150 --> 01:33:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want her to is this part of this word I'm the vindictive part because you want the position you want the credit you want people to see you as capable of doing that job.

913
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:29.880
Magan: Yeah, cuz I I stepped up and I volunteered. And I'm not getting extra pay for it. I'm not getting anything for it. I'm just trying to show initiative and it's not just for her, it's for everybody. My up my higher ups everybody to see that I am capable to. Okay, I can do this.

914
01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm going to stick with Sydney for a second because we did member you back down and said, I think there's something going on with the Sydney level we so we're going to skip the higher ups. We're back down at Sydney. So just now. It was really easy. I was just like, well, thank you.

915
01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now this is this is the therapy piece. This is not the elevate myself professionally piece.

916
01:33:57.810 --> 01:34:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: This, this, there's some nuance to this role that I don't quite understand because

917
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:23.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you pick it because you know she's going to see you doing it and you just you picked one where she's gonna you sir. Okay, so why that one, why not show show your capability to command and in a different area. Why pick her her thing that she's doing

918
01:34:25.650 --> 01:34:32.940
Magan: So she gave it up because she's she went to day shift and and she specifically through it on the night shift supervisor.

919
01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:41.340
Magan: And he really expressed his frustration and how he didn't want it at all, but she also she washed your hands of it.

920
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:49.890
Magan: I had been trying for over a year to try to step up volunteer myself for things

921
01:34:50.550 --> 01:35:06.810
Magan: Try to let it be known that I'd like to trade take training that I want to be a supervisor that I want to go to the pre management class and none of those things are within my grasp. So when I volunteered for this. Well, actually I asked for first

922
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Class, you know,

923
01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:26.340
Magan: Who I asked my direct supervisor, Josh. And he said, We got to talk to Chris about it. I'm okay with it. I think you're fully capable. But let's talk to Chris. So I went directly to Chris and I spoke with him. I told him that I really liked this opportunity and

924
01:35:28.170 --> 01:35:47.880
Magan: He said, I appreciate you volunteering and thank you for taking the initiative and that was it. And it wasn't for her. But I will say this, since I got it. That then fictive feeling of hahaha

925
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:57.480
Magan: Has come up towards her now because I see how much it bothers her that I haven't. I see how much it bothers her

926
01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.940
Magan: She didn't want the responsibility. We weren't but she definitely didn't want me to have it.

927
01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go back to the peace with Chris. Let's leave, leave Sydney out of this for a second. Did you go back. I mean, what if I were you, I'd be like, Okay. Does this have to be in a formal

928
01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Statement. Does it have to be in a change of my job responsibilities, what I want, I want some accountability on it. And I want to show you some consistent demonstration that I've taken on this this role.

929
01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Do I need to tell some people do you need to tell some people what I don't get. Megan is why it just ended the way it ended. Like I would want to know.

930
01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Should I tell people this is my new job thing. Like, where does it go from here, it feels fuzzy

931
01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:53.490
Magan: It was fuzzy. So when I took it on. He said, Yes, you can have the responsibility of it which means now. My name is literally on Lost and Found

932
01:36:54.150 --> 01:37:09.180
Magan: And I'm like, literally all the paperwork that is done. I do it. The key to the cabinet to put all the items away is mine. And I'm talking like big responsibility. There's thousands of dollars going through that place.

933
01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:18.210
Magan: Jewelry with diamonds people leaving iPads laptops. Okay. Anything you can name in the airport. It goes to me.

934
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so when when

935
01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it for you. Um, it is that accountability putting you at risk because she could do something with it that's

936
01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.890
Magan: What confuses me

937
01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:31.320
Yes.

938
01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:44.670
Magan: So like for example, her trying to take the items down after I've done all the work I've pulled everything I've counted all the items I need to go to the auction.

939
01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:57.270
Magan: So I have to go turn them into terminal maintenance because they have to put it on the city website and sell them and the city makes them money off of it, the profit of those items that have been now.

940
01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:01.920
Magan: turned over to lost and found they were sitting and lost and found for 90 days.

941
01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:17.910
Magan: And now it's no longer their property right so the city that then owns it, and they get whatever money for it. That includes money like literally physical money if somebody doesn't come back and get it and it's in 90 days, see it now belongs to the city.

942
01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:22.530
Magan: So she wanted to take the items that

943
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:29.190
Magan: Need to be turned in for city auction every single month after you do all the Lost and Found herself.

944
01:38:29.850 --> 01:38:39.120
Magan: She wanted to do that part. That's what she said to me, she said, I will take care of that, at which point I said, Don't you know I've got it covered because

945
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:57.540
Magan: It is a chain of custody issue. She could take those items and I'm walking down to that term to drop it off. She could drop a laptop. She could slip it in her jacket pocket. It could be a diamond ring, whatever. And if it is not there when she gets there. Guess what falls on

946
01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.610
A Megan me

947
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanting I'm not gonna tell you what I would do. But what did you do about that. That's huge. That's a real problem.

948
01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.610
So what you do.

949
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:27.240
Magan: I went directly to my supervisor. Uh huh. Yeah. So there's three things I did. I first I went to my direct supervisor, I expressed my concern about it. He agreed with me, Chris. The manager director manager walked in.

950
01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:41.940
Magan: My direct supervisor said, Please repeat everything you just said to me to Chris I did Chris said, I agree. There's no reason why Sydney needs to be involved in it, you need to handle it from start to finish.

951
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:48.510
Magan: And then I sent an email to Sydney. And I said, I appreciate you offering to do it, but I've got it.

952
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:57.750
Magan: So I got the permission to handle the whole thing from beginning to end through my direct manager of the center

953
01:39:58.230 --> 01:40:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: That's great, except there's nothing in writing, so

954
01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:03.990
Magan: Personally, I don't know the

955
01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.130
Witness.

956
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good.

957
01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's also why are doing some of this in writing, why not the email to Josh Why, why not

958
01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:23.820
Magan: There. Oh, good. I also emailed it. Okay, fine. So you go I also emailed him. Yeah, just making sure

959
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:27.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay cuz I'm so great.

960
01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:29.790
So,

961
01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Then there's no problem here. I mean, I don't know your gambling. I just fine.

962
01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:38.160
Magan: I'm trying, but

963
01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:50.190
Magan: Like I said this morning when I walked away. I know that she hadn't read that email yet of me saying, I got it covered. And I was anxious, of how he would respond

964
01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:51.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I see.

965
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.440
Magan: Okay.

966
01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:55.680
Magan: So that's how I left feeling

967
01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:03.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let's see if I'm up to speed. Now on, you're going to see her tomorrow or something. Soon, right.

968
01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:07.740
Magan: And yep tomorrow morning.

969
01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so really

970
01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me let me do a replay. If it's tomorrow morning. Let's assume she

971
01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Read the email. Don't you think she I mean she going to go ahead and get the items or she really gonna back down and just let you do the job at

972
01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:35.370
Magan: This point she has to back down because the things with me, she can't get it.

973
01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Out to you about what what might she pick out you about

974
01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:55.380
Magan: She might pick up me about the paperwork for lost and found she read over it and she said, it looks like I did it. All right, but she said, Next time, leave the paper for Salvation Army decide when they pick up the meeting.

975
01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.000
Gwenevere Abriel: And what's wrong with just saying okay

976
01:41:59.610 --> 01:42:01.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What's wrong with just saying, I said, Okay, is that okay

977
01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:04.410
Magan: Yeah, I will say thank you. I said, Okay.

978
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:06.300
Magan: Okay.

979
01:42:08.610 --> 01:42:12.690
Magan: And I did say thank you for all your help. Okay.

980
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:24.690
Magan: I'm really trying to be professional, but I am saying that even in me acting professional I'm still feeling that feeling of control power vindictive

981
01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:34.230
Magan: I want to get back at you. I want that acceptance from you. I know all the things that you just said are literally happening. They are happening now.

982
01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:49.290
Magan: But I am still handling it the way that you, that I should be I'm handling it professionally and I'm putting on a great fit show, but the feelings that I'm feeling inside are exactly as you described.

983
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:51.120
Right.

984
01:42:53.310 --> 01:43:00.720
Magan: So that's the problem. She doesn't know it, but I know it, I know that she's getting a rise out of me. I know that.

985
01:43:01.530 --> 01:43:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so trying to get when i when i get the I Am resin, that's a phrase, but she's getting a rise out of me. I'm getting activated. What's the belief about yourself right in there. I see what she's doing.

986
01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm not good enough.

987
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.610
Magan: Okay.

988
01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.880
Magan: That's the belief that I'm not good enough.

989
01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And how old is this one. How old is this belief.

990
01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:35.160
Magan: Not good enough. As long as I can remember.

991
01:43:38.370 --> 01:43:39.150
Magan: As forever.

992
01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:45.240
Magan: That's pretty common for people like there's a time in my life.

993
01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:48.000
Magan: Where I haven't felt that way.

994
01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:54.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So Megan, when you say, oh, look, I'm still she still gets a rise out of me.

995
01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Your life.

996
01:44:01.410 --> 01:44:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You've been operating from this platform of I'm not good enough.

997
01:44:05.970 --> 01:44:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And fighting for it in various different ways.

998
01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:11.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It's gonna take some time.

999
01:44:11.610 --> 01:44:12.900
Magan: I do want to be good.

1000
01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you already

1001
01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:16.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Are

1002
01:44:16.290 --> 01:44:17.010
Magan: It's just

1003
01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:17.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't record.

1004
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:21.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but you always more you wish for her.

1005
01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's this this this

1006
01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:26.400
Magan: But that's the problem. I don't see that.

1007
01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:27.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I know

1008
01:44:28.050 --> 01:44:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're going to have these crop.

1009
01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.680
Magan: And I don't. And in those moments and

1010
01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:35.640
Magan: I'm sorry, I don't mean interrupt it in those moments.

1011
01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:56.790
Magan: I don't, I don't see it. And I kind of wish I could you have no idea how badly how stupid I feel sometimes reflecting back on a conversation or an event. And I'm like, why didn't I do this. Why didn't I do that. Like why would. Why did I do that. Why did I respond that way.

1012
01:44:58.020 --> 01:44:58.380
Magan: And then

1013
01:44:59.550 --> 01:45:06.420
Magan: I'm never okay with just being me. And that moment where I'm at an accepting

1014
01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:10.050
Magan: Accepting that what is is

1015
01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:15.540
Magan: I'm always constantly questioning, if I'm good enough.

1016
01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.140
Magan: Constantly

1017
01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:23.880
Magan: And I don't even realize it and doing it right.

1018
01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:26.340
Magan: And so second nature to me.

1019
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:27.180
All right.

1020
01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:30.390
Magan: So,

1021
01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:39.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't be surprised or to keep showing up, then we can't be, can't be like shocked by it. You've been rehearsing this and feeling and feeding it for a long time.

1022
01:45:39.450 --> 01:45:49.110
Gwenevere Abriel: But also notice that during this conversation you played out this scenario, and I got pretty far and I kept looking for. Well, where was the misstep here. They're really

1023
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You were direct you are clear. I mean, weren't you good enough with this whole exchange you wanted to initiate

1024
01:45:58.830 --> 01:46:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Got Krista to say the word great initiative you pulled your Josh in and said look, there's a real high risk with the chain of custody going on here, real high risk. I'm not comfortable. Everyone agreed like you did. You did it all just thought on

1025
01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.170
Gwenevere Abriel: What

1026
01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:20.040
Magan: I still

1027
01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:22.800
Magan: wanted her. Yeah.

1028
01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

1029
01:46:24.630 --> 01:46:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted, but that's my point number I was doing this whole thing you're going to want this.

1030
01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Um it Bongo, in my world. It's this this image of these negative qualities of our caregivers, you're going to want that one. To give you approval.

1031
01:46:42.630 --> 01:46:44.190
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to want the impossible.

1032
01:46:45.570 --> 01:46:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're set up for it.

1033
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: To fail they they're not capable

1034
01:46:53.130 --> 01:46:55.140
Magan: So how do I placate myself.

1035
01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:57.600
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you don't placate

1036
01:46:58.770 --> 01:46:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: You just

1037
01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Give up trying to please those types of people

1038
01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: They're never going to see

1039
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: The triangle. You're never going to see you.

1040
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:16.170
Gwenevere Abriel: If, if it's true what we're talking about the people that you the

1041
01:47:17.250 --> 01:47:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The husband type. The Sydney that you had some of those, that's your other job they're never going to see you. If you really get it.

1042
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: All that effort you do to analyzing them is a waste of your time. Just say

1043
01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:47.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you and go do the next right thing and sometimes it's an email sometimes because trying to prove your value to them is a waste of your time.

1044
01:47:48.090 --> 01:47:59.520
Gwenevere Abriel: But you don't know that because this is so organic and ingrained in you to have your mother who couldn't see past her own narcissistic needs.

1045
01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You want approval and acceptance and recognition from that over and over and over and Andrew has embodies a lot of them from your

1046
01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:12.390
Caregivers

1047
01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:15.390
Want him you

1048
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:19.590
Magan: It and he doesn't

1049
01:48:20.730 --> 01:48:32.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I know it's an exaggeration. When I say they can't. And I know as I say it, of course, they may but it serves you in the freedom that comes

1050
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: From just turning inward all that analysis, why can't pay, but look evidence, evidence. See, I'm a good person. See how good. Look what I do. I'm a good girl look like a value value value.

1051
01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Quit

1052
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:53.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Go inside and say, well, I really thought I was a tough little cookie.

1053
01:48:53.700 --> 01:49:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm really smart. I know the policies and procedures and I'm really i i like this job so much. I want to be. I'm going to be a supervisor here. Which means I'm going to have to tolerate working with some morons. And I'm going to, this is an example.

1054
01:49:07.710 --> 01:49:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Working with people like this, I find a way to not take it.

1055
01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:15.360
Personally when they're it

1056
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Around idiots ignorant selfish people, you're going to be around and we all are.

1057
01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:26.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna have to hold on.

1058
01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.950
Magan: I applied for a different job.

1059
01:49:30.570 --> 01:49:31.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

1060
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:39.180
Magan: Well, it's still a dispatcher but it's with the county and it pays 22 an hour.

1061
01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.170
Whoo.

1062
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:47.670
Magan: Yeah, it's like a $4 raise. So it would be really nice to get that but

1063
01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:50.550
Magan: I am

1064
01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:57.090
Magan: I like my job. I do. I like my job and I want to grow there.

1065
01:50:01.410 --> 01:50:04.230
Magan: I want to succeed there because I think I really can

1066
01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.140
So Megan.

1067
01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:17.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you believe that you are the cause of Sydney's behavior.

1068
01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:20.940
Magan: No, I don't.

1069
01:50:22.170 --> 01:50:31.410
Magan: Those behaviors were there long before I came along. She has a very long history of it. You literally in paper.

1070
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You have on paper. I know. Do you have a secret wish that you're the one that will get her to recognize her inappropriateness

1071
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:46.560
Magan: Secret wish. Yes.

1072
01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:49.380
Magan: Yes, I do.

1073
01:50:49.890 --> 01:50:50.610
Magan: That's been

1074
01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:51.780
picker.

1075
01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep, that's been your, your secret wish ongoing

1076
01:50:59.250 --> 01:51:02.190
Gwenevere Abriel: They need to know what they did. They need to know how they

1077
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:03.120
Magan: Hurt me

1078
01:51:03.150 --> 01:51:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: What they did. They need justice.

1079
01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That's just, that's it.

1080
01:51:08.250 --> 01:51:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: And you

1081
01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: can spend your energy to them.

1082
01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:23.250
Magan: So that's a good point because I'm sitting here and I'm waiting for the result from this investigation. I'm waiting. And I'm waiting. And I'm waiting. And I'm hoping

1083
01:51:25.650 --> 01:51:29.400
Magan: That it comes out in my favor.

1084
01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:31.590
Magan: But once it doesn't

1085
01:51:33.450 --> 01:51:34.830
Magan: But if nothing comes in it.

1086
01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.540
Oh, well, you could

1087
01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:38.580
Magan: Everything that I

1088
01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Could you could have a depression if you wanted to.

1089
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:45.450
Yeah.

1090
01:51:46.530 --> 01:51:48.510
Magan: You could get, how do I accept that.

1091
01:51:52.110 --> 01:51:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: He goes this this machine.

1092
01:51:57.810 --> 01:52:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This machine is a flawed machine.

1093
01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You move on.

1094
01:52:03.810 --> 01:52:05.700
Magan: It's a fucking mess. Put your

1095
01:52:05.730 --> 01:52:07.560
Magan: Or you can text when a mike

1096
01:52:07.650 --> 01:52:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you there to change the agency.

1097
01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you there to change Sydney. No.

1098
01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:14.490
Magan: Just sure no

1099
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:39.690
Magan: I'm not I am well. So for this investigation. Yes. I want her to see the error of her ways I want her to see that the way that she treats me and other white women is wrong. I want her to see that her behavior is unacceptable, and I am not going to accept her mistreatment.

1100
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:43.980
Magan: That's fine. And look, if none of that happens.

1101
01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh wait, wait a minute. You're not accepting this treatment.

1102
01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is totally different than an outcome of her see her. Miss treatment of you. I keep saying the same thing.

1103
01:52:58.050 --> 01:52:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: They're different.

1104
01:53:00.450 --> 01:53:02.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You want the perpetrator.

1105
01:53:04.890 --> 01:53:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: To own what he did.

1106
01:53:07.710 --> 01:53:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: To see how he do

1107
01:53:10.290 --> 01:53:11.010
Magan: They're not

1108
01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:14.070
Magan: Going to know exactly where that comes from.

1109
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not gonna he's not going to start. Yeah, he's not going to, if they were the type that got it.

1110
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:31.500
Gwenevere Abriel: If they were the type to get it, they wouldn't have done it.

1111
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:33.510
Magan: If they knew

1112
01:53:33.690 --> 01:53:36.600
Magan: What they were doing really tough pill to swallow.

1113
01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:41.550
Magan: Hard

1114
01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: For me to solve that. I know.

1115
01:53:45.090 --> 01:53:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't undo the history, the history still happened.

1116
01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't undo what he did.

1117
01:53:59.670 --> 01:54:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you making this other part. I'm not going to tolerate people crossing a boundary

1118
01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Now that's that's a real doable thing and you're living it you're standing up often often speaking your truth.

1119
01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what's real for be following through with self protection self validation. You're following through with it, but you're holding on still to you just, you need to know what to do.

1120
01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:39.450
Gwenevere Abriel: How's it going to change history. He'll never say sorry not in any way that you'll ever feel in your visceral

1121
01:54:41.490 --> 01:54:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not, I don't think it will happen.

1122
01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:49.800
Magan: No, it won't. It hasn't happened yet. He denies it to this day.

1123
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:53.340
Magan: He's a coward, but

1124
01:54:54.450 --> 01:55:07.200
Magan: It does come from that basis of i do want this, this, and it's not just from Sydney or from anything else, it comes down directly to that I want justice for what he did to me.

1125
01:55:08.730 --> 01:55:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: But

1126
01:55:09.210 --> 01:55:12.180
Magan: Does he need to be never going to happen. Know.

1127
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What would just to speak. How do you go this for that. I mean, yes, he should be in

1128
01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:22.920
Magan: Jail, and never be around children rotting in jail and never be around children and little girls.

1129
01:55:23.370 --> 01:55:24.180
Magan: Absolutely.

1130
01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:27.510
Magan: So that if it were my way

1131
01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:31.140
Magan: He'd be castrated yeah I could totally see him dead.

1132
01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.350
Yeah, but

1133
01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:37.320
Magan: It's hard. It's hard.

1134
01:55:39.690 --> 01:55:48.630
Magan: It's I just it it's like you said it's ingrained in me and it's like second nature. So it's, it is aha moments that are happening. Yes.

1135
01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:55.620
Magan: And and then there are moments where I know that this is my truth. I know this is happening.

1136
01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:01.440
Magan: And then I just don't know how to stop it in the moment.

1137
01:56:03.090 --> 01:56:13.830
Magan: I can say right now. Yes, this is wrong. I shouldn't be thinking this way. You're right, or this or this or that or that. I'm never going to get that I need to find it within myself.

1138
01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:21.900
Magan: But in the moment I don't feel that way in the moment I'm seeking acceptance from

1139
01:56:23.130 --> 01:56:26.550
Magan: Perpetrator I know and it sucks.

1140
01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:29.460
Magan: It really sucks.

1141
01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're hearing another human telling you that this is a common thing that happens. This is the end you can go reach in a psychology book and you'll find yourself on those pages. Okay.

1142
01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And so when we say, oh, if this is so common, maybe we can say there's healing.

1143
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:57.960
Gwenevere Abriel: A predictable a journey of healing and predictable maybe solutions and ways out that's exciting.

1144
01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. And if we're on these pages, then okay then then somebody has some comfort level without we get out of this, there is a way out.

1145
01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:09.660
Magan: And you're

1146
01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're getting there. You really are, because you couldn't have tolerated. This kind of conversation before

1147
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You would have been really convinced in the why me you are very

1148
01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:25.650
Immersive

1149
01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:33.900
Gwenevere Abriel: That there was something literally sell your early spiritually. You were plucked out

1150
01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.760
Magan: Tell you that I've made growth.

1151
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:41.580
Yeah, I think so too.

1152
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:44.970
Magan: It's slow, but it's happening.

1153
01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know about the slow, I don't know, maybe it feels slow, but here it doesn't look slow to

1154
01:57:50.670 --> 01:57:50.880
Me.

1155
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.380
Magan: It looks like to keep coming and fill up

1156
01:57:59.550 --> 01:58:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The takeaway. I hope at least as a minimum that you get is, see how you call yourself it's going slowly. She didn't think about my whole life. I've had. I'm not enough. But you say I'm going slowly.

1157
01:58:15.210 --> 01:58:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna have to clearly see, you're, you're actually moving rapidly aggressively intensely meaningfully because this is a lot of history of I'm not good enough. Do you know how many moments you have met and made decisions based on that fundamental database, right there.

1158
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:36.930
That offer

1159
01:58:38.670 --> 01:58:39.360
Magan: Everyday

1160
01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Elegance billions

1161
01:58:44.730 --> 01:58:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Of solutions and answers you based it out of, well, my solution will surely come from. I'm not good enough.

1162
01:58:51.930 --> 01:59:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: That's so many and you're saying you're slow know you literally speak to someone who's in a power, authority, who looks, smells acts like right your, your, your perpetrator.

1163
01:59:05.190 --> 01:59:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: You're standing in your truth and you want to label yourself slow I i can't agree. I think you're moving profoundly meaningfully fast I I don't see it the way you do.

1164
01:59:20.250 --> 01:59:21.300
Magan: Maybe that's good.

1165
01:59:22.530 --> 01:59:23.790
Magan: Maybe I will get there.

1166
01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:34.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in it. I'm telling you, you remember these things. You remember some imagery. Remember the breath. I hope for the breath is going to be the key.

1167
01:59:34.290 --> 01:59:38.190
Magan: To all of us is key to I've been working on it.

1168
01:59:38.970 --> 01:59:41.970
Magan: A lot. I've even been doing it right now.

1169
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:51.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. And I call it. Now I've changed it from box breathing, because now I just call it belly breathing, because that mechanism is that that like a balloon.

1170
01:59:51.420 --> 02:00:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: The belly pushing out getting that air download. I don't even take a chance anymore. I'm just calling it belly breathing, because I can't take a chance that people will think, oh, it's about breathing in the nose or it's about my shoulders not moving. No.

1171
02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It's about that air getting to the bottom of that long.

1172
02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the mechanism. So now it's just belly breathing, meaning that belly goes

1173
02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It goes out because that long is expanding at the bottom. Now I'm just I can't take a chance that piece is the meaningful piece I'm going to care if you breathe through your mouth.

1174
02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But that belly right we'll see it going in and out.

1175
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:26.970
Magan: Because that bottom

1176
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't care if it's two seconds. One second. You can have all those things be off. We got to have the belly breath. Okay. My next client just rolled in. Let's schedule another appointment.

1177
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.470
Magan: Next Friday at eight.

1212
02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Below.

1213
02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:29.520

1214
02:06:29.850 --> 02:06:30.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I was like,

1215
02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: walking to class in Madison, Wisconsin. I was like,

1216
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: My nose hairs were frozen.

1217
02:06:39.570 --> 02:06:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Ice. I was like this is

1218
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: This is not a thing. What is this

1219
02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:49.050
Matthew Montano: From California was it windy there too.

1220
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. Oh, yeah.

1221
02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:51.450
It was

1222
02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like Chicago right by the great great lakes and I was like, I spent one year there and I went back to California.

1223
02:07:00.630 --> 02:07:02.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I'm going back to California.

1224
02:07:02.130 --> 02:07:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Last year, my final. I was like,

1225
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Ankles and assholes. I'm out of here.

1226
02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:09.540
Matthew Montano: I'm getting the hell out of here.

1227
02:07:10.650 --> 02:07:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I can get an education anywhere.

1228
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:13.290
Yeah.

1229
02:07:15.930 --> 02:07:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a tan.

1230
02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:28.980
Matthew Montano: Yeah. Right. Exactly. That's craziness. I think the closest I've ever received into that here is like maybe six degrees 10 degrees nuts. Not 20 below zero, nothing like that.

1231
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's like this is unreal like unfathomable. Thank you.

1232
02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:37.830
Matthew Montano: Can you eat those prickling you all over the

1233
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:42.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Place and your car doesn't start and I, it doesn't start

1234
02:07:44.010 --> 02:07:58.770
Matthew Montano: And then you have to get used to like starting it and letting it run for a while before you actually go in the morning. So you have to get up earlier go scrape the ice off your car and you're just miserable get frostbite on your hands and stuff.

1235
02:08:00.090 --> 02:08:01.020
Gwenevere Abriel: One year

Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so that that that happened. Yeah.

1241
02:08:20.010 --> 02:08:27.990
Matthew Montano: toasty Toshi. That's how I am too if it's even like like it is 36 degrees outside right now.

1242
02:08:29.010 --> 02:08:33.180
Matthew Montano: I have it like 74 I always like to see

1243
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:37.980
Matthew Montano: Especially if I'm not moving a lot

1244
02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.720
Matthew Montano: I'm like, if I'm just sitting down like watching a movie or something. I get really cold after like get the blood circulating

1245
02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:51.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right, let's let's focus on you now.

1246
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:53.700
Matthew Montano: Okay, rather

1247
02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Talk, I talked about the weather with my therapist today.

1248
02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:58.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you really

1249
02:08:59.610 --> 02:09:00.240
Know whether

1250
02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:09.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, let me get good a note open for you. So how has your mood, then these shirts.

1251
02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:11.370
Matthew Montano: My mood is

1252
02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:25.200
Matthew Montano: The I've noticed the medicine kicking into much um it's been my moods been a little bit back. I've just been staying busy. So that's been keeping my mood up

1253
02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:37.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I will let me reflect a little bit of contradictory information. So in one of our sessions. It was like the second day that you had started taking

1254
02:09:37.410 --> 02:09:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it was an antidepressant. You said, I don't know if it's the medicine, but I'm feeling better and then you showed up in group. And you said, I can't feel any difference with the medicine. Remember logging it in my memory. And so now I'm bringing it up.

1255
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: And again, you're saying I'm not feeling the difference. So I don't know which one you're on. But sometimes, it really does take a month for to kick in. So

1256
02:09:56.190 --> 02:09:57.060
Matthew Montano: Yeah, okay.

1257
02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: That's pretty standard. You just got to hang in there for it. But once it does I you should feel the difference

1258
02:10:04.050 --> 02:10:08.280
Matthew Montano: All right, I'm done them into week two. So, yeah. Well, yeah.

1259
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Be patient with it.

1260
02:10:10.170 --> 02:10:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and

1261
02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: When you say you're keeping busy.

1262
02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this the gym and work.

1263
02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:33.960
Matthew Montano: Yeah okay work and I'm when I have time, we'll every once in a while friend will come over, will make dinner. Watch it. Watch a movie or something like that.

1264
02:10:38.070 --> 02:10:44.010
Matthew Montano: Me in the X have a there's no communication, it's been it's been over a month now.

1265
02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So it feels done

1266
02:10:47.610 --> 02:10:55.860
Matthew Montano: Yes, it's done. Uh huh. Because there's been like a few times where he had left some stuff here. And we had, you know,

1267
02:10:56.970 --> 02:11:03.780
Matthew Montano: I left it outside and told him to come get it and because we were arguing on the phone, too. So

1268
02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so what what what what

1269
02:11:08.190 --> 02:11:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: When you're arguing on the phone. How is that a thing.

1270
02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:30.990
Matthew Montano: Uh, he called me at work. Oh, that's not yeah the arguing was so bad. I had to work we blocked each other on everything social media to Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, the phone.

1271
02:11:32.250 --> 02:11:40.200
Matthew Montano: Yeah, there's no means of communication there. So he's called me at work a few times just to tell him just to tell me all kinds of crap.

1272
02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:58.770
Matthew Montano: really crazy. I didn't think you would end that abruptly, but it was a very toxic relationship. And I think when I started coming to counseling. Um, I started working on myself. And it kind of started pushing him away.

1273
02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:00.810
Okay.

1274
02:12:02.130 --> 02:12:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's really really be deliberate with your words, try to say that. Say that again, but in a different way.

1275
02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:11.190
Matthew Montano: I'm

1276
02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:19.560
Matthew Montano: Going to start when I started coming to counseling and working on myself. Um, I just started noticing what was right for me.

1277
02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh. Yeah, there we go. Right, counseling give

1278
02:12:24.630 --> 02:12:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Him away, right. That's not what that was. Yes, there we go, you noticing maybe what you're willing to tolerate that maybe without self awareness and valuing of the self. You might have been willing to tolerate for many, many months and years.

1279
02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. That is the side effect of growing up. It's true. That's a side effect heal and

1280
02:12:47.970 --> 02:12:51.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You won't be able to tolerate right toxic people as much

1281
02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:57.240
Matthew Montano: Yeah, and he was to be really toxic.

1282
02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:00.360
Matthew Montano: Actually think he was a

1283
02:13:02.610 --> 02:13:06.360
Matthew Montano: narcissist. Sometimes when I read into that it's

1284
02:13:08.130 --> 02:13:09.090
Matthew Montano: A lot of us it's

1285
02:13:09.810 --> 02:13:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: A fun one. Right now it's blowing up all over the internet. Yeah, then checking out that I don't know what that Dr. Whatever name is that long brown hair she's got she's all over the place. I'm looking at her, she's

1286
02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Right dynamic. Yeah.

1287
02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:32.400
Matthew Montano: A lot yeah it's Poppy. It is popping up everywhere everywhere and people are starting to say they're narcissists themselves like being proud about it.

1288
02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

1289
02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's talk about that just for two seconds, and let's get into kind of where we left off before I'm

1290
02:13:41.250 --> 02:13:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Insane in psychology. Right.

1291
02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Depression right antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder Borderline Personality Disorder anxiety disorder obsessive compulsive disorder. Right.

1292
02:14:01.530 --> 02:14:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are extremes. That's when they make it into the diagnostic manual. It has to do with extremes. Right.

1293
02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You may recognize yourself in some of those. Sometimes I get a low mood or it goes on for a longer period of time than I like

1294
02:14:17.550 --> 02:14:26.520
Gwenevere Abriel: People do get depressed. They had depressed moves it just doesn't meet the threshold criteria of meeting the diagnosis. So they get anxious

1295
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, or they're they're feeling like I really need to keep this clean or I really need to be organized, but it's not messing with the functioning in their life, or they have attention difficulties or something like that.

1296
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Has to do with whether how much it's affecting multiple domains of functioning in your life narcissism is a necessary part of ego strength. We do need. Oh.

1297
02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:56.370
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1298
02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So that we can register right if it's something we love get sick or hurt so that we can show them. We care. We need sad.

1299
02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: We need anger to protect itself. We need to be organized. We need to see the relevance of

1300
02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: predictability and structured organization. So that has its value. It's not just all like. So when people say, well, I'm, I'm a narcissist well doesn't take them off the hook for how they're affecting people

1301
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point is to say we do need a little

1302
02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:33.360
Matthew Montano: Of those all those traits.

1303
02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:35.400
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so, yeah.

1304
02:15:38.070 --> 02:15:46.290
Matthew Montano: So like the counseling field is narcissism, or a narcissist something you would like a way you would diagnose a person or

1305
02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a personality disorder.

1306
02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:51.330
Matthew Montano: It already has a personality so

1307
02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, but again it's extreme

1308
02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:00.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Behaviors are those are ones that

1309
02:16:02.010 --> 02:16:03.510
You know you're with one

1310
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:14.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe a, wouldn't you continue to try to get some empathy from them and you would be wasting your time.

1311
02:16:15.570 --> 02:16:15.960
Yeah.

1312
02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:26.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm noticing a little bit of fidgeting. Why don't you turn inward. I know we've been very playful this morning but turn in just kind of go inside.

1313
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice intentional breath.

1314
02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: This is all about you, Matt. Matthew. This is you, your time.

1315
02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:40.740
Matthew Montano: Man, I like to be called Matt if you

1316
02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I absolutely feel free to remind me again if I forget. So, Matt.

1317
02:16:47.640 --> 02:17:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Just eat. See what unsettled thoughts are still kind of going on inside. Or maybe there's a part of your body and you have a lot of messaging that often happens in that shoulder area.

1318
02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Is a Restlessness or attention.

1319
02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Or any concern.

1320
02:17:13.650 --> 02:17:14.400
Matthew Montano: Um,

1321
02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:27.750
Matthew Montano: I've never been. I guess some of it always comes from the fact that I've never been used to like, I'm not a big video chatter

1322
02:17:28.350 --> 02:17:32.400
Matthew Montano: Uh huh. So yeah, that, that right there makes me nervous.

1323
02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:34.590
Matthew Montano: I'm

1324
02:17:37.530 --> 02:17:50.160
Matthew Montano: Not that I'm really insecure, like in person like you know I'm pretty confident. It's just that I've never liked video chatting, but also so I want to make sure I look good. That's always and

1325
02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:11.100
Matthew Montano: I've been feeling. I've actually been feeling good and doing good, just

1326
02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:18.330
Matthew Montano: Going forward, knowing I'm single. Now, okay.

1327
02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:23.370
Matthew Montano: I'm just the

1328
02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:28.470
Matthew Montano: It's kind of excited and

1329
02:18:31.770 --> 02:18:36.120
Matthew Montano: And with that excitement comes a little bit of

1330
02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:39.720
Matthew Montano: You know,

1331
02:18:41.370 --> 02:18:41.940
Matthew Montano: I guess.

1332
02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:50.940
Matthew Montano: I guess.

1333
02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:55.320
Matthew Montano: You know, scared scared and

1334
02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:57.780
Matthew Montano: Expired. You

1335
02:18:58.740 --> 02:18:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Scared and excited

1336
02:19:00.030 --> 02:19:00.570
All right.

1337
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:11.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me a little bit about the the fear part oftentimes fear comes from

1338
02:19:12.990 --> 02:19:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A fantasy about the future we we imagine something negative happening in the future and and your imagined fear is what

1339
02:19:37.590 --> 02:19:43.170
Matthew Montano: Just now that I'm not so much focusing on another person.

1340
02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:55.470
Matthew Montano: Or I don't have that other person here to make me laugh or, you know, really tension with

1341
02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:03.600
Matthew Montano: Can I do that myself. Like, can I

1342
02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:10.620
Matthew Montano: I'm not always the best at making myself happy.

1343
02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:11.790
Yeah.

1344
02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:15.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Nicely done that.

1345
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm

1346
02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: The

1347
02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: work you were doing with me before summit, even though we've been hanging out here in therapy for months. Most recently, you've been doing the most work. Most recently,

1348
02:20:36.690 --> 02:20:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And you got a chance to really sort of but up next to some old ones and your relationship right some missed parenting opportunity from your mother certainly

1349
02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:55.800
Matthew Montano: Oh, and it's weird.

1350
02:20:57.450 --> 02:21:07.680
Matthew Montano: Okay. It's weird, me and her how to have your really been communicating and I guess through Facebook somehow I don't post anything about my personal life on there.

1351
02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:19.680
Matthew Montano: Like, stuff like that. But somehow she figured it out. I guess because I don't know how to even know how because we didn't put that we broke up on there anything either of us, but

1352
02:21:21.210 --> 02:21:23.670
Matthew Montano: Now she kind of comes into

1353
02:21:24.690 --> 02:21:35.670
Matthew Montano: The picture she she's texting and not even like a phone call, she's texting me insane like shipper, she asked me. Did I break up with Ryan and then she saying

1354
02:21:38.940 --> 02:21:45.630
Matthew Montano: She's and she's saying like, and then I said, Oh, we're just taking a break, working things out because I really didn't want to

1355
02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:53.190
Matthew Montano: put too much in new in you know tower too much about it and she and then she's like

1356
02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:59.430
Matthew Montano: I'm another day, she has like how's your love like love love life going

1357
02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:07.710
Matthew Montano: I don't like together too involved with that because when I was living near her

1358
02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:20.190
Matthew Montano: A lot of the stress that meet her were arguing a lot at that time.

1359
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:22.470
Matthew Montano: And

1360
02:22:27.090 --> 02:22:31.080
Matthew Montano: Actually thought that had something to do with our

1361
02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:33.570
Matthew Montano: A BREAKUP in my past.

1362
02:22:34.770 --> 02:22:37.290
Matthew Montano: You know, she can't be like the ultimate reason for it, but

1363
02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:44.820
Matthew Montano: You know, just, you know, she's a lot of the yeah there's a lot of arguments.

1364
02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:51.900
Matthew Montano: I would take it out of the boyfriends and this look like five years ago.

1365
02:22:56.490 --> 02:23:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Also, you had mentioned that past relationships were not the most functional regardless of the fact that you may have been acting out instead of expressing your frustration with your relationship. You've described that your relationship with Ryan actually was functional

1366
02:23:20.430 --> 02:23:23.910
Matthew Montano: Yeah, just in the fact that he and

1367
02:23:27.450 --> 02:23:30.030
Matthew Montano: To be honest, I think it's just because

1368
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:32.910
Matthew Montano: He was a more laid back person.

1369
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:39.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah why maybe we need to define our what what determines function.

1370
02:23:41.130 --> 02:23:41.490
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1371
02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, have a couple of things, you know, defining

1372
02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:50.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're looking for.

1373
02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:54.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And

1374
02:23:56.490 --> 02:23:57.090
He

1375
02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Happy alone.

1376
02:24:04.830 --> 02:24:05.310
Right.

1377
02:24:06.810 --> 02:24:11.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's how we started. Can I be, can I believe my own tension.

1378
02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. How will I cope with my on moments. My unpleasant ones. And sometimes it's even the happy one so I'm happy, I'm alone. Oh no, it doesn't necessarily mean we even know how to handle happy alone. Okay, so I make no assumptions that one's easier than the other.

1379
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:35.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Because right away. I was hearing stories of

1380
02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting people and just now you've got people over at the house right you don't prefer your own company.

1381
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:57.300
Matthew Montano: Like since I've split up with Ryan I

1382
02:25:06.210 --> 02:25:06.930
Matthew Montano: Have

1383
02:25:09.450 --> 02:25:14.790
Matthew Montano: Tried to like sometimes when I get really depressed or down. I'll distance myself.

1384
02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:20.850
Matthew Montano: By friends will be texting me

1385
02:25:24.390 --> 02:25:28.620
Matthew Montano: My dad will be texting me here. He lives in the same town, I'm

1386
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:36.780
Matthew Montano: Kind of distance myself, but this time I tried to like get myself back to that. Okay.

1387
02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:37.560
Question.

1388
02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm all about connection for wired for connection love social medicine connect with people. I'm on big fan. Huge fan.

1389
02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And

1390
02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know when you are isolating. What were you doing

1391
02:25:57.210 --> 02:25:58.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Literally in your apartment.

1392
02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:08.490
Matthew Montano: I'm cleaning cooking eating watching Netflix, Hulu.

1393
02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:09.480
Doing

1394
02:26:11.430 --> 02:26:12.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Great. Where are you happy.

1395
02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:19.920
Matthew Montano: I was, I felt safe and content.

1396
02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:21.030
Okay.

1397
02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it okay that you spend time on your own.

1398
02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: feeling safe and content with yourself. Is that okay, or is there this huge risk of you might be missing out on something out there. Is it okay you carve out time for yourself, or does it have to be pathological like Oh, I'm in a depression.

1399
02:26:45.570 --> 02:26:48.780
Matthew Montano: Um, no, it's okay for me to spend some time by myself.

1400
02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.530
Matthew Montano: One thing also after I go through breakups I

1401
02:26:57.630 --> 02:27:05.280
Matthew Montano: Like there is this buddy called me at work. And then we had a conversation before it started, are you and

1402
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:19.740
Matthew Montano: Or was it a text with I think maybe he he did text me so far I blocked and we're just talking for a little bit and we're

1403
02:27:20.970 --> 02:27:26.760
Matthew Montano: We're both were saying this isn't going to work out stuff. And I asked him if he was if he

1404
02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:36.720
Matthew Montano: Is seeing anybody yet. And he's like, No, I'm not seeing what he and I was, and then asked, Are you are you hooking up with anybody yet.

1405
02:27:37.170 --> 02:27:53.310
Matthew Montano: And then he didn't text back but there's a long pot. And then finally, I put a question mark. You know, it's like, I'll take that as a yes. And he said, no, but if I was in any of your business. Anyway, we're not together and

1406
02:27:55.410 --> 02:27:57.540
Matthew Montano: That that bug me

1407
02:27:59.010 --> 02:28:03.060
Matthew Montano: A and Bill like that.

1408
02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: What is your question, Matt, might you ask him that

1409
02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:16.830
Matthew Montano: I'm just because just because that's

1410
02:28:20.610 --> 02:28:22.020
Matthew Montano: I don't know. Should I not have

1411
02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: No answer my question why

1412
02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:29.910
Matthew Montano: I asked him that to see if there was a chance you can get back to you.

1413
02:28:29.970 --> 02:28:30.360
Yeah.

1414
02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So kind of interesting. You went ahead and he basically said, It's none of your business.

1415
02:28:41.490 --> 02:28:42.510
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you do with that.

1416
02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it your business to know who is sleeping with and who is not. At this point, you guys are not in a romantic relationship anymore.

1417
02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:58.290
Matthew Montano: Well, see, that's with me right now. That's the last thing I can think about is, um,

1418
02:28:59.490 --> 02:29:02.760
Matthew Montano: Is sex with somebody else it would

1432
02:30:05.310 --> 02:30:07.710

1433
02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: You and Julie about yourself.

02:30:34.170 --> 02:30:36.750
Matthew Montano: Yeah, I kind of felt like that was a normal question.

1439
02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:38.760
Matthew Montano: But

1440
02:30:42.690 --> 02:30:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: It's normal for someone, still holding on to hope.

1441
02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:47.460
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1442
02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:54.630
Gwenevere Abriel: So give me some adjectives.

1443
02:31:02.010 --> 02:31:08.160
Matthew Montano: mates to what I would do in the past, even if I didn't feel like being with somebody

1444
02:31:09.210 --> 02:31:12.360
Matthew Montano: I would purposely make a point to beat somebody

1445
02:31:14.250 --> 02:31:17.880
Matthew Montano: Hey, you know, to, you know, like I'm gonna show you

1446
02:31:18.600 --> 02:31:25.230

1448
02:31:27.390 --> 02:31:38.550

1449
02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So those quiet times where you you kind of need to just cook and to clean and to just kind of keep

1450
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep the confusion uncertainty of the inter personal at a minimum. So maybe spending some quiet time alone that actually makes a lot of sense.

Gwenevere Abriel: Feel settled in yourself, sort of, before going out and saying, Hi friend and coming back. Okay, wait a minute.

Matthew Montano: Yeah. Or like, I'm like, like keys. He's a douche bag husband and I'm his wife, you know, I kind of look to me like that. OK.

1562
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So now that we're talking about it.

1563
02:43:49.230 --> 02:43:50.760
Matthew Montano: I could give you more negatives.

1564
02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:53.430
Matthew Montano: If you need them.

1565
02:43:55.290 --> 02:44:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But this is all in service to you. So let's go, let's go back up a little bit. This this meeting to be needed and be put in this role of

1566
02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a caregiver whether your wifey or your parent is still, you know, a caregiver. Okay, so do you like it.

1567
02:44:21.090 --> 02:44:30.030
Matthew Montano: Yeah I did like it when he was when he was respecting it and when he was any would make him happy to

1568
02:44:32.610 --> 02:44:33.060
So,

1569
02:44:35.430 --> 02:44:40.980
Matthew Montano: I mean he moves from his mom's house to my house. So his mom is probably doing these things.

1570
02:44:47.790 --> 02:45:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: For now, how open are you to the idea of spending more time continuing to work on yourself versus starting another relationship. How, how important is it to you that you work on you for a while, whatever that is.

1571
02:45:10.470 --> 02:45:21.720
Matthew Montano: I'm open to that before I got with Ryan Ryan came to me it wasn't, I wasn't looking for relationship. I was single for for two almost three years before I and

1572
02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:23.430
Matthew Montano: I don't

1573
02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:32.730
Matthew Montano: I don't chase after relationships. Very anymore. I've because I've been heard so much and I'm very hesitant.

1574
02:45:34.170 --> 02:45:35.670
Matthew Montano: When I do need somebody I

1575
02:45:37.170 --> 02:45:49.230
Matthew Montano: I keep keep that distance. You know, I, and I make sure to explain, you know, so I'm open to taking time okay I can swipe right now that's I can't

1576
02:45:49.770 --> 02:45:59.010
Matthew Montano: Get to know somebody I feel like I would be rude to them because I'd be something else would be a mind or something, or I feel like I'd be comparing them to look

1577
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:01.560
Matthew Montano: At old relationship, you know,

1578
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's back up today might just be kind of touching on a couple topics. Um, did you journal

1579
02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:22.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Anything from our last session you had some anger that was still lingering towards your mother did you continue. Did you write it down.

1580
02:46:24.420 --> 02:46:27.990
Matthew Montano: Um, I remember we talked about the box.

1581
02:46:30.930 --> 02:46:34.440
Matthew Montano: There's a journal. So, okay.

1582
02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:36.450
Matthew Montano: So for me to

1583
02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: invited you to journal some leftover anger and resentment towards mom that might have been leftover I'm just, I'm just checking in to see if it was there.

1584
02:46:47.550 --> 02:46:51.330
Matthew Montano: If I can, I can give it to you, even if I didn't journal way.

1585
02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

1586
02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The Journaling is the intervention, not your

1587
02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:00.480
Matthew Montano: Energy taking it to me.

1588
02:47:00.750 --> 02:47:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: My hearing it. No, it's so let's just see how much charge is there around anger towards mom. These days, anger, not

1589
02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not a safe person to trust your personal business too. But I'm talking about anger and resentment.

1590
02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Much it is is there.

1591
02:47:26.250 --> 02:47:27.840
Matthew Montano: There's, there's still a lot

1592
02:47:35.580 --> 02:47:36.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Of homework again.

1593
02:47:37.890 --> 02:47:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: To get into writing, I'm

1594
02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:46.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting it onto paper. What you resent what you're angry about

1595
02:47:48.930 --> 02:47:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: I would recommend it.

1596
02:47:51.690 --> 02:47:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: What you do with it, who knows. We can talk about it. Once it's written

1597
02:47:58.410 --> 02:48:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'd be curious to see what you go through writing it down in a quiet reflective time

1598
02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Why you didn't do it that day.

1599
02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:18.360
Gwenevere Abriel: We were, we were having a lot of emotions and then we ended the session.

1600
02:48:20.250 --> 02:48:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened, maybe not wanting to feel it, not wanting to think about it, not wanting to put it on the paper. Do you think, what do you think it is.

1601
02:48:29.430 --> 02:48:40.740
Matthew Montano: Now, when I think about it. I think it's just because I fell. I look I don't cry. Very much. You see me cry or the most like probably. Anybody see me cry, to be honest.

1602
02:48:44.370 --> 02:48:52.170
Matthew Montano: I think it's just I felt a little bit better and just was like group that was a good session. And then I went out and went to work in

1603
02:48:53.220 --> 02:48:53.970
Matthew Montano: And, you know,

1604
02:48:57.270 --> 02:48:58.830
Matthew Montano: But did this time.

1605
02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:07.770
Matthew Montano: I can do that because that does make sense. Like when I have downtime, maybe like after the gym tonight or something.

1606
02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:16.170
Matthew Montano: I can sit down and there's a lot. I would have to say, I could see

1607
02:49:17.310 --> 02:49:17.940
Matthew Montano: Right now.

1608
02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:36.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll, I'll invite it again maybe as some homework, just do some journaling and if you need some organization and structure to it. You can say, I'll start from most recent or you can do it earliest we touched on some of those early, early childhood resentments.

1609
02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:41.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And just writing them out and see if you can do

1610
02:49:43.650 --> 02:49:46.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel, I feel, you know,

1611
02:49:47.640 --> 02:50:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Angry that you did this, I feel sad and hurt or rejected or abandoned. See if you can even though it's only in writing and maybe no one will see it but you, it's still really helpful to structure it with the I feel when you

1612
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:09.870
Matthew Montano: Do writing with the I feel

1613
02:50:10.350 --> 02:50:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And put an emotion in there.

1614
02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:20.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel angry. Put the plugin sad scared afraid lonely, or I was

1615
02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: I felt back then abandoned all alone right put in the emotion.

1616
02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:36.720
Gwenevere Abriel: When you did this when you weren't there when you were there. You did this when this is such happened. Okay.

1617
02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:38.670
Matthew Montano: Okay.

1618
02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:41.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I need to touch on some of your goals here.

1619
02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:45.240
Before, but

1620
02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What, how many milligrams do that.

1621
02:50:49.290 --> 02:50:50.460
Matthew Montano: Oh, it's a box in

1622
02:50:53.010 --> 02:50:55.290
Matthew Montano: A while taking the other than Allah. Allah

1623
02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:02.580
Matthew Montano: Allah. Allah, whatever it's called a look alike Lexapro.

1624
02:51:03.900 --> 02:51:05.790
Matthew Montano: I am taking

1625
02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:11.250
Matthew Montano: One film and five eighths.

1626
02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Go into your medication thing and see if they've got that written in there for me because I don't get it.

1627
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:32.310
Medications

1628
02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: 1313 I think 1311 Phil libin films for

1629
02:51:58.770 --> 02:52:02.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This 1158 I see the five as i get i think it's 13

1630
02:52:06.390 --> 02:52:07.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I think so.

1631
02:52:08.970 --> 02:52:11.640
Matthew Montano: Let me, let me grab the PNC Bank figured out

1632
02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:23.250
Matthew Montano: I hate cutting them into those little fight that five eighths.

1633
02:52:24.270 --> 02:52:32.220
Matthew Montano: Even a little contact case and then those last few days when I have to take those you like you know if your fingers are a little bit like

1634
02:52:32.970 --> 02:52:44.190
Matthew Montano: You know, wet or something. And then, and then they don't always fall on your tongue. Ooh, I hate, I hate the left and I take this brand right here and you were talking about in one of the sessions.

1635
02:52:45.300 --> 02:52:45.780
Matthew Montano: That

1636
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:50.550
Matthew Montano: They might not be all the same consistency.

1637
02:52:50.880 --> 02:52:51.750
Matthew Montano: Right, this

1638
02:52:51.810 --> 02:52:52.590
Matthew Montano: This, this

1639
02:52:53.460 --> 02:52:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it

1640
02:52:55.410 --> 02:52:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Called

1641
02:52:55.800 --> 02:52:57.330
Matthew Montano: It's called a

1642
02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:01.260
Matthew Montano: Milan, Milan.

1643
02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:13.200
Matthew Montano: And when I first started with you. Um, I was with a woman doctor and she said to request that my doctor not give me this kind, because it's inconsistent.

1644
02:53:13.560 --> 02:53:26.490
Matthew Montano: And if I I do notice like when you were talking about in the group. There are people when they're hoping look in the sun, they look different, consistency, like, so it will be orange, but some will be lights will be darker.

1645
02:53:28.230 --> 02:53:28.530
Yeah.

1646
02:53:29.550 --> 02:53:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I got you. So you can you can look at this in a couple of different ways. Of course, you can advocate for yourself if insurance and pharmacy and everybody's on board. Sometimes it's a supply issue. And it's a tough no geek kind of moment.

1647
02:53:44.100 --> 02:53:54.540
Matthew Montano: You can see if the doctor. Sorry for interview if the doctor I'm request that I get the name brands that there'll be open to that because I talked to them about it.

1648
02:53:55.830 --> 02:54:00.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And it can also be a motivator to continue to get

1649
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: To taper down. Okay, so keep, keep that in mind because it's a negative reinforcer it's like this. This is inconvenient. So there's embedded in there, some some reinforces you are born to be on a medicine like this. You were you're not

1650
02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfectly fine the way you are, you know, you're, you're, you let's let's manage your life with you. You know, you've gotten in the habit of thinking. I've got to have this substance, but you're not broken, Matt.

1651
02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Something wrong with you.

1652
02:54:37.590 --> 02:54:37.980
Hey,

1653
02:54:39.180 --> 02:54:43.260
Matthew Montano: There's a lot in there that I need to work on along the way.

1654
02:54:44.010 --> 02:54:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's

1655
02:54:45.630 --> 02:54:51.480
Matthew Montano: Yeah, because this was my. This was like this was the crutch, this has always been the crutch.

1656
02:54:52.710 --> 02:55:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that's the challenge, you know, you'll hear me sometimes say, and what's your drug of choice and those of you who have fallen in love with Suboxone on it and say, when was my last year as well as this morning.

1657
02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:08.910
Matthew Montano: Yeah, well yeah and see it doesn't it doesn't even

1658
02:55:10.530 --> 02:55:13.470
Matthew Montano: Like when I'm taking it like I'm supposed to

1659
02:55:14.940 --> 02:55:23.130
Matthew Montano: I don't even feel anything. It doesn't even feel like nothing's different, um, when I don't take it. Ooh, I see how

1660
02:55:24.570 --> 02:55:32.100
Matthew Montano: Strong of a drug. It is, I guess, because it's all, it's all, it's the withdrawals of the same as a opiates like

1661
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, via

1662
02:55:33.810 --> 02:55:49.320
Matthew Montano: ID. Yeah, I took pain pills and stuff. It's like synthetic opiate right it's not it's not like pure like in pure opiate like in pain pills because pain pills was my drug of choice. I never did heroin or any of that stuff so

1663
02:55:49.380 --> 02:55:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: The big differences with the long acting a bit and the short acting short acting are percocet oxy heroin.

1664
02:56:00.180 --> 02:56:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: These guys, you can build a tolerance which means I have to keep taking more and more and more and more. Yeah.

1665
02:56:08.010 --> 02:56:09.300
Matthew Montano: This one, if you

1666
02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:11.340
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1667
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: There was euphoria.

1668
02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:20.640
The box on

1669
02:56:21.750 --> 02:56:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Although there is some euphoric. You know it when it hits your bloodstream. You can feel it. It shouldn't hopefully you guys can tell me otherwise shouldn't be bringing that euphoria, it should not be giving

1670
02:56:38.310 --> 02:56:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I feel like nirvana. And I'm like, oh, are you on myself. You shouldn't be experienced

1671
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:44.640
Matthew Montano: It doesn't do that.

1672
02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You do not have tolerance which means you're not having to take more and more

1673
02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:55.290
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

1674
02:56:56.100 --> 02:57:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Of course you're going to have withdrawal symptoms one stays in your system, a very short amount of time and the long acting stays in for 2436 hours. We're out of time. Let's schedule another appointment. Yes.

1675
02:57:09.390 --> 02:57:09.930
Matthew Montano: Ready.

1676
02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that something

1677
02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:12.870
Matthew Montano: Can we do one soon.

1678
02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking

1679
02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now.

1680
02:57:26.790 --> 02:57:30.000
Matthew Montano: went by so quick and it felt like we hardly talked about anything.

1681
02:57:32.370 --> 02:57:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I know, but look how much interrupting. I did want to say, Matt. If

1682
02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You do. You've got a light. You wanna so there's a lot to cover. I'm glad you're, you know, we're going to be meeting weekly right so we can get to it.

1683
02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:49.680
Matthew Montano: Oh, just real quick on that, on that one.

1684
02:57:51.300 --> 02:58:06.210
Matthew Montano: A questionnaire, you had a stew on in the group that manipulation. I'm. To be honest, I answered a lot of them, yes. In currently. Okay.

1685
02:58:06.990 --> 02:58:08.220
That was

1686
02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: really brave. Yeah. And we'll, we'll get into more that that's good for you to own it. Right. And I try and tell people, hey, I've done them. We all have done them. It's no big Shami Shami thing.

1687
02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:29.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It came from a thinking this was the only way we can get our needs met, real quick let's reschedule so I'm

1688
02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

1689
02:58:32.730 --> 02:58:37.560
Matthew Montano: You might find Mom was a big manipulator. So that's kind of probably very good friend.

1690
02:58:38.340 --> 02:58:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what to think here but

1691
02:58:43.890 --> 02:58:44.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe

1692
02:58:46.050 --> 02:58:48.780
Wednesday at one maybe

1693
02:58:50.430 --> 02:58:51.990
Matthew Montano: Wednesday at one

1694
02:58:53.370 --> 02:58:53.940
Matthew Montano: Yeah.

03:12:28.470 --> 03:12:39.090
Nicole Roybal: The last job, I worked. Was that a kidney specialist and then I worked at Sam's Club during the samples. Okay. And I worked at Subway.

1833
03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:56.370
Nicole Roybal: And Jersey Mike's which is another sub sandwich store, would you place would you do there. Well, that's when I am I first finished my schooling with a medical assistant thing. And so it was my externship at the end of it.

1834
03:12:57.660 --> 03:13:04.260
Nicole Roybal: And then with the externship ended up giving me the job because they liked me and then after a couple months.

1835
03:13:05.310 --> 03:13:09.150
Nicole Roybal: Uh, I was three minutes late, one day and she fired me

1836
03:13:11.130 --> 03:13:20.730
Nicole Roybal: And I don't know if I don't know if it had to do with drinking. So I don't know if they knew that sometimes I would drink on the job. I don't know, but she just said that.

1837
03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:29.700
Nicole Roybal: I wasn't working. No more and I need to get the Scout and check yelled at me like she yelled at me to get the hell out like I wasn't even doing nothing. She yelled, like, Oh, no.

1838
03:13:29.850 --> 03:13:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That's very valuable assisting sorry

1839
03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:34.980
Nicole Roybal: Sorry.

1840
03:13:36.540 --> 03:13:39.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Medical thing you went to school for it.

1841
03:13:41.130 --> 03:13:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: You went to training. How many months. Did you go to training for this.

1842
03:13:45.330 --> 03:13:46.230
Nicole Roybal: Nine months.

1843
03:13:49.170 --> 03:13:50.250
Nicole Roybal: Like for like the schooling.

1844
03:13:51.570 --> 03:13:51.810
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1845
03:13:53.430 --> 03:13:53.730
Okay.

1846
03:13:55.140 --> 03:14:01.290
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me, did you like at least some of the work when you were doing it.

1847
03:14:03.930 --> 03:14:11.940
Nicole Roybal: I liked working with the patients, but then it's tough because like I only have a few minutes like a few answers. I'm just to check their blood pressure and stuff. And they're like,

1848
03:14:12.510 --> 03:14:20.400
Nicole Roybal: Oh, like older people, you know, and they all just want to like talk and share their stories and I'm like so interested in their stories, but I couldn't listen to them because at

1849
03:14:22.020 --> 03:14:23.670
Nicole Roybal: The room, you know,

1850
03:14:25.170 --> 03:14:32.100
Nicole Roybal: The doctor come see you and like, I don't know. I know that's that's a job. You can't be talking to people, but that's been something I've always done is I talk a lot.

1851
03:14:33.420 --> 03:14:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also said you like listening to their stories as well.

1852
03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:39.810
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, exactly. Well, older people, they have so many good stories.

1853
03:14:41.640 --> 03:14:43.440
Nicole Roybal: So yeah, that's true.

1854
03:14:43.890 --> 03:14:47.850
Nicole Roybal: Okay, and that's that it was in trouble for to the

1855
03:14:48.060 --> 03:14:53.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Actual work the tasks involved in medical assisting

1856
03:14:55.230 --> 03:15:09.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember doing some of them and thinking oh hey I'm good at this. I like that. I'm good at it. And I feel capable and competent. Do you remember any of it.

1857
03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:11.910
Nicole Roybal: Now remember it all, but I just, I don't

1858
03:15:15.180 --> 03:15:29.850
Nicole Roybal: I learned how to do like a blood pressure, like a manual blood pressure at school. And then once I had the job. I couldn't get it right for nothing. It's been so long, like three weeks to find the ability to read someone's blood pressure correctly manually and

1859
03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:43.530
Nicole Roybal: Once I finally got it. I was happy. But then I like I'd always be like kind of guessing it okay and so honestly, it was like everything was just like a headache. It was just like

1860
03:15:44.700 --> 03:15:48.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Were you you were, you were drinking, obviously.

1861
03:15:48.750 --> 03:15:51.000
Nicole Roybal: During here in there. Yeah. Not every like

1862
03:15:52.440 --> 03:16:00.480
Nicole Roybal: In the morning, no. And then once I come back from lunch upstart not feeling good. So I drink like a shot. Yeah, sometimes more, depending. Yeah.

1863
03:16:01.590 --> 03:16:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so the alcohol dependence was there so

1864
03:16:04.290 --> 03:16:04.950
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1865
03:16:05.220 --> 03:16:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know yet is how your brain works as an adult in your ability to learn

1866
03:16:13.200 --> 03:16:23.790
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the problem with the marijuana is right. It's messing with your ability to retain information. So that's going to be a problem. But you're only going to know that through lived experience, but it does mess with it.

1867
03:16:24.990 --> 03:16:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

1868
03:16:28.470 --> 03:16:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Without the

1869
03:16:30.210 --> 03:16:31.920
Gwenevere Abriel: We might be able to see

1870
03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if you can learn things a little better and

1871
03:16:38.520 --> 03:16:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1872
03:16:39.840 --> 03:16:45.870
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, my, my little brother places frickin game, and he yells lot all night.

1873
03:16:48.330 --> 03:16:49.410
Nicole Roybal: Thank you slept yet.

1874
03:16:49.950 --> 03:16:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So one thing I've heard so let's go over to Sam's Club. What did you like about kind of given out the samples or was there anything you liked about it.

1875
03:16:58.050 --> 03:17:05.070
Nicole Roybal: I really love that job. It was, I would, I could put together from what you're asking me is I

1876
03:17:05.430 --> 03:17:15.630
Nicole Roybal: Like talking to people because even when I worked at Dunkin Donuts and I had on my regulars. I was so sad and I lost that job because I miss my regular. It's like, and then even at Sam's Club my regulars.

1877
03:17:16.230 --> 03:17:21.990
Nicole Roybal: Just like people that are there all the time and just having conversations with people and just talking and just

1878
03:17:23.670 --> 03:17:32.940
Nicole Roybal: Because I know a lot of people are lonely and they don't have people to talk to. So sometimes I like to like do that, personally, like we can have a conversation. You know what I mean, like, I'll listen to your story.

1879
03:17:37.680 --> 03:17:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. No, I'm not very subtle. What I'm doing here trying to figure out when some common ground is and try and see what direction you might check out. You may not know it.

1880
03:17:48.870 --> 03:18:00.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Until you get there and there's nothing wrong with going in and ruling it out. This isn't the place for me want to do something else. But you can get started in it. That would be a step towards

1881
03:18:00.690 --> 03:18:08.130
Gwenevere Abriel: A career something that's kind of exciting for you so you can already see that you tend to like older adults.

1882
03:18:08.460 --> 03:18:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You like listening you like being of service to people on an emotional level where you can listen to their stories and be available to them. What kind of curse can you think of that that would be a good fit.

1883
03:18:22.290 --> 03:18:26.580
Nicole Roybal: Caretaker but I don't want to wait but

1884
03:18:28.530 --> 03:18:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1885
03:18:30.180 --> 03:18:35.940
Nicole Roybal: That's like so you don't necessarily have to do that. But like any friend that I've had. They

1886
03:18:37.200 --> 03:18:41.670
Nicole Roybal: Ended up having to do that when they and even I've had. It's been a caretaker, they end up having that

1887
03:18:42.780 --> 03:18:45.600
Nicole Roybal: You know, and it's different. It's an adult. It's just do

1888
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:48.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

1889
03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1890
03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: So in the medical industry. You've got your meeting with people all the time.

1891
03:18:59.220 --> 03:19:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you meet balance it a little bit by being able to have that kind of interaction with someone and

1892
03:19:07.620 --> 03:19:13.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe go back in some way, shape, or form to the medical field I

1893
03:19:13.650 --> 03:19:17.850
Nicole Roybal: didn't like it. I really don't like it. The doctors

1894
03:19:20.010 --> 03:19:26.040
Nicole Roybal: The doctors with down. I'm like, I don't know. They're just like the pope couple places I did work out there. And then I worked at

1895
03:19:27.390 --> 03:19:36.780
Nicole Roybal: Some other small office was on. It's like a week and both places. The doctors just like look down on you, like, Oh, your pay grade is so much lower like

1896
03:19:37.560 --> 03:19:45.990
Nicole Roybal: only talk to you when needed. Like, why don't you talk to you. Other than that, yeah, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't like the way the doctors treat me. I get it.

1897
03:19:47.790 --> 03:19:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

1898
03:19:48.570 --> 03:19:53.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Mr RW, one of the one of the neat things about going to

1899
03:19:55.020 --> 03:20:03.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Either a college or junior college is you have time to figure this what we're doing. We have time to figure it out.

1900
03:20:03.810 --> 03:20:08.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, is there still an interest to pursue that.

1901
03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:11.040
Nicole Roybal: Not really, honestly.

1902
03:20:11.460 --> 03:20:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to do a trade school instead

1903
03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:23.520
Nicole Roybal: Of it. Well, yeah, I want to go to see an M. And I don't know, I have to do all my prerequisites and then that'll give me time to figure out what actually want to go there for, but

1904
03:20:24.240 --> 03:20:34.260
Nicole Roybal: I already have $1,000 in school debt. So I don't want to go to CNN and then have more school debt, like, so that's why that's what's stopping me, honestly. Yeah.

1905
03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:37.260
Nicole Roybal: Okay, thousand dollars is a lot to oh

1906
03:20:46.710 --> 03:20:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: How much you paying back on that.

1907
03:20:49.560 --> 03:20:51.870
Nicole Roybal: Nothing right now. So I'm not working. I got a

1908
03:20:53.760 --> 03:20:58.560
Nicole Roybal: Different difference or I don't know what it was, but something on my on the loan and

1909
03:20:59.670 --> 03:21:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: You may want to consider looking into how much interest is being accrued on that $8,000, you may want to look into it. I know looking at things is a big piece of fright sobriety.

1910
03:21:16.620 --> 03:21:16.890
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1911
03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: It's uncomfortable, but it's a whole lot better. Once you get there and you find out the information

1912
03:21:24.480 --> 03:21:37.410
Nicole Roybal: Well, I look at my. Am I on tuition or something that website and I looked at it like a week ago and I don't know how to read all that stuff. And I looked at it and it says everything. But I don't know how to read it and I didn't know what a crude

1913
03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:41.220
Nicole Roybal: Would you say interesting is

1914
03:21:42.330 --> 03:21:51.180
Nicole Roybal: I don't know. They just said that basically after we do it every year after like 25 years or something. As long as I redo it every year, then like

1915
03:21:51.960 --> 03:22:03.570
Nicole Roybal: The payment will go down. And then at the end of the 25 years also have to pay whatever the rest is, I don't know. They said something weird I couldn't understand it. Exactly, exactly how I felt. I don't know what it means.

1916
03:22:03.870 --> 03:22:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay it. That's my expression is not not knowing my expression.

1917
03:22:09.720 --> 03:22:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Is actually knowing

1918
03:22:11.610 --> 03:22:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So I highly encourage you to be informed 8000 can turn into 20,000

1919
03:22:20.190 --> 03:22:21.090
Really low

1920
03:22:22.260 --> 03:22:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Interest.

1921
03:22:24.570 --> 03:22:29.040
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't mind you deferring it because the interest is higher, which means

1922
03:22:31.290 --> 03:22:37.950
Nicole Roybal: Well, there's just something about that I could just go away like that. If I keep doing it, though. And I'm just going away, they'll pay itself off or something.

1923
03:22:39.090 --> 03:22:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Without you paying

1924
03:22:40.380 --> 03:22:43.170
Nicole Roybal: Yeah I know, Timmy sense to me.

1925
03:22:44.490 --> 03:22:44.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

1926
03:22:45.420 --> 03:22:45.810
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1927
03:22:45.840 --> 03:22:46.590
Exactly. Okay.

1928
03:22:47.730 --> 03:22:49.890
Gwenevere Abriel: More you need to be more informed.

1929
03:22:51.570 --> 03:22:54.180
Nicole Roybal: I didn't understand the thing. So it's like okay

1930
03:22:55.320 --> 03:22:56.310
It's not okay.

1931
03:22:57.840 --> 03:22:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: This is a debt. This is your debt.

1932
03:23:01.200 --> 03:23:10.380
Gwenevere Abriel: I asked questions, you get someone on the phone and you you ask them, I don't understand what is the interest rate during the period of deferment

1933
03:23:13.710 --> 03:23:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: After a year all end up owing how much, what will my new debt be if I keep this in deferment

1934
03:23:22.890 --> 03:23:23.070
Now,

1935
03:23:24.300 --> 03:23:31.320
Gwenevere Abriel: My point the overarching point here is if you don't understand something. This is your debt, not the guy on the phones.

1936
03:23:31.890 --> 03:23:32.370
Nicole Roybal: He doesn't

1937
03:23:32.430 --> 03:23:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Get it, you need to understand it because with understanding comes empowerment and choice.

1938
03:23:40.650 --> 03:23:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And it also notice how you're not making a payment on it, but you don't want another debt and

1939
03:23:47.730 --> 03:23:48.750
Nicole Roybal: Yeah I know, right.

1940
03:23:49.590 --> 03:23:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: No, you're not making a payment on it. You're not even

1941
03:23:54.120 --> 03:23:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not feeling a debt.

1942
03:23:58.590 --> 03:23:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not making a payment.

1943
03:24:00.210 --> 03:24:04.020
Nicole Roybal: Does that make sense, though, so I'm not caring about it.

1944
03:24:05.070 --> 03:24:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But who cares if you get another one. You're not gonna make it so

1945
03:24:10.620 --> 03:24:11.880
Gwenevere Abriel: My about, hold on.

1946
03:24:12.840 --> 03:24:13.260
Yeah.

1947
03:24:18.150 --> 03:24:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Sometimes

1948
03:24:21.030 --> 03:24:35.460
Gwenevere Abriel: People work two and three jobs to pay down a debt. Listen, sometimes people work jobs and they go to school part time. Sometimes they work those jobs.

1949
03:24:36.660 --> 03:24:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And they only take a credit

1950
03:24:39.090 --> 03:24:45.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Or two at a time so that they don't go into debt. There's a lot of different ways to go about this.

1951
03:24:46.470 --> 03:24:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's a bit over simplified to say I don't want a debt. I'm not going back to school. Isn't it a little over simplified to say that

1952
03:24:56.460 --> 03:24:57.120
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

1953
03:24:57.990 --> 03:24:59.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Then what are you going to do

1954
03:25:00.420 --> 03:25:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You see,

1955
03:25:03.210 --> 03:25:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What, what's the alternative, what's your plan is anybody asking you and holding you to the fire here.

1956
03:25:12.450 --> 03:25:14.130
Nicole Roybal: No, but they should be

1957
03:25:16.320 --> 03:25:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Mothers not going to your dad's going to do this sweeping thing you need to get one.

1958
03:25:22.410 --> 03:25:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Your, your grandparents, and I just heard it from the grandparents to they're going to say you're an adult work it out.

1959
03:25:29.940 --> 03:25:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: It may be inconvenient. But at some point, you're going to need to take on one by one. You don't have to do all at once. Just one and make that call.

1960
03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Around the debt that's a step in in the adult responsible direction and it is unpleasant. But I'll tell you it does actually feel good to be like, I found on to the call.

Gwenevere Abriel: If you keep deferring it

1980
03:27:42.090 --> 03:27:44.670

2066
03:35:03.270 --> 03:35:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the difficult thing. It's your style to

03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You are no different than every other person.

2097
03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: You're no different. We don't know.

2098
03:37:55.020 --> 03:38:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't know when you when you got to your grandparents house, how is this going to be, how am I going to be their advocate. How is this going to go how you didn't know when you went and you did this.

2099
03:38:06.300 --> 03:38:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: This externship how's this going to go. How's this good. We don't know till we get there.

2100
03:38:12.570 --> 03:38:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: If you operate, not knowing. Watch. Don't say anything just yet. If you can tolerate not knowing I am learning

2101
03:38:24.270 --> 03:38:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You can tolerate that.

2102
03:38:27.240 --> 03:38:30.390
Nicole Roybal: Oh my god, that's why with drinks, I'd be so scared.

2103
03:38:31.500 --> 03:38:36.870
Nicole Roybal: Of not knowing I just go to let me drink and I'll just, I can handle any situation is on some junk junk.

2104
03:38:37.920 --> 03:38:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm learning.

2105
03:38:39.120 --> 03:38:46.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, there's so much freedom in there, Nicole. I'm learning. You're learning in here with us. You're here.

2106
03:38:49.260 --> 03:38:59.010
Nicole Roybal: That's insane. Oh, that's what it was. That's what made me feel the need to drink is I was scared of not knowing what's going to happen. You just like open my eyes like whoa, that's what it was. I was nervous.

2107
03:39:00.840 --> 03:39:06.720
Nicole Roybal: And that made me want to drink and then not knowing. Oh my god, but not knowing that is the main thing. Excuse me.

2108
03:39:07.740 --> 03:39:10.500
Nicole Roybal: With with the job, my grandparents, I kind of already knew.

2109
03:39:11.700 --> 03:39:12.240
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

2110
03:39:13.440 --> 03:39:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

2111
03:39:16.740 --> 03:39:17.790
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know either.

2112
03:39:18.330 --> 03:39:18.840
Yeah.

2113
03:39:20.160 --> 03:39:27.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning I kid you not. What if I don't have clients, how will I pay for things

2114
03:39:29.010 --> 03:39:39.960
Gwenevere Abriel: How do I know that I'm going to spend two years in a master's degree and I'm going to be any darn good at it. How do I know I don't, I'm not God and

2115
03:39:41.820 --> 03:39:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: It's ridiculous to think we can predict the future. I don't have a crystal ball. Not it was do it is very human of you it's human of your brain to want to go.

2116
03:39:54.540 --> 03:40:04.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, this is dangerous. This is going to get us in trouble. This is going to bring rejection. This is also stupid over here. I'm not going to even try. Don't even go there. I get what the brain does

2117
03:40:05.220 --> 03:40:13.020
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's not the only part of the brain that you have access to. You have this up here, which can use logic and it can say to you.

2118
03:40:14.880 --> 03:40:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: No one can tell the future. What you do is you do the best you can. You give it your all and then you check it off the list as well that when I didn't like

2119
03:40:24.900 --> 03:40:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Me go talk to these people. I kind of like myself and I was hanging out with with older folks. So maybe I'll do a job that has to do with that. But more administrative so that I'm not dealing with poop.

2120
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.330
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

2121
03:40:43.530 --> 03:40:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: That's important. Nicole that might be all it takes is just sort of saying there's and of course there's jobs that meet that but we don't know what to call them yet because

2122
03:40:52.530 --> 03:41:07.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We're not in the field. We're not getting our hands in it. We got to get our hands in and be talking to people and in when you're in school or doing a job, then you get to find out, it gets out. Wasn't that one who this one was really close.

2123
03:41:07.320 --> 03:41:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This yeah this was really close to what I want to do.

2124
03:41:11.610 --> 03:41:12.060
All my

2125
03:41:13.440 --> 03:41:19.290
Nicole Roybal: My older sister was time because I'm how I've been like cooking for my grandma like you should show food and stuff and

2126
03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:26.190
Nicole Roybal: They ate some of my food. And it was just like meat and potatoes like ground beef and potatoes and then I don't know.

2127
03:41:26.550 --> 03:41:32.790
Nicole Roybal: Simple things. But anyway, they're just like, oh my god. Like you could really good. My sister is Tommy, what do you think about getting into cooking.

2128
03:41:33.390 --> 03:41:41.310
Nicole Roybal: She's like, she's like trying to help me find my career, you know, and I'm like, I don't. I love cooking now and I don't want to pursue it as a career and then end up hating it

2129
03:41:42.270 --> 03:41:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, you just did that with school too.

2130
03:41:44.850 --> 03:41:48.330
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, exactly. And I don't want to, well,

2131
03:41:49.440 --> 03:41:51.300
Nicole Roybal: With the medical system thing I didn't

2132
03:41:52.230 --> 03:41:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, no, no, no, no, no. The I will hate it.

2133
03:41:56.970 --> 03:41:57.690
Nicole Roybal: Yeah.

2134
03:41:58.860 --> 03:41:59.340
Nicole Roybal: I'm

2135
03:41:59.790 --> 03:42:01.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You lost focus you lost

2136
03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:02.670
Nicole Roybal: My little brother.

2137
03:42:03.450 --> 03:42:05.760
Nicole Roybal: got distracted. Yeah.

2138
03:42:06.420 --> 03:42:14.550
Nicole Roybal: Nobody. Well, I don't want to end up eating it. Because like I said, I love it. And it's something I'm passionate about. But I don't want to do it and then hate it. Okay, sorry such repeated or

2139
03:42:17.490 --> 03:42:19.470
Nicole Roybal: I'm sorry. No, sorry. Did someone once

2140
03:42:22.290 --> 03:42:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You have this is shown up before this is, I don't know. I don't know that I've seen this one before. You've really brought some an interesting phenomenon here.

2141
03:42:32.880 --> 03:42:40.710
Nicole Roybal: And she was saying that she like it like it like started like a food, Chuck, or even I could be like a head chef like Monica from friends or something.

2142
03:42:41.760 --> 03:42:48.720
Nicole Roybal: And my best friend. Tiffany that I've talked about before she has a food chef. Then she doesn't get started because her

2143
03:42:49.260 --> 03:42:56.640
Gwenevere Abriel: What, why, why do you smoke marijuana, you might end up painting it, why are you talking to a therapist, you might end up hating it

2144
03:42:57.090 --> 03:43:01.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you wear cute little under things I might. I might end up hating it. Why do I

2145
03:43:02.250 --> 03:43:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Boyfriend I might end up hating him this logic is like I literally don't understand it. You've got yourself one that has completely immobilized you

2146
03:43:13.140 --> 03:43:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: It, it makes no sense to me. I don't think I've run across one of those before you're going to have to teach me. I'm going to be learning from you about what that is.

2147
03:43:24.270 --> 03:43:29.610
Nicole Roybal: It's the only thing that's so anything I feel that way about too is, I don't know why.

2148
03:43:30.750 --> 03:43:36.900
Nicole Roybal: And what you just said. Makes sense. Like, you don't know anything's gonna end up. I just don't want to end up doing it and then

2149
03:43:38.670 --> 03:43:40.950
Nicole Roybal: When I come home. I don't want to cook. So I've been cooking all day.

2150
03:43:42.150 --> 03:43:43.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So what

2151
03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:45.930
Nicole Roybal: I have to do when I come on

2152
03:43:46.230 --> 03:43:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't

2153
03:43:48.750 --> 03:43:49.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Know, you know,

2154
03:43:53.130 --> 03:43:57.510
Nicole Roybal: I guess I'm looking at my relationship again, Daniel.

2155
03:43:58.680 --> 03:44:00.150
Nicole Roybal: says yes I have dinner every night.

2156
03:44:03.270 --> 03:44:05.100
Nicole Roybal: And he's not grown up enough to make himself.

2157
03:44:09.150 --> 03:44:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: But you did this same belief system with school just a little bit by take classes I might end up hating that I took classes like you that that does apply also with school you use that same kind of thing with school to

2158
03:44:24.240 --> 03:44:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't quite understand it. I got more learning to do with you I'm

2159
03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:30.990
Nicole Roybal: Sure I'll complicated one.

2160
03:44:33.180 --> 03:44:35.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But do you want to understand it.

2161
03:44:35.730 --> 03:44:37.440
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, of course I did.

2162
03:44:39.270 --> 03:44:41.400
Nicole Roybal: Feel so lost and everything. Of course I do.

2163
03:44:45.780 --> 03:44:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you willing to be a little uncomfortable if it means that you find something that you enjoy doing.

2164
03:44:54.780 --> 03:45:03.750
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, well, yeah, I feel like that's kind of the price you have to be uncomfortable to get to the place where you're very comfortable. Like, not necessarily. It's just kind of like a metaphor I guess in China.

2165
03:45:05.100 --> 03:45:06.180
Nicole Roybal: Russia right

2166
03:45:07.800 --> 03:45:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to do with delayed gratification. You know, you go to school, you get a training. You do know how to do it.

2167
03:45:16.200 --> 03:45:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: But you drank yourself through it. This one, this next one will be you being okay so your big moment today had to do with I can enjoy being a student and learning.

2168
03:45:31.020 --> 03:45:43.410
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, and actually, when I was in school. I really loved it. I left school like I could largest but it was like more of like being involved with like for like the pep rallies and stuff like that but

2169
03:45:44.790 --> 03:45:58.950
Nicole Roybal: I did like learning and I was always really good as long as I was sober. But when I went to valley. I didn't know I wouldn't smoke weed at school. I'd say so. We're all day and then I go home, do my homework. And then so be it. After that was like my reward and I know, I know.

2170
03:46:00.900 --> 03:46:16.950
Nicole Roybal: I had straight A's that whole time when I wasn't smoking weed during school out. I did so good in school and then I went to Brooklyn with for the medical I was drinking all the time. So I got straight A's. The whole time, but I was drinking. I don't remember. None of it now. Yeah, okay.

2171
03:46:17.580 --> 03:46:28.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's, let's put a pin in this this session today, but really hold on to maybe the the discomfort for you the stretching the growth point for you is

2172
03:46:30.930 --> 03:46:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: The students and for now. It might be just a call on a student trying to understand my debt.

2173
03:46:37.890 --> 03:46:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not stupid. It's just, these are big words and I you know I really have kind of been in some denial, but I'm really trying to get myself informed.

2174
03:46:47.160 --> 03:46:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Adults talk like that. That's okay.

2175
03:46:53.280 --> 03:46:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself permission to talk like that.

2176
03:46:57.540 --> 03:47:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Same the same thing. It took with the primary care physician. So what you didn't know you haven't had anybody guiding you. Why do you give yourself such a hard time for crying out loud.

2177
03:47:08.130 --> 03:47:09.600
Nicole Roybal: I don't know, I just thought to myself,

2178
03:47:10.500 --> 03:47:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You just haven't had anybody teaching you along the way you're

2179
03:47:15.090 --> 03:47:21.450
Gwenevere Abriel: You give yourself a hard time about not knowing something that you never learned. Give yourself a break. You're learning it now.

2180
03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You, you're going to get what you want. I have every bit of faith. It's just you're in your own way.

2181
03:47:28.740 --> 03:47:30.900
Nicole Roybal: I just, I guess, because I always pride myself on like

2182
03:47:32.190 --> 03:47:35.730
Nicole Roybal: Like around like my family or like Daniel or whatever, like I

2183
03:47:36.480 --> 03:47:48.450
Nicole Roybal: I always know like these bigger words and I always use different words. And I was like, what that will that mean and I still so smart. So whenever I don't feel smart. I feel like this small. I'm like, I know I'm smart, why the hell do I do, I notice I should know this.

2184
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.500
Nicole Roybal: Again,

2185
03:47:49.830 --> 03:47:57.300
Nicole Roybal: Get mad at myself for not knowing it, but it's like, like you said, that's what like learning is you have to like that's what new things. Are you have to learn

2186
03:47:57.870 --> 03:48:02.430
Nicole Roybal: It's exciting. Yeah. And I don't know I get so mad at myself for not knowing

2187
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You just said it, you said this is I've carved out this tiny little space in my family that I get to have value with knowing these words.

2188
03:48:14.310 --> 03:48:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it's being threatened.

2189
03:48:18.600 --> 03:48:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's carve out carve out a different identity.

2190
03:48:21.540 --> 03:48:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can see white being the student for life, enjoy learning

2191
03:48:28.050 --> 03:48:43.230
Gwenevere Abriel: What if that's your identity. Now guess what, when someone says, Oh, you don't know this now. It's not a threat anymore. Now, it's like, Oh, good. Watch, Nicole. Now I get to learn something right now. Oh boy. It's very different. It's no longer threatening.

2192
03:48:43.890 --> 03:48:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know if it's just by saying that's going to make a difference, but maybe we'll can do some work.

2193
03:48:48.060 --> 03:48:50.970
Nicole Roybal: On that next time. Oh, I heard no was writing it down, what you're saying.

2194
03:48:52.860 --> 03:48:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's different to hear it, then, to actually feel it.

2195
03:48:57.660 --> 03:48:58.740
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so

2196
03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Give yourself a chance and do a little one by maybe giving those folks a call and sitting with

2197
03:49:07.350 --> 03:49:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That discomfort of not knowing all those terms and giving yourself permission to ask three and four times. I know, I know I'm going to be your toughest call today. Could you do

2198
03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: More time, talk to me like I'm a fifth grader. You can do it. Come on now.

2199
03:49:21.540 --> 03:49:22.560
Yeah.

2200
03:49:23.760 --> 03:49:35.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's say you're going to be in group on Tuesday. And do you want to stick with this timing or do you want to make a change on the timing of individual therapy like maybe when you're

2201
03:49:35.760 --> 03:49:36.510
Nicole Roybal: Not perfect

2202
03:49:37.350 --> 03:49:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: But what about when you're any chance you could

2203
03:49:41.940 --> 03:49:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Be at your grandparents or no.

2204
03:49:44.610 --> 03:49:52.500
Nicole Roybal: No Fridays. My mom goes over there. So I'm good on Fridays, and then Thursday. Oh no, to 6am nervous. Okay, well,

2205
03:49:52.980 --> 03:49:54.330
Nicole Roybal: I don't, I don't like

2206
03:49:54.390 --> 03:50:04.110
Nicole Roybal: The group on Tuesday. And that's why I keep trying to, like, I don't know, because I started off in the group on Thursday, and I've told you guys this and I, I just, I like the people better on Thursday.

2207
03:50:05.490 --> 03:50:14.550
Nicole Roybal: I just said Tuesday I started off on Thursday. And I'm not trying to, I still go on to this I problem but i i like to people better on Thursday I like, I like that group.

2208
03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I understand. It is good chemistry, um, let me see if I if I can pull it off, let me let me talk. Let me see if there's enough people to make that a possibility. Okay.

2209
03:50:26.700 --> 03:50:35.700
Nicole Roybal: If not, it's totally fine. Like, I don't mind, I'll go to these dates. I'm not trying to like you know like what I did this week. I'm sorry, so sorry about that. I know you got mad at me for that.

2210
03:50:36.300 --> 03:50:40.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Well I it's not mad. It has to do with um

2211
03:50:41.580 --> 03:50:43.680
Nicole Roybal: I didn't even email on schedule. That's just like

2212
03:50:44.760 --> 03:51:02.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It has to do with this concept of people that are working a program are used to kind of hustling and kind of like running their own deal and they don't kind of pay attention to this to other and so what ends up happening is

2213
03:51:03.900 --> 03:51:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: You think I just can go anywhere and do anything but you have an impact on other people. And typically in addiction. There isn't an awareness of that and so

2214
03:51:15.630 --> 03:51:33.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what that was about. It had to do with unfortunately the inconvenience of checking in and saying I you're doing it now. You're doing the part about I really prefer the people in Thursday. But here's the deal. Those people won't stay the same.

2215
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's about the people were in a conundrum here, people won't stay the same. Notice how several of them weren't there.

2216
03:51:41.490 --> 03:51:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

2217
03:51:43.440 --> 03:51:46.170
Nicole Roybal: I haven't seen her in a while. That's one of the ones I really liked

2218
03:51:46.650 --> 03:51:52.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because they're on a different schedule. Their further down, it may be coming every other week, or maybe monthly

2219
03:51:53.700 --> 03:52:07.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. That's, yeah. So if it's just people were in a pickle because they're not gonna, it's not gonna it's they're open groups. Oh, I got a new job. Now I need to be going to the 7am group or I need to go. So it changes.

2220
03:52:08.040 --> 03:52:18.810
Nicole Roybal: That's very true. I guess. There's just, there's just like the three people. I guess is that I'm in Thursday group that I like. And I guess I kind of like miss them in a way, you know, I mean,

2221
03:52:19.290 --> 03:52:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

2222
03:52:20.430 --> 03:52:22.470
Nicole Roybal: Because they don't get any really good advice, but I'm

2223
03:52:23.070 --> 03:52:28.110
Nicole Roybal: Also, I'm sorry, just one more thing also Tuesday 7am this last Tuesday.

2224
03:52:29.130 --> 03:52:37.560
Nicole Roybal: They told me how to do my peak up and I can't do my group until I do my pika some friends. I didn't have my peak up with me says here, my mom's

2225
03:52:38.070 --> 03:52:52.290
Nicole Roybal: And so yesterday before group. I literally did it right before group. And so that was another reason why I couldn't really make it because they told me I had to do that. And that's my own problem. I should have took the responsibility and came and got it and did it and I didn't

2226
03:52:52.920 --> 03:52:55.410
Nicole Roybal: So there is an added as to why couldn't

2227
03:52:55.620 --> 03:52:59.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Show up right it's probably

2228
03:53:00.750 --> 03:53:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: This other one which has to do seven in the morning is inconvenient for someone who's not a morning person.

2229
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:09.150
Nicole Roybal: I

2230
03:53:09.210 --> 03:53:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And I didn't have my cup.

2231
03:53:13.860 --> 03:53:20.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And yes, it would be lovely. If it was this other these other people were there, but I happen to know they're not going to be there. A lot of the time.

2232
03:53:20.850 --> 03:53:26.580
Nicole Roybal: I think that inconveniencing me though, like do going on Tuesday is a good thing because like you said, you gotta like

2233
03:53:27.930 --> 03:53:30.360
Nicole Roybal: I gotta start getting used to get up early, so

2234
03:53:31.590 --> 03:53:37.440
Nicole Roybal: I still, I don't have to go to my grandparents on the weekends like 1112 you know as I still could wake up late.

2235
03:53:37.860 --> 03:53:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta

2236
03:53:38.640 --> 03:53:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta jump out of here, but let us do it.

2237
03:53:40.410 --> 03:53:42.480
Nicole Roybal: But I guess it's a good thing. So I'll go Tuesday.

2238
03:53:43.410 --> 03:53:47.130
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple more weeks where you're attending 7am on Tuesdays.

2239
03:53:47.280 --> 03:53:47.670
Nicole Roybal: Let me see.

2240
03:53:48.030 --> 03:53:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: If I can find another space that might open up, but I love what you did today. I'm really proud of you.

2241
03:53:57.360 --> 03:54:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You you own that responsibility part instead of getting defensive right and getting mad at me, which you could

2242
03:54:05.820 --> 03:54:07.020
Nicole Roybal: Might be interested in doing.

2243
03:54:07.020 --> 03:54:07.500
That

2244
03:54:09.360 --> 03:54:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, right. Well, it's my grandma and I'm not budging. Right.

2245
03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I get it.

2246
03:54:13.650 --> 03:54:26.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I get all of it, but I'm proud of you for looking at another layer of it which is I probably do need to take some responsibility. And at some point, I'm going to have to do these parts and it's it's hard it's

2247
03:54:27.690 --> 03:54:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard. I got you. It is

2248
03:54:31.110 --> 03:54:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, but there's going to be you're getting those some real perks to it, too. Okay, I highly recommend it. It's fun over here.

2249
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The, the water is fresh over here it's warm and sunny, there are good days to being an adult, I promise is good also

2250
03:54:47.310 --> 03:54:54.690
Nicole Roybal: Yeah, so we're meeting again next Friday at the same time. Yes. Okay. Just wanted to be sure before we leave.

2251
03:54:55.440 --> 03:54:58.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Real quick, do I need to send a message about medicine or no.

2252
03:54:59.340 --> 03:55:00.660
Nicole Roybal: No, no, I won't get on that.

2253
03:55:00.870 --> 03:55:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I'll see you on Tuesday.

2254
03:55:02.160 --> 03:55:05.040
Nicole Roybal: Okay, thank you. Have a good one. Bye bye.
