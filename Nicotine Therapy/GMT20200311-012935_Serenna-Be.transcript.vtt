Serenna Beers: That depends on you, but that's not always a bad thing. Right, right.

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:01.110
Serenna Beers: There I saw it in a show once where somebody said, I mean, it wasn't a very nice show but it said crying takes the sat out. And I don't remember what movie it was, but I thought, Oh my gosh, that is so smart because it's true. Right.

Serenna Beers: Yeah, so we'll just get right get right on it. So tell me, what brings you to bright heart help, why, why. Now, why is it that you are seeking help.

18
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.920
Donna H.: Okay. So about a year and a half ago, I was on the Suboxone program in Crescent City, California.

19
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.130
Donna H.: Okay, I was on it for about three years. So I had caught I'd gotten some trouble caught a couple cases.

20
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.700
Donna H.: And needed to get clean they'd put me on drug court. So I was looking at prison time if I didn't get clean and do a program

21
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.760
Donna H.: And I have a son, he is back then. He was only like two or three he's now six almost seven but

22
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:52.650
Donna H.: For three years I did really, really good. I mean I completed drug court with not one dirty. I got a job. I got a house. I mean, I was doing the whole life thing. I was actually assistant manager at the place I worked in

23
00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:06.630
Donna H.: And nice. Yeah. And then my spouse. I was with ended up he got diagnosed with brain cancer. And that was a battle for about a year and a half, and then eventually he ended up relaxing on his drug of choice, which was met.

24
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.640
Donna H.: And then I ended up relaxing along with him thinking it would bring us closer

25
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.480
Donna H.: And

26
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:22.260
Donna H.: Math wasn't my drug of choice and I never really knew like there was a lot of mental games and stuff. He played on me like he really broke my heart and screwed me over and

27
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:33.060
Donna H.: Totally just like did identity theft on me, like, all kinds of stuff. So I was devastated and brokenhearted. And I ended up having to get my son to his

28
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:43.380
Donna H.: biological father because I was moving out and I had nowhere to go and whatnot. So, and then for like a whole year, almost a year and a half. I kind of just

29
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.950
Donna H.: I started doing heroin again and and just slowly started getting back into using and whatnot and

30
00:02:50.610 --> 00:03:02.310
Donna H.: I don't want to completely lose myself again. And I want my son to have stability and structure again and I just I want to get my life back together to where it was. I know what I'm capable of and sleep.

31
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:11.610
Donna H.: sleeping on the floor of my grandpa's fits well with my kid is like being nice me like there was no need for me to be there for a whole year and a half. You know what I mean. So

32
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.560
Donna H.: Just a short time I've been on Suboxone I've got a job and I've got a place in my own. And so things are like really falling into place.

33
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:32.910
Serenna Beers: Good. So tell me about your story with substances. When did all of it, start when when we're when were you first exposed when did it get the absolute worst

34
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.140
Donna H.: And one way or another drugs have always been a part of my life because of my parents. Okay, so I grew up in that drug scene.

35
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:55.110
Donna H.: I did my first. Okay. So I started with cigarettes probably like 12 years old cigarettes and alcohol. I never alcohol. I never really became like completely dependent on it. It was just thing I did in party by partied a lot back then.

36
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.130
Donna H.: And then out about 15 I started with oxy cotton and a friend had given me.

37
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:19.590
Donna H.: It was going around my school, sadly, and a friend gave me a line of axes and it just, I kind of did it to fit in at first and then became addicted. You know that thing. And then once the ops. He's got taken out about 1819 I started heroin.

38
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.820
Donna H.: And then I started injecting the heroin and then

39
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.490
Donna H.: It got really, really bad. So, this time on my relapse and

40
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.930
Donna H.: It got really bad right before I called right heart. I was at three grams a day or more of heroin.

41
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:50.430
Donna H.: And I was losing everything slowly losing everything and like I said I had nowhere to live my kid's dad took me to custody Courtney's trying to take my son because of me selling drugs and using drugs.

42
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.950
Donna H.: And I wasn't selling the drugs, but I was using them. He said, I was selling, but I wasn't and i but i was using the drugs and

43
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:14.910
Donna H.: I didn't want to lose my kid and stuff. You know what I mean. So at the end. It's been I was actively using every single day for a year and a half, straight and for the last fucking oh sorry for my language for the last probably six months I was

44
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.420
Donna H.: At

45
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.820
Donna H.: Least three grams.

46
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.970
Serenna Beers: Do you hear that we got

47
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.140
Donna H.: Yeah, that's it.

48
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.240
Donna H.: That's my neighbor, they just

49
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.260
Serenna Beers: Oh, okay.

50
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.050
Serenna Beers: No, I wasn't sure if that was our connection or I didn't know if somebody

51
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.120
Serenna Beers: Jumping or web what that was.

52
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.100
Serenna Beers: Okay.

53
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.380
Serenna Beers: Um, what about, okay, chronic pain. Do you

54
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.980
Serenna Beers: Do

55
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.460
Serenna Beers: Do you have any of that. And if you do it.

56
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.740
Donna H.: When did it start, what was

57
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.270
Serenna Beers: Getting event. OK.

58
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.070
Donna H.: OK, so back pain. I've only

59
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.700
Donna H.: Seen

60
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.440
Donna H.: Like in the

61
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.250
Donna H.: Up in the upper neck and in the lumbar and then

62
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.860
Donna H.: And there was other things wrong with me to diagnosis. There's a lot of it.

63
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:56.940
Donna H.: A lot of bad thousands. I have some times where it just feels like I can't even walk because of you know the nerves, or the muscles or whatever. But what they said to me and my doctor's appointment was that

64
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:10.320
Donna H.: In my spine and between the desk. There's like fluid packets and whatever my fluid pockets are all gone. So like the disc or rubbing on each other and grinding and they're breaking in there, pinching nerves and all that stuff. So

65
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.970
Donna H.: Okay that yeah

66
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:19.170
Serenna Beers: Okay. And when when when did it. When did it get to the point where it was the absolute worst

67
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.600
Donna H.: So that probably would be

68
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.740
Donna H.: Almost two years ago. It got to where it was so bad. I actually had to stop working.

69
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:36.180
Serenna Beers: Okay, did your drug. Did your drug use, go up to did it. That's

70
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:48.600
Donna H.: Well, honestly. That's a big factor into my relapse to heroin, because I was already doing the math. That's what made me make the choice to do the hair relapse, because I was trying to stay away from the heroin, because I already be what it did to me. It was my drug of choice, you

71
00:07:48.600 --> 00:08:00.690
Donna H.: Know and but my pain was so freaking bad that I that's the reason why I gave in to the heroin was just to help with. It was all I could find out that time out with my pain.

72
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.320
Donna H.: Okay, so that played a big factor on me, relaxing on here. Yeah.

73
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.380
Serenna Beers: What about any prior treatment or just history of it.

Serenna Beers: Good, yeah.

84
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:49.920
Serenna Beers: I'm not sure I don't believe it's my connection, but every so often I your face will freeze and I don't hear what you say. So I don't know if you could look at your if it's your phone. Look at the bars to make sure you're in a you're in a good spot. Oh.

103
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.510
Serenna Beers: Issues.

104
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:56.880
Donna H.: I have had mental health, one on one meetings one on ones with the counselor at least once a week, probably for two years straight.

105
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.660
Okay.

106
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.170
Serenna Beers: Okay. And then for substance use.

107
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.200
Donna H.: I've done a god outpatient rehabilitation for three years.

108
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.580
Donna H.: Yeah.

109
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.340
Serenna Beers: Where, where we're at. If you have

110
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.050
Donna H.: Other alcohol and other drugs in Crescent City, California.

111
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:16.860
Okay.

112
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.670
Serenna Beers: All right, and you have any history of SI, H, I, you know,

113
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:31.410
Serenna Beers: Suit suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation or self, self, self harm.

114
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.180
Donna H.: No, nothing like that.

115
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.220
Serenna Beers: Okay. Have you ever been in. Have you ever had felt felt that way if

116
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.180
Serenna Beers: I wanted

117
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:52.260
Donna H.: To hire Seidel before I felt suicidal before I can't say necessarily suicidal, it was just so depressed. I didn't want to die, but I didn't want to live either. So it's just like not a hopelessness of not

118
00:11:52.350 --> 00:12:02.760
Serenna Beers: You know, and I mean type nine that would be what we would call a suicidal ideation ideations are aware, we have the thoughts, which is, I mean, that's

119
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.030
Serenna Beers: Honestly, pretty common. You know when you're

120
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:22.530
Serenna Beers: Using any kind of substances and you're flipping your brain on and off and and you're putting it in overdrive. And you're stimulating it and then you're bringing it down and then you're stimulating it I mean to have si to have suicidal ideation would make a lot of sense. Right.

121
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.550
Donna H.: It doesn't

122
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:34.920
Serenna Beers: Mean that you necessarily are going to act on it or that you have a plan. And that's why that kind of that's what differentiates the ideation from the the the suicidal plan with

123
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.080
Donna H.: With a with an

124
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.530

Donna H.: Awesome.

182
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.780
Serenna Beers: For sure as well that you should should be. That's a huge step. I mean, when you start to

183
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.810
Serenna Beers: Get things back. It's huge. Right.

184
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.620
Donna H.: Know that I didn't shack up with a guy to get the place

185
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.160
Serenna Beers: Or

186
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.880
Donna H.: You know what I mean. I did all on my own like

187
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:54.600
Donna H.: And I don't have to try to depend on anybody to make sure the bills get paid. It's all I know I can. Do you know what I mean.

188
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:55.470
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

189
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.970
Donna H.: Makes me even more prouder.

190
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:10.560
Serenna Beers: As well that you should should be. Um, let's see, one other thing. Let me just ask you really quick. What do you want to work on while you're at bright heart. What does he give me like three top top things

191
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:18.000
Donna H.: How to live online live life on life's terms how to stay in the present. You know what I mean.

192
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.390
Donna H.: I want to get my whole life back together.

193
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.550
Donna H.: Okay, um,

194
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:37.410
Donna H.: Yeah, and I would just like to, you know, be that good person that I know I am. And that good mom like, even while I was using everybody was like, you're such a good mom like you don't see attics actively using being such a good parent

195
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:49.740
Donna H.: But I know I could be a better mom and my son knows that, you know, they mean so to just be to give my son back the mom that he deserves and that he's used to having, you know,

196
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.690
Serenna Beers: Right. It's a big deal.

197
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.630
Serenna Beers: What about a third thing.

198
00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:06.240
Donna H.: I want to start working again and and get like I've never had a license. I want to get my license and want to get my car, I want to stop procrastinating. You know, they mean I wanted to

199
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:13.590
Donna H.: I also want to get rid of the work on getting rid of the guilt and the shame and everything I acquired last year and a half with using again, you know,

200
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.010
Hmm.

201
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:28.170
Serenna Beers: Just remember, you know, there's a difference between guilt and shame, guilt is about what I've done. Shame is about who I am and there's times when a little bit of guilt can actually be healthy to push you.

202
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.310
Donna H.: To get to where you want to

203
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.730
Serenna Beers: Go.

204
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.020
Donna H.: Yeah, even when it

205
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:36.750
Serenna Beers: Turns into shame when we start that I'm awful. I'm a bad person. Now I've done siding.

206
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.550
Donna H.: Now, but I'm a bad person.

207
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.440
Serenna Beers: That's a that is a vicious cycle that you want to stay away from

208
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.790
Donna H.: Yeah, I really try not to get in my own head, and let myself get there you know name.

209
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.980
Serenna Beers: Yes, it makes it really tough.

210
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:56.790
Serenna Beers: Okay, I don't think I missed anything I did ask you if you were in a relationship, I think, right.

211
00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.530
Donna H.: Yeah. Nope, I'm single.

212
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:11.610
Serenna Beers: Okay, cool. And you're just you got you and your son that live with you and we went through all that I think I went through your psych history. And then I asked you three things you wanted to get out of treatment.

213
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:17.040
Serenna Beers: Did I miss anything. Is there anything else that you want to add that you'd like your

214
00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.470
Serenna Beers: Therapist to see

215
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.990
Donna H.: No, I think, I think that's

216
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:23.460
Donna H.: That's it.

217
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:35.820
Serenna Beers: Well. Cool. Well, I wish you the absolute best of luck. Keep on plugging on and be proud of yourself because it takes a lot one just to stand up and say, I need help, and to

218
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.220
Serenna Beers: To do the work, because it's hard work but it's definitely worth it. All right.

219
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:42.540
Donna H.: It is

220
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.370

Guys.
