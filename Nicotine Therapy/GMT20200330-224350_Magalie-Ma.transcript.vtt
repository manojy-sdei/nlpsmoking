Kelley Briscar: Know when to call it when she sent it over. First, she said filter for tablets and I've never been on since I and all this entire time. And then when you mix it. She will it for the front end for stress, she will for twice a day instead of three times a day.

224
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.810
Magalie Marcellus: So it's like within a 24

Kelley Briscar: hour period. We had, you know, it is. I mean, it got fixed and strange, you know, our, you know, so, but it's like

226
00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:03.270
Kelley Briscar: You know, but other than that. No, I don't have any complaints or anything. I would say that, you know,

227
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:10.830
Kelley Briscar: You can be better about you but I mean to not perfect either, you know, I mean, she's human everybody say

228
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:17.880
Kelley Briscar: Like that would like to within like I said like, it's like really but

229
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.680
Kelley Briscar: You know,

230
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:24.330
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, so it was just a specific incident that that's what

231
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.770
Kelley Briscar: Yeah yeah

232
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:32.250
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah, but over the month of how that you receive with the program. What would you leave.

233
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:40.740
Kelley Briscar: Before 901 probably three. Now you know almost for

234
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.150
Kelley Briscar: Me, I'm very happy with this you know i mean i wouldn't be where I am.

235
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.470
Kelley Briscar: Now, if it wasn't for the you know the help of the program.

236
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:57.330
Magalie Marcellus: And I can say certainly those things, you know, sometimes they may be some hiccups here and there, but as

237
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:06.930
Magalie Marcellus: You know, we know about it in the staff would do their best to resolve whatever issues because they want you. We want you guys to be

238
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.990
Magalie Marcellus: Said to be successful in the program.

239
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:10.980
Industry.

240
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:14.340
Magalie Marcellus: Uh huh.

241
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.490
Kelley Briscar: And I think I am so far. You know, I think I'm

242
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:19.260
Kelley Briscar: Good.

243
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:30.750
Magalie Marcellus: So you say you keeping yourself busy so besides I know you know, watching the news. So when when you as the fed by the way.

244
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:43.650
Kelley Briscar: All right. I mean, she was needed. And I thought, I made her actually of politeness or Wednesday for the bat, but she hasn't really the last few days she really hasn't. And so I'm thinking I'm a

245
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:53.520
Kelley Briscar: Week as well because I mean she's had like I said to kind of stop sneezing. So whenever it was I think kind of cleared up.

246
00:32:54.090 --> 00:33:04.590
Kelley Briscar: With it right now. I can't even go inside with her. I have to like stay in the parking lot is again to overcome them, and they take your invite themselves. And it's because of that.

247
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.000
Kelley Briscar: You know,

248
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.570
Magalie Marcellus: When she's a call. You just do enough

249
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:19.620
Kelley Briscar: Enough. You know, like I said she was teasing. So I thought, well, maybe she was starting a cold but fine running around crazy. She's really

250
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.810
Kelley Briscar: Really good. And she really has the last

251
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:28.230
Kelley Briscar: Two, three days she really hasn't been anything. So maybe it was just, you know, make it blue or

252
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.070
Something

253
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.710
Kelley Briscar: Right, or what she'll do is once I cancel the appointment actual fact that

254
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.160
Magalie Marcellus: You never know.

255
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.240
Magalie Marcellus: If she's if she's better

256
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:45.480
Kelley Briscar: It's not, it's

257
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:50.070
Kelley Briscar: Not it's not cheap to take the first of all and

258
00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.760
Kelley Briscar: Right now, like I said, you know, you can you can go inside.

259
00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:01.170
Kelley Briscar: Once again, I understand, but it just kind of feels weird handing over the last

260
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:04.500
Kelley Briscar: Detach going in the right yeah you know

261
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:09.690
Kelley Briscar: If you know if I'm not going to cancel the thoughts that a day off, you know,

262
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.460
Kelley Briscar: You know,

263
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.140
Magalie Marcellus: She's done it better.

264
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:25.560
Kelley Briscar: Yeah, yeah. But even when she was season she was still running around like a crazy, you know, for you know animal. You know, so it didn't seem to a faster make her feel bad, it's just

265
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:38.070
Kelley Briscar: Got to be careful with that. Because sometimes they're like the story systems. I'm for them. So, and I tend to be overly protective I know with, especially after that left so around like that, but

266
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:43.590
Magalie Marcellus: To get sick. Yeah. Was that the first time she'd been SNEEZING Oh is it something

267
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.300
Magalie Marcellus: She's. That's the first time.

268
00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.660
Kelley Briscar: That right now and then, you know, I mean, I noticed with her.

269
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:58.140
Kelley Briscar: You know she seems to go to a little stage. Don't want to stay like versus if need be. But then it's that

270
00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.180
Kelley Briscar: You know I'm going right and then

271
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.450
Kelley Briscar: You know, so it's just like, I don't know if it's just her, you know, and now she is or, you know,

272
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.900
Kelley Briscar: Like I said, you find in every other way. Oh.

273
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:11.820
Shit.

274
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:24.030
Kelley Briscar: I swear, but as long as these Athan fine and not doing it now. You know, I probably will end up here.

275
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.020
Kelley Briscar: Matt. Matt time just yet. So I'll wait.

276
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.710
Magalie Marcellus: For next week this week.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.960

279
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:52.890
Kelley Briscar: Know,

280
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:54.690
Kelley Briscar: But

281
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.210
Kelley Briscar: If not, I have the appointment.

282
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.430
Kelley Briscar: But she keeps me busy.

283
00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:14.250
Kelley Briscar: You know I'm constantly messing around with her. She constantly always wants out of that stage and you know she's the handful. You gotta watch everything that she loves to get in everything she's not supposed to be getting

284
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:23.070
Kelley Briscar: Oh, yeah, yeah. And we were to take the cord up like a with the electrical you're up close and

Kelley Briscar: The GB classes, trying to find one that's the area that timeframe where it's not too far and and it's not really it's not more than a couple days a week, because you know that way. My mom said if I can find something that flows.
