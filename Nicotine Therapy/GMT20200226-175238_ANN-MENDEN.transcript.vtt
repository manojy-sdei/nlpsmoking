32
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:51.450
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and let's start with the alcohol and then we can. Well, first of all, why don't you tell me what what else you're using and then we'll kind of go through them one by one.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.940

ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, good for you. Wow.

39
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.100

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.260
Ken Olsen: Mostly San Juan. Okay.

41
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.610
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, that's a good hospital.

42
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.560
ANN MENDENHALL: I used to work up in Grass Valley.

43
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:32.640
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, and so did you go into the ER there.

44
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.170
ANN MENDENHALL: Or did you do crisis stabilization or

45
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.780
Ken Olsen: Not, I don't think it was. I didn't go to the heart or no.

46
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.650
Okay.

47
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.190
Ken Olsen: I had a heart attack, by the way.

48
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.570
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, when

49
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.040
Ken Olsen: Okay, here's this is why it's kind of strange.

50
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.870
Ken Olsen: Okay, I checked in on like a Monday for

51
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.640
Ken Olsen: For alcohol withdrawal. I mean, I wanted to quit drinking and

52
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:07.290
ANN MENDENHALL: It was just this past Monday or the Monday. Monday before probably

53
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.440
Ken Olsen: Yeah, see my we see what what is today.

54
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.210
ANN MENDENHALL: Is the 26 and so the Monday before would have been like the 17th.

55
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.160
Ken Olsen: OK. OK.

56
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.310

Ken Olsen: Got out on like the 20th

58
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.960

Okay.

63
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.210
Ken Olsen: So it's been kind of a crazy two weeks to

64
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.590
ANN MENDENHALL: Me. It sounds like it.

65
00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.980
Ken Olsen: Yeah. Well, I tried to quit drinking and what do I get a heart attack.

66
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:58.620
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, you know, so you don't get any more heart attacks, you know, staying sober is the absolute best thing you can do

67
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:07.320
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I've sobered up before it just, I was getting out of control. And I knew it. So that's why I turned myself and I couldn't stop. Okay.

68
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.020
ANN MENDENHALL: So are you under the care of a cardiologist. Now that you had to her.

75
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.210
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, there's some other hospitals around there.

76
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.840
ANN MENDENHALL: Like maybe dignity, health and Grass Valley that I don't recommend this highly

95
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.110
Ken Olsen: Monday. Yeah.

96
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.190
Okay.

97
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.540
ANN MENDENHALL: And so, um,

98
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.500
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, we'll get around to that in just a second. Good. I'm really glad you followed up so quickly with her.

99
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:41.340
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so can you tell me what they gave you for detox methods was liberalism or advantage or

100
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:48.330
Ken Olsen: Will while I was in set while while I was inside the hospital. They were given me out of an

101
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.020
Ken Olsen: Okay. And, and then when I saw my

102
00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:01.260
Ken Olsen: My, my, my primary on Monday. She gave me a little equilibrium for a while, couple, couple livery and settle down. Okay.

103
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.250
ANN MENDENHALL: How many does she gave you

104
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:07.800
Ken Olsen: See

105
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.130
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. Yeah, that's good. And how often are you taking them.

106
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.050
Ken Olsen: I take about three day

107
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:35.940
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, I would recommend. I work in a residential I do this, but my main job is actually through Reza drug and alcohol residential rehab facilities, one in

108
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:45.390
ANN MENDENHALL: Forest knows in Marin County and in Sonoma County and so I prescribed, you know, work with

109
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:55.530
ANN MENDENHALL: People who have alcohol use disorder there in a quite a bit. And it's really important to taper down on the Libyan so if I were you. If you only have 15

110
00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:05.400
ANN MENDENHALL: I wouldn't use it three a day for five days and just stop. I would taper that down. So use three a day maybe switch down to two a day than one a day.

111
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:21.240
ANN MENDENHALL: Because it's addictive to and you can have some withdrawals from benzodiazepine you haven't taken that long. So I don't expect, you're going to have it, but it's just sort of you follow your doctor's recommendation, but from my experience in sort of a better way to do it.

112
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.380
Ken Olsen: She wasn't she wasn't crazy about the idea, but I can kind of bigger

113
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.120
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay.

114
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.950
Ken Olsen: Maybe that she had given me, you know,

115
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:42.900
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah. Well, and that's true. I mean, I, you know, certainly deal with that quite a bit, but she's probably not going to prescribe anymore. And I'm not going to prescribe any so I would recommend that you, you do a taper.

116
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.770
Ken Olsen: For your

117
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.700
ANN MENDENHALL: Own comfort.

118
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.950
ANN MENDENHALL: Your will pass the point why we usually prescribe liberalism or

119
00:21:50.520 --> 00:22:02.610
ANN MENDENHALL: Out of n, which is lorazepam at the very beginning in the first like five, six days is to protect you from the seizure. Because when you go cold turkey. If you've been drinking, you know quite a bit. You're at really a high risk of

120
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Seizures so you're past that now.

121
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.360
Ken Olsen: Now it's more kind of comfort but

122
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.960
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, so anyway, just FYI recommend tapering it or other than

123
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:15.990
Ken Olsen: Well, I mean, my doctor told me last are doing nothing for two weeks. I'm just like sitting on my butt, you know,

124
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:16.920
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah.

125
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.090
Ken Olsen: Yeah, that's

126
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.400
ANN MENDENHALL: That's probably kind of challenging

127
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.370
Ken Olsen: Well, I'm not complaining. But

128
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.880
Ken Olsen: Like you said, getting activity and, you know,

129
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:36.240
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, well, yeah, and I would check with them, you know, to, to find out when you can start going for, like, little short walks, even just, you know, in the block.

130
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:48.840
Ken Olsen: Like yeah yeah yeah I got my outtake information for me to, you know, five minutes here five minutes. They're walking, you know, good.

131
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.920
ANN MENDENHALL: And that's going to help you feel better and that's going to help kind of the whole picture.

132
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.230
Ken Olsen: When dog for a walk.

133
00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.500
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, good.

134
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.840
Ken Olsen: What kind of dog. Yeah.

135
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.570
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, sure.

136
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.050
ANN MENDENHALL: That Russell. Oh, yeah. Oh, they're great.

137
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:14.760
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, they need. They need to walk. I've got a little gold golden retriever puppy. That's four months old. It's kind of sleeping under my chair here so

138
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.220
ANN MENDENHALL: She's a lively one too. So

139
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.150
Ken Olsen: Martin stakes by my side all the time. It's, it's just my shadow

140
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.150
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, it's pretty nice to have that chatter, wouldn't it

141
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.130
Ken Olsen: Yes, it's cool. I like it.

142
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:35.820
ANN MENDENHALL: So just a little bit more about the alcohol. Can you tell me at what age you were when you started drinking

143
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.170
ANN MENDENHALL: More or less. It doesn't have to be, you know,

144
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.690
Ken Olsen: 1819

145
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:43.350
Okay.

146
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:50.070
ANN MENDENHALL: And how much have you been drinking recently, like in the last month or two and per day.

147
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.500
Ken Olsen: Well, I was drinking beer and

148
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:59.550
Ken Olsen: And the like the last three weeks I switched to vodka. Okay, that's when I that's when I

149
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:06.420
Ken Olsen: That's when I knew it was getting out of control. That's why I turned myself in because I couldn't stop.

150
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.580
Ken Olsen: Yeah. So how much

151
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:13.350

ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, yeah. And that's so important for your heart, you know, I'm not going to give you a big lecture on it. But, you know, consider, you know, doing whatever you can. I'm sure you're getting this from your cardiologist, and your friends.

233
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.940
Ken Olsen: Talk to my cardiologist yet, but I mean, it wouldn't be safer just debate me

ANN MENDENHALL: Not really.

235
00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:59.190
ANN MENDENHALL: No, I mean you you put yourself at at really high risk for, you know, respiratory issues, especially when you've had a heart attack, it would definitely not be safer today.

237
00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.590

ANN MENDENHALL: No, that's really hard. Yeah.

240
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.150

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:43.560
ANN MENDENHALL: Those things usually work pretty well. So I would give it a shot.

249
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:48.990
Ken Olsen: Well, I figured, once I once I talked my cardiologist, and

250
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:59.550
Ken Olsen: And actually the one that smokes. I live with my dad and he wants to quit smoking, too. So we got we got we're like a carton of cigarettes, left, right.

Ken Olsen: I know. I just know

259
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:32.100
ANN MENDENHALL: I worried because it is the highest risk for, you know, additional heart attacks and you know so many other things. So how about do you feel like you eat healthy meals or no.

260
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:46.350

267
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.790
ANN MENDENHALL: It's tough. When you have surgery like that, but it's

268

ANN MENDENHALL: Well, you know, I think when you get back to getting a little exercise, you know, in doing a heart healthy diet is really important. You always end up losing weight. With that, you know, really.

472
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:30.990
ANN MENDENHALL: And I'm sure your doctors talking to you about that. I'm not going to go into depth at that but you know I don't know if you eat a lot of meat that really cutting back and read

473
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.970
Ken Olsen: I used to not anymore.

474
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:34.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, okay, good.

475
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.790
Ken Olsen: It's been been to innovation, a little bit lately. Oh, okay.

476
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:44.490
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, any kind of fish is really good, you know, in chicken is ok to yes

477
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:47.130
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I had chicken. The other day. Yeah.

478
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.420
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, lots of veggies and fruits and, you know, cutting back on the fats, but

479
00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:52.920
ANN MENDENHALL: Not all of them and eating them.

480
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.200
Ken Olsen: And I like vegetables and fruit. So I'm lucky.

481
00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:56.550
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, good, good.

482
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:09.960
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so I'm going to have you put your, your fingers on your neck so you can feel your carotid pulse have. Have you done this, you probably do that and like workout classes or at the gym, maybe

483
00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.790
Ken Olsen: No, I've never done that before.

484
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:25.890
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so look at me and I'm putting my finger right here. Yes, I've got and I can feel a pulse. So see if you can find your pulse. You might have to move your hand around a little bit.

485
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.530
ANN MENDENHALL: It's probably down. Yeah, it should be somewhere around there.

486
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:39.990
ANN MENDENHALL: Maybe pushing a little bad

487
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:45.960
Ken Olsen: Boy.

488
00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.160
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I think, a little bit.

489
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:53.520
ANN MENDENHALL: Enough that you could count it. Do you think

490
00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:08.010
ANN MENDENHALL: Maybe push a little more, a little harder. Because usually if you push harder. It kind of, it's either that or you could try to get your pulse in your wrist. Usually that's a little harder. Fine, but not for everybody.

491
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.360
Ken Olsen: I could fill up my wrist.

492
00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:17.940
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, perfect. Well, let's do that. And so what I'm going to have you do is, you know, keep your fingers, not your thumb, because there's a pulse in your thumb.

493
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:31.530
ANN MENDENHALL: But keep your, your fingers on your pulse in your wrist and I'm going to go 321 start. And when I say start you start counting the number of beats that you're feeling. And when I say stop. You can tell me the number

494
00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:38.670
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay okay okay here we go 321 start

495
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:45.000
Stop. Okay.

496
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:46.800
ANN MENDENHALL: How many

497
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.080
Ken Olsen: Six or seven. Okay.

498
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:50.820
Good.

499
00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:58.530
Ken Olsen: The funny thing is, though, Mike my cholesterol was okay. They said it wasn't, you know,

500
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:04.080
Ken Olsen: The one of the RN said it must have been like a hereditary thing could be too but

501
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:06.600
Ken Olsen: I don't, nevermind. Nevermind. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

502
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.880
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, no, that's, that's okay i mean it's it's tough when you've got

503
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:28.110
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, you can do a lot to reduce your cholesterol. If both your parents have high cholesterol, high triglycerides, it's, it's definitely harder, but you know you're on the Lipitor. So that's going to help with the cholesterol right there, that in dietary changes.

504
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.070
Ken Olsen: Yeah yeah

505
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:42.690
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. And so right now because you're already detox. I will say the majority of people that that I work with here at bright heart.

506
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:59.070
ANN MENDENHALL: Are in for opiate use disorder. And so they're on Suboxone, you know, which is, but you've already gone through your detox. And so there's really an in your associated with your primary care and you'll be seeing a cardiologist. So there's really no meds that

507
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:08.220
ANN MENDENHALL: I will send right now because I want you to get whatever you need. Since you just had the heart attack from your cardiologist and or your primary care.

508
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:10.140
ANN MENDENHALL: But

509
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:18.120
ANN MENDENHALL: In normally we have we have groups, you know, that will, that's when we prescribe our are

510
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.320
ANN MENDENHALL: Like Suboxone medicine which you know you won't be getting

511
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:34.020
ANN MENDENHALL: So, but I would like to have you follow up. We like to have people have a therapy appointment, like a initial intake. And I think that would be really helpful.

512
00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:41.550
ANN MENDENHALL: That's going to be the best thing for you right now to be able to sort of meet with someone who's got some really good therapist and it just kind of

513
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:48.060
ANN MENDENHALL: They can help you kind of figure out what's going on. And you know kind of what triggered relapse and what you can do to

514
00:54:48.300 --> 00:55:03.930
ANN MENDENHALL: Make some changes and you know they're they're very supportive and positive, the way they go about it. So when you get off this this call, I'd like you to call back, you know, to the virtual clinic and say that I told you to make an appointment for your

515
00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:16.680
ANN MENDENHALL: Therapy intake and and and then the other thing that I don't know if you have you ever spent much time going to a meetings or

516
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.640
ANN MENDENHALL: Yes. Okay. Are you currently going

517
00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:27.570
Ken Olsen: On at the moment, I'm just been kind of like hanging out the house just relaxing.

518
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:29.670
Ken Olsen: Okay, but

519
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.000
Ken Olsen: I've been to a lot of meetings. Yes.

520
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.010
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, do you have a sponsor.

521
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.520
Ken Olsen: I know it's a moment, but I can get one.

522
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.650
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, you know, I would

523
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:47.310
ANN MENDENHALL: highly advise that but my son who's

524
00:55:48.540 --> 00:56:02.580
ANN MENDENHALL: 34 now it's been sober for about seven and a half years now alcohol. And I think what really did it for him as he started when he decided to quit drinking. He did that 90 days 90 meetings in 90 days.

525
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:09.900
ANN MENDENHALL: And so he went every day and he found a sponsor who he still has the same guy. Wonderful guy like my son lives in San Francisco.

526
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:20.910
ANN MENDENHALL: And to me that's really the key going to the meetings frequently, but also having a sponsor. So, you know, because, you know, who knows what's going to happen down the road.

527
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:27.810
ANN MENDENHALL: I mean cravings cop up. But if you have somebody, you can call and say oh my god you know I'm having these cravings. Can you help me.

528
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:43.650
ANN MENDENHALL: You know it's it's really, really, really helpful. And sometimes it takes, you know, I think you could look at it like, Well, you know, go to a meeting. That's convenient one that you know you maybe felt comfortable in and see

529
00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:50.010
ANN MENDENHALL: If there's anybody there like one of the speakers or somebody who's you know clearly been sober for a while that you

530
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.570
ANN MENDENHALL: Feel like you can connect with

531
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.880
Ken Olsen: People

532
00:56:54.180 --> 00:57:11.790
ANN MENDENHALL: Oh, good, good, you know, and also tell yourself, it's like, Okay, I'm going to ask them if there'll be my sponsor you know sort of temporarily and then that way you don't feel like you're locked into that person you can sort of give it a try. For three months or so. And if you feel like it's

533
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.240
Ken Olsen: Never had a sponsor before, but I'm I think I'm gonna try it this time. Yeah.

534
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:23.940
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah yeah i think i think it would be hugely helpful. So I mean that and going to the meetings because

535
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:29.040
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, it's sort of like you don't want to do this in a vacuum. You don't want to do this by yourself.

536
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:42.360
ANN MENDENHALL: And being able to go to those meetings and sponsor and then coming to us for some therapy sessions. That's what's going to help maintain this because you know this is kind of life and death for you after having a heart attack. It's like pretty

537
00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:44.520
ANN MENDENHALL: a wake up call.

538
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:48.390
ANN MENDENHALL: So we'd like to do whatever we can to help support you.

539
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:50.370
Ken Olsen: I appreciate it. Yeah.

540
00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:53.190
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, so why don't you

541
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:59.220
ANN MENDENHALL: Do you have any other questions for me. I can we kind of went through everything. I think

542
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:00.540
Um,

543
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:06.210
Ken Olsen: No, no, I think we're, we're good. Okay.

544
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:07.200
And

545
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:14.040
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, because you don't have any current kind of going back to the suicide thing they want us to really kind of

546
00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:35.160
ANN MENDENHALL: Look at that. If you have any ideation meaning like you're thinking about it even not necessarily even have a plan yet, but you're thinking about it. Would you promise me that you call either here to talk to a therapist or, you know, the ER or talk to somebody a crisis line or something.

547
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:39.120
Ken Olsen: What, what's another by Okay what's the number I call

548
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:49.350
ANN MENDENHALL: Well, you can call here, but actually I think let's, let's, let me just look for a crisis line in in your area.

549
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:51.570
Ken Olsen: You know, I don't think I need it.

550
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:53.280
Ken Olsen: I don't think

551
00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:59.010
Ken Olsen: You know, I don't have any. I don't think I'm gonna get a need that.

552
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.780
Ken Olsen: Okay, well, how many are kind of want to live now.

553
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:07.980
ANN MENDENHALL: Well that's, that's the most important thing

554
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:16.350
Ken Olsen: Smoking is this, you know, smoking, kind of like slow suicide, I guess. But yeah, that's gonna be hard, but I'm gonna try eventually

555
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:23.010
Ken Olsen: But I don't think I need any any suicide hotline number think I'm okay.

556
00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.100
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, because I can give you

557
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.670
ANN MENDENHALL: crisis hotline intervention.

558
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.030
Ken Olsen: So you just one in. Okay.

559
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.520
ANN MENDENHALL: You could just, you know,

560
00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:36.510
Ken Olsen: Already done

561
00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.680
ANN MENDENHALL: Write it down. Yeah. And you can use it if if you feel like you need it.

562
00:59:46.950 --> 01:00:01.980
ANN MENDENHALL: What's your zip code there 95621

563
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.630
ANN MENDENHALL: Here, here's a number. It's an 800 number

564
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:28.110
ANN MENDENHALL: 800-273-8255

565
01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:29.880
Ken Olsen: Okay.

566
01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:41.160
ANN MENDENHALL: So just so you have that, you know, I think it sounds to me like you're doing really well, and you've got, you know, all the right intentions you doing all the right things, but I just want to make sure you're safe.

567
01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:45.120
Ken Olsen: Yeah, just the smoking thing bothers me. I'm just, you know,

568
01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:50.460
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I went to all this and and cigarettes going to take me out. It's like shit.

569
01:00:51.480 --> 01:01:00.660
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, well, you know, you might give you know, talk to your primary care. I know just you were just there Monday. But usually you can call and talk to the nurse, even though

570
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:11.550
ANN MENDENHALL: It may be, you know, I don't know if you have a way you can like email or text your doctor. But if you call and talk to the nurse and and see what if you want to try

571
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:17.160
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, the, the calm or the loss inches or you need more patches.

572
01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:30.300
ANN MENDENHALL: There's other things, there's, you know, also medication, you can take, but I usually recommend starting those sort of easier ones first and see if that works. And if they don't you know look at something like will be a Turner Chantix

573
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.320
Ken Olsen: Okay, okay. Yeah.

574
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.910
ANN MENDENHALL: Yeah, because I think you're going to feel you're going to feel a lot better in general.

575
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:51.420
ANN MENDENHALL: You're going to be a lot safer and you're just going to feel better about yourself. You know when you kind of get going. And it's not easy. I get that. I know a lot of people feel it's easier to quit heroin than it is to quit cigarettes.

576
01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:56.280
ANN MENDENHALL: You know, but you can do it. It's just, you know, probably going to need some help.

577
01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:58.740
Ken Olsen: Yeah and there's probably some

578
01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.530
ANN MENDENHALL: Smoking groups, if that's something you would consider

579
01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.100
ANN MENDENHALL: And I'm guessing.

580
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:08.340
Ken Olsen: You know the law group for everything.

581
01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:09.960
ANN MENDENHALL: There's a group for everything.

582
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.530
You got it.

583
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.040
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay Can well unless you have any other questions for me. I would just call up the

584
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:25.890
ANN MENDENHALL: Same number you call it to get in here and and ask for an appointment for your therapy intake.

585
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:29.370
Ken Olsen: Okay, so yeah. Somebody set this all up for me.

586
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.960
ANN MENDENHALL: Uh huh. Oh.

587
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.550
Ken Olsen: What would be the number I call

588
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:33.810
Um,

589
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.870
Ken Olsen: Let's show up. I mean, I, you know, I'm not really phone savvy, you know,

590
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:41.130
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay. All right.

591
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:42.960
ANN MENDENHALL: Let you know

592
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.930
ANN MENDENHALL: I shouldn't do that. But let me figure it out.

593
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.670
Ken Olsen: I'm probably I'm probably pretty sure it's there by punching number here or there, but I don't know. Yeah, see,

594
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.890
ANN MENDENHALL: What I could do. I could have have them call you.

595
01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:06.480
ANN MENDENHALL: Better

596
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:07.560
Sure.

597
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.580
ANN MENDENHALL: Okay, let's see which here's maybe if

598
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:14.640
ANN MENDENHALL: Or number here. I'll give

599
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:18.030
Ken Olsen: Yeah.

600
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:20.160
Ken Olsen: Okay.

601
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:29.790
ANN MENDENHALL: It's also an 800 number. It's 800-892-2695

602
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:38.760
ANN MENDENHALL: And and then just tell it, and I will also ask them to call you just in case you know you have any problem.

603
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.580
Ken Olsen: With this, and what is this Amy, what is this again.

604
01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:43.230
