7
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.030

8
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.940
Samantha Scott: In right. Did you know

9
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You received it. When I was in Albuquerque. That doesn't count. Let me try it. Right.

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.280
Samantha Scott: Okay, good.

11
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I, I was in Albuquerque. So we're real quick jammed out everybody's reminders last night.

12
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.190
Samantha Scott: So this is

13
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Test. I'm gonna say test.

14
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.810
Gwenevere Abriel: From Santa Fe, the boonies of Santa Fe.

15
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.970
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

16
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.640
Samantha Scott: Not delivered. Oh.

17
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so it only works when I'm in a big city. So we're gonna stick with

18
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: God if we schedule some it's on you.

19
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.280
Samantha Scott: It's all

20
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.470
Samantha Scott: Know, got it totally

21
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.360
Samantha Scott: Okay, I do.

22
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.870
Gwenevere Abriel: We're here.

23
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.590
Samantha Scott: I did want to ask you one thing and if

24
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.720
Samantha Scott: I don't know if I should ask you

25
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:53.640
Samantha Scott: Or somebody else got anything from Blue Cross field saying that something about covering the following drugs and I know this is a

26
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:06.420
Samantha Scott: I know this is a generic. So I'm wondering, I'm thinking, the only thing that's different is that I got longer prescription for it this time and maybe I'm not

27
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That doesn't know that doesn't make any sense.

28
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.590
Samantha Scott: I will go you

29
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: I, I don't know, is the quick answer.

30
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I suggest

31
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.060
Samantha Scott: You go

32
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Into virtual clinic and say, Hey, who would be the best person to talk to about this.

33
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to make sure that my medication is covered

34
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.290
Samantha Scott: And right

35
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: doctor. A doctor brielle or

36
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it someone please give me there.

37
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:42.990
Samantha Scott: Yeah, might be some weird reporting thing or something or some change from one from something induction to maintenance or something like that. I was thinking, yeah.

38
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Does it say specifically what medication, they're

39
00:02:45.960 --> 00:03:00.180
Samantha Scott: They're having it says, it says a name of drug Bupropion the locks eight two and it says each drug above is not on our drug list or has rules that were not followed

40
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.150
Samantha Scott: And I'm thinking that it's definitely on their drug list because it's a generic

41
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:17.760
Samantha Scott: Um, but I don't know what it is. So I'll just call virtual clinic. After this, and will, and I'll work on this. I mean, right now, I've still got a weeks left till our next

42
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.330
Samantha Scott: I'm not freaking out.

43
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think it's important, and I think that your

44
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Your non this week it would be smart. I like that you're bringing that to my opinion.

45
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.410
Yeah.

46
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You can also, if you want to swing by and have a quicker what's today, today's Thursday.

47
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: If you wanted to talk to Dr. Gabrielle, you could come in. This is what it would look like it. Let's

48
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Say you didn't get the answers you need if you roll in right after our appointment. You go into virtual clinic and you don't get information that satisfies

49
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Your question then drop by. Write this down at 1155 at 1135 drop into my 11am group, which would be at the tail end of it. You'll come in, they're not going to believe it. I'm not sure she may bill you for some medical thing but it won't be a group bill.

50
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:27.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you do a 15 minute thing with you and you can get clear about or she may not feel it all. I have no idea, but I'm going to stay out of it, but I just want to create that already embedded opportunity to talk to the doctor.

51
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:38.040
Samantha Scott: Yeah, that's perfect. I'll call and talk to them and then depending on what I find out all talk to virtual clinic. If that doesn't work, then I'll come in at

52
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: 1150 511 more important piece. I won't

53
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I won't be able to text you

54
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The group number because of what we just talked about. So you're going to have to go to receive

55
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: And say, hey, Glenn said I need to meet with the doc for medication check in right at the end. I'm not doing the group, but she asked me to check in right at the end.

56
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I'm going to give them a heads up now so that they know okay and they're going to give you the number but you know you're only coming in right in the last five minutes.

57
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you know,

58
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Those, those last five minutes. Just don't say a word turn yourself on you know what i do i say what came up for you. I'm finishing up that summary.

59
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.160
Samantha Scott: And then wait until everybody's taken care of. And then we'll talk. Yeah.

60
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so let me just say

61
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.870

67
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: 1145 hours.

68
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.780
Samantha Scott: Okay, yeah.

69
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Cuz i don't i don't know he's on to be very honest, it could be really busy.

70
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:20.580
Samantha Scott: Right. Ya know I whenever I have no I need to talk to them. I try to call in at least 20 minutes early, because then that gives that cushion for

71
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.390
Samantha Scott: But before I want to talk to him.

72
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.950
Samantha Scott: So, but in general, things are going. Okay.

73
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I like it.

74
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.380
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I've been doing my body scans.

75
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.940
Samantha Scott: For me not perfectly

76
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. But tell me, tell me when you've been doing them kind of tell me about what time of day. Oh, yeah.

77
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:52.920
Samantha Scott: Like you said it was working on trying to be. I mean, I tend to wake up later. But I'm working on trying to be up like by nine or 930 every day a little bit earlier today. But, you know,

78
00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:12.240
Samantha Scott: And in the morning like 10 and then in the afternoon, and then the evening. Those are the set ones that I have and then other than that, it's like, like you said, Whenever I feel like I'm getting stressed or, you know, like whenever I got that letter.

79
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.460
Samantha Scott: Or, you know,

80
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:22.140
Samantha Scott: Anything you know that's like, and I mean I'm just trying to trust that no matter the fact that it

81
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:34.380
Samantha Scott: Personally, I feel like I'm doing pretty good. I mean the world. I feel like it's just, I'm just like everybody else. I just have to trust that together we all get through this, you know,

82
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.780
Samantha Scott: You know,

83
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When you have done the scan.

84
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.080
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

85
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you noticed has been going on that you hadn't really been paying attention to your body's messages before what's been going on in there.

86
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:57.810
Samantha Scott: A lot of it. I mean, I don't think I've ever been paying attention to my body's messages. So, just the fact that even has messages is a huge advance

87
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:18.930
Samantha Scott: I mean, I definitely I think I've noticed I definitely find myself getting distracted, you know, during, and I just tried to be kind and reroute my opinion you know okay I honor that thought and but I'm not. It's not necessary. So like, let's move on, you know,

88
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.630
Samantha Scott: And then try to return.

89
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Beautiful. One thing people sometimes like this. Thank you for sharing. We say that to our mind.

90
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.280
Samantha Scott: Oh, yeah.

91
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.400
Samantha Scott: That's good. Yeah, I like that, yeah.

92
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.370
Samantha Scott: It's it because it's kind of

93
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:40.740
Samantha Scott: It's it's polite, but at the same time, you can put some attitude into it if you wanted to.

94
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Hey Karen and then next. So thank you for sharing when it's just a little passing thought when it's when it's more like it's really opinionated and it's really judgmental or it's sending a fair message, it can be. Thank you for sharing. You've got me this far in my life.

95
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.030
Samantha Scott: Thank you.

96
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: I learning new things and right now our attention is on how my body is doing right

97
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's still grateful. It's we're not trying to pull the self apart. We want integration.

98
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.480
Samantha Scott: Right.

99
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.760
Gwenevere Abriel: We can be kind to ourselves. Along the way, too.

100
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.990
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I'm trying to be, I mean I feel like for the most part, things are going really well. I just

101
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.980
Samantha Scott: It's just the overall thing. Yeah. And there's nothing I can do about that so

102
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to talk about what it's like to be you in the world today.

103
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.530
Samantha Scott: I don't know i mean i i feel like

104
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:48.870
Samantha Scott: I feel like I'm not that different essentially from anybody else, you know, in terms of how it is in this world.

105
00:09:49.740 --> 00:10:00.390
Samantha Scott: Because it's just changing every day and every day we get up and we get new information and like before we even have time to process like whatever the big

106
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:18.180
Samantha Scott: Things of the day are or the week are then there's like more on top of it and it feels like it's just impossible to stay on top of, you know, not that I need to, but I guess I feel like it's kind of my job as a person in the world to be aware of what's going on, you know,

107
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And do you budget your time to narrow windows of consuming media.

108
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.700
Samantha Scott: No, I should

109
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.540
Samantha Scott: I get really bad about getting sucked in and then just going and going and going. So if you

110
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Designated, you know, five o'clock is the time

111
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.370
Samantha Scott: And I'll catch myself up.

112
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Really budget, it

113
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:47.910
Samantha Scott: And give myself like a time period. Not, oh, you can just keep going through these websites until you've been there for 12 hours.

114
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I would just do

115
00:10:50.100 --> 00:11:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Just do your top two and just say from, you know, from five to six, whatever the timing but limited to to an hour limited to have our and that's when you use heard my constructive worry

116
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:08.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That can be a time where you can give yourself permission to have your apocalyptic thoughts. If you want to

117
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.170
Samantha Scott: Write

118
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.490
Samantha Scott: Like I need them right now.

119
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: No.

120
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:23.970
Samantha Scott: No, yeah, all my favorite movies are like dystopias and a lot of my favorite stories. It's like

121
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:32.520
Samantha Scott: Now, a lot of them I find I can't, I'm not feeling a desire to watch him because like I feel like there's already that in my world so

122
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.630
Samantha Scott: No, we need. Yeah, that's a really good idea. I definitely

123
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:46.470
Samantha Scott: I mean, because there's only so much information I can consume and my brain can actually make sense of, so why am I just like putting more and more in it's

124
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:53.040
Gwenevere Abriel: More of a time for a Patch Adams kind of movie ones that that are positive and relate to this.

125
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.740
Samantha Scott: Legally Blonde legally

126
00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Was my go to my go to is bridesmaids when I want to indulge I go

127
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.370
Home.

128
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: I just indulge

129
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah I know I'm not supposed to hang over but I such well

130
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.480
Samantha Scott: Yeah, so

131
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

132
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:11.520
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

133
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it's just this bridesmaids it's just so perfectly done

134
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:24.150
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no, I love that movie Roseburg, I was just thinking about Rose Byrne, because I just watched this great series called Mrs America.

135
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:33.870
Samantha Scott: And I was just, and it's all about Phyllis Schlafly and the, the second wave feminists and like Gloria Steinem and stuff like that and

136
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:45.420
Samantha Scott: It was fascinating because I feel like I'm pretty informed about that. But I learned a lot just from this like fictional pseudo fictional like semi fictional series, you know,

137
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:55.380
Samantha Scott: And then it's like, at the end, it's like, Oh, where are we at with the era, because it's all about the you know the Equal Rights Amendment and it's like we're still not there.

138
00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:14.460
Samantha Scott: And then I was just thinking like, it's so weird that that's actual history from my actual country and I am feeling more connected to it somehow through like a pop culture TV. Then I feel connected through it through like my actual society, you know,

139
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.410
Samantha Scott: So,

140
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:40.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder, I don't know what your, your peer kind of colleague friend situation is. But are you having to sort of pull away from some of your other peers and starting to carve out room for a peer group that is not based on maybe getting high. I don't know where you are because we got right

141
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.060
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no. Totally. I hear you. I mean with me. It was always more of a

142
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:56.010
Samantha Scott: Personal it didn't really matter who I was around it was more about me being high, you know, if I'm an order or if I'm at home. I've never had a lot of friends.

143
00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:12.690
Samantha Scott: I mean I'm I can make friends. But basically, I had this friend who who was like my best friend. Like I never had great relationships with women, which is probably partially my fault, partially societies and

144
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.910
Samantha Scott: I think that

145
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:24.240
Samantha Scott: You know, I had this best friend were like, sometimes you meet somebody and like immediately. You're like best friends.

146
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:34.410
Samantha Scott: And like immediately. You're like holding hands like the second time you hang out, you know, and you're just sitting there and I never really had anybody like that. And then I met her.

147
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:45.030
Samantha Scott: And she had this really bad pain disease Reflex sympathetic dystrophy and when she died as one of my opiate stuff like really

148
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:58.170
Samantha Scott: Went up and, you know, just to treat the pain or whatever, you know, is this really sad. She had a disease that wasn't a recognized by medicine at the time, you know,

149
00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:10.830
Samantha Scott: Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. So they're like she's a drug seeker, whatever. But really, like all her nerves are dying underneath her skin but continuing to send pain signals.

150
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:18.180
Samantha Scott: Now they know a lot more about it at the time they basically conserve it like fibromyalgia whenever it first came out.

151
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:25.170
Samantha Scott: And she fought for years to get her disability. She and then she killed herself.

152
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:35.580
Samantha Scott: You know, and then after she had already gotten her disability and she has a five more. She had a five year old daughter, I'm still in touch with her on Facebook.

153
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:45.900
Samantha Scott: Um, but, uh, yeah. And it was not even just about that. It was about, like, loss of love, you know, wanting to be loved and

154
00:15:46.680 --> 00:16:00.870
Samantha Scott: being damaged and feeling like nobody was ever gonna like love her. The way she wanted, you know, and it's just it's sad but I hear. I mean, I'm still working my way back to the collection.

155
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:08.490
Samantha Scott: I do need more peers and I've been trying to reach out to people from my life that are like

156
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:17.940
Samantha Scott: Maybe I don't work with them anymore. Obviously, or whatever. But like I know what they're like. And I know what their core values are and stuff like that and

157
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:28.770
Samantha Scott: That they sort of feel similarly to I, the way I do and you know I know I've noticed when I get on the phone with anybody. You know, or on the zoom

158
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:42.870
Samantha Scott: I'm just, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And so, like, I'm actually going to set up like a couple of phone calls this week to just or zoom calls to just talk to people because I feel like I'm starting to get really disconnected.

159
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.070
Samantha Scott: Yeah, you know,

160
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Please do that I really encourage it. It does help quite a bit.

161
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.420
teleconferencing

162
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And you just so you are, you have a blog, um,

163
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.050
Samantha Scott: Yes.

164
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: If that's just for work, you don't have one where you kind of do sort of political commentary

165
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:17.970
Samantha Scott: I have like I have done a little bit like I did one on the Oscars or my own website this past year. How like the first, it's great that there was like the first non like wife, you know, basically like oh

166
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:31.890
Samantha Scott: I don't know the correct way to put it, like he was Vietnamese so good, you know, okay, we know we don't have to worry about xenophobia, but like, not one director nominated for like the

167
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:42.390
Samantha Scott: Oscars this year was female and there were so amazing movies so but yeah but not so much like my personal um my personal thoughts.

168
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:58.860
Samantha Scott: I don't know i i thought about doing that. I definitely like to write that down. You know, um, I guess it's sort of weird for me to share like unprocessed thoughts with people because I'm so used to like editing and stuff like that. And I feel like I can't

169
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait, isn't that the fun part with it with a with a girlfriend or

170
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.660
Samantha Scott: No totally

171
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: To hear yourself argue at one side and then to hear that dialogue that other perspective to see is what I'm saying is what I think really what I believe. No.

172
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:39.420
Samantha Scott: No, yeah, I could totally use that. And I mean, my friend Lisa is one of the ones that I want to connect with because we work together in the past, but now we don't. And she's very honest and funny and smart and she does like a really strong like bullshit meter, you know,

173
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:44.100
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no, I mean like you need people that are like, uh huh.

174
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.890
Samantha Scott: I feel like you're an art to

175
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.730
Samantha Scott: For me,

176
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:52.530
Samantha Scott: Like as a personal friend are you know

177
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly. Is there more to it than that. Yeah.

178
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.170
Samantha Scott: And she's got a very different life. I mean, she's got a kid, you know,

179
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:13.020
Samantha Scott: Raising a kid and stuff like that. That's different. But I love kids. I mean, I really enjoy being around them and stuff like that. I feel like I'm on the same level with them.

180
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:20.940
Samantha Scott: Sometimes more so like if there's like a room of people and like a few kids, I'm totally going for the kids for

181
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I, yeah, I got you.

182
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

183
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:30.060
Samantha Scott: But yeah, I mean in terms of my recovery. I feel really strong like I'm feeling

184
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:46.830
Samantha Scott: I'm almost getting to a point where I feel, and I know you know it's fragile, but I'm really starting to get kind of pissed off that I spent so long, so much of my life. And so much of my resources on oxy code on you know

185
00:19:46.920 --> 00:20:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Why don't we spend just a minute there. We haven't done much of this, and we've done some some of this sort of psychotherapy. Now we're kind of sort of staying sort of on the outside here. I've just sort of how you meet your community. Let's talk a little bit about this idea

186
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Of tapering

187
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.790
Samantha Scott: I want to

188
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Say this it's two different treatment plans. One is a taper.

189
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:21.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. That would be the one I'm inviting. So here, if I said a couple of times, because the mind will panic.

190
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm separating it separate from

191
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:34.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Off, not the same trail. First one is a taper down to what the doctor has been calling a safe medical dose, which means if you

192
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Break your ankle and had to have reconstructive surgery that the short term opiates, let's say, or increasing the buprenorphine would be effective. We want you to have access and enjoy the benefits of analgesic medicine, just like everybody else. So

193
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

194
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.770
Samantha Scott: That's this one huh

195
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.760
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but I gotta say in a couple of times, because the addict brain has a freak out.

196
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: The taper off the tapering the off, off, off. No, that's not what we're doing.

197
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Right then here that it will feel very different because when you say to us, and it will come from you, you'll go. I've had it. I want to be office and you'll be sitting there at one milligram point seven five milligrams, maybe four months.

198
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Right up down 2.25 I have plenty of clients that are a point two five. And they're just they're just they're

199
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, hover hover.

200
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:30.120
Samantha Scott: It's better to be on whatever dose, however small, it is then to go back. Yeah.

201
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:42.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I am not saying that actually what I'm saying is there's two separate treatment plans. One of them is tapering down to a safe medical dose. I'm going to leave it like

202
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.610
Samantha Scott: This and why you're eight or something. No.

203
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.160
Samantha Scott: Much lower than that line one or

204
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.450
Samantha Scott: Two. Okay.

205
00:21:51.630 --> 00:22:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Gotcha. So, and that will have a ride that will have this yoga we going along can't feel it can't fill the taper. Oh, felt that one. Oh boy, that was a rough week rough, meaning I had restless leg. I hadn't had it. The last two tapers I'm having some cold sweats.

206
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I'm taking my chronic. Gosh, that stuff really works. She was great. Wow.

207
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You need to take a break.

208
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:28.230
Samantha Scott: No, I'm just seeing. Um, no. Okay. It's just some other my husband's out getting our car is ready today from the shop. It was stolen found and fixed

209
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.840
Samantha Scott: So he's out there. I just want to make sure it wasn't him, it was

210
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Staying on this topic a little bit longer because then I want to hear your perspective because I heard something just now, and I want to check it out. So we have a taper down

211
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Treatment plan. And then we have taper off so don't confuse the two. Don't let your, your monkey mind your addict brain confuse the two.

212
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You're frozen. So let me see, for coming back on board here. I'll wait.

213
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Test test test.

214
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.850
Samantha Scott: Hello.

215
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:21.480
Hi.

216
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:31.620
Samantha Scott: I get when that phone rings. Sometimes it's like they leave a message it temporarily disconnects the connection or something.

217
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay i get i get i get

218
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: So just to review your, your addict brain that voice inside that wants to get away with whatever it can that one.

219
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Omit information to not be honest disclose doesn't want to be humble wants to say don't

220
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't tell Gwen anything

221
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That one.

222
00:23:53.220 --> 00:24:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That one is going to be saying, See. See look, they're trying to they're going to hurry us off. And then there's going to be this awful withdrawal. But that's not what's up, what's up is down tapering down and then when you and your physician and I'm a part of it too if you want me to is

223
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you eyes a doctor. Thank you have

224
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The coping skills in place the confidence and the motivation in place.

225
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:18.120
Samantha Scott: Right.

226
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: To taper off. And it's a very distinct four days there's different medications that go on. There's daily checking in with the physician.

227
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:32.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, completely different experience. Then down tapering down typically milligram

228
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You come down. If you're at a 16 need to be at 15 for two weeks, then you'd be at 14 for two weeks. And now I say it like that. But the doc will say, she'll say it a little differently. But I've been here three years and that is what I have watched you guys succeed.

229
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:53.010
Samantha Scott: Right, right. One milligram a week, seeing how that goes.

230
00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

231
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:59.220
Samantha Scott: That makes sense. I mean, it makes it does sound scary to me. But at the same time.

232
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:08.580
Samantha Scott: I was thinking, like, one of the things about the car accident. Like why I'm so scared of being in cars. That's part of it. I mean, obviously that's not my phobia.

233
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:23.250
Samantha Scott: But like, it's even scarier to be in a car and to be afraid of getting into an accident and then to be afraid of getting into the hospital and like they can't even help me. You know where they going to do, give me Ketamine or something, you know,

234
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What they would give you ketamine.

235
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:32.460
Samantha Scott: That but that still sounds a lot scarier and less normal than you know what an average person.

236
00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's me and motivation.

237
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah you access to the normal stuff just like me him her. So we want to get together. That's what we're up to but not over night.

238
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:55.950
Samantha Scott: Right. No, I know. And it took me a long time to get here. You know, I mean it took me a long time to get to this point my addiction and then to even knowing that I had an addiction to get to the point to calling

239
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.690
Samantha Scott: You know, and starting

240
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I want to hear. I heard about a fear I heard of the positive motivator. That's a bit like

241
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a negative reinforcer which I liked hearing hey I want I want access, just like everybody else does. That's a motivator to be chemically dependent anymore.

242
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not I think your biggest fear that's actually a motivator. I want to know.

243
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You're here about the first taper. I want to hear it just all the ugly shadow thoughts, you've gotten there.

244
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:31.770
Samantha Scott: I think like, I mean the what's most scary about it is feeling, you know, sick. I mean, that's

245
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:54.840
Samantha Scott: That's something I really don't enjoy. I mean, that's one of the reasons why I kept up my addiction for as long as I did, um, but I think I need to look at it as getting a little sick or maybe not feeling. Exactly. Okay. To get to a point where I feel better every day.

246
00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let's get into that a little bit. And I don't know what you've heard, but when you've been in group. Have you heard anybody who is tapering. Did you hear anybody who is tapering

247
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:14.040
Samantha Scott: I think so. I'm not sure. Well, I'm trying to think, like, I think so. I think I remember hearing. Dr. A real talk with

248
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:25.410
Samantha Scott: A couple of people about like, Oh, you're at this. Do you want to stay at this or maybe want to wait wait a week before we do that, like I'm trying to remember exactly who but I've definitely seen that

249
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so watch. I'd like to play with this word sick, a little bit because sick. The first step. What's the worst. Is it diarrhea. Is it nachos it throat, what's the worst part of sick.

250
00:27:38.880 --> 00:28:00.780
Samantha Scott: I mean, to me, honestly, yet diarrhea sucks nausea sucks restless leg sucks, but to me it's just a feeling you know that insides your skin and it kind of feels like it's crawling or like your teeth are itching, or like, I mean I can think of, like, a lot of metaphors, but feeling not

251
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.890
Samantha Scott: Good not centered not

252
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:14.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, okay. So it does, yes. So here's what people have been reporting for all I'm gonna say three years because it's really close to June.

253
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what people have been reporting. Number one, I want you to remember that you did not hear. Notice you didn't say just now. I heard someone say they got sick. You didn't hear that in group did you

254
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.920
Samantha Scott: Know I heard like little stuff like, Oh, I'm getting a little bit more of the

255
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.120
Samantha Scott: drippy nose.

256
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Haha drippy nose.

257
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.700
Samantha Scott: Or yawning or yeah yeah

258
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:40.110
Yani

259
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people start to perspire a little

260
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.750
Samantha Scott: Right. Definitely. I do that.

261
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It Clonidine treats it and it works.

262
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.020
Samantha Scott: It just like makes your skin not flushed like that, not

263
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:56.490
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

264
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: But it does make you tired. So then, for people who are they're saying, well, because it's a it's a blood pressure medicine and what we're using is it's off label benefits.

265
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: right not to be really clear with the doctor. Hey, I'm already on blood pressure medication. So really, whenever we add something. Don't be intimidated.

266
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.090
Samantha Scott: You've got us you

267
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.780
Samantha Scott: Know, we've got will this be okay with all this

268
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, because if you get too quickly, you might get ahead rush. So there's little

269
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.490
Samantha Scott: Floors that she

270
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: she forgets who told me she hasn't

271
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: So say to the side effects.

272
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And, you know, so here's what I've heard. I'm not going outside my lane. I'm just regurgitating what I've heard people that feel tired. Let's say they want to. They're sweating during the day and they're trying to work. They take that tablet and cut it in half.

273
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And they just didn't have the quantity. So they're addressing the symptoms, but they're not feeling the fatigue during the day.

274
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, but they do is they take one at night.

275
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, that helps them fall asleep for that.

276
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.370
Gwenevere Abriel: While they're doing

277
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It because

278
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:02.280
Samantha Scott: So that period. Don't need to be aware and cognizant and all that. Yeah.

279
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Totally. But really what's really interesting about this particular one is the actual withdrawal symptoms have to be present.

280
00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Which it baffles me that

281
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to remember

282
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:27.060
Gwenevere Abriel: What endorphin forgetting what it is that has to be in your bloodstream, in order for it to metabolize but you have to actually have a symptom in order for it to be effective.

283
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.380
It's really great.

284
00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh. So cool. I just right now I'm forgetting forgetting with the required a local thing is, it'll come to me.

285
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.280
Samantha Scott: To make me feel like less

286
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Kelly. Yeah.

287
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:51.390
Samantha Scott: Holly is the big is the sick for me like that. Oh, yeah.

288
00:30:52.200 --> 00:31:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: So there are other things that she can use so she uses the support medication you're going to hear her say, Do you need any support medication that's what she's talking

289
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: About yeah

290
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:11.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Quantity and she's talking about Gabba Penton she's talking about doc suppan she's talking about. What else does she use

291
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:15.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are the big ones for the

292
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:16.740
Samantha Scott: For the win at all.

293
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.800
Samantha Scott: And you have a patent for nerve pain right

294
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: It's for a lot of things it yeah but that one. I always I'm reluctant because if you go to high if you do 1100 you actually do have to then tie trade off of it and I've got a couple people.

295
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.310
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I'd like to live.

296
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's absolutely necessary.

297
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:41.580
Samantha Scott: Yeah yeah

298
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want to add another one. Yeah, I do one thing at a time.

299
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.430
Samantha Scott: Right.

300
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: There's no you part is what you get from it, though. It's not a you yeah okay so yes let's talk to the to the fear, the big fear is

301
00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:12.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to crawl out of my skin. That's sick. I haven't heard anyone say that when they're tapering just as prescribed. Now what can happen because you're using a strip. You may not be taking slicing it just right.

302
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, this is where when you when you hear her. She draws her little picture and you cut it in half and you kind of a 48 and, oh, I only take that that that eighth offer that 16th off. Okay, fine. But you got to do it because

303
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.400
Samantha Scott: Exactly right. Yeah.

304
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:38.070
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no. Totally. I'm thinking like, at that point, like any just set up like a whole area with like tweezers and like

305
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:39.000
Samantha Scott: You know,

306
00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: What you want to get contact lens cases.

307
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:43.920
Samantha Scott: Right, yeah. Okay.

308
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:48.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Because it'll feel those little bits and it'll keep it airtight because you're going to have to because that's medicine.

309
00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:55.470
Samantha Scott: You take it is really dangerous. I mean, with my pets like I always want to make sure, like I don't

310
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.710
Samantha Scott: You know, throw all the rappers away and

311
00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And so they need to be sealed because you'll be taking those later. Okay, so we've covered that now you are at, how are you at 16. Now what do you

312
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:21.930
Samantha Scott: Gain I met 16 and I mean I feel comfortable. I mean, definitely. But I wonder if I feel too comfortable, you know,

313
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stay there. Let's stay there. Okay, so you. This is the typical protocol after a month, I have this conversation. And you've been here.

314
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.970
Samantha Scott: Yeah, been here for at least a month. A month and a half closer to two, I think.

315
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: We're having conversation we're having it now.

316
00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.570
Samantha Scott: Okay, good.

317
00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: We're gonna, we're gonna we're going to see how this goes.

318
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Because in order for a therapy to be effective. It's also got to be stretching right

319
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what physical therapy.

320
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.160
Samantha Scott: Is we meet that energy right

321
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.870
Samantha Scott: And we ask those those

322
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.230
Samantha Scott: A little bit, yeah. Yeah, totally.

323
00:33:58.650 --> 00:33:59.190
Samantha Scott: Totally and

324
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me tell you there's this plateau. That happens

325
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: With the buprenorphine. You can be taking 16, you know, up to 24 right in 1624 right in there.

326
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: People don't actually isn't. We're normally it's like this all you take more you definitely feel and then it goes like this. But you're right at that spot.

327
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't think based on listening to you guys. I don't think you're going to feel anything.

328
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.650
Gwenevere Abriel: If you go to 15 I think you will feel nothing

329
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.590
Samantha Scott: Right, which will be good.

330
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.150
Gwenevere Abriel: No kidding.

331
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know what, then you'd be able to do you

332
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Say, Oh, I can taper.

333
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't feel it.

334
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:51.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, I don't feel it and then you go guys, guess what I tapered it went down one milligram. I didn't feel

335
00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:51.600
Samantha Scott: Good.

336
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I felt it and all it was was those cold sweats. You guys were talking about, right, or I felt nothing

337
00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Or or accidentally you tapered and cut off too big a piece and then we'll investigate it, because you have a five, six distress level as then I have a crawler at a six or seven and you probably cut off too much.

338
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me say one more thing and then we go let's analyze how you cut those off. That's the first thing. Number two, then we'll try producing at point five, but I don't think we're going to thing, Sam.

339
00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:38.970
Samantha Scott: Yeah. Well, I mean, and my experience of withdrawal is not tapering it's a having drugs and then running out of drugs and then having to make it until the next

340
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:39.510
Samantha Scott: Time I get

341
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Napa 10

342
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:53.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Years is a long acting sticky opiate receptor and it's medicine rather buprenorphine it sticks on those opiate receptors are supposed to stay. It stays there for like 3648 hours.

343
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:54.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not getting

344
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: The full kick

345
00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:14.550
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I mean I really liked the idea of at least coming up with a plan to work to I mean what I love about about all this is that like I'm realizing okay your brain. My thoughts are actually changing my brain. Awesome.

346
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:27.060
Samantha Scott: And then this drug. I mean, one of the ideas is that like eventually these as I taper down right these opiate receptors will become less

347
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch this is what it does. So right now, let's say this is all of them. These are all sectors. So this morning, they were all like this. Hi. Hey. Hi. Hey. Hey, where's my Where's my

348
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:41.190
Samantha Scott: Where's my partner, right. Hey,

349
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.260
Samantha Scott: Bring in the tab on the

350
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:43.860
On

351
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.860
Samantha Scott: The jail bars right yeah

352
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: They're empty there naked sectors and then let's say this morning. What you decided to do was

353
00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to take 15 milligrams. So then this guy gets filled this guy gets filled this guy gets filled this guy gets filled this guy gets filled this guy gets filled this guy, this guy, but this guy doesn't

354
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Write this guy is like, boy, Sam. I think I'm gonna make you a little sweaty because

355
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.490
Samantha Scott: It didn't feel

356
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a hey hey hey hey, then the next day you do it again.

357
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: This guy, this guy, this guy, this guy. You might be there like this much. Okay, it's not gone yet then and then guess what he's not there screaming. It's not reabsorbed. It's gone.

358
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:37.050
Samantha Scott: Three. That's the magic. And that's what I want to. That's what I that's magical and I want to make that happen.

359
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

360
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:47.220
Samantha Scott: We're already set up for it. I mean, like you said, the brain. It's already set up for it. The medication. The way works. It's just me participating

361
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: You participating

362
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you're going to be afraid.

363
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:54.930
Samantha Scott: Yeah, I already am. Right now I am afraid.

364
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:57.300
Gwenevere Abriel: That's

365
00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.040
Samantha Scott: Also a good afraid.

366
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess now what

367
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: What counterbalances that fear. So here's fear and then. What is it that motivates you, that says it's worth it to take this risk. What's this other thing over here.

368
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:34.230
Samantha Scott: Because it's the magic of eventually you know of shrinking those of eventually to me it sounds really amazing to get as close as possible to whatever my natural level of, you know, all the chemicals in my brain. And although receptors for opiates, for sure.

369
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a naturally occurring opiate in your body and we'd love to get you back to your natural self.

370
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.270
Samantha Scott: Well, no. I mean, when, when I had that car accident I broke my hip.

371
00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:56.790
Samantha Scott: And I felt nothing so that says like, there's got to be super powerful opiate in my system because I wasn't on them. And I mean that has to hurt so

372
00:38:59.070 --> 00:38:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

373
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:03.390
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're almost there. So here's the fear.

374
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:09.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Just give me one sentence. What's the primary thought, oh, what is it,

375
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.450
Samantha Scott: Primary don't want to be Crawley

376
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:18.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to be Crawley. Here we go. What do you say, what's your motivation. What's the counter opposite thought

377
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.740
Samantha Scott: Magic reabsorption and returns a normal

378
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

379
00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.340
Samantha Scott: Great, but

380
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: One more piece.

381
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.580
Okay.

382
00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Why do you want to return to normal.

383
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.980
Samantha Scott: Why do I want the drums normal

384
00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:45.330
Samantha Scott: Bit because I've never been there sober.

385
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

386
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.310
Samantha Scott: I don't

387
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.290
Samantha Scott: I don't

388
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's not return

389
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:58.440
Samantha Scott: Right. Maybe it's getting there for the first time. Yeah. Cuz I started using drugs when I was 14

390
00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe it's I want to know who I am.

391
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:08.790
Samantha Scott: Yeah, that is very much more. Yeah, I wanted to who I am, without drugs without

392
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So, here it comes. Make I'm going to do it right now, see if that's enough to counterweight to counterbalance the fear. So, here it comes naturally to you.

393
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Good. I'm the fear thought, Oh my gosh, Sam. Don't you remember those Crawley feelings you wanted to get out of your skin. Oh, you want it. You couldn't nothing would fix it. Nothing with all the it was awful. Don't let her

394
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.630
Samantha Scott: Know who I am.

395
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And

396
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:38.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This explanation with member of the visual, you're going to see it that it's only going to be a little

397
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.810
Samantha Scott: Tiny maybe a depressive a three.

398
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Or two OR NO DISTRESS all

399
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's science.

400
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.690
Samantha Scott: To counter right the feet because

401
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:52.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not 10 out of 10 kick it, it's going to make a to maybe a worst of three.

402
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're gonna tell us

403
00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

404
00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:05.490
Samantha Scott: We're going to help you. And I mean, yeah, I know. And I mean, I think there's a big part of me that maybe a big part of all of us. I don't know that, like,

405
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:21.300
Samantha Scott: Wants to believe and we are all special right but like humans are biological creatures and we're looking at. It's like we all have like within the same you know no number of all these things are all these

406
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:30.030
Samantha Scott: And I can trust in other people's experience that it's going to be reasonably representative of mine, you know,

407
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:31.830
Samantha Scott: And in terms of, like, take your

408
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:37.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, Sam, ask someone if you see someone a group. If it's one of the ones we have lots of people

409
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Or anytime I can say, hey, hey. JOHN I asked you.

410
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:45.630
Gwenevere Abriel: When you first taper. Did you feel blah, blah, blah. You can

411
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.580
Samantha Scott: Write

412
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be cool. And I want to

413
00:41:50.700 --> 00:42:06.960
Samantha Scott: Know better about group. This week I really did and realize that I think that also, I think I was like projecting onto sherry to, you know, I think I was like, judging her for, um,

414
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:14.040
Samantha Scott: What I like I was kind of judging her like I would judge myself. You know what I mean.

415
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:21.420
Samantha Scott: Like if if I was doing what she's doing. And like, I'm not her. And like I have nothing the same experience and like

416
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:32.760
Samantha Scott: It made no sense, I think in retrospect for me to feel that, but I did and we do feel these things and we can't help it. Right. We just have to work through it.

417
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:40.560
Samantha Scott: And I want to be more open. I mean, that's why I tried to reach out and say that I think that's what her attitude is

418
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:54.300
Samantha Scott: I really need to foster that I like, I realized, even with my pug my pug gets on my nerves so much when she goes outside. She's just going crazy barking. I mean, the mailman whoever to thrive.

419
00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:10.230
Samantha Scott: And like I judged her and I realized I'm judging her because like I think I'm not supposed to complain. I think I'm not supposed to go, you know. No, no, no, no, no, or you know whatever it is and

420
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:23.280
Samantha Scott: I know I've been thinking about a lot of stuff like that lately and I think the body scans are really helpful in terms of like I've never even tried to get to know who I who I am.

421
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:32.040
Samantha Scott: Like this and it's good and not everything I'm finding out is good, but it's good to find it out. You know, I think.

422
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: You did a lot of work. Just now we did very direct confrontation of the addiction, the addictive voice, the part of you that leaves the door open that says, well,

423
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. All right. We'll do this stupid program. But you know what

424
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.110
Samantha Scott: What maybe

425
00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Well, we can always go us again.

426
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.290
Gwenevere Abriel: When you start to close those exits.

427
00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's going to be scary. But you know what that says something really important is happening.

428
00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:14.130
Samantha Scott: Right growth is painful. Right. I've been thinking about bees and I know this isn't a perfect analogy but like you know bees. I saw a picture of how they pushed honey out

429
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:36.330
Samantha Scott: It looks incredibly painful. It's like these little it's like wax. It looks like wax and they push it out of there, whatever. But, or whatever it is. And like, then we take the money and then process it and eat it and stuff. And I kind of feel I'm like

430
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:44.160
Samantha Scott: I feel, similar to the be sometimes, you know, in terms of like my

431
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:49.080
Samantha Scott: Yeah, like drug addiction thing. You know, it's like I feel like

432
00:44:51.750 --> 00:45:01.530
Samantha Scott: I am it's unnatural. That's, that's, like, probably the clearest way I can put it like it's not natural.

433
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:13.230
Samantha Scott: That I am able to take this extraordinary amount of these like great medicines for when you need them, right, like if you're in cancer pain or if you're in

434
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:32.400
Samantha Scott: You know, and decide that I'm able to take like the same level as somebody that is like dying of cancer, you know. That's like not natural. You know, I'm not judging anybody else. I just for me that's not natural. You know, and I don't want it ultimately

435
00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:39.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's focus on this concept of earned a reward. So that be

436
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: What you've done to get through school that work that you've done to get a paper written a story written

437
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you get to celebrate

438
00:45:52.260 --> 00:46:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: That we do the studying that we did. And then we get a grade we feel good about or we've learned something and we have honed a smell.

439
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:06.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It was not fed to us we earned the reward.

440
00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:07.830
Samantha Scott: Right will

441
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Be yours forever, Sam.

442
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.670
Samantha Scott: You will have done and

443
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Are doing something difficult

444
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: And it will be yours. No one can come in and say your week there's no not even an allusion to it, you will have lived and done this. Stretching through fear.

445
00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll be able to look anyone in the eye and be like,

446
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I can do anything because

447
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. This was hard and I moved through it. I did not leap over. I did not avoid it. I did not escape it. I went through the fear.

448
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.690
Samantha Scott: I lived through it and it

449
00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:54.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Turns out, and this is what every single person tells me it is not as bad as I thought. Yeah.

450
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're not going to know that until you know it.

451
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.740
Gwenevere Abriel: No amount of my lips clapping are going to do the trip. No.

452
00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:12.780
Samantha Scott: No, and I mean I I have literally spent hours scrolling through like drug forums and stuff like about like, Oh, what is this like and you can't trust anybody else's experience, either because

453
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.310
Samantha Scott: I haven't

454
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:29.820
Samantha Scott: I need to say but it feels and maybe it's not, I don't know, but it feels like a lot of these drug forums that I've read like where people are addicts or they're trying not to whatever it feels like there's almost like a competitiveness in terms of like

455
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:46.530
Samantha Scott: The like addictive like their level of addiction. It's like, Wait, whoa, like, oh, here's like an idea for you. And it's like, no, you know, I can't do anything less than whatever this crazy number

456
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:47.280
Samantha Scott: You know, is

457
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so I haven't seen anything and I have recently haven't scoured YouTube and I'm always looking for really good videos I still haven't found a good one.

458
00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:06.150
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no minor. These are mostly just like forums where people are like, you know, oh yeah, this is this or this brand of this is, I don't know.

459
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.150
Samantha Scott: I feel like that's not super helpful for me.

460
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.110
Samantha Scott: I feel like

461
00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:25.740
Samantha Scott: I'm not gonna go. I'm gonna make a list and I mean a limit on myself to not go scour those forums to trust that the information I'm getting from my doctor and from like a couple of primary sources is good.

462
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.370
You know,

463
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you go to group next time.

464
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:37.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you like to say, I'd like to taper. Are you ready to do that or do you want me to bring it up.

465
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:41.220
Samantha Scott: Yeah, no, I would like to bring it up. I think that would feel good.

466
00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: If you don't, I'm going to

467
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:45.270
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

468
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.130
Samantha Scott: You are okay.

469
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You're ready

470
00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:59.490
Samantha Scott: Okay, good. Yeah, I trust you. I feel like I am. Um, but it's a lot. It's a reaffirming to hear somebody else echo that. Yeah, this word.

471
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:09.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you you're you're moving quickly into getting at core underlying dynamics that make feeling your feelings.

472
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Unacceptable. You're getting it core ideology that has made feeling your feelings.

473
00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Impossible terrifying unacceptable, you're getting at them through the psychotherapy, you're moving quickly and not not meaning to fast. That's not what I mean. I just mean you work your investment in yourself growth is evident. Every time I see you and I'm, I'm very optimistic.

474
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:38.160
Samantha Scott: Cool I, that means a lot to me and I you know I feel like

475
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.940
Samantha Scott: I feel like this is going really well you know

476
00:49:42.780 --> 00:50:01.980
Samantha Scott: I do and I am lucky to have. I mean, in a way, all the horrible things, not withstanding a deaths and everything of we talking. Honestly, I do feel like a tremendous collective grief, like right now between, like, you know, everybody. I hear, but it's like, you know, I do have this time right now.

477
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:06.600
Samantha Scott: Well, as long as I get this medication things straight. Now, which I'm sure I will.

478
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:17.550
Samantha Scott: I have the access that I need to do it. So I really am trying to take this time and like and be serious about it because I'll never get another chance. Like this properly.

479
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.190
Samantha Scott: To focus intensely

480
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.810
Samantha Scott: That's pretty huge.

481
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:36.780
Samantha Scott: That feels like a huge thing but a good thing. It's not. I mean, it is scary. And I'm sure it's going to continue to be, but it also feels good. Like, like good scary, like you said, like

482
00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:49.740
Samantha Scott: pushing through that last, like, you know, the last a bit of a, you know, stretch, where it's like, oh God it hurts. But, you know, ultimately, it makes me feel better.

483
00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So this concept of earned reward just adding that concept in when you bump into fear.

484
00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:04.170
Gwenevere Abriel: And the addict says you can't do this, she's lost her mind.

485
00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: When it catastrophizing thank you for sharing that gotten me this far. I appreciate it, but I've got new skills. I know how to pay attention to the subtleties of the messages that my body. I won't ignore you anymore. I'm paying attention, but doesn't have to wait till it gets so bad.

486
00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:29.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm our emotional regulation skills with belly breathing with grounding in the five senses with peripheral vision.

487
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:44.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm learning communication skills and learning cognitive reframing. And I'm processing early trauma. So you're doing a lot. We're doing little bits of glue slightly different each time just kind of coming at it. Not a lot of different places and

488
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I just want to touch on that orange reward.

489
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:55.110
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the counter thought is this, I want to know who I am.

490
00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.530
Samantha Scott: Which is very motivating.

491
00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.790
Samantha Scott: very emotive word

492
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the one I wanted you to get to what

493
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:06.300
Gwenevere Abriel: will motivate you to get past the fear and if it you're worth getting to know

494
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.440
Samantha Scott: That you're

495
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to have to be not knowing for a while, and that is scary uncertainty is scary. Well, I like who I am, will I will other people like who I am.

496
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:17.460
Samantha Scott: Right.

497
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I have fun will oh well now I think

498
00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm confident because I I think I'm talking to you right now, I think, Who is this because I don't know you know the other

499
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Aspect right and

500
00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:40.710
Samantha Scott: I'm trying to be as honest as possible. It's hard, like the intellectualizing is really hard. Like, I feel myself butting up against it like constantly but

501
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Then Burt ward hold on to that too. When I work hard for this.

502
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Evaluate deserve it. I deserve it.

503
00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right and

504
00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: As I value it

505
00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:57.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Out the things that were spoon fed to you.

506
00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you take for granted. I do.

507
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: We all do.

508
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But the ones that I worked hard for Ain't nobody gonna take that for me.

509
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:25.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm sorry. Now an education. Yeah. Once you get an education. Once you do something that you worked hard for you worked right that's yours forever. Knowledge is forever. It's yours, yours, yours, yours, yours. This earned experience of moving through uncertainty.

510
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be able to teach it because you're going to know it, and you'll teach it.

511
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And you'll be excited and proud and you get to brag about it and then you're going to be saying to me, why are you holding me back. I want to taper again, what's the deal. It's going to flip because it's going to be like that was nothing.

512
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, okay.

513
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:56.430
Samantha Scott: Well, I'm going to try to remember that you are telling me, things were my best interest based on science and your, you know, knowledge and experience.

514
00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:05.160
Samantha Scott: And I'll try to push back too hard, but I can't promise. I mean, it sounds exciting to be that excited that I would even want to do that so

515
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:06.090
Samantha Scott: You know,

516
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:21.150
Gwenevere Abriel: You just don't be shy about telling us if something comes up, because again, we don't know whether you cut the strip wrong. We don't know whether you decided to smoke a cigarette and didn't absorb in your mouth well enough. Right. No.

517
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, don't be shy. You're not

518
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not a bad client or patient because you didn't tape or the way you hear everybody else, you don't know all the people in this program, you don't know that everybody's is just slightly different

519
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Right yours will

520
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:42.900
Samantha Scott: Leave Rubin, I think, I think this is going to be different for me because

521
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:50.280
Samantha Scott: In any way because like I'm actually paying attention to what I feel like, yeah, and I don't think I've done that before so

522
00:54:50.640 --> 00:55:02.130
Gwenevere Abriel: I also wanted to say we've got just a couple minutes left here um you know how you whenever I would do sort of this somatic awareness and I would say where is that coming up for you, whereas that landing and you would do.

523
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.800
Samantha Scott: This solar plexus. I feel like

524
00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:22.620
Gwenevere Abriel: And I asked Dr. Gabrielle I said what is right there because she's not saying to me. Most people say tummy chest heart that's where they go. But she keeps putting hands like right under her to her breast plate. The, the rib cage right up here. Is that right, it's right at that top

525
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:23.880
Samantha Scott: You're like, right here.

526
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And I said, What's right there. And she said, it's the duodenum.

527
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.720
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was like,

528
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's part of the stomach.

529
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Good second here.

530
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: duodenum. So it's part of the stomach, in a sense, and I said,

531
00:55:48.360 --> 00:56:04.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm because she's, she's got training, too. And I said, what, what, what does that typically associated with and and she doesn't know your stories. And I said, Just tell me. And let's see if they line up and she says, Well, it's frequently associated with not belonging

532
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.000
Samantha Scott: Yeah, that makes sense.

533
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.040
Samantha Scott: I mean, I definitely

534
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

535
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:20.520
Samantha Scott: I definitely feel. I mean, particularly in terms of like the whole family thing, you know. And I mean that

536
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:36.120
Samantha Scott: That kind of like transfers over, you know, like, oh, I'm in my family. And then I go to my school and then I do whatever but like ultimately underneath like I'm always underneath. I think I've always felt

537
00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:40.260
Samantha Scott: Like I don't have the right to exist.

538
00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:52.890
Samantha Scott: If I have to put it like bluntly, you know, I don't have the right to feel. I don't have the right to hurt. I don't have the right to complain, you know, and

539
00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:04.650
Samantha Scott: I mean, I think a lot of this is my mom and I know that she you know was obviously everything I've read about narcissism says that

540
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:26.040
Samantha Scott: She didn't get something that she needed at a various Central time and that now that's that's how she got where she is. And so I try to feel sympathy for but not so much sympathy that I'm going to forget, you know, or or not take care of myself first

541
00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

542
00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:42.480
Gwenevere Abriel: My invitation to you is you have some distance from her right now. Right. There's not a daily texting talking right so we can address sympathy for her later.

543
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:43.440
Samantha Scott: Yeah.

544
00:57:43.710 --> 00:58:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You've already sacrifice yourself for so many years. Why don't you indulge in a little bit of just, I'm going to focus on me. The dipping out into interpretation and empathy and feeling sorry for her here. You just did it. You just did it just now.

545
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's on the record.

546
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, now let's not do that.

547
00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you've already been doing this for years.

548
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You have right side.

549
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.380
Samantha Scott: So the right and that's what I need to hear that's waiting to hear

550
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:17.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we'll put a pin in that we have not gone. Oh, you're not going

552
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's just

553
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:25.710
Samantha Scott: Obviously, I'm going to circle back around to it because it's like the first thing I know, right.

554
00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:26.430
Samantha Scott: Like

555
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.940
