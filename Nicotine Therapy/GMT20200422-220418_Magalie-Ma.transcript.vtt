00:36:52.110 --> 00:37:02.520
G Pad 7.0 LTE: I say they said evacuating Tampa St Pete, so I drove all the way across the streets, all the way across the state to Melbourne.

519
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.730
G Pad 7.0 LTE: And hurricane Miss Tampa.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:12.630
G Pad 7.0 LTE: As went right in the Melbourne or I was

522
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.910
G Pad 7.0 LTE: Like, oh my god, I should just stay at home.

523
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.070
Magalie Marcellus: With this, can you never know until they hit

524
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:23.940

Magalie Marcellus: Tracks. Yeah.

526
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.910
G Pad 7.0 LTE: Get him back across the state was

527
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.220
G Pad 7.0 LTE: A pain in the ass. The next day,

528
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:43.950
G Pad 7.0 LTE: The trees. Yeah, luckily I filled my gas tank up the night before it hit

529
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.560
G Pad 7.0 LTE: The gas still snow get you couldn't get gas for

530
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.470
G Pad 7.0 LTE: The next day anywhere throughout the middle of Florida, because all the powers.

531
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.880
So,

532
00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:06.900
G Pad 7.0 LTE: I just barely had enough gas in my car to make it from one side, back to the other side. So thank

533
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:22.410
Magalie Marcellus: You get the guess that's why it's important, and Windows thing happening. You need to be, again, just in case. But that's the first thing that gets it takes us on time to get them back on track. In case you know

534
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.000
G Pad 7.0 LTE: They can't

535
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.750
Magalie Marcellus: Go on.

536
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.380
G Pad 7.0 LTE: Trusted Tricity. That's right.

537
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:39.840
Magalie Marcellus: You know, and this was a recent one that they had made all the gas station as on generators because at one point they had no gas because they had no backup generators

538
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.170
Magalie Marcellus: Became a lot for them to make sure that there

539
00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.540
G Pad 7.0 LTE: Is smart because back then they didn't have that

540
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.900
G Pad 7.0 LTE: It was a big, big

541
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.440
Deal.

542
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.900
G Pad 7.0 LTE: People stranded.

543
00:38:55.290 --> 00:39:01.410
