00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Hi.

2
00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.649
LG Aristo 2: Hi, how are you

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm doing great, you

4
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me a little bit. I did just a tiny little snoop just to try and get a little bit of information about maybe some things that were kind of contextually going on in your life to looking at a prior note from Jessica.

5
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Where am I finding right now are you at home. Are you at work where you out right now.

6
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.460
LG Aristo 2: I'm at home right now.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. Beautiful. So let's do this.

8
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:59.190
Gwenevere Abriel: There's still lots to learn about each other as far as like expectations. I'm probably going to be quite different from Jessica. I'm been doing therapy for over 20 years so I can dive into whatever

9
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.760
LG Aristo 2: That's good.

10
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so really excited to work with you and but one thing that I will ask is, I'm going to need your hands free

11
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.670
LG Aristo 2: Okay, so

12
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.980
Gwenevere Abriel: See if we can. And you can take us on find a little place to have it propped up

13
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: The future, you can find a more

14
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.610
LG Aristo 2: Elegant

15
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Way, or maybe in a month from now where there's little book or a plate or something that's sort of holding it steady, so that you had your hands free

16
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.110
Gwenevere Abriel: One of the reasons why is because what I've noticed

17
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: That's been most effective is for people that have any kind of complex trauma.

18
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.130
Or development.

19
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.720
Gwenevere Abriel: The talking the talk therapy is nice, but it doesn't it doesn't really

20
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.330
LG Aristo 2: Feel like I know

21
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:14.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Trauma that seems to be coming aware, that's interesting in our sleep that feels like we're we're emotionally. We're angry right away and like there was like no chance to even think before we yelled at someone or got pissed off or whatever.

22
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I've noticed is the

23
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: therapeutic interventions that have been effective are more experiential so there might be times when you're going to need like to be standing with me or sitting

24
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:41.850
Gwenevere Abriel: In a chair here in a chair there. Or we might be doing if you're open to it. Some of the EMT our work once we do lots of preparation. First, but so my point is

25
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:53.220
Gwenevere Abriel: This is probably going to feel very much as if you were in office so you, you really want to have it quiet, no one around and really protect that environment.

26
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.180
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

27
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take where you left off and

28
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.760
Maybe concern.

29
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I can introduce myself and could start there. And then we'll kind of kind of

30
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Move forward.

31
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.690
LG Aristo 2: Mosey into it. Okay. Sounds good.

32
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh of course you know I'm in Florida Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and doing it over 20 years very into have been drawn to the field of addiction. The whole time love working with folks struggling with it. I, I think it's because there's no

33
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.080
Gwenevere Abriel: single answer to it, it just continues to be so individualized

34
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.910
LG Aristo 2: And I kind of like that challenge.

35
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:44.430
LG Aristo 2: Yeah, that's good. Well, that's like me. I was in nursing for 25 plus years. And I just, I went to a gas station job now because I just

36
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.420
LG Aristo 2: I got burned down. Oh, I was really burnt out on it.

37
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.890
LG Aristo 2: Let me tell you.

38
00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:02.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I that that position of a nurse is something I mean you never get validation never get recognition, you're basically doing the doctor's job. I mean, I just, I'm in awe.

39
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Thank you for taking care of

40
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:16.710
LG Aristo 2: Yeah. Well, I did home. Well, I'd like I said 25 plus years, but I just, I couldn't do it. And so now I'm learning to get along with people at the gas station.

41
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my gosh.

42
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:28.710
LG Aristo 2: Yeah, so it's been a struggle kind of there, but I've been learning, just to take a deep breath, just walk away, keep busy and just kind of do my own thing.

43
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.290
LG Aristo 2: Learning how to cope with it a little bit better. Okay.

44
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I heard is, um, deep breath, keep busy right distraction.

45
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are really useful coping techniques. Absolutely.

46
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this this job and the gas station is a new one.

47
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.970
LG Aristo 2: Mm hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

48
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see if we can find. Take your time. I'm gonna go open up a note and kind of look around there. A little bit. Look around your room and see if you can find a bookcase even a cupboard in the kitchen.

49
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Would work.

50
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Just taking it.

51
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.400
LG Aristo 2: Right. Let me see where I could put it. I'm wondering if in the other room. I have the table right can sit and do it.

52
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But really, no pressure. Take your time. It's more important that we

53
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Get this so that you can completely because there's going to be times we'll focus on the soma soma, the body and if your hands are busy. We welcome you all to kind of have those free

54
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.980
LG Aristo 2: Okay.

55
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.730
LG Aristo 2: Take your time to see if I can go to the other room and see if I have a stand.

56
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.740
LG Aristo 2: Up.

57
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.210
LG Aristo 2: It got so cold here last night.

58
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.720
LG Aristo 2: Yeah, oh four degrees. Yeah.

59
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.600
LG Aristo 2: Wow freezing. So we had wonder if I can do sideways. Oh, there we go.

60
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.430
LG Aristo 2: Okay.

61
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that is good.

62
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.430
LG Aristo 2: That is just turn it

63
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn it about an inch down. I want to see more because. Okay, that's beautiful fantastic day

64
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.280
LG Aristo 2: Yeah.

65
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to get more out of it this way to truly because it will feel more like it's not like a phone call, like, Hey, what's up, it'll feel more like this is a therapeutic environment right

66
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, okay.

67
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so what I've heard is

68
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: This job this job. It's really something's going on. I see people you're working with. Am I hearing. Yeah.

69
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.450
LG Aristo 2: Yeah, well, yeah, I, I've had to really keep my

70
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:59.040
LG Aristo 2: Well, I'll go back a little bit. I was in when I went to rehab. I was in there and I had to take my domestic violence class over because I kept getting invites when I was in there.

71
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.450
LG Aristo 2: But I, my main point is learning how to communicate. I don't communicate well.

72
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:16.920
LG Aristo 2: Okay. Um, but other than that. I'm just working. I guess after being by myself and like my elderly and stuff. I've always visit them grocery shopping

73
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:27.930
LG Aristo 2: So I really didn't have friends or had to deal with other women really outside. And if it was, it was just at the office high and by so to have to sit there eight hours and then

74
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.690
LG Aristo 2: Just the gossip. I'm like, I'm almost 50 I don't like to hear this shit.

75
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

76
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:52.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you. Okay. Well, I love, love, love on low working with communication. I'm so excited because there are there are some distinct skills that you can quickly pick up. Try and right away, play with them.

77
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.410
Gwenevere Abriel: feel empowered.

78
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.280
LG Aristo 2: Right.

79
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, about harnessing right, all of that.

80
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:20.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you've got this initial response. And if we put the psychology aside and I just do a quick little blast and I just say, okay, there's a threat response happening to you happens instantaneous this whatever this is. This ignorant. Man, this bitchy woman, whatever. This thing is this

81
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Complaining whatever, whatever it is, right, this satisfied customer

82
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:27.330
LG Aristo 2: I know

83
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:40.440
Gwenevere Abriel: They're all over, but it has nothing to do with you. They're going to be dissatisfied when they go to the laundromat, they're going to be dissatisfied when they go to Walmart. So they're just gonna spread their misery and you have a right

84
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.540
LG Aristo 2: To say happy. Yes, I've been really, really trying

85
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.350
LG Aristo 2: When I was talking to Jessica.

86
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:56.760
LG Aristo 2: I think the thing that hit home with me and we never kind of went back to it.

87
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.520
LG Aristo 2: Because it was really hard for me.

88
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:10.710
LG Aristo 2: Was my childhood. Oh, okay. Yes, my mom and she wanted me to write her a letter and I told her that was one of the hardest things for me to do.

89
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:28.020
LG Aristo 2: Was sit down and try to write a letter. So we kind of and then other things happened in between. So we kind of got sidetracked from it and then with the new job and all that, but then my mom got sick. And when she was in the hospital. I kind of

90
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:37.830
LG Aristo 2: I felt bad, but I couldn't be there, like I normally would be there for her like I would usually always jump run go be at the hospital, take care of her.

91
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.120
LG Aristo 2: This time I went and saw her once

92
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:52.260
LG Aristo 2: And my brother and I get along better and we were we we stayed that Friday way she went into her surgery was a week on and off for her gallbladder.

93
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.070
LG Aristo 2: But she was a really bad alcoholic. When I was growing up.

94
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:08.220
LG Aristo 2: So in drugs so that that was just really hard for me. Um, and since I brought that up to just come one of our first meetings Jonas, it was back in December.

95
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:19.980
LG Aristo 2: I, I didn't know it kind of threw me off, kind of, because I've never even when I was in rehab and I did do my counseling. Um, it was some I avoided the whole time.

96
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:26.550
LG Aristo 2: I avoided it the whole entire time. And I still am, and I think I still am avoiding it.

97
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:34.200
LG Aristo 2: But I she did want me to sit down and write a letter to her that was just going to be between me and her and that was it.

98
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:51.090
LG Aristo 2: It was one of the hardest things I sat there one night for two hours, and I could not do it. I just broke down and cried. So it goes deep, but I think that's a lot of it and then just when me my husband went through our stuff, you know, they get. I have a lot of PTSD from that.

99
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.850
LG Aristo 2: From our years because

100
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Was there abuse, physical, emotional, sexual with your husband.

101
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.080
LG Aristo 2: I think it was more mental. Okay.

102
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

103
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.990
LG Aristo 2: Okay. Yeah, little

104
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: This is setting setting some general goal setting for me as I'm listening to you. And what I'm hearing is

105
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:33.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Something really resonated when when that topic of childhood came up. There's a real honesty with you right now. It's like I might just continue to avoid it, and I will keep an eye on that because I happen to believe that indeed those early

106
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That shaping that happens when we're very young.

107
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not a conscious thing we do it to survive. We adapt to our environment we develop certain behavioral patterns emotional regulation patterns, an identity.

108
00:11:47.730 --> 00:12:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Of you about how we are in the world we develop those when we're tiny, really tiny like you know 15 months. Okay, one years, two years old, three years old. We develop them very early on, what ends up happening is there. They're kind of still the solutions that we're using as grown women.

109
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.900
LG Aristo 2: Yeah yeah I I really had a hard time with that and and she

110
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.900
LG Aristo 2: She was great. Jessica was somebody that I finally trusted to talk to

111
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:31.380
LG Aristo 2: And. And finally, I was in denial since 2016. And then this last June or July 30 I got hit head on in that from there I went downhill.

112
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:44.970
LG Aristo 2: I tried killing myself and just stuff like that. So it was just kind of a rough year and then now I'm now getting back into things, and finally getting to talk you know I

113
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.220
LG Aristo 2: I'm accepting it more than I did in 2016 and then

114
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.690
Gwenevere Abriel: The denial was that childhood or the addictive behavior. What are you

115
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.770
LG Aristo 2: What are you going to go, I think, oh, both of it pretty much

116
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:06.450
LG Aristo 2: I even though my doctor was writing me the meds. I was still abusing them. Okay. But when I went into rehab.

117
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:19.830
LG Aristo 2: I was the only thing I was on was valued at the time of Ben's those I guess they call them. That's all I was on when I went into rehab so mine was a lot of the mental to get through of my anger and aggression and the fighting.

118
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:27.810
LG Aristo 2: Because right away. I'll just hit somebody and not think twice, and I've learned you know that's not the right way to go. No, but

119
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, wait, so

120
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:40.410
Gwenevere Abriel: The part of your brain that makes a decision. Is this the right thing to do. It's not online.

121
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: What's online in that instance that you have this threat response right I'm just punch.

122
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That the prefrontal cortex is just not online. It's just not

123
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.730
Gwenevere Abriel: And so the work that I want to do with you.

124
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Will create space which is time.

125
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Which are breathing.

126
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: keeping busy and distraction is useful, but in the moment when someone

127
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Looks like someone who has disrespected you offended you. Well, I don't know what your triggers are I'll find those out from us. I listened to your stories in the future.

128
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: But what we want to do. And that's what this therapy can do is create time

129
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And with that time. You know what ends up happening. The frontal part of your brain gets blood

130
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It means all the parts of your brain is working and this one up here, the one that can problem solve that can look ahead and say, if I do this, and this, I might get a positive outcome if I punched in the nose or smoker.

131
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a bad idea because then I might get arrested and then I'll help lose my freedom and oh what a hassle. I don't want to go to court. I don't want to do that. So this is the part right that's the part of the brain.

132
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But that is nowhere took a sin when that an angel is getting activated, it's instantaneous

133
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.110
LG Aristo 2: I had to walk away. I have and I went to my boss. And I said, you know,

134
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:19.830
LG Aristo 2: Back in the day, I would have just naive and ask questions. And so I think I've matured a lot that way.

135
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:33.000
LG Aristo 2: But I just tried to ignore it. But like, they said if there's a problem. Bring it up, but it's stupid petty gossip stuff. It doesn't even need to be brought up beverages needs to quit talking and do what they're supposed to work. So

136
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:40.590
Gwenevere Abriel: What you're touching on and I'm so glad you have the awareness that there are current activating events.

137
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That are happening into personally you've touched on a lot of things that we can work on. And what I want to go over with you is starting to and I usually do these things right away.

138
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: In the first few sessions, when I need people is just to make sure that they have right those emotional coping skills.

139
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I want to go into resourcing skills which would get us ready for long term sort of work, dealing with that childhood stuff.

140
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:22.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's all stuff you can use right away, but it's also an investment in long term sort of treatment of of some complex trauma. So let me ask you this is just a check in. There's no way for you to do your part wrong.

141
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.960
LG Aristo 2: You're the guy that

142
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You did ever do anything wrong not I'm not in my world. Okay.

143
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.730
Okay.

144
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: This is just a checking because I don't want to waste your time. I will go review something if you already know if that's the only reason why I'm checking in.

145
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know if I said diaphragm matic breathing square breathing or box breathing. If you would be able to tell me what that is or how to do it.

146
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.330
LG Aristo 2: Like no, I don't.

147
00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:52.500
Um,

148
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:54.630
LG Aristo 2: Hmm.

149
00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because this is so cool. You know, because you already, you already have this breath, you already know, like everybody says, take a deep breath and calm down. Well, okay, whatever.

150
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:14.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Button, there is science behind this particular type of breathing. It's not this one.

151
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Sitting earlier with this thing out of here. Most people breeze up here.

152
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:38.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Short fast breath. Now, what that message that sends to the brain is oh oh it's go time. We've got to be ready for fight.

153
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Or flight.

154
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: heart racing all of the blood is in our large muscle groups, we are ready to defend ourselves right

155
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm. What I'm going to show you first I'm going to tell you about it. Then I'm going to model it for you. And then we're going to do it together.

156
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:57.660
LG Aristo 2: Because

157
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I have a all of the little tricks that I've got this is the one

158
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.870
Gwenevere Abriel: That created this thing time

159
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what you need.

160
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.080
LG Aristo 2: Time each

161
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Time because stimulus and response. Screw you. Right. And we don't

162
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: In between there. We just need that fraction of a second. And guess what we can do it with the breath.

163
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It signals a message up to the brain.

164
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, it's not life or death. This is just an idiot, I'm talking to, ah, it's in complete contradiction to whatever thought you're having

165
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:51.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That initial sort of impulse, like when I was in danger. It's a complete contradiction. When we do this particular reading. Then I'm gonna go over with you and that's what we want it sends a message to the brain. We are not in danger and off heart rate can go down.

166
00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:05.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't need to be in distress, and guess what happens all the blood that was in the large muscle groups ready to run or fight now makes it to which part of the brain do we need the prefrontal cortex. We need that one that was the one that goes

167
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:12.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Girl, you're not worth my time mess. I need my freedom. You're an idiot. You're always give me anything I say to you now is going to make a damn difference

168
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, okay, so we need that part of the brain online. Yes.

169
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:27.030
Gwenevere Abriel: The science very quickly. If I lose you. I'll be saying this as many or as little times as you want. But the basic so that you get that it doesn't require you believing in it for this to work.

170
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.630
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, so in our body.

171
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what's called a Vegas nerve, it goes. It's called the wandering nerve. It goes brain goes to our face goes to our ears goes to our throat heart chest guts, spleen, all of our viscera. It's called all of our organs.

172
00:19:51.630 --> 00:20:01.080
Gwenevere Abriel: When I teach you the I'll call it belly breathing, because this way you can remember that it's the belly expanding that makes all the difference. Okay.

173
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:24.990
Gwenevere Abriel: When I say that it is that deep full long breath that activates the Vegas nerve. This is what I mean when you inhale and it goes where as if a balloon. We're expanding in your belly and it's not short appear. Most people you'll know a short little breath when your shoulders do this.

174
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's not the deep breath.

175
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You may be doing that, but that's not what makes the difference. What makes the difference is this and your shoulders will move

176
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: What will happen is you expand that belly. It's as if a balloon.

177
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Right expands in the belly. So if you're filling it with air.

178
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And here's what happens when you do this really different kind of breathing. We knew how to do it. We were babies. Maybe you could picture that little belly kind of go and work with a little belly moving up and down.

179
00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we stopped doing it as adults we just do this short little tight breath up here.

180
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So what happens when I have this this belly breath it smashes down on the diaphragm it smashes down on all those Oregon's below it. And guess what it does.

181
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

182
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.550
Gwenevere Abriel: It signals that Vegas nerve and it goes like this.

183
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Up to the brain. And you know what it says in complete contradiction to the mind which is saying, oh, this new this girl needs to shut up. I'm going to smack the stupid out of her. Okay, so that's going on right this breath. This kind of breath says

184
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.450
Gwenevere Abriel: She's not a danger to us.

185
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Because no one can breathe like that when they're about to

186
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.500
Write

187
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It.

188
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel me

189
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: complete contradiction. We need that contradiction. We need it fast. Okay, we can pop off really quick. Right. So we need that to get up real fast so we

190
00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:08.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a teacher to you. I'm not teaching now I'm just doing my slain. And so what happens, it goes up to the Vegas nerve sends it up to the brain says we'll wait we're good. There's actually no danger which is perceiving danger.

191
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:15.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's keep breathing and then we remember up here, all that information of consequence.

192
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Of like the belief in the self, I really don't want to physically hurt someone. I don't want to hurt myself.

193
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:31.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I just don't want to be around idiots or people that are insulting. I just don't want to be around them. That's all it is. Oh, wait. Now, what can I do, I can

194
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:38.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Ignore walk away whatever that's later on. But those are the things that you'll be able to remember up here. Your whole brain will be online.

195
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:44.610
LG Aristo 2: The and that's how I feel like I don't know how to communicate, but boy, I sure have a mouthful. When it comes time to

196
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:55.320
LG Aristo 2: I know you and I've been better like now at work, like say for example, the girl. One of them went in the next morning, because I was just really concentrating because it was my first night.

197
00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:01.470
LG Aristo 2: That I've messed up before so I was really concentrating on my register and I was doing what I needed to do.

198
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:16.320
LG Aristo 2: She went in and I even gave her a hug, before we left that night. She went in crying to them. The next morning saying how mean I was to her and I was just like, are you kidding me. I said, watch the cameras even hundred into the night. Like, I was like, why, you know, and then it's kind of like

199
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:22.830
LG Aristo 2: She's, she's the one that does the gossiping, but doesn't want to be involved in it kind of BS.

200
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:23.760
LG Aristo 2: So, so

201
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:25.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You're

202
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:34.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stay right here on this belly breathing. Let's make sure you come away with this so that it's yours forever.

203
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.150
LG Aristo 2: Okay, you

204
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Own this

205
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:48.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Because wisdom you get time time to remember skills which you and I haven't gone over yet. That's going to be fun. I'm going to teach all kinds of fun things will do role plays love a good time.

206
00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be able to handle this woman, it should be like, who is this woman I'm working. I don't even know.

207
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:53.460
I know

208
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.840
LG Aristo 2: But you

209
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: won't remember them.

210
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: In

211
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: An anxious body you want

212
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:07.560
LG Aristo 2: And I agree to that I there's there's situations that I've gotten in there. I'm just like, and then after I calm down. I'm like, what was I thinking

213
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:08.190
LG Aristo 2: So let's

214
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep teaching. I'm going to

215
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.560
LG Aristo 2: Sleep so

216
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I just gave you the physiology. Do you notice that it doesn't, it's not a psychological trick. It is physiology.

217
00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You do not have to believe me when I say this is going to work. It just works because it's like you have to tell your hard to work. No. It just does.

218
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:36.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the parasympathetic nervous system sympathetic is fight or flight parasympathetic nervous system is that Vegas nerve pulling the break.

219
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:53.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Putting the freeze on it. Okay. Down regulating the heart rate and the rapid breast. The demand for oxygen is decreased and we calm down. It's a fact all of our bodies have it. If you don't, right, because we can't live with that all the time.

220
00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.390
LG Aristo 2: It's bad. Right.

221
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the cortisol. This rushing around really bad for us. So now let's go in. I want to go into teaching it. You ready

222
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:00.450
Yep.

223
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: For so I'm going to teach, then I'll show you how to do it. And we'll do it together. Okay, first one I'm just going to do some teaching. So, just listen to kind of watch me you don't feel compelled to do it, but you're welcome to do whatever you want and no way for you to do it wrong. Okay.

224
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so this is the basics, the basics are this. It's an inhale through the nose.

225
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, paying attention. The whole time goes in.

226
00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: And you expand that balloon in the belly, right, not with the shoulders up what's different is that you're also using that kind of concept that's really trendy right now mindfulness

227
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:43.740
Gwenevere Abriel: We pay attention to the tactile experience of those little nose hairs wiggling around and we feel that cool air really cold air apparently

228
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Going into the nose and down and filling up that long. So it isn't just know it's specifically for seconds.

229
00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Of inhaling through the nose with that tactile touch awareness, who aware of how that airfield, and you're expanding that belly and then guess what you hold your breath for four seconds.

230
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And then out of your mouth very deliberately, it will be four seconds of

231
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 in through the nose.

232
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 and then it's

233
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.560
All 321

234
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat. Flat belly hold 321

235
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.050
Hold three

236
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.150
Push it on

237
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:10.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold three one. Now, just to review. It's an inhale through the nose. Pop quiz can't get it wrong. This is just to see what sticking because there's one thing

238
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: That can't be skipped the one thing that pulls that they will break the one that actually sends that signal up to the brain. This part can't be skipped with the breath. Do you remember what part that is

239
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.910
LG Aristo 2: When you breathe in through your nostrils. Don't lift your shoulders that one.

240
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.950
LG Aristo 2: And then you read that hold it and then breathe out, you

241
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You can forget all that

242
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: You can be mouth craven girl.

243
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:55.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You're gonna be mouth praising the whole time, you can get all that your shoulders can be. You can be blue. You can do whatever you want. Nope, he got to have the air in the bottom of your long

244
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, can't skip that one. That's why we're going to call it belly breathing, because I think it's going to help you remember no joke.

245
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It can't stay here. Guess what organs aren't getting smushed so that, so. Oh, a world K anybody that brings deep like that there's no danger and sends a signal we have to make that belly balloon happen to smash the organs to send the signal to the brain. It this body's not in danger.

246
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: can't skip it. I don't care if you're not free don't care.

247
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:33.960
LG Aristo 2: Just breathe.

248
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: In the belly, so

249
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now we're going to put a pause.

250
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:47.850
Gwenevere Abriel: This is so important that we're going to put all the instruction aside and all you're going to do is put your hand on your belly and see if you can even do it.

251
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:48.780
Okay.

252
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:59.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm going to share with you. I don't find this easy. I found this so difficult. I've gotten in the habit of it, but it's hard. So first become aware of your shoulders. Notice where they are.

253
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And now I want you to push all the air out, push it all out.

254
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:11.850
Gwenevere Abriel: inhale through your nose expanding your belly, as if it was full of air, push, push, push, just the belly.

255
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice your shoulders.

256
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.750
Yes, I could feel like

257
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I told you this is hard.

258
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.190
LG Aristo 2: It is

259
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:21.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

260
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:32.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't look at me. I want you to look at your own your own pause right there on your tummy and just just see if you inhale, can you make a balloon in there.

261
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.460
LG Aristo 2: Yes. Yeah, yeah.

262
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:40.470
Gwenevere Abriel: So when I didn't, you know I push it all out. And then I go and I can pop out my hands.

263
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.670
LG Aristo 2: Can you pop yours out. Yep.

264
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.860
Gwenevere Abriel: With an eel has to be an idiot.

265
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.790
LG Aristo 2: Um, it's hard, but yes.

266
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.500
LG Aristo 2: It's hard.

267
00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:50.700
LG Aristo 2: It's so

268
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard and like that.

269
00:29:53.430 --> 00:30:00.210
LG Aristo 2: Nobody. Yeah, that's a good, that's something that with my hypertension anyway.

270
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.760
LG Aristo 2: I get so wound up

271
00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:03.930
LG Aristo 2: And

272
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:15.090
LG Aristo 2: Any. Great. Yeah, so it, it helps a whole bunch. When I can just and there's times I have walked away. And I've been the bigger person. But yeah, this House, this will be good.

273
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: So I left. We're going to do it together and

274
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Get to have an experiential

275
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:26.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Benefit of it. So what we'll do a couple of things. First, I'm going to review it again because it's a lot to take in.

276
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: First, we're going to do it with what's called fidelity, which means you do it. Just the way you're supposed to. But the truth is, you can use whatever counts, you want

277
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And then remember

278
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That remember the one thing that there's, you've got to absolutely have his belly breathe.

279
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:46.590
LG Aristo 2: Elliot good belly.

280
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.200
LG Aristo 2: belly breathing. That's right.

281
00:30:49.260 --> 00:31:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, the fourth hour, blah blah blah, whatever, you know, over time, I've noticed my inhales about four seconds I hold it for maybe three, but my exhale is like six

282
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.400
LG Aristo 2: Six. Yeah, I've noticed that too.

283
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my god.

284
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.970
LG Aristo 2: Isn't that great came out and

285
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually that that exhales a beautiful one. So, stretch it out.

286
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.170
LG Aristo 2: It's doing a great job to bring that

287
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Relax muscle until the body. We're okay because you can't do that when you're in a threat response.

288
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:22.650
LG Aristo 2: You don't have any air.

289
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.200
LG Aristo 2: You'd have any air.

290
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.330
LG Aristo 2: You have enough dl, but that's about it.

291
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So we'll do it with fidelity. But you and I, we both get, you get to make it deeply personal make it your own style.

292
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:44.760
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll eventually right we'll have some neat imagery that is going with it. And then while that frontal lobe is coming online.

293
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Then we're going to have these new skills, you're going to learn. We'll have some meat imagery that when you around toxic people you can maintain the integrity that you're proud of that. You can walk away from it feeling like

294
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Nobody can touch me. I'm like em untouchable. This is fantastic. Look at me. Right. I mean, that's just

295
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to be able to move through these people where you're in charge of how you react. Wouldn't that be nice.

296
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.170
LG Aristo 2: Yes, yes.

297
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.560
LG Aristo 2: Yes. Amen to that. So,

298
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to do a little bit of it.

299
00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:27.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I told you the physiological benefit and you're probably going to find out the second benefit of it after we actually do it.

300
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:35.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's make it relevant. Let's take you've got lots of little inner personal things going on in your head, something that just happened at work.

301
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:48.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That hypocrisy that double standard. The gossiping, the mixed message the toxic whatever this woman is doing. Maybe it's someone else I want you to just, you don't even have to tell me just sort of hold it in your awareness.

302
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: untrustworthy maybe my

303
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.090
LG Aristo 2: She says one thing does another like

304
00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:54.360
Well,

305
00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.730
LG Aristo 2: Yeah, I'm too old for this, though, but

306
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:06.810
LG Aristo 2: Now it's hard as I went to high school out here. So there's a lot of people that's that's a rough one, so

307
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: We're pulling it out of the

308
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Hippocampus we're putting it in to what we call working memory. There's a lot of memories you have a campus holes lots and lots of memories from childhood, it stores it all. It's amazing.

309
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:35.820
Gwenevere Abriel: But just for now I want you to picture just sort of one piece, maybe a yucky piece of maybe seeing her do something or whatever and just, just notice how your body responds to just even thinking about that negative event. Just pay attention. I

310
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.190
LG Aristo 2: Heart just start pattering right away.

311
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: So here we go, exhale all the air out.

312
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:46.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, inhale through the nose, big belly.

313
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale it out.

314
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.370
Hold 321 inhale through the nose.

315
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold 321 exhale it deliberately all out flat, flat belly flat, all of it out.

316
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Here we go, and hold it all out for 321 bring it into the nose.

317
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:25.890
Gwenevere Abriel: A balloon belly hold 321 push it all out.

318
00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:41.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 inhale feeling every little bit of it to those nose and nostrils and hold 321 push it all out.

319
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Laptop five five flat.

320
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Pull it all out for 321 inhale.

321
00:34:53.190 --> 00:35:02.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Nice big belly and hold it in there 321 let it all go all in it. Go, go, go, go.

322
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it all out.

323
00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And then breathe it in through the nose.

324
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold it in there for 321 not deliberately pierces lips and push it all out.

325
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold 321 breathe in through the nose.

326
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: The balloon down there. Hold it for 321 push it all.

327
00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: See ya. Bye bye.

328
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:46.920
Gwenevere Abriel: And hold it out 321 and now on your own count inside in quietly inside yourself.

329
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Just run cycles through on your own.

330
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Good get that big belly for us down in there.

331
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

332
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.530
Awkward.

333
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.990
LG Aristo 2: Yeah, I have a lot more air coming out, like you said,

334
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, real quick.

335
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to know.

336
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: What you think about anything else.

337
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:30.870
LG Aristo 2: No, I did real good on my breathing and I just feel like it's just I feel good. Here, like there's a weight lifted me yeah yeah

338
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:31.920
LG Aristo 2: So robotic

339
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:39.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brain did it think about anything else, or were you concentrating on this breathing.

340
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:47.730
LG Aristo 2: It just didn't make me think of anything else you know I was breathing. I wasn't really thinking of anything like went away with the breathing.

341
00:36:47.790 --> 00:37:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right, so here you just found out the second I told you about the physiology, the Vegas nerve that it's a bagel break the parasympathetic nervous system. You just found out real time what the second one is

342
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.640
LG Aristo 2: Not having to speak.

343
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's distracting. This is so hard to do.

344
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.090
LG Aristo 2: I like the challenge though.

345
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.340
LG Aristo 2: Love the challenge.

346
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.260
LG Aristo 2: It's hard. Yeah.

347
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And

348
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:23.910
LG Aristo 2: And I catch myself doing my shoulders to but then I remember. Oh no, the bell and then once I get the belly. Back then it goes right back into the

349
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: It takes all of your concentration. That's why I said, trying to list fidelity. First, right, because it will distract your mind from what if this woman gives me a hard time again tomorrow.

350
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't start analyzing

351
00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:48.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Your brain wants to do one thing. Well, let's focus on, especially since you just learned something new is the brain loves learning new stuff. Oh my gosh, it's like, oh, there's a problem to solve a man it was

352
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:54.750
Gwenevere Abriel: It's awesome. So you made that happen. You did two things.

353
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.200
LG Aristo 2: And I asked them. Yep. So you

354
00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:09.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Already that you know what's neat about what you told me soon as you walked in here. You said I took a deep breath and kept busy did my distraction. You already are remembering the breath. Now when you walk away.

355
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:29.070
LG Aristo 2: I guess.

356
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So focused on that because you're going to want to like, come back to group and be like, I did it so well and it was awesome. And my shoulders were like little frozen icebergs and I was great. Okay. Yeah.

357
00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be thinking about this turkey. This

358
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't want you there. We want this is your life, don't waste a minute of it.

359
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Right ignorant people

360
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to enjoy your

361
00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Moments. And this breath.

362
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.590
Gwenevere Abriel: gives you time to remember

363
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:15.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't need any of these little people this small I don't either. Okay. And then over time, you will have more and more skills, about how to communicate. There's cute little trips to use with dumb people

364
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.240
LG Aristo 2: I hear ya I hear ya. It's just crazy but

365
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:28.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so you just learned a super important skill with you forever.

366
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:37.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I wish they taught it to us when we were kids in school. I wish our parents taught it to us. I wish we had the science, the science, the fact that that Vegas nerve that the

367
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a dorsal and ventral nerve one smile and aid one's not blah, blah, blah. Anyway, we didn't know about it. Yeah. Think about how many religions or cultures, talk about the breath. We knew without knowing the science behind it. It's the right thing to do.

368
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:54.600
LG Aristo 2: Yeah.

369
00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It regulates us. It says

370
00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:04.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay. I'm here in this body. I'm in this moment, I'm okay. In this moment.

371
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:16.230
LG Aristo 2: It's amazing. That's what felt good, even just a weight that went off my chest, it, it went away just even because I tried thinking about it, but you don't even have time to think about it because you're busy breathing. That's awesome.

372
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

373
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So we want to keep it difficult, so it occupies the line. So we want it to be difficult. So, and you may challenge yourself. Oh, this month. I'm just going to do it on for the next time, I'm a try. Five, you know, challenge yourself because the brain likes that.

374
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll say so.

375
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.640
LG Aristo 2: Great job. Thank you.

376
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:40.200
LG Aristo 2: Thank you. Thank you. I'm all excited to try it now. I can't wait to go to work tomorrow.

377
00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:41.580
LG Aristo 2: So we

378
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Have a little bit of time left. So let's shift gears and let's do I want to start to do some some preparation and use a liberal look these these couple things. I'm gonna do with you are super quick.

379
00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:16.260
Gwenevere Abriel: But they'll really add to, to having some resourcing and preparation for future work. So has there ever been a time where it would have been nice for you to what people call compartmentalize and emotion or a reaction or a memory, like, oh, I don't really want to deal with this right now.

380
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:18.390
LG Aristo 2: Right, yeah.

381
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yes. So,

382
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's right now create an imagery around that and I call it a container and this container is your emotional container and we're going to use it.

383
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:39.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Lots of different ways but super handy. It's going to stay in this particular section in my note and I can reference it if you ever forget it. I'll have it written right there in the middle.

384
00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And here are the requirements.

385
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.490
Gwenevere Abriel: This container.

386
00:41:45.600 --> 00:42:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Can be whatever you want. Whatever your imagination comes up with, but it's got to be big enough strong enough to hold all your emotional stuff kind of have a lid on it. Got a lot of some kind.

387
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Finger well nomination or key.

388
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:09.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what comes to mind. Give yourself time to think.

389
00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:20.400
LG Aristo 2: I think what the hardest thing is is when we go around my kids. And it seems like there's always tension like

390
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:29.280
LG Aristo 2: I'm and it's usually me that that has the issue of being around. I don't know if that makes sense. That's what came to mind.

391
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.180
LG Aristo 2: Okay, now

392
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: We know what

393
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.730
LG Aristo 2: You just told me the

394
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Content of what's going in the container. Now I want you to actually this is actually telling me the container. I'll give you an example, someone said a mason jar. Another person said a safe. One person said a cargo.

395
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: What you call those things that go on a train ride a train car that's also goes on a cargo ship to India or something.

396
00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:03.780
Gwenevere Abriel: One person said just a large wooden the the container was a large jewelry box or a chest like

397
00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:09.420
LG Aristo 2: Tupperware. I just think of big plastic Tupperware. I don't know why, and put the lid on it.

398
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:17.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're gonna. So remember, we're just learning each other here. So, so really tuned into yourself. So here's the thing. Notice the requirement.

399
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Wants you to picture that tension.

400
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Remember the requirement big enough strong enough to hold all your stuff. We're just talking about tension with a family there might be a lot and it might want to get out is that Tupperware big enough and strong enough for all your emotional stuff.

401
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:49.650
LG Aristo 2: Mm hmm. No, I had to put it in a safe a metal box. I'll put a safe.

402
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go.

403
00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, now we're talking

404
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.040
LG Aristo 2: Okay.

405
00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Now you can see it if it wanted to get out. You've already. You've already kind of got locked it.

406
00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:58.500
LG Aristo 2: In there.

407
00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.270
LG Aristo 2: Yes.

408
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, how big, how big would it be

409
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:10.200
LG Aristo 2: Um, it's pretty big will put a staff floor safe. What a lock on it. Yeah.

410
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.080
Yep Okay floor safe.

411
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll call it pretty big cool and then we're Let's do another one. This will call the container.

412
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:31.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's go do another one super handy to have when we want to get a little bit of distance. This is similar. This is similar

413
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to give you some examples of what I want to do now, which is I want. See if you can come up. This is the creative mind the right side of your brain when you had to kind of come up with the safe that one.

414
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:53.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Same kind of thing. So I want you to come up with imagery for a distancing metaphor. So I'll give you an example, recently this week, people have been coming up with this one.

415
00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:11.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Spaceship takes off. I have a negative, whatever, and I want it gone like 20 seconds ago off it goes into outer space. Can't even see it anymore and off it goes. Some people are like, yeah, I'm not in any hurry. You know, it's kind of on a cruise ship and it's like

416
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

417
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Slowly moving

418
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.000
LG Aristo 2: Like, Oh, that's right. If

419
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:30.840
Gwenevere Abriel: I needed to be a little faster that some people are in a car, they're going to play and passing them and they look in the rearview mirror and they're like, Oh, I can't even see it anymore. It

420
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:31.860
LG Aristo 2: Like that one.

421
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:33.090
LG Aristo 2: Yeah, well,

422
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:34.320
LG Aristo 2: You

423
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.930
LG Aristo 2: Yeah, the rearview mirror that one.

424
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.580
Gwenevere Abriel: But let's do it. I'm like, Okay.

425
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.630
LG Aristo 2: I like it.

426
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And then like I can't even see that

427
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.460
LG Aristo 2: It for yeah

428
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:45.450
LG Aristo 2: I like that one.

429
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and you're heading in this direction and it's going the other way.

430
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.670
LG Aristo 2: That's even better. I like it.

431
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:59.640
LG Aristo 2: See, yes. We didn't want to be. Yeah, right. Okay, so now we've got distancing man.

432
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:12.540
Gwenevere Abriel: For so you'll hear me refer to it that way. And it's going to be car driving opposite direction seen further

433
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: And further own way and rear view mirror.

434
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.390
LG Aristo 2: Yep. Sounds good.

435
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.280
LG Aristo 2: That's awesome. Yeah.

436
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And so the idea is

437
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: There's also going to be will be developing

438
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:47.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What I end up calling sort of your team and it'll be and you're welcome to if you want to set yourself some homework I love your homework kind of gal. What you can do is you can either on your own or when we meet again will be visualizing

439
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Protective quality either real or imagined.

440
00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people said the Hulk. Some people say my uncle sale. One was imagined. Right. It's an hour. That's not real. Well, I guess it depends.

441
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: On you. But

442
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:20.130
Gwenevere Abriel: One is my uncle is a real life. I actually felt his protective nature he only wanted for my safety, most people that I work with.

443
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: They have a hard time finding real people. Because the whole point of a part of their, their childhood experience was a failure of their caregivers to protect them. So don't give yourself a hard time if you can't come up with anyone real that's fine you can be from a book, a movie, TV.

444
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.430
LG Aristo 2: My grandfather was the one

445
00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.910
LG Aristo 2: Your grandfather and my grandmother. Yeah, that's great.

446
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'll put in there right now right now okay and then do you're already clipping along. I'll go ahead and write it in. So this is coming too quickly. Let's just put it in there. Then let's let's keep going. It's only two more.

447
00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:57.030
LG Aristo 2: What

448
00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you think about a protective quality real or imagined of someone who is nurturing. This is someone who wants your growth your development, pure and simple nothing back. They don't want, they just they want for you to be your authentic self.

449
00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.920
LG Aristo 2: My daughter Michaela my youngest

450
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:28.770
Beautiful. And let me just real quick. Up here put grandma, grandpa.

451
00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: He said, Grandpa first right

452
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.240
Mm hmm.

453
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.700
LG Aristo 2: Okay, Grandpa.

454
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:45.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And grab also but but the real this this protective active, then this one is for nurturing

455
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Your turn, your turn. There you go.

456
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.830
LG Aristo 2: Not heard

457
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Michaela arm again. How old is she,

458
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:58.440
LG Aristo 2: Good 16

459
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, she's really got a minor on now DUNGEY

460
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, yeah.

LG Aristo 2: Very much so.

Gwenevere Abriel: That's a good thing. Good to know and feel her own agency. So last one is

463
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that the imagery, real or imagined of a wise figure

464
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.800
LG Aristo 2: Hmm.

465
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:35.670
LG Aristo 2: I don't see my husband's wise. He's very Paul. He's wise when it comes to he helps me get through.

466
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:42.180
LG Aristo 2: Those kinds of things being wise. Okay. But other than that, I can't think of anybody else.

467
00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:46.530
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to go with what tell me

468
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:51.420
LG Aristo 2: Know, that's why I was just gonna say he's, he's the one my husband. And so when I could think of.

469
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.910
Gwenevere Abriel: That's perfect. So we you've done a lot of work today. Bravo.

470
00:49:58.410 --> 00:49:59.040
LG Aristo 2: Thank you.

471
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at our schedule and see what works for future appointments and you've been apparently in this program for a little while so

472
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it's

473
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.240
Gwenevere Abriel: More than welcome to meet weekly or you can do a bi weekly or what would you like to do

474
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.030
LG Aristo 2: Let's do it.

475
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:30.540
LG Aristo 2: Weekly right now. Okay, we'll go weekly. And then, and if it's Wednesdays at this time. If you have openings or if anytime before I go to work at 130

476
00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:32.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, okay. All right.

477
00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.920
LG Aristo 2: And I have group on Mondays with you.

478
00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: But you're right, it can't be Mondays. So let me just, I'm looking ahead, I think we're okay for 10 o'clock on March 4 Wednesday, March forth, it'll feel just like this.

479
00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.120
LG Aristo 2: Okay, yeah.

480
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:59.880
LG Aristo 2: And I'll put that down. Cool. March 4 at 10:10am. Okay, good.

481
00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:05.850
LG Aristo 2: And if you ever need to switch it or do bike weekly if you do have people that are full, or if

482
00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:09.450
LG Aristo 2: You need somebody else. I don't mind doing the bi weekly

483
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:19.380
LG Aristo 2: But I kind of like to, if I could do weekly until we get to know each other a little better than then maybe we can move to bi weekly like once we see how things go. Yeah.

484
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:20.280
Um,

485
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:30.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It might end up being the reverse. What might it might be. You get to know me we trust each other right

486
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:39.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you might start diving in deeper into these interventions and you might want to stay because with weekly because

487
00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you might say, Oh that was so intense. I need more time to marinate right more time to let that really saturate and I need to sit with that a little longer so whichever happens for you either direction is fine.

488
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:57.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I got a lot of people in my case, I've got a pretty decent I'm managing it pretty well.

489
00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's, again, there's no wrong way for you to do this just pay attention to yourself if something comes up. I'm interested

490
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Your body has a specific reaction, emotionally, you have a reaction A belief about yourself. Big emotion. I'm interested in all of those experiences in the whole body. I want to know about. Okay.

491
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:19.500
LG Aristo 2: Sounds good.
