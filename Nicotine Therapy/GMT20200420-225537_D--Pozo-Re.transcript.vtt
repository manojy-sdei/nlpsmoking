50
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.670
Jesse Baca: And we really good

51
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.700
Jesse Baca: I was never dirty for us or anything like that.

52
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.020
Dominique Pozo: And when was

53
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.110
Jesse Baca: The last time I was there was in 2000

54
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.500
Jesse Baca: October 2019

55
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.990
Dominique Pozo: And what happened if it was going well, what

56
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.950
Jesse Baca: It was just, just a little bit of disputes like cuz I had a

57
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:25.470
Jesse Baca: I had surgery for my mouth. Just get some teeth removed because they're just like the wisdom teeth and everything. And, um,

58
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:37.410
Jesse Baca: I guess I was in pain at, um, they said they would help me go through and everything. I wouldn't even have done surgery but I was just in pain and everything. They didn't really help me. So I just thought an argument with

59
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.970
With

60
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.420
Jesse Baca: With the superintendent. The, the person that owns it, I guess, or whoever the person that's running in

61
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.040
Jesse Baca: The doctor

62
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.820
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

63
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.460
Jesse Baca: And he just kicked me out.

64
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.410
Jesse Baca: I'm just being honest.

65
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.410
Jesse Baca: But it's talking happen again.

66
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:07.140
Dominique Pozo: Oh no, that's fine. So I'm I think I'm maybe I'm not clear. So you've got into an argument with the person that the I O P program. Is that what you're saying.

67
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.820
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

68
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.840
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I thought you were talking about your dentist. I didn't quite understand. So

69
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.490
Jesse Baca: Okay, I'm sorry.

70
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:30.990
Dominique Pozo: So here's the thing, if you relapse or have a slip in this program, we're not going to kick you out, or we really want you to, you know, to have this come from you and you know really you commit to your recovery. We're not going to kick you out. This isn't a punitive program.

71
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:32.670
Jesse Baca: Okay.

72
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:43.080
Dominique Pozo: And with that said, I'm not saying you know go use and I'm not encouraging that at all. I'm just saying it's better to talk about it. Like if you

73
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:58.650
Dominique Pozo: Are having a really bad week and you come to group and you're feeling agitated and you're craving please talk about it because other folks in the group. You know a lot of people have relapsed they've slipped while in the program. So it might help to talk to other folks about it.

74
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.390
Jesse Baca: Sounds good.

75
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:01.950
Jesse Baca: Okay.

76
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.480
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

77
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.660
Dominique Pozo: And was it just opiates or do were you struggling with anything else.

78
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.380
Jesse Baca: Just opiates. Okay.

79
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.440
Dominique Pozo: And how did that start

80
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:36.060
Jesse Baca: Um, I think it was just more of dealing with my mental health in a healthy way. Just, you know,

81
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:44.550
Jesse Baca: Just, I was just feeling depressed and just was looking for something to cover it, you know, just don't make it make myself feel better.

82
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.510
Jesse Baca: Yeah. Exciting stuff like that. Yeah.

83
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.340
Dominique Pozo: That makes sense.

84
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.170
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

85
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.800

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.210
Dominique Pozo: Anything else

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.000

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.940
Jesse Baca: Depression. That's it. Okay.

91
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.230
All right.

92
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:37.980
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm going to ask you a little bit about your family history. Can you tell me a bit about your, your relationship with your mom. What was she like

93
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.070
Dominique Pozo: And what is your relationship now.

94
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.760
I'm

95
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.910
Jesse Baca: I'm my relationship was always good with my mom when I was a kid, still is going good to everything's good.

96
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.010
Dominique Pozo: How about when you were actively using. How was it at that point with her.

97
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.150
Jesse Baca: Um, it's been the same.

98
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.570
Dominique Pozo: How does she

99
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.490
Jesse Baca: Um, she was, she was, she

100
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:35.610
Jesse Baca: Just always wants what's best for me. And she just she's saying like, I should have gone hope nothing, and I did get help already so she's been supportive with me.

101
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.780
Dominique Pozo: How about with your dad.

102
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.480
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

103
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.310
Jesse Baca: I since I was younger, until now.

104
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.900
Dominique Pozo: Oh, so same

105
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.460
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

106
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:09.180
Jesse Baca: He did. He did have drinking issues, stuff like that. But it really didn't like affect me that much.

107
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.190
Jesse Baca: You know,

108
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.720
Jesse Baca: You just had drinking issues. And I guess you're just a functioning alcoholic.

109
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.350
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm.

110
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.540
Dominique Pozo: It didn't affect you at all to you can't think of any way that that impacted you

111
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.270
Jesse Baca: As well.

112
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.970
Jesse Baca: 99 in a big way.

113
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.170
Jesse Baca: I mean, I always thought it was weird that he was drinking. I knew what it was.

114
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:37.770
Dominique Pozo: It didn't

115
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.240
Jesse Baca: Oh golly, it probably has

116
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.180
Jesse Baca: Just nothing I can think of right now.

117
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.980
Jesse Baca: I never seen anything weird didn't do anything.

118
00:11:51.810 --> 00:12:02.610
Dominique Pozo: I mean was he ever verbally abusive or anything like that with you all. Because after a while if someone's chronically drinking it starts to really impact their liver and

119
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.220
Jesse Baca: Well,

120
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.890
Jesse Baca: He did a lot for his, his pain if I get a lot of like painting his body and everything with his, his knees and everything.

121
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.820
Jesse Baca: He would just isolate himself for or you just like be really

122
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.890
Jesse Baca: Antisocial

123
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:24.600
Jesse Baca: But

124
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:35.490
Jesse Baca: Um, he, he worked a lot though. So, you know, I didn't really see him that way. Anyway, like until it when you got home.

125
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.380
Jesse Baca: But I don't know. That's, that's it.

126
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:53.280
Dominique Pozo: I mean, when I think of your dad isolating and being antisocial and you being a young boy I do wonder, you know, was that sad for you and hard to not have your dad around

127
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:55.350
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

128
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:03.210
Jesse Baca: I guess I didn't know where you're going with that. I just like he wasn't ever violent or anything, just like

129
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.210
Jesse Baca: You just be antisocial.

130
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.310
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, I mean I think having a parent. That's not fully present

131
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.050
Dominique Pozo: Often, most of the time does impact a child so

132
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.900
Dominique Pozo: It's just curious, like, wow, that didn't, didn't impact we did

133
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.700
Jesse Baca: It take me to stay parks, all the time and everything. Uh huh. Cool.

134
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.250
Dominique Pozo: Did escaped with you.

135
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:30.660

244
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.120
Dominique Pozo: Anything else

245
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.340
Jesse Baca: That's about it.

246
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:57.480
Okay.

247
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:17.310
Dominique Pozo: All right, so let's think of some short term goals. So if we could come up with six. That would be great. So six goals that you would like to complete by, say, the end of May.

248
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.000
Jesse Baca: And yeah.

249
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:30.930
Jesse Baca: Um,

250
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:45.360
Jesse Baca: It's a short time, but I did. I went I want to get my GED. First off, and be able to find a job until then.

251
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.140
Jesse Baca: And just continue my sobriety.

252
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.250
Jesse Baca: Which is, I don't know if that makes sense. That's cool.

253
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:13.170
Dominique Pozo: You know it is a great goal. I think it's a wonderful goal to have if you're in recovery for sure. And sometimes it's good to just name, how you can do that and I'll just give you

254
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:23.040
Dominique Pozo: A little prompt. If you want to name continue your sobriety by attending weekly group meetings and individual therapy.

255
00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.090
Jesse Baca: Yeah, sure. Once a week would be good weekly

256
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:38.220
Dominique Pozo: For. Well, definitely. You have to go to the group meetings, weekly, but would you like weekly individual therapy as well.

257
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.110
Dominique Pozo: I can't hear you. You got broken

258
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.560
Jesse Baca: Can I switch to my Wi Fi.

259
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:50.340
Yeah.

260
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.330
Jesse Baca: It won't interrupt me

261
00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.400
Jesse Baca: Okay. Um, I think I should be good with her.

262
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.340
Dominique Pozo: Oh, that sounds so much better. Actually, yeah.

263
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:27.840
Jesse Baca: Yeah, okay.

264
00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:35.910
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so definitely you have to come to the group meetings weekly. How often would you like to come to individual therapy will be with me.

265
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.290
Dominique Pozo: Shoot, I can't hear you.

266
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:49.800
Dominique Pozo: Huh.

267
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.430
Dominique Pozo: OK, now I hear you.

268
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.700
Jesse Baca: Yeah I froze there for a second.

269
00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:05.310
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I keep asking you how often you want to come to individual therapy, but I am not hearing your response because it freezes.

270
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.120
Jesse Baca: Can you hear me now.

271
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.560
Yes, yeah.

272
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.710
Jesse Baca: Okay, um, how many times do I want to do a week like or just repeat all that

273
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:25.020
Dominique Pozo: So it's part of the program is you have to come to the weekly group meetings. That's that is just required

274
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:26.490
Jesse Baca: To get your medication.

275
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:42.330
Dominique Pozo: The one that you came to last week and then the individual therapy, it's, it's more flexible, we could do weekly once a week or we could do once every two weeks. But definitely, I encourage weekly, and if that if you know that's too much, then we could do every other week.

276
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.280
Jesse Baca: But definitely of the week.

277
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.850
Dominique Pozo: Okay, so I'm going to put bi weekly

278
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:06.780
Jesse Baca: Because I do see I do see my therapist once a week, and I just like to have some, like, you know, sometimes just the, you know, like the

279
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:08.940
Jesse Baca: Like you know and i mean

280
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:10.560
Jesse Baca: To me.

281
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.440
Dominique Pozo: Yeah. Oh, so you already have a therapist.

282
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:20.100
Jesse Baca: Yeah, I told him that last time to you at home. I probably haven't told you yet though. But yes, I have a therapist. Yeah.

283
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:26.490
Dominique Pozo: Oh well, I mean, do you want extra support from me. I don't want to interfere with the therapy, you're doing with them.

284
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.680
Jesse Baca: Um,

285
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.220
Jesse Baca: I would like to do it every other week. So I want you. Okay.

286
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:48.450
Dominique Pozo: Let's do it. And I'm so I'm a trained art therapist, and I do movement and writing as well expressive art therapy. So, you know, if you're doing straight talk therapy with them. Maybe we can get into more experiential work and keep

287
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:55.110
Dominique Pozo: You know, exploring and deepening your process in other ways. If you want, or we can do talk therapy to that's fine.

288
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.290
Jesse Baca: Yeah, talk therapy.

289
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:12.720
Dominique Pozo: Okay, great. So let's see. So I'm going to put bi weekly with me and then. Okay, how about three more goals. If you can think of some short term and if you want to think of more long term, why don't we do

290
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.800
Dominique Pozo: Maybe one more short term and a couple long term goals.

291
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:18.840
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

292
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:32.370
Jesse Baca: Um,

293
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:39.990
Jesse Baca: I really can't think of any other than just like my main priority is just to really get my GED underway.

294
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:41.370
Mm hmm.

295
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.150
Dominique Pozo: Um, do you want to get more exercise or

296
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.690
Dominique Pozo: Know. Is there anything else that you've been wanting to do that isn't a huge endeavor.

297
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.730
Jesse Baca: I can think of some like simple one. Just

298
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:00.750
Well,

299
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.420
Jesse Baca: Um, I

300
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.670
Jesse Baca: Of course exercise will be good for anybody but um

301
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.750
Jesse Baca: I really don't. I haven't really been putting goals like that, but I can start setting goals.

302
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:27.030
Dominique Pozo: Well, let's do that in our individual therapy, maybe let's just get specific more exercise how what what kinds like riding your bike skateboarding running swimming. What kind of

303
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.130
Jesse Baca: Skateboarding

304
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:30.150
OK.

305
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.080
Dominique Pozo: All right.

306
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:47.880
Dominique Pozo: OK. And then let's think of to long term goals and then tell me when you first see and that can be, you know, in the next year or it can. These are longer ones so

307
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.480

Jesse Baca: I'm finding a job.

309
00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.260
Dominique Pozo: Okay, I had that on your short term goal. Do you want that to be a long term one

310
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.490
Jesse Baca: Sorry, I didn't realize this at that for that part.

Dominique Pozo: In the long term goal realistically. When do you think, can you really imagine getting a new job. Like if you just first look into the next year what what month so I can just put a target date down

317
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:51.840
Jesse Baca: June.

318
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:53.820
Dominique Pozo: June. Okay.

319
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.780
Dominique Pozo: Alright and then

320
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:04.980
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

321
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.740
Dominique Pozo: So how about

322
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:22.530
Dominique Pozo: How about the tapering off of Suboxone when can you imagine doing that and just want to let you know, from what I've witnessed over the last, like, four years working with bright heart health, it's a slow process. So,

323
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:29.400
Jesse Baca: Yeah, I know, I know. I'm thinking about around a six month mark this like around six months or seven months.

324
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:34.680
Dominique Pozo: Oh, that seems even very short to need. But if you want to put it at that. Okay.

325
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:43.860
Dominique Pozo: So let's see where an April. It's just say, May, June, July, August, September. So around October, November.

326
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:51.990
Jesse Baca: Yeah, and even then it's not like I said day either, you know, it just depends. I'll put it that date, though, though, though work.

327
00:31:52.800 --> 00:32:03.930
Dominique Pozo: I'm just going to check with you at that date, and we'll see how it's going. Because I have a feeling, you know, it could go longer than that, but that's okay. Okay, let's see, um,

328
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:16.530
Dominique Pozo: All right. And then these are just a few questions about your relapse prevention and being able to name some of these things. So do you know, are you aware of things that trigger you emotionally

329
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.000
Jesse Baca: What things trigger me emotionally

330
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:23.910
Jesse Baca: Stress

331
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.190
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

332
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.530
Dominique Pozo: Around anything in particular.

333
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:34.500
Jesse Baca: Know everything

334
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.310
OK.

335
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.600
Dominique Pozo: And then how about in relationships. Is there anything that triggers either

336
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.710
Dominique Pozo: That you're aware of

337
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.650
Jesse Baca: Nothing that I'm aware of. Right now.

338
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.580
Okay.

339
00:32:54.060 --> 00:33:00.330
Dominique Pozo: Wow, that's, that's pretty amazing, you've been with your partner for what did you say, six months or five months and

340
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.170
Dominique Pozo: You haven't had

341
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:01.860
Jesse Baca: A farmer.

342
00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.680
Dominique Pozo: You haven't had any triggers and that time.

343
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.800
Jesse Baca: Um,

344
00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.530
Jesse Baca: I don't know. Nothing I can think of right now.

345
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:16.380
Dominique Pozo: Wow, that that must be a delight to be in a relationship and not

346
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.960
Dominique Pozo: You know, things get triggered.

347
00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:21.840
Jesse Baca: I'm

348
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.050
Jesse Baca: Just can't think of anything right now.

349
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:28.800
Okay.

350
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:38.010
Dominique Pozo: All right, let's see. How about, um, any events or situations that are triggering for you.

351
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.580
Jesse Baca: I'm not even events.

352
00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.430
Jesse Baca: Guess.

353
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:08.970
Jesse Baca: Well, I guess, like the coronavirus just because that means just going outside a lot more than this.

354
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.260
Dominique Pozo: Mm hmm. Okay, so not being able to go outside.

355
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.060
Dominique Pozo: Or just move freely through your life.

356
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.030
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

357
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.340
Dominique Pozo: So what what to you are healthy coping skills.

358
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:42.510
Jesse Baca: Oh, no.

359
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:49.650
Dominique Pozo: Okay, this is great that you will, it's not great that you don't know but it's stuff for us to work on in our, in our sessions.

360
00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.130
Dominique Pozo: Okay. Do you have people that you can call if you're in a crisis.

361
00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:05.970
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

362
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.120
Dominique Pozo: Can you, are you willing to name, maybe one or two.

363
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.810
Jesse Baca: I guess. Mom, I can call my girlfriend.

364
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.870
Jesse Baca: Because I can call her.

365
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.830
Okay.

366
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.250
Jesse Baca: It's more like a friendship thing, but I don't really, I just call her when I just want to talk to her.

367
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:36.570
Okay.

368
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.140
Dominique Pozo: Um, and then

369
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:52.500
Dominique Pozo: Do you, are you aware of any self care habits that really work for you or self care behaviors things that help to soothe you when you're feeling anxious

370
00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:00.480
Jesse Baca: Yeah, I've been through that with my therapist. I'm just breathing exercises. I'm DISTRACTING MYSELF.

371
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.260
Jesse Baca: With stuff.

372
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.500
Dominique Pozo: So those are some of your coping skills.

373
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:26.070
Dominique Pozo: But, and they're also self, you know, self soothing, but definitely the breathing would be a way to to cope through stress. What do you distract yourself with

374
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.780
Jesse Baca: Reading music

375
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:43.290
Jesse Baca: If it's really, really, really bad. I could just go take a shower and just try to relax myself, but I just have constant bad thoughts.

376
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.700
Dominique Pozo: Cool. Okay.

377
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.720
Dominique Pozo: Okay.

378
00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:57.570
Dominique Pozo: All right.

379
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:13.350
Dominique Pozo: Okay, well that's that's the intake for today. Do you have any questions for me or any concerns about the program or therapy or anything.

380
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.360
Jesse Baca: No, that's good.

381
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:27.930
Dominique Pozo: Okay. And right now, can you just share with me from one to 10 one being not at all 10 being off the charts. How do you, where's your anxiety in this moment.

382
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:30.840
Jesse Baca: Hey at a time.

383
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:37.260
Dominique Pozo: No. Oh, sorry. I thought you were asking is the scale eight to 10. Oh, so you're at an eight right now.

384
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:38.850
Jesse Baca: Yeah.

385
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.960
Dominique Pozo: Are you able to identify what what's creating the anxiety.

386
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.910
Jesse Baca: Know, sometimes, nothing really triggers and

387
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.350
Dominique Pozo: It's just there.

388
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.060
Dominique Pozo: Yeah, yeah. What does it feel like schematically in your body.

Jesse Baca: Well just anxiety in general just

390
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:07.800
Jesse Baca: racing thoughts. My chest like it's on my mind. I could feel my heart beating faster than normal.

391
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:11.340
Dominique Pozo: Okay.
