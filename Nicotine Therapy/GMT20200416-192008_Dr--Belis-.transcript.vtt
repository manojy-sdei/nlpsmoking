17
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.750
Lisa’s iPhone: Now, we don't know. We don't know. And because of the the medication that they didn't. They didn't that the developer. So running for so long that was helping her

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.490
Lisa’s iPhone: How she feels like

Dr. Belis Aladag: Right, so I would, I'm guessing that's the reason you know that that was holding a lot of the pain, I guess.

Dr. Belis Aladag: I have my notes from we spoke before, but I'm

32
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:29.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: You. I think that it's important to contact that physician to say hey you know you took away this thing, which is good. It was it was it was, you know, going to lower your immune system. We talked about that.

33
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:47.250
Dr. Belis Aladag: And she thought you were having side effects, but you can tell you know you can ask her. Okay. But, you know, is there something that's less dangerous that I could be on that does similar anti inflammatory, anti inflammation work, you know,

Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, the doctor right

38
00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.670

Dr. Belis Aladag: ganz that was Dr chahal

42
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:26.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, Dr. Show Hall you. That's the person that's helping you with the arthritis and that was helping the inflammation. So when she took Dan's away your inflammation probably came back, which is why you're feeling in your hands a lot in your feet.

43
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:40.230
Dr. Belis Aladag: So I think you need to contact her office and say Dr show Hall, you know, since the Belgians went away my inflammation is back. What can I do, is there any other medication.

44
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:52.680
Lisa’s iPhone: Yeah, to try it for me and different. Yeah. Like we mean examples away something that that little less side effects that many

45
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.560
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yes, similar but less

46
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.710
Dr. Belis Aladag: Dangerous or you know what I mean, something that does something similar.

47
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.350
Dr. Belis Aladag: I think because that is a rheumatoid arthritis type of drug and that's sounds like the arthritis is what's flaring

48
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.680
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we need doctor show halls input.

49
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.440
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so yeah. Do you know how to contact her and everything.

50
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.120
Lisa’s iPhone: Yes. Okay. Yes.

51
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:28.470
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so please let's do that as soon as possible to get in touch with her because maybe you could even do a telephone visit with her if she can't do in person because of the quarantine.

52
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.460
Dr. Belis Aladag: Maybe you guys can do a phone visit, just to talk about it and say, Okay, what else can we do and you know

53
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.050
Lisa’s iPhone: Set on her.

54
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:45.180
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, because sometimes you leave a message and the nurses, get the message and they never get back. You know what I mean, maybe it's better to say I really

55
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.510
Lisa’s iPhone: Want to

56
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.520

59
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.820

60
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:12.450

62
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, then I leave a message and I need her to call me back.

63
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.330
Dr. Belis Aladag: But start with the visit request because then there, they might take it a little more serious.

64
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.760
Lisa’s iPhone: Yeah, boy. Yeah.

Lisa’s iPhone: Why are you getting supposedly she tried to contact you.

95
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.800
Dr. Belis Aladag: Really

96
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:57.960
Lisa’s iPhone: Yeah, that's what they told me that that she wanted to contact you. Because I told her. The reason why because I I told her the doctor doctor wanted to raise

97
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.830
Lisa’s iPhone: She will we're talking about raising the doses, but of celebrating those who were trying to patch us even helps her. So she said, Yeah, I understand. But

98
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:14.580
Lisa’s iPhone: Let me speak to her. I'm going to speak to today, and then tomorrow I call back the next day. I'm like, no little thing. So that's I'm just telling you, I had a little arguing with them to like

99
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:23.100
Lisa’s iPhone: You guys don't care about you because you had another thing that's the situation. You guys are not in pain. That's why you don't care. But it's not supposed to be like that.

100
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.260
Lisa’s iPhone: It's not, that's why.

101
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.720
Lisa’s iPhone: That's why I changed it all the pharmacists and

102
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:34.140
Dr. Belis Aladag: Get the right thing because it's just not right when I prescribed something, you know, it's like they need to make sure

103
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.980
Lisa’s iPhone: Sure that

104
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:44.310
Dr. Belis Aladag: Safe, but they need to call and make it happen. No one our staffs if they had called our staff would have answered and explained, but

105
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.270
Lisa’s iPhone: We got because

106
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:53.250
Lisa’s iPhone: Because that's what i because you've seen it was it was starting to get aggressive for pain. So you knew what you were doing.

107
00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:08.130
Lisa’s iPhone: And then you did what you had to do. And then they didn't do it because he maybe if she would have that she wouldn't be related crying, almost all day long time she feels better when she sleeps in that's hardly to sleep because independent surcharge for to sleep.

108
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:16.260
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm so sorry. Okay, so we're going to try this. So we're going to do two things we're going to increase the dose of the top

109
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.940
Dr. Belis Aladag: So we're going to do run

110
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.080
Dr. Belis Aladag: Instead of one half and one we will do one one in one

111
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:35.190
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, we'll do that and I'll do the patch again, but this time patch patch and it's a patch that you were for one week and it should help it should help a lot.

112
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:49.530
Lisa’s iPhone: Okay, the this is the whole thing. They asked me about the patch, because I don't know if it wasn't specifically written right how to use it. That was one of the other things as they said that you wanted. You wanted to give her. I think

113
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.780
Lisa’s iPhone: They thought it was one day and I get that input one per week. I said no to one per week.

114
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.870
Dr. Belis Aladag: One per week. Yeah, so I will

115
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.530
Dr. Belis Aladag: I, yeah, I wrote that on the script. It says

116
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:12.600
Lisa’s iPhone: You then and yeah and my pharmacist wanted to know what milligram was the patches, because we can order them for her, she's going to have them the next eight

117
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:24.720
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, so I had originally thought I'd give the 10 micrograms, which is the smaller one. Should I think we need to go up to the higher one. I don't

118
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.140
I

119
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.630
Lisa’s iPhone: Think is but as of today.

120
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:38.640
Lisa’s iPhone: Like I said, these doctors over here. I promise you that. And, and, and I know that we've already got don't know but I can take her to all her doctors anywhere. She has to go.

121
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.150
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay.

122
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.760
Lisa’s iPhone: But these doctors over here are very hard to talk

123
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:58.200
Dr. Belis Aladag: Let's, let's do the higher dose, then. Okay. And if it's too much you can lower your tablets, because you have the tablets. We're going to do 111 if you were the patch and the tablet and it just feel a role too much. Go to half a tablet.

124
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.020
Dr. Belis Aladag: Or high blood that's kind of will adjust it.

125
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.490
Lisa’s iPhone: Thank you. Oh.

126
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.170
Dr. Belis Aladag: Yeah, lower the

127
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.380
Dr. Belis Aladag: Too much lower the pill. Okay.

128
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.960
Dr. Belis Aladag: Okay, three times a day still

129
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: But we're going to do 111

130
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:19.110
Dr. Belis Aladag: And then the patch on top for one week. Each patch. Okay, and

131
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:31.950
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'll give you extras like the higher strength. So we don't have to go back and forth so many times it's so it will be the 20 microgram dose. The 20 micrograms view trans

132
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:41.910
Dr. Belis Aladag: I'm prescribing it right now. And so the pharmacy should be able to see it soon. Hold on, that's the highest dose that they have for that.

133
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.930
Lisa’s iPhone: Even what her her medication. It took me three days to get it.

134
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.580
Dr. Belis Aladag: Really

135
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.420
Dr. Belis Aladag: Walgreens is just not doing a good job.

136
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:11.760

141
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:48.600
Dr. Belis Aladag: Film I said four of them. So that should be a whole month you know for week

142
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.590

143
00:12:53.700 --> 00:13:03.030
Dr. Belis Aladag: And you know, it's very difficult. We're going to do our best. You know I gotta be honest with you, I'm not a pain expert.

144
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:15.120
Dr. Belis Aladag: I use Suboxone mainly my patients are mainly addiction patients, you know, they've been using pain pills too much and whatever. Some of them had pain and that's how they started but

145
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:27.900
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know, some of them just take pain pills for fun, you know, so, so my expertise is with addiction and this medication Suboxone. So that's kind of my expertise. So I'm trying

146
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:43.920
Dr. Belis Aladag: I will. I'm trying to utilize it to help you with the pain, the best I can. But I think we still need some input from from the rheumatologist to say because this is not necessarily helping inflammation.

147
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.610
Dr. Belis Aladag: This helps

148
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.770
Lisa’s iPhone: But it's my man.

149
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:52.830
Dr. Belis Aladag: You know what I mean. And I wonder if she has something else for you that can help prevent inflammation.

150
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.410
Dr. Belis Aladag: To help with the actual arthritis piece, you know,

151
00:13:59.010 --> 00:13:59.670
Lisa’s iPhone: Mm hmm.

152
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:09.060
Dr. Belis Aladag: But so, but in the meantime I don't want you to be in pain. So I'm going to do this, and hopefully this will cover it.

153
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:20.220
Dr. Belis Aladag: But I still think. In the meantime, try do your best to reach this Dr chahal and say we need an appointment, a telephone appointment video appointment something because the inflammation is bad.

154
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:22.740
