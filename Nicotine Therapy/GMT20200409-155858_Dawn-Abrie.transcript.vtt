Dawn Abriel: Yes, put your name in there.

13
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.190
Dawn Abriel: Okay, because

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:01.800
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I think I've got everything and I just need to order his medicine. Usually, I have a little time, but he was really late so

19
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.950
Dawn Abriel: I kind of crammed it in. I couldn't

20
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.930
Dawn Abriel: visit with him at all. I had to just

21
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.880
Dawn Abriel: Jam in the session.

22
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.460
Dawn Abriel: So it threw me off a bit

23
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.650
LG Stylo 4: Understand

24
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.630
Dawn Abriel: So, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, six days.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.520
Dawn Abriel: For more button pushes and I'm with you.

26
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.800
LG Stylo 4: I'm here.

27
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.980
Dawn Abriel: For

28
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.710
Dawn Abriel: Dope. Now let me

29
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.620
Dawn Abriel: Get into my

30
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.760
Dawn Abriel: Chart opened up. I started it earlier, just in case this happens. So it saves a little time when I can.

31
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.610
Dawn Abriel: Open it up. You live in Albuquerque.

32
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.020
LG Stylo 4: I do. Yeah.

33
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.830
Okay.

34
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.260
Dawn Abriel: I am so I have to put in a little justification here for why you don't come up and see me.

35
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.930
LG Stylo 4: I actually don't have a driver's license.

36
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:54.000
Dawn Abriel: Oh, good. No driver's license. Okay. And the last time you had any opioid

37
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.760
LG Stylo 4: I'm today.

38
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.440
Dawn Abriel: About what time

39
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.720
LG Stylo 4: 9am

40
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.280
Dawn Abriel: And what was that

41
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.660
LG Stylo 4: It was 40 milligrams of oxycodone

42
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.950
Okay.

43
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.310
Dawn Abriel: And what's your daily dose of axes.

44
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:21.630
LG Stylo 4: I'm her. I mean, usually I can only afford to do it once a day, but it's usually about 6070

45
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.000
Dawn Abriel: That helps me know how much Suboxone to put you on

46
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.960
Okay.

47
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.080
Dawn Abriel: And were you ever an IV drug user

48
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.100
Know,

49
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.180
Dawn Abriel: So it's just the short acting opioids, you never got into heroin snorting using heroin.

50
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.580
Dawn Abriel: And no fit no fentanyl

51
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.660
No.

52
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.500
Dawn Abriel: You are so lucky.

53
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.550
LG Stylo 4: I'm a, I guess, I guess I have certain. I mean, I definitely have anxiety. You know, so maybe so my obsessive compulsive stuff.

54
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.220
Dawn Abriel: Isn't that weird

55
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.500
Dawn Abriel: Yeah yeah

56
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.330
Dawn Abriel: Any overdoses.

57
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.140
No.

58
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.770
Dawn Abriel: No history of overdose no medical complications from the axes and no legal issues.

59
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.540
Dawn Abriel: No. All right.

60
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.960
Dawn Abriel: Did your life kind of turn into thinking about the drug doing the drug getting the drug being all about the drug.

61
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:37.890
LG Stylo 4: Well, I mean, I think the worst part is that just not feeling normal ever. You know, I'm like, I can't wake up at normal. You know, it's

62
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:49.590
LG Stylo 4: It's just physically impossible for me so I well um it's a long, it's a long drawn out story. I'm sure the whole edition, but uh recently.

63
00:05:50.310 --> 00:06:01.200
LG Stylo 4: Just because of the coven and everything. My, my husband and I got laid off from our jobs and we're doing unemployment and, you know,

64
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:16.290
LG Stylo 4: Snap and we got Medicaid, which is how I'm doing this. Um, but I just figured, you know, I'm out of a job. I'm stuck in my house when could be the more perfect time to try to attack this problem.

65
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.570
Dawn Abriel: Absolutely. Let us help you

66
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:39.030
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and I will tell you that you will never be able to afford the quality of therapy, you're going to get with bright heart health because of being on Medicaid, this is, this is the ideal time to kind of get done with life issues get

67
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.540
Dawn Abriel: Get that

68
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.740
LG Stylo 4: were dancing.

69
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:59.790
LG Stylo 4: And I mean, I've got so it's getting ridiculous. I mean, I've done therapy throughout my life at certain points, but it feels pretty ridiculous for me to be at 42 and like just this past year I just cut my mom out of my life because she's so toxic and like manipulative

70
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.110
Dawn Abriel: Hello. Yeah.

71
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.940
LG Stylo 4: Yeah, it was. It's hard. I mean, a lot of people don't understand it but

72
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.010
LG Stylo 4: I can't deal with her anymore.

73
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.700
Dawn Abriel: And but I didn't do it until I was 50

74
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.960
LG Stylo 4: Oh ok so

75
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.870
Dawn Abriel: You're, you're ahead of the schedule.

76
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:27.630
LG Stylo 4: But, uh, yeah. So I'm really excited about trying to work. I mean, I don't have coping skills. There's a lot of stuff. I just didn't learn growing up, you know,

77
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.140
Dawn Abriel: Yes.

78
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:36.900
LG Stylo 4: And I just made my way by being sort of intelligent, you know, being able to tell what people are thinking and stuff and

79
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:50.370
Dawn Abriel: Yet, here's the weird thing a people who had early childhood trauma, if they can make their way out and I'm one of those um

80
00:07:53.460 --> 00:08:02.220
Dawn Abriel: You know, decades of therapy thousands and thousands of dollars and I feel pretty good about myself at this point in life.

81
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:10.380
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and going into therapy. I was a doctor for many years and then got a degree in in 30 and

82
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:20.940
Dawn Abriel: When I found out was that I'm really good at reading people right because I had to be careful of alcoholic fathers and crazy mother and

83
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:21.840
Dawn Abriel: Right, right.

84
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.020
Dawn Abriel: It's it's it's a talent that

85
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.210
LG Stylo 4: Like you're reading what for me, it was my mom. It was reading

86
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.270
LG Stylo 4: What I was what I could say or not say or

87
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.760
LG Stylo 4: If I could say anything at all without. Yep.

88
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:42.570
Dawn Abriel: Yep. So you'll see that it's a, it's a, there is a little silver lining there.

89
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:51.210
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, yeah. Okay, let me get through this here. How old were you when you used any kind of illicit drug even marijuana

90
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.570
LG Stylo 4: Oh, that would have been 14. That was the first

91
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.940
LG Stylo 4: Marijuana. Yes.

92
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.100
Dawn Abriel: And the first

93
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.010
Dawn Abriel: Opioid Use

94
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.440
LG Stylo 4: That would have been. I wouldn't really count, like I was in, I was in a car accident when I was 14 and they had me on a drip, but I really, really count that because I didn't have control of it.

95
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:35.130
LG Stylo 4: Um, so I would say the first time was in relation to having a sense of cervix biopsy and they take a loop and kind of take the top of this ever talked about and it wouldn't stop bleeding I later found out my my doctor was a drunk.

96
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:45.210
LG Stylo 4: But it wouldn't stop bleeding add to go back to the hospital. They put some kind of silver something on it and they give me some pain medication that was probably the first time.

97
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.260
Dawn Abriel: And how old were you

98
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.940
LG Stylo 4: I would have been 17

99
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:49.320
Okay.

100
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:50.820
Dawn Abriel: And

101
00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:00.510
Dawn Abriel: Has the drug use route resulted in loss of relationship or work issues.

102
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:16.650
LG Stylo 4: Not so much. I'm a role functional. I mean, honestly, it sounds so lame. But like the thing that I've used oxy codeine for for this past 1520 years beyond just needing it to Phil normal is to be able to work harder.

103
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:17.670
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

104
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.200
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, so I believe you. And is this the first program you've been in

105
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:43.680
LG Stylo 4: No. Um, let's see, spin over six years now, but I did do methadone here in Albuquerque. And I was able to successfully get off of methadone unfortunately later I ended up going back to taking oxycodone

106
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:46.950
LG Stylo 4: Yeah.

107
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.110
LG Stylo 4: But the lady there so that I could really well.

108
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:58.530
LG Stylo 4: She said she's at the end. I guess I didn't have any dirty drug tests or whatever. And so her and other counselors came out and clapped. For me, my last

109
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.240
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

110
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.140
Dawn Abriel: And how much

111
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.180
Dawn Abriel: Therapy, did you get through that program.

112
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:14.490
LG Stylo 4: Some but to be honest it. A lot of it probably wasn't super helpful because a lot of it was because of me because I was still

113
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:23.010
LG Stylo 4: My father was super abusive physically abusive and like, like you're straight up kind of abusive like your kicker.

114
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:42.780
LG Stylo 4: And my mom was my mom's highly intelligent and manipulative abusive and so at that point when I was going to that program. My mom was still a big part of my life and I hadn't even started talking about the fact that she wasn't a great parrot. I was like, oh, my mom's my champion, you know,

115
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.860
My dad right

116
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.610
Dawn Abriel: It was the bad guy. Yeah, yeah. So

117
00:11:48.840 --> 00:12:01.380
Dawn Abriel: In in addiction medicine we get that aspect we we understand that when people have had, we call them the adverse childhood experiences.

118
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:21.090
Dawn Abriel: When there are more than four of those in your background, when people take an opioid their first experiences are wow I'm not worrying. I'm not emotionally troubled I THIS FEELS GOOD.

119
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.630
Dawn Abriel: Who wouldn't want to be that emotional pain.

120
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:31.170
Dawn Abriel: Really. Exactly. And that's why we refer to it as a brain disease. We don't

121
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:45.300
Dawn Abriel: We don't call addiction, a matter of willpower, or you're a moral and there's something wrong with you. We recognize it. It's a brain disease and it starts with the brain disease of abuse and neglect. Yeah.

122
00:12:46.200 --> 00:13:00.060
LG Stylo 4: So I have some other. I don't know if they're. I don't know if they're if they're chemical or or or what but been diagnosed. And again, I don't know how accurate diagnosis are

123
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.570
LG Stylo 4: But, uh, been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder borderline personality disorder and

124
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.250
LG Stylo 4: What was the most complex post traumatic disorder. Yeah.

125
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.690
Dawn Abriel: I believe it. What's your stress level right now, mild, moderate, or severe

126
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:37.170
LG Stylo 4: Well, honestly, talking to you. It's made him better. Um, I mean, but in general, it's Hi. I was laid off from my job, um, because of this coven I realistically, the job that I had. It was like one of the last jobs like this that existed as a copy editor for a newspaper

127
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:55.890
LG Stylo 4: I'm probably not going to come back. I, I know I can do other things. And I can you know move around and gig economy and stuff like that. But I think everybody's feeling a lot of stress right now. So I would put myself at least an eight seven or eight

128
00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:07.950
Dawn Abriel: Okay and so besides economical and occupational any educational health primary support legal problems relationships, social, what other stressors.

129
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:27.570
LG Stylo 4: I mean, my husband. I said the only the only like really core relationship in my life right now, which may or may not be. He is my husband, he's really supportive. He's I love him. Totally. But he gets frustrated with me for

130
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.320
LG Stylo 4: A good reason.

131
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:35.070
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, let's put that in there just so that the the therapist will go through this much more extensively

132
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.140
LG Stylo 4: And I'm

133
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.460
Dawn Abriel: Sorry, did and how

134
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.890
LG Stylo 4: I manipulate him. I learned from my mom. So I manipulate right

135
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.330
Dawn Abriel: Right, okay.

136
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.290
Dawn Abriel: And I'm sorry to be rushing, but I have

137
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.460
Dawn Abriel: Group right after

138
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.720
Dawn Abriel: Us. No, no, I

139
00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:02.130
LG Stylo 4: I totally hear you. And it's, it's also the I'm not normally like this. It's the the shot in coven thing like I was talking to someone yesterday to

140
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.560
Dawn Abriel: A human being. Let me talk to her.

141
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:06.420
Dawn Abriel: Right.

142
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.180

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:48.150
Dawn Abriel: That's okay. You know, you never know which one's gonna gonna stick and maybe it'll be this one, you get the support you need and make the behavioral changes. This might

230
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.650
Dawn Abriel: This might be it right and it certainly you know i mean

231
00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:03.870
Dawn Abriel: We have about, well, it seems to be under estimated about 66,000 people die from overdose of opioids in this country every year.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:22:10.920
LG Stylo 4: But yes, the only time I've successfully quit smoking. I got pregnant and high school and I did adoption. Um, and I quit. From the time I knew I was pregnant, the time by delivered as soon as my legs were working with other women you know

246
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:17.760
Dawn Abriel: Right, right. Well, at least you gave that child a fighting chance of having a good life.

Dawn Abriel: Oh wonderful and drinking alcohol.

250
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:34.470
LG Stylo 4: For you, not at all. I haven't drunk at least six or seven years at all.

251
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.220
Dawn Abriel: Did you ever. Were you ever a heavy drinker.

252
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:57.300
LG Stylo 4: I drank a lot. I would say I was it when I lived in Austin. I went out a lot and I was one of the binge drinkers. I mean, when I started drinking. I just kept drinking and eventually I saw a video of myself drunk.

253
00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.800
LG Stylo 4: And

254
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.800
LG Stylo 4: Then I quit.

255
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.250
Dawn Abriel: You know, I have often said to family members videotape them when they're drunk.

256
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.330
Dawn Abriel: It does make a difference. Some people really wake up.

257
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.780
LG Stylo 4: I did not want to be that person. I did not want no yeah that was, yeah.

Then

260
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:32.280
Dawn Abriel: Again, we in our brains we register physical pain in the same place as emotional pain.

261
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:39.060
Dawn Abriel: Emotional Pain hurts. We we perceive it as an ache.

262
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.750
Dawn Abriel: And getting drunk relieves that pain.

263
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.540
Dawn Abriel: So whatever drug. Yeah.

LG Stylo 4: Actually just signed up for a CSA if it comes through.

269
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.510
LG Stylo 4: That should be a good test of trying to eat healthier.

270
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.930
Dawn Abriel: I do get regular exercise.

271
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:28.290
LG Stylo 4: I'm working on that. I'm taking walks. I'm we at. We just moved our exercise bicycle out to the backyard and my husband's been using it. So he's a really good role model for me in that sense. He's been getting out there.

LG Stylo 4: And really exercising, so I'm

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:25.050
LG Stylo 4: For a long, long time. I was taking five milligrams of Diazepam a day just to keep me at that level. But then all this research came out about how it might, you know, hurt your brain and

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:30.930
Dawn Abriel: Stuff you can't you can't learn your hippocampus is offline. So

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:03.120
LG Stylo 4: Sure.

452
00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.460
Dawn Abriel: This way.

453
00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.320
Dawn Abriel: Cup them.

454
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:12.120
LG Stylo 4: And pull against. Oh, sorry. It's hard for me to do that. My glasses.

455
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.520
Dawn Abriel: Will put your glasses back on.

456
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:17.550
LG Stylo 4: There we go.

457
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.340
Dawn Abriel: And tap your fingers to your thumb.

458
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:24.630
Dawn Abriel: One at a time, tap

459
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:38.940
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And let me see you push on your belly upper right upper left lower right lower left, there's no lumps or bumps or pain when you do that.

460
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.000
LG Stylo 4: No.

461
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.470
Dawn Abriel: Good and show me your ankles.

462
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.620
Dawn Abriel: I need to see that there's no swelling in your ankles.

463
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.360
Dawn Abriel: That's good. Great.

464
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.400
Dawn Abriel: Perfect. Okay.

465
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.970
Dawn Abriel: So let's talk about the program.

466
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:04.800
Dawn Abriel: Um,

467
00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:09.570
Dawn Abriel: Let's see, just put this in and

468
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:20.610
Dawn Abriel: So is there any reason why you couldn't come to Tuesday at noon.

469
00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:31.860
Dawn Abriel: So that will put you in one of my groups. So every group has a doctor in the therapist.

470
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.390
Dawn Abriel: The therapist name is

471
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.610
LG Stylo 4: Glenn a year and

472
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.180
Dawn Abriel: One of the

473
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.710
Dawn Abriel: It just happens to be my daughter, she's a psycho therapist.

474
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:41.190
LG Stylo 4: In home.

475
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.020
Dawn Abriel: And I think

476
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:47.160
Dawn Abriel: I think your personalities will really be a match. She's

477
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.420
Dawn Abriel: Very, very talented and a hoot to be with so

478
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:52.410
LG Stylo 4: Yeah.

479
00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.490
LG Stylo 4: That sounds great.

480
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:54.750
Dawn Abriel: You like her.

481
00:40:55.650 --> 00:41:02.850
LG Stylo 4: I've never done group before, but I think that sounds really good. I mean, I tend to learn a lot from listening to people.

482
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:08.790
Dawn Abriel: It is good. And we know from the studies that are done on addiction that

483
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:22.320
Dawn Abriel: You know having some little white lady tell you something about your addiction is not as powerful as you talking with other people who have struggled with this issue.

484
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.550
Dawn Abriel: So right

485
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:30.780
Dawn Abriel: Um, it just, it just we invite people to cross talk a lot to ask each other so

486
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:41.010
Dawn Abriel: I'm going to put you on. I'm guessing that you're going to need at least one and a half strips of buprenorphine to to get you settled.

487
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:55.560
Dawn Abriel: What I recommend is that you take one strip today and you see you but you can't take it. If you took the medicine, this morning, you're going to have to wait 12 hours, you're going to have to

488
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.300
Dawn Abriel: Be in a line withdrawal.

489
00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:01.050
Dawn Abriel: Before you can take buprenorphine or it'll slam you into

490
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.700
LG Stylo 4: Right.

491
00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:04.620
Dawn Abriel: To withdraw.

492
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.270
LG Stylo 4: Right, right. As

493
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.310
Dawn Abriel: You're damaging your ace and so you're going to take

494
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:25.710
Dawn Abriel: A full strip tonight in in the morning, you're going to take one and a half strips. If that's too much medicine, you'll know that it's too much medicine because you will get drowsy and sleepy.

495
00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:38.640
Dawn Abriel: In case back off. Yeah, don't take the other half, but you want to take all of your medicine. First thing in the morning, same time in the morning. If you can within an hour so

496
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.510
LG Stylo 4: Okay.

497
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.350
Dawn Abriel: But if you're not sleepy then continue the one and a half.

498
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:59.490
Dawn Abriel: Strips that's 12 milligrams and we'll talk about it on Tuesday. If you have any any any any problems of any kind. You go to the virtual clinic and you say, I'm, I'm in crisis, I need to talk to my therapist.

499
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.860
Dawn Abriel: Those people will get ahold of one of your

500
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:15.660
Dawn Abriel: You know my medicine all accidentally flushed down the toilet. I need to talk to the doc. Right, right. Anything to do with the medicine you want them to get ahold of me not.

501
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.130
LG Stylo 4: Okay.

502
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:26.490
LG Stylo 4: But obviously, I am going to be very careful with it. It's a very serious medication and I'll make sure it's not accessible by anyone else.

503
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:37.590
Dawn Abriel: Oh, absolutely. You want to keep it up, safe and away from other people, but especially, you don't want to like when you when you're going to start tapering you're going to be cutting it.

504
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.470
Dawn Abriel: And these oh yes that you're cut off.

505
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:44.010
Dawn Abriel: They will blow away if you sneeze or cough or breathe hard

506
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.980
Dawn Abriel: Right. Can't standing over the sink.

507
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:48.960
Dawn Abriel: You can't be staying in the toilet.

508
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:51.540
Dawn Abriel: I say that from experience, right.

509
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:52.890
LG Stylo 4: Yeah yeah

510
00:43:52.980 --> 00:44:00.000
LG Stylo 4: No doubt. I mean, probably better to like spread something out in a room with, you know, no windows open and just

511
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.350
LG Stylo 4: Carefully back up.

512
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:04.350
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, and

513
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.300
Dawn Abriel: When you go to the pharmacy to pick it up. Pick up a little contact lens case.

514
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:17.760
Dawn Abriel: Because you're gonna be pretty little pieces in that contact lens case.

515
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:18.780
LG Stylo 4: You might have

516
00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:21.510
LG Stylo 4: A smart idea. Yeah.

517
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:32.400
Dawn Abriel: Okay, I need to order your medicine before a group starts at 11 so it was wonderful meeting you. I look forward to working with you.

518
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.290
LG Stylo 4: And I'll see you on Tuesday. As

519
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.120
LG Stylo 4: That's okay. So thank you so much. I'll talk to you soon.

520
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.260
You bet.

521
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.860
Dawn Abriel: Okay, if you will fill in the bubbles and for assessment, we will put

522
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.650
Dawn Abriel: Nicotine the can.

523
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:00.480
Dawn Abriel: Marijuana

524
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.910
Dawn Abriel: Dependence and ghd

525
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.390
Dawn Abriel: generalized anxiety disorder.

526
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.390
Dawn Abriel: And you'll fill in the bubbles and all is right with the world.
