Serenna Beers: Yeah, good, good, good, good.

126
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:58.110
Serenna Beers: So with the chronic, chronic pain when what was the precipitating event. When did it start

127
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.930
Carol Hampton: Okay, started 12 years ago.

128
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.500
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

129
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:08.790
Carol Hampton: I had a hysterectomy, and the doctor. It was badge and all

130
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.540
Serenna Beers: Mm hmm.

131
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:29.790
Carol Hampton: And the doctor, he just basically he tells me. Oh, I really had a hard time getting your uterus up because it was so enlarged and it's like, oh, well, did you think, I mean, you did an examination.

132
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:40.230
Carol Hampton: Mm hmm. What happened, you know, why didn't you decide it was too big to come out eventually.

133
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:52.470
Carol Hampton: Right, and so that makes to me out. But he's, he, what happened was, is he passed away two weeks after the surgery.

134
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.470
Serenna Beers: Your gynecologist did

135
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.760
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay.

136
00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:57.930
And

137
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.350
Carol Hampton: It was 74 I kind of blame his

138
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:12.870
Carol Hampton: You know his luck. Good thinking, kind of on his age. This is like

139
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.130
Carol Hampton: He was trying to do too much.

140
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:24.690
Carol Hampton: Mm hmm. And yeah, he has his age, you know, kinda in the cupboard him.

141
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:31.560
Carol Hampton: Sure. So, you know, and now I'm living with this and I didn't go after him because

142
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:39.600
Carol Hampton: I'm not a I'm not a type to the left or someone for money and

143
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:49.620
Carol Hampton: I also thought that you know I did when I was in the first three years.

144
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.170
Carol Hampton: I didn't think

145
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.970
Carol Hampton: That I'd still be at it, you know.

146
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.980
Carol Hampton: At 1212 years later, you know,

147
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.720
Carol Hampton: So, so I didn't, I didn't. I had no idea.

148
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:24.090
Carol Hampton: I had gotten the doctors tell me what they think caused it. And, but they didn't say that this is really serious you you need to do something to help you and

149
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.890
Carol Hampton: You know, it was just kind of like

150
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.200
Carol Hampton: You know,

151
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:40.770
Carol Hampton: I, I just pinned it on them to tell me these things that it's bad enough for me to go after him.

152
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.660
Carol Hampton: Right and

153
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.170
Serenna Beers: I'm so sorry.

154
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.360
Serenna Beers: Um, and so, after the hysterectomy. That's, that's when the the nerve damage happened.

155
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:03.750
Carol Hampton: Okay, yeah, what happened is I had hysterectomies then

156
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:11.070

Carol Hampton: My house when my daughter.

272
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.020
Carol Hampton: Was here because she's

273
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:58.770
Carol Hampton: It's expensive out there and she doesn't make enough money to you know make them to make it on her own. Yeah.

Carol Hampton: Yeah, and

275
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.460
Carol Hampton: So,

276
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:16.410
Carol Hampton: It's in there. She has a baby to to boot. And I keep telling her about all these programs that they have for single moms and they have where if you

277
