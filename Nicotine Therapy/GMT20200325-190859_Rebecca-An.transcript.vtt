94
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.600
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Oh, good. Yeah. Did they say that it might have to be adjusted or something. I mean, that seems kind of high

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.480
Ken Olsen: Yeah, I'm taking blood pressure medication.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Anything in in your recovery that isn't quite working that you need to change.

105
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:33.180
Ken Olsen: That process. You know, I'm thinking I can have a glass of wine and, you know, I'm looking at you know what's a good wine to drink when you have a heart attack. Shit. I don't know what you know.

106
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.640

107
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:44.370
Ken Olsen: I don't, I'm not gonna drink anymore. I just, yeah. And when my mind my mind plays tricks on me. Just look at, you know, maybe you have a glass of wine.

108
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.080
Ken Olsen: But

109
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:54.270
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, no, no. Know what that is right. What that's your addiction trying to reel you back in

110
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:03.060
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All those all those even in remember that when you start having them. You know what I mean. Because that's exactly what it is.

111
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.140

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.070
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that job student to really back in and take you out.

113
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.130
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And you're worth a lot more than that.

114
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.070
Ken Olsen: Yeah, you're right, you're right.

115
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.710
Ken Olsen: I know I just thought I'd be honest with you.

116
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.300
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's exactly

117
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.470
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: It. Thank you.

118
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.140
Ken Olsen: I have been Google wants to go more in jail.

119
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.400
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And we'll come back and say none.

120
00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.770
Ken Olsen: No pain. You're nowhere nowhere, you know, nowhere.

121
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.500
Ken Olsen: So much scan of the grapes and a lot of good healthy cholesterol in him.

122
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:45.090
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: So there's a piece of it that says, Is it just because of boredom.

123
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.410
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And

124
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.710
Ken Olsen: I think it does nothing to do with boredom, because I don't, I'm not going to my meetings anymore. It kind of had a schedule, you know,

125
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.940
Ken Olsen: I was actually looking forward to go my meeting. So by looking forward to go my meetings I think about that.

126
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.710
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, well,

127
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.970
Ken Olsen: So now that I my whole schedules different

128
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.340
Ken Olsen: And I'm trying to find things to do. Everything's fixed the house and learning done clean

129
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.110

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: No, they are

135
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.820
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Words are they accessible to you.

136
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:39.210
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: To be able to connect with them when you are in that I'm thinking of ways that you can still be protected, but also get contact with people. You know what I mean when you're in that mindset.

137
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.030
Ken Olsen: I have no credit cards and money in my pocket helps to

138
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.660
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Yeah, of course.

139
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.290
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's got to be

140
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.170
Ken Olsen: There at the end. I was applying for credit card and get

141
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.230
Ken Olsen: Actually

142
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.960
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: That's always fun, huh.

143
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.000
Ken Olsen: This is

144
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:04.710

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Who else can you can you connect with when you are having those thoughts.

148
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.050
Ken Olsen: Sponsor my cousin. He said, always call me, you know,

149
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.050
Ken Olsen: I was just googling shit, I'm not gonna go on it, you know.

150
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.000
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Well,

151
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:27.990
Boredom

152
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:40.950
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And that's, you know, that's definitely a scary or a slippery slope for us to be. And when we're bored is when our addiction really comes into our brain and had gives us those thoughts. You know what I mean.

153
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.510
Ken Olsen: It's doing the same, you know, smoking.

154
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.130
No.

155

174
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.800
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: Google, you know, I don't care what Google says, your body has a mind of its own.

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And I know it sucks because nobody wants to feel nobody definitely wants to, you know, go through that stuff. But we have to in order to cleanse ourselves. And I don't think we ever heal from losing somebody I think we learned to live without them next to us, you know,

239
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:43.320
Ken Olsen: Well, she was a spiritual person. And so my. So when I look at it using a better place. No.

246
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:12.420
Ken Olsen: Yeah, think of anything. But think about it. You know, I think, you know, now that I know I'm not going to probably do it anymore. You know, I just played them with my phone so

247
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.180
Ken Olsen: I don't know. I know I'm fooling myself. That's nice. I can admit that you know I

248
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:27.780
Ken Olsen: Mean like for myself, like, Oh, I can have a glass of wine. You know, I'm fooling myself and I know it so

249
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:29.370

Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know what I mean.

253
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:52.140
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: All of those thoughts that come into our brain, I believe, and this is my perception again and and the way that I define addiction and how we deal with it is that it's, you know, really another voice in our head and

254
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.910
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know the struggle is real mentally. It really is.

255
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.510
Yeah.

256
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:10.350
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: And people you know a lot of people that I work with, they understand the concept because when they get those thoughts in their head. You know what I mean when they're trying so hard to be sober. Where did they come from and why are they just popping in there.

257
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.570
Rebecca Antoinette Evans: You know, um,

258
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.320
Ken Olsen: Well, because it

259
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.190
Ken Olsen: Just means that had changed you get, you know, and everything's you know

260
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.670
Ken Olsen: I think the less boring.

261
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:25.620
Ken Olsen: But

262
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.240
Ken Olsen: I don't know. I can handle the boredom. All right, I'm gonna figure something out.

263
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.370
Ken Olsen: I can stay alive.

264
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:33.360
