00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.530
Tricia Frederick: Yes, I tried to commit suicide. A couple of times.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.940
Serenna Beers: Oh, goodness. Okay.

22
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.250

24
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.510
Tricia Frederick: Go right on ahead.

25
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.550
Serenna Beers: Okay, so tell me what what brings you to bright her house and why now.

26
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:30.060
Tricia Frederick: Um, okay, so three and a half years ago, I was on a lot of opiates a lot for pain.

27
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:43.410
Tricia Frederick: I broken my back twice, and I have hip problems and you know it all goes on and and and and you know 60 something I'm good.

28
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.340
Tricia Frederick: I'm so

29
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.560
Tricia Frederick: I just had knee surgery. Last year I walk really funny. And I have really bad back problems because

30
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.820
Tricia Frederick: That's where I'm in and pain management, um,

31
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.340
Tricia Frederick: I wanted to get off all the opiates, but they told me I had to turn around and say I'm an addict to get help here in Crescent City. I moved from Arizona.

32
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.270
Okay.

33
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:23.790
Tricia Frederick: So that's exactly what I did. You know what, yes, absolutely. I'm an addict, you take those away and I had withdrawals. So I considered myself an app.

34
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.830
Tricia Frederick: Um, when I started the program. What I did not realize was I was using other drugs also

35
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.410
Tricia Frederick: To run away from a lot of things that I never dealt with in my childhood.

36
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.310
Okay.

37
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.610
Tricia Frederick: So three, three and a half years ago, I

38
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.710
Tricia Frederick: Decided that

39
00:03:48.150 --> 00:04:01.560
Tricia Frederick: I needed to change and I needed to learn why I had these problems skill and I needed to deal with a few things so that I could get over not get over bit past walk through

40
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.880
Serenna Beers: Okay, yeah.

41
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:19.470
Tricia Frederick: So that's what I did. That's what I did. I cleaned up my act. I got into every single mental health group, I could. Um, I had a lot of domestic violence in my first marriage.

42
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.700
Tricia Frederick: So that I never dealt with.

43
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.880
Tricia Frederick: My sexual abuse my mother told me I lied. I that I never dealt with.

44
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:41.490
Tricia Frederick: So all of this. I'm not dealing with made it real easy when I took the opiates to go, you know what, I don't think about that.

45
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.350
Serenna Beers: Huh.

46
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:53.940
Tricia Frederick: So since 1999 I was taking opiates and not dealing with any of it. And so it had, I had a lot of baggage to work through

47
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:06.390
Tricia Frederick: Then that's where I sit, today I'm three and a half years, clean, I say clean I'm three and a half years off opiates and bentos

48
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.020
Tricia Frederick: And I'm doing the best I can.

49
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:33.210
Serenna Beers: Well, I mean, I, I would imagine, everybody's definition is of will clean is different. But here's the reality. You are on Medicaid it medic medication assisted treatment, which is you're sober.

50
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.870
Serenna Beers: Just mere my you might take the sub you text correct or not.

51
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.220
Tricia Frederick: Yes, boxing. Yeah.

52
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.840
Serenna Beers: You are on that, but that's a, you know, The you that's something you're doing to take care of yourself so

53
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.230
Serenna Beers: Smear

54
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.650
Tricia Frederick: That's absolutely I don't look at it. I don't look at it as

55
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.380
Tricia Frederick: Oh my god, I'm not clean because I'm taking Suboxone no I don't look at it that way at all.

56
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.740
Serenna Beers: You stay clean because you're taking Suboxone

57
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:10.080
Tricia Frederick: Absolutely. You know, I walked through the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous for quite a while. When I first first got into this program.

58
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.880
Tricia Frederick: And

59
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:22.620
Tricia Frederick: I walked through the rooms long enough to realize most of the people were on Suboxone going, oh no, why not

60
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.000
Tricia Frederick: And I was going

61
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.810
Tricia Frederick: Well, yes.

62
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.370
Tricia Frederick: You know,

63
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.210
Um,

64
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:43.680
Tricia Frederick: So I decided to walk myself out of those rooms, because I wanted to deal with things. Honestly, I didn't want to turn around and go, Oh, I'm smoking pot. Oh my god.

65
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.170
Tricia Frederick: No, it's legal down and I'm smoking it for the CBD effects.

66
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.330
Tricia Frederick: Okay, so I smoke it.

67
00:06:51.660 --> 00:07:04.590
Tricia Frederick: And yeah, every now and then I'll turn around and get this stuff. It's not so you know I had the THC in it. Okay, and helps my attitude I don't take a benzo because of that. So I'm okay with it.

68
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:12.660
Tricia Frederick: Mm hmm. And I got tired of being judged by the people that were doing the same thing. I was but not being honest.

69
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:24.000
Serenna Beers: Ah, which you see that a lot. And that's that that's really difficult. I mean, because we're already harder on ourselves than anybody else could ever be harder on us. So

70
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:31.380
Serenna Beers: To throw that judgment that feeling of being judged on top of it all, it's like who really needs all that right

71
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.320
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, I have one my

72
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.770
Tricia Frederick: I have a tattoo on my wrist. This is only God can judge me because I got started people judging me from, you know,

73
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.750
Serenna Beers: It started to migrate saying

74
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.310
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, and all the judgment started with my mother.

75
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.000
Uh huh.

76
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.550
Tricia Frederick: Everybody bit of it.

77
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.670
Tricia Frederick: Because I know I was not my mother's favorite

78
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.080
Serenna Beers: Child. Okay.

79
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.430
Tricia Frederick: But that's okay they're dead. Now I don't have to worry

80
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:03.450
Tricia Frederick: Anymore.

81
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:13.230
Serenna Beers: Well, so tell me about your story. So you went into a little bit but like your story with substances as far as like

82
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:30.540
Serenna Beers: When you were first exposed age, you know, up to the point where I'm in which you did share with me basically how it's pro how it's pro progressed, but specifically. So you said that you were addicted to the opiates and the Bezos correct

83
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:51.750
Tricia Frederick: Yes, it got to that, um, I never did any drugs, up until I was 17 1617 I I am. It was when I married my first husband. Okay. And he introduced me to drugs. He was in the Navy already and I was just turning 15 1616

84
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:53.730
Tricia Frederick: And

85
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:02.100
Tricia Frederick: My mother found a great opportunity to get rid of me. So I married this and I knew, I'm six weeks and I married him.

86
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.090
Tricia Frederick: What a what a

87
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.610
Tricia Frederick: Oh my god, I never knew how badly that man treated me

88
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.000
Tricia Frederick: You know, oh my god.

89
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:24.840
Serenna Beers: You mean you never knew until you were removed from the situation right or from the

90
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.250
Serenna Beers: Yes relationship. Okay.

91
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.620
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, my, um, so okay um my current husband.

92
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.780
Tricia Frederick: I knew him when I was married to my first house. Well, I knew him in high school before I even knew my first customer.

93
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.440
Mm hmm.

94
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:58.680
Tricia Frederick: And as a matter of fact, my first husband and I babysit him when his, his mother and father went for vacation, so I babysit. This guy anyway 11 and a half years later we move up the road.

95
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.780
Tricia Frederick: I was on Mount Soledad in San Diego and

96
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.170
Tricia Frederick: This guy was driving around in his car.

97
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:19.140
Tricia Frederick: And when he stopped. I went up and I tapped on his window. And I said, I just needed to tell you, you add the most gorgeous I'd ever seen. He goes, isn't your name, Tricia and I say, Jimmy.

98
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:29.010
Tricia Frederick: Three days later, me and my ex. I just kicked him out of the house and Jimmy kind of moved in the house because he knew how violent my

99
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:40.800
Tricia Frederick: And that's what happened to, He came back that next morning to get me and he found Jim there and Jimmy said there's not going to be any violence here.

100
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.830
Serenna Beers: He goes, if there is going to be between you and I

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.290
Tricia Frederick: I'm

102
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.240
Tricia Frederick: From that day on, that was 30 years ago.

103
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.130
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, and Jimmy and I have been together ever since.

104
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.900
Serenna Beers: That's amazing.

105
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.690
Tricia Frederick: And he treats me like the queen.

106
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.930
Serenna Beers: That, that means

107
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.530
Serenna Beers: To be in a relationship like like that.

108
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:16.800
Serenna Beers: Is huge after you've come so far from being in one that was so abusive. Can I place you on hold, just for a second.

109
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.240
Serenna Beers: I've got a switch my shirt I'm thinking I'm having some hot flashes here, so hang on tight.

110
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.230
Okay.

Absolutely.

113
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.890
Serenna Beers: Apologize, but I

114
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:27.480
Tricia Frederick: Right before you came on, I was in a long sleeve shirt and had to do the same thing. It was like

115
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:27.810
Oh,

116
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.550
Tricia Frederick: Well, that's

117
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:38.940
Serenna Beers: quite embarrassing but I appreciate your, your understanding. Okay, so, so now you are with Jim correct

118
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.090
Serenna Beers: Yes. And you all have been married, I assume, or no.

119
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.080
Serenna Beers: Yes. Okay.

120
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.680
Serenna Beers: Absolutely.

121
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.300
Serenna Beers: For how long

122
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:58.650
Tricia Frederick: Um, let's see, we just celebrated 30 years and we been together about 35 because it took me four years to marry him, because I was so afraid. Who's gonna check

123
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.270
Because that's what my

124
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:14.640
Tricia Frederick: So it was like, you know, I'm not gonna. No, no, every day. This man asked me to marry him, drove me absolutely next word to the point where finally I just looked at him go. Fine. Let's just go.

125
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:31.650
Serenna Beers: Um, well, it's okay. So tell me about you, you went into it a little bit so you kind of answered, like all of my bio psychosocial questions but but I'm just going to like ask you to expound on certain ones.

126
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:43.320
Serenna Beers: You mentioned for the chronic pain that you had broken your back. But what what was the precipitating event was that the one that started it all was when

127
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:43.950
Serenna Beers: You broke

128
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:52.260
Serenna Beers: broke your back and then you were put on the pain meds, of which you had work that you were on since 1999

129
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.190
Tricia Frederick: And it is

130
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.310
Serenna Beers: progressively got worse as far as the amount you had to take

131
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:56.970
Tricia Frederick: To manage

132
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.200
Serenna Beers: That pain and

133
00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.040
Tricia Frederick: Yes, ma'am.

134
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.690
Tricia Frederick: knows it.

135
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:13.110
Tricia Frederick: You've probably heard this story more often than I've told it. Do you know what I mean. Because I've heard it from so many people that that's how they've started also

136
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:23.910
Tricia Frederick: And yeah, because my doctor said you know back then. He even said to me. No, no, these, these you can go on and all these no

137
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.530
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

138
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:30.690
Tricia Frederick: And it just got worse and worse to the point where then I was introduced to oxy cotton.

139
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.640
Serenna Beers: Okay.

140
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:51.780
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, and I got up, I was taking like 680 milligrams of oxy cotton, plus all of my breakthrough, plus all I was piggybacking on top on top, plus all of my Xanax, oh my god, my Xanax

141
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.480
Tricia Frederick: Wow, I did not know I had such a problem.

142
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:09.120
Tricia Frederick: Yeah I embarrass myself one day up at the group. It was terrible serene. It was terrible. That was the last time I ever used a benzo

149
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.010
Tricia Frederick: Okay, so

150
00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.560
Tricia Frederick: I was taking an awful lot of Ben's owes and

151
00:15:50.730 --> 00:16:02.820
Tricia Frederick: Both of my kids have moved out my son, my oldest son was in prison. He had just gotten out of prison and he was using heroin at my home and I didn't realize he was a heroin addict.

152
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.630
Tricia Frederick: I never in my life thought

153
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.210
Tricia Frederick: Anyway, um,

154
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.750
Tricia Frederick: So, there, there, got to be a point where I felt

155
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.490
Tricia Frederick: In a really, really small box.

156
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.540
Tricia Frederick: And that's one of my big fears.

157
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.210
Tricia Frederick: Is being in a box.

158
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:38.370
Tricia Frederick: My ex husband used to take a that was a form of punishment. Anyway, um,

159
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.480
Tricia Frederick: So I tried to commit suicide and

160
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.820
Tricia Frederick: They put me my husband and my son.

161
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.880
Tricia Frederick: Put me in a

162
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.910
Tricia Frederick: Mental health facility in Arizona, that just absolutely

163
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:10.980
Tricia Frederick: opened my eyes to an awful lot of things. But it hadn't opened it totally. You know what I mean. So, so my eyes were open like this much.

164
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:18.390
Serenna Beers: Were you did, did they put you in there. What was it voluntary or involuntary. Okay.

165
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:19.650
Tricia Frederick: No, it was

166
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:26.040
Tricia Frederick: voluntary or involuntary. So my son and my husband looked at me and said, you're going to do this.

167
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.110
Tricia Frederick: And I said, Okay, I'll sign up for her.

168
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.500
Tricia Frederick: Okay, so, but it was

169
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:42.900
Tricia Frederick: I didn't look at it as they were punishing me at the time I looked at it as they were trying to help. And they didn't know how

170
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:43.830
Okay.

171
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:45.360
Tricia Frederick: And

172
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:57.390
Tricia Frederick: Like I I noticed a lot of those spheres coming back. Now with this that's going on with the coronavirus I know I you know I

173
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.740
Tricia Frederick: You know that fear of being alone.

174
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.800
Tricia Frederick: My husband's having really really bad. High blood pressure problems right now.

175
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:18.030
Tricia Frederick: Okay. And there's this in here, there's this inherent fear of being alone.

176
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.350
Tricia Frederick: That keeps me up at night, almost nightly

177
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.800
Tricia Frederick: And I'm

178
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.320
Tricia Frederick: You know,

179
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.210
Tricia Frederick: I take propranolol from my anxiety.

180
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:46.620
Tricia Frederick: And I've been noticing the last month that I'm having to take like three at a time.

181
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:47.880
And

182
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.520
Tricia Frederick: And I've never had to take three at a time. I rarely take two at a time.

183
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.420
Tricia Frederick: But most of the time it's like one one's enough, you know,

184
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.850
Serenna Beers: Does your doctor know that you're taking three at a time. Okay, good.

185
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.010
Tricia Frederick: Oh yeah yeah yeah I wait 30

186
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.300
Tricia Frederick: Minutes and if I my anxiety hasn't gone away. I'm allowed to take another one.

187
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:23.730
Tricia Frederick: Okay, I've never had to go, I, I've never had to take three but yet my anxiety lately because of my husband's just really been a

188
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:44.160
Serenna Beers: How long has it. Have you felt like this, as far as kind of and what I hear you describing is almost like an impending sense of doom.

189
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:45.120
Tricia Frederick: Yeah.

190
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:56.340
Tricia Frederick: It has been like it's been at least a month or so. Because when the coronavirus king came on, it was like a. Oh, and on top of, you know,

191
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:56.880
When I

192
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.890
Tricia Frederick: You know, I try to laugh it off because that's my way of dealing with a lot of stuff. Sure.

193
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:10.290
Tricia Frederick: Is to just turn your face around and you just laugh it off and go okay Everything's gonna be fine.

194
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:17.160
Tricia Frederick: Except for that pit in my stomach that says no, everything's not going to be fine.

195
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:17.940
Right.

196
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:27.960
Serenna Beers: So, so what types of things do you do at night when you're unable to sleep. And first, I just want to let you know.

197
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:36.060
Serenna Beers: That the fact that you struggle more at night with with with sleep when you feel more anxious is pretty

198
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:37.740
Serenna Beers: Normal

199
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.280
Serenna Beers: A lot of people do that. As a matter of fact.

200
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.930
Serenna Beers: For people who struggle struggle with anxiety.

201
00:20:47.400 --> 00:21:06.060
Serenna Beers: I do. I have good days and I have bad days. Right. Yeah. And I don't necessarily have anything that's going on in my life. I don't have a sick husband, but I do have worries and fears. Right. But I will literally my eyeballs are both bulging out of my head at like 1am

202
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:15.060
Serenna Beers: And I used to fight it, but something that you can do is, is, is look at the things that you're doing to

203
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:28.560
Serenna Beers: To to work that out. So if you are having anxiety and you're up at night and you're pacing and you're ruminating on all the things that you're anxious about that kind of will only well not kind of that will actually

204
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.880
Serenna Beers: exacerbate yeah

205
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.750

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.880
Serenna Beers: To put yourself.

207
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.600
Serenna Beers: Can Can troll because that's really what it is. It's lack of control.

208
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.690
Tricia Frederick: Okay, so I'll show you exactly what I do.

209
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.410

Tricia Frederick: Oh, wow. Um, I kick little diamonds on

214
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.220
Tricia Frederick: My husband says he can't do it. It's too tedious, but it's

215
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:12.060
Tricia Frederick: Oh, I don't. Okay, so there's nothing to think about. Like it with crochet and you have to do like learn character count, you know,

Tricia Frederick: See, we've got fairies. Here's another lighthouse. Okay, there's another lighthouse.

236
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.180
Tricia Frederick: I didn't realize it so many night lighthouses

237
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.790
Serenna Beers: So,

238
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.990
Tricia Frederick: I just

239
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.680
Serenna Beers: Oh, I love that. That is so nice.

240
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.770
Tricia Frederick: Yes. And then this peak one

241
00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.750
Tricia Frederick: I'm waiting to get a few more kinks that we're missing.

242
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.760
Tricia Frederick: Mm hmm. And as soon as I get that I'll be able to finish that one. But that's, you know, so far.

243
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:16.080
Serenna Beers: So let me ask you in the last minute and a half that you've been describing to me these things that fill your heart with joy, where, where's your anxiety at right now in the current moment.

244
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.600
Tricia Frederick: About a three.

245
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.380
Serenna Beers: Okay.

246
00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.000
Serenna Beers: Was it higher.

247
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.520
Serenna Beers: Three or four minutes ago.

248
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:24.990
Tricia Frederick: This morning, no.

249
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:35.700
Serenna Beers: Okay, so one of the things that I that I just want to bring to light is when you feel anxious. A good distraction is by doing something

250
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.750
Serenna Beers: That brings out

251
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:42.270
Serenna Beers: Happiness or emotions that feel calm calming. So if to diamond paint.

252
00:24:43.770 --> 00:25:04.110
Serenna Beers: Helps to re relax your mind, then I would say really honestly use use those skills because avoiding you know like running from the emotion is definitely not a way to handle it, because it's gonna be there and then also things like this, you know, talking to someone

253
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.690
Tricia Frederick: Yeah yeah calm.

254
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.950
Tricia Frederick: app on my phone.

255
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.130
Serenna Beers: Oh, you do. I also have it. It's very cool.

256
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.680
Tricia Frederick: I love that thing. Yeah.

257
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:14.910
Serenna Beers: And

258
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:29.010
Tricia Frederick: I do everything I can. I'm I've looked into others that you know, just to make sure that I try. I, I don't want to step into the world at all, again at all, you know,

259
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.210
Tricia Frederick: Like cats going nuts right now.

260
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.450
Tricia Frederick: I have two kids well they're not kittens anymore, but they're juveniles.

261
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.230
Ah,

262
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.340
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, I, I had a cat that was

263
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.540
Tricia Frederick: My body for 20 some odd years

264
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.450
Tricia Frederick: Hmm, and we had to put her down them.

265
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.000
Tricia Frederick: So sorry.

266
00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:02.190
Tricia Frederick: And before that, when she was getting my husband decided that he was going to get to kittens and they were going to be my response.

267
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.100
Serenna Beers: Oh my gosh.

268
00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.070
Tricia Frederick: Can I go. Yeah, they are.

269
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:17.790
Tricia Frederick: And I'll tell you what, though they brought the most joy in my life and longest cut, you know, it's like, I haven't had this much fun.

270
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.520
Tricia Frederick: With animals in a long, long time.

271
00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:24.870
Serenna Beers: So it's great.

272
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.910
Tricia Frederick: Oh I'm sorry my head so big.

Serenna Beers: Coming back to you had described your mental health and substance abuse history. Was there any additional to report. You mentioned the ones suit suit suicide attempt. But I thought earlier you had mentioned that, that there were a few of them.

276
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.480
Serenna Beers: Yeah, okay.

277
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.070

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.280
Tricia Frederick: Well, it was right around the same time, it was, it wasn't even. It was like in the same month

280
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.060
Serenna Beers: Okay.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.370

Tricia Frederick: My ex husband.

289
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.410

Tricia Frederick: I mean, no, there wasn't. There's if you if you take me out of that situation. No man there's not

291
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:43.800
Okay.

292
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.090
Tricia Frederick: But

293
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.100
Tricia Frederick: Um yeah you know i'd look i'd say to myself, if I could only

294
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.540
Write

295
00:27:52.740 --> 00:28:01.680
Serenna Beers: Well, and, and you really don't know. I mean, if you look at the site cycle of abuse. It's like, have you ever heard of boiling frog.

296
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.060
Tricia Frederick: No.

297
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:10.920
Serenna Beers: Syndrome. So that's what what we we call in the psychology field oftentimes

298
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:19.410
Serenna Beers: survivors of domestic violence domestic violence. So if you're if you're a frog and you're in

299
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:35.610
Serenna Beers: A water you're in water and it starts to boil. You don't realize that you're burning to death because you were in it when it was cold and as the temperature rises, you just become more comfortable so your body adjust until you die because your boil. Right.

300
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.060
Tricia Frederick: Right.

301
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:55.410
Serenna Beers: It's an analogy, which actually makes a lot of sense. But you don't see those types of things until you remove yourself from the situation. And so, but with that comes, you know, I mean, there's this whole cycle of a abuse, you know, the go through all the stages, you know, where

302
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:13.530
Serenna Beers: The abuse. OK, so the build up the abuse the apologies, the romance, the honeymoon phase, which is what you know most domestic violence survivors live for. And then, only to repeat itself again the shaming. The blaming

303
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:26.100
Serenna Beers: The abuse and then the apologies and then the honeymoon phase, the makeup part of that which you know most survivors love that part. Actually, it said that a lot of

304
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:37.680
Serenna Beers: People that are abused don't even realize it but they will provoke their abuser because they want to hurry up and get through that cycle to get through the part that feels good. That feels the best

305
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:45.750
Serenna Beers: Because it can last from anywhere from a night to two days to two weeks depending on you know that per person. So

306
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:52.470
Serenna Beers: Most of the time. I mean, I don't know too many folks. I mean, I think, a really a folks really knew what they were in

307
00:29:53.160 --> 00:30:11.130
Serenna Beers: You know, I mean, because it's like that saying it's from the outside looking in. We really can't see front wait front from the inside looking out. We can't see as much as somebody from the outside looking in, because we have what we call rose colored glasses on our lenses are jack

308
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:17.580
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, well, I remember the very, very first time. My ex husband hit me.

309
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.760
Tricia Frederick: I went to my mom.

310
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.380
Tricia Frederick: And my mom told me to go home to my husband.

311
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:39.270
Tricia Frederick: And that was when I really, really realized that my mom didn't like me.

312
00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:51.030
Tricia Frederick: You know, it was like one of those things beforehand. Before that it was like, Oh, was I just a rebellious teenager and I just thought, my mom didn't like me. Right.

313
00:30:53.100 --> 00:31:01.440
Tricia Frederick: So I went home to my husband and I thought well maybe my dad did it behind closed doors. I don't know. Maybe that's what happened.

314
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:09.960
Tricia Frederick: So I was there 11 and a half years with my ex husband and during that that was in the first

315
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.340
Tricia Frederick: Two years. I think it was that I was married at my husband and I went home to my mom.

316
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.240
Tricia Frederick: So for 1110

317
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.490
Tricia Frederick: Years, nine years. Yeah.

318
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:24.900
Serenna Beers: Okay.

319
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.420
Tricia Frederick: But before that, it was an angel.

320
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.430
Tricia Frederick: Course

321
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.350
Serenna Beers: Of course, I mean, that's usually

322
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.210
Serenna Beers: For

323
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.230
Serenna Beers: Perpetrators. It's a very calculated thing. I mean, it's literally

324
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:38.880
Serenna Beers: A sickness.

325
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:48.750
Tricia Frederick: It's very. Yeah. And do you know since that day since the day that I left him and I got with Jimmy

326
00:31:50.130 --> 00:32:13.020
Tricia Frederick: Any women and the women. I talked to that are any kind of domestic violence situations I tell them, You gotta get out, you got you got got got to get out because that one time, one time they can go to my friend Emily's well she's not around anymore because her husband killed her.

327
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.650
Tricia Frederick: Sucked in her fucking closet and they found her Valentine's.

328
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.780
Tricia Frederick: On Valentine's Day.

329
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:38.190
Tricia Frederick: And it was before Christmas. She'd been gone. I've been trying to call her and I kept telling everybody you know something's wrong. Something's wrong. And he said, No Emily's gone back using. It's like, no, no, she hasn't she would never leave her children.

330
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:48.180
Tricia Frederick: And people. People that deal with attics think that they can use that for the rest of their lives against them.

331
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.080
Mm hmm.

332
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.870
Tricia Frederick: And I felt so bad that actor

333
00:32:55.890 --> 00:33:07.440
Tricia Frederick: This poor girl went through what she went through this guy was gonna try to discredit her and make her look bad. Oh no, that wasn't going to happen with them on my watch. Yeah.

334
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.840
Tricia Frederick: And now in the group when I see

335
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:22.200
Tricia Frederick: Some of these girls in the same situation. The first thing I do is I look at them and I go, remember, Emily.

336
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.350
Tricia Frederick: And they do.

337
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:34.560
Tricia Frederick: And I look at them and I say, you know, my one thing I'm always here.

338
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.100
Tricia Frederick: I'm always here.

339
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:44.490
Tricia Frederick: So if I can do any good use me, you know, so

340
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.820
Tricia Frederick: I'm here you could talk to me. You call me, you know,

341
00:33:48.300 --> 00:34:06.390
Serenna Beers: Anything, just remember though, I just want to that oftentimes, as you know, because you've been in the same spot. You can have the best advice and the best examples to give them but you know as well as I do until somebody is ready to leave. It's almost like it's

342
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.270
Serenna Beers: I know turning, turning, turning a deaf ear, but

343
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.230
Tricia Frederick: It is, but I

344
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.700
Serenna Beers: Think it's great that you're willing to help. Yes it is, right, because if you look like

345
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:28.290
Serenna Beers: If they knew what you knew they wouldn't situation that they're in. So, so that makes sense. But I think it's nice. At least that you, you know, that's a way of giving back because they say in order to keep it. You have to give it away. I think that

346
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.630
Serenna Beers: Applies on many different levels.

347
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.650
Tricia Frederick: Okay, go.

348
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.620

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.630
Serenna Beers: fam family specifically. Like, were you raised by a woman, Dad.

352
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.010
Serenna Beers: All the way through.

353
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:52.500
Serenna Beers: Or do you have your sister or your parents still the notebook. Your parents are deceased.

354
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:53.340
Tricia Frederick: Correct.

355
00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:01.590
Serenna Beers: Buddy else in within your within your household growing up suffer from mental health or substance abuse or food is gambling or anything.

356
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:21.870
Tricia Frederick: OK, so my family was basically I'm from the South, so no ass. No. Tell you keep your mouth shut. You don't say nothing. So growing up. I didn't know anything about my family. Okay, even as I grew older, I still to this day don't know a lot about my mother's family.

357
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:27.420
Tricia Frederick: My father's family and since they're dead. It doesn't matter because mostly all their families get to

358
00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.950
Tricia Frederick: So it's one of those things that when growing up.

359
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:39.780
Tricia Frederick: When my mom and dad both run the household. My dad cheated around a lot.

360
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.180

361
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:51.870
Tricia Frederick: Of I lived in Vietnam. I was evacuated off of the American Embassy during the Tet Offensive at 1974. Oh yeah, I've had a great life.

Tricia Frederick: I am so so blessed and unbalanced in the same

363
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.070
Tricia Frederick: But now,

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.340
Tricia Frederick: Working through all that I'm blessed

365
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:16.230
Tricia Frederick: I don't know. Mom and Dad, I knew my mom didn't like me. I knew my sister was my mom's favorite. It was only my mom, my sister and I mean

Tricia Frederick: Huge, huge opiate addict and she will not listen to me. She will not

368
00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:43.260
Tricia Frederick: So I refuse to even talk to her. I can't even talk to her because she's so she'll not out on the phone with me and and and for me being an addict that really bothers me.

Tricia Frederick: You know, let me tell you something every single American citizen has no clue what it's like to live in one of those countries until they do. And then you come back to this country and you tell me how bad you got it just

428
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.030
Tricia Frederick: Just

429
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:44.280
Tricia Frederick: Wow. Yeah. I think God I had a habit toilet, let alone. Fucking toilet paper.

430
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:49.290
Tricia Frederick: Happy camper.

431
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.650
Serenna Beers: You actually have somehow

432
00:42:52.800 --> 00:43:00.630
Serenna Beers: All right. Do I actually do too. I was just making a joke, funny thing was is I didn't even stockpile. It's like

433
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:07.560
Tricia Frederick: Really stockpiling paper. Okay, I could think of a lot other things I'd like to stop playing

434
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.260
Serenna Beers: Yeah.

435
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.050
Serenna Beers: Oh, goodness.

436
00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.960
Serenna Beers: Hopefully that'll all work itself out.

437
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.240
Tricia Frederick: Oh, let's hope so.

438
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.030
Serenna Beers: Um okay so

439
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.410
Serenna Beers: Do you have any financial or legal issues that you're concerned about

440
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.020
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, always financial

441
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.230
Tricia Frederick: Okay, yeah, my husband works. But, you know,

442
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:35.280
Tricia Frederick: Yeah, you know,

443
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.520
Tricia Frederick: I don't have any problems really I don't

444
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.870
Tricia Frederick: Things are going really well.

445
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.390
Tricia Frederick: I shouldn't say really well, things are going, as well as can be expected.

446
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.950
Tricia Frederick: Mm hmm. That way.

447
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.680
Tricia Frederick: I mean I don't I'm

448
00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:04.800
Tricia Frederick: The only issue. I'm trying to add right now is I'm just trying to get my

449
00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:15.810
Tricia Frederick: My body in sync with my mind. I just don't, I don't feel good. I'm not sleeping. I just don't feel good at all.

450
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:20.460
Tricia Frederick: So, you know, I'm just trying to get through this.

451
00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:25.740
Serenna Beers: Okay. And do you are you pretty satisfied with

452
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.360
Serenna Beers: With your medication at this time. Do you feel like it's working.

453
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.870
Tricia Frederick: We mean medication. I mean,

454
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.220
Serenna Beers: Have you started. So you're on the Suboxone right so

455
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.900
Tricia Frederick: For three and a half years.

456
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:43.560
Serenna Beers: Okay, so, so there's nothing new to change with with that.

457
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.520
Serenna Beers: Okay.

458
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:52.110
Tricia Frederick: No, I'm right now. I'm trying to figure out, I've been having some really, really bad sweats.

459
00:44:52.620 --> 00:45:07.530
Tricia Frederick: Okay, so I remember back about six years ago, no more net about 16 years ago or so I was having really really bad sweats and when I went. They said I was having a cardiac issue so they had to go in and put a skin.

460
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.390
Serenna Beers: Oh my goodness.

461
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.790
Tricia Frederick: So,

462
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:19.860
Tricia Frederick: That's a little worrisome. So I'm and I can't go check it out right now. I can't check it out until after

463
00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:22.020
Serenna Beers: I saw saying

464
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:46.140
Tricia Frederick: It's stupid. Yeah. You know, it's just like my husband, um, you know, he hasn't used drugs and a lot longer and I have. Okay. Mm hmm. And yet you know his teeth about blue four years ago started falling out. And we've been waiting to get him some teeth.

465
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:51.690
Tricia Frederick: Mm hmm. Oh damn. See, I was holding that secret I broke it. Oh, bad, bad, bad

466
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.870
Tricia Frederick: Expensive to break anyway.

467
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:03.180
Tricia Frederick: So now we finally, finally, finally, finally saved up money to get his teeth gun.

468
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:18.330
Serenna Beers: Well, uh, hold on. Because that's one of the newest things that they're speaking on. In fact, there was, I think it was yesterday on Fox News, just to give you hopefully maybe a little light.

469
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:30.450
Serenna Beers: They were talking about one of the first things that they're going to do as far as opening back up the economy is allowing for elective surgeries and medical surgery. Oh.

470
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.500
Tricia Frederick: Oh,

471
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:41.010
Serenna Beers: So just kind of keep your eyes peeled and maybe check back with with his Dennis because that sounds like that's one of the and where are you at, like,

472
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.570
Tricia Frederick: It.

473
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:43.260
Serenna Beers: Okay.

474
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:44.790
Serenna Beers: So you're in in

475
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.380
Tricia Frederick: In Oregon. No, I'm in. I'm in California, but

476
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.080
Tricia Frederick: We go to Oregon for his dental work we go

477
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:53.310
Tricia Frederick: Oh, yeah.

478
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.980
Serenna Beers: Oh yeah, so it was Washington, Oregon and California that we're speaking on this. So just kind of keep

479
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:00.990
Serenna Beers: Your eyes peeled. Wonderful. Yeah.

480
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.650
Serenna Beers: Okay, so really quick because then I'll have to go

481
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:07.890
Serenna Beers: To my other session. Oh, that's okay i I've enjoyed

482
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:13.890
Serenna Beers: Listening. I have enjoyed, you know, and I wanted to give you as much time as I possibly can because it looks like

483
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:25.950
Serenna Beers: I mean, if you want to see me more than twice a month that's also fine. But it looks like that. It was requested that that you be seen by a therapist at least twice monthly so

484
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.780
Tricia Frederick: It was

485
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:36.720
Serenna Beers: It says on there twice monthly, but it also says that your self, self pay. So you know if that's something

486
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.060
Serenna Beers: You know, if you're not rep, or if you're not

487
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:49.260
Serenna Beers: Ordered by the courts to see me. I mean, it's always good to have a therapist, especially in this time if you

488
00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:55.050
Serenna Beers: Don't make it work, at least at least twice a month, just so you have somebody else to talk to.

489
00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:03.450
Serenna Beers: So, so that would be my recommendation, but I also, you know, I also get it. I mean, folks. Folks have bills and, you know,

490
00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:04.950
Serenna Beers: If

491
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:11.400
Tricia Frederick: If the right now is a little tough, you know, it's like my husband's working but you know he's there truckers

492
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.490
Tricia Frederick: You know, and it's very, very sporadic right now.

493
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:26.130
Serenna Beers: Okay, you know, so maybe what we'll do then is is I would ask for you to to call in

494
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:31.320
Serenna Beers: And and put yourself on my schedule to two weeks out three weeks out

495
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.710
Serenna Beers: Rather than me set up an appointment because that'd

496
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:38.100
Serenna Beers: Be good.

497
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.840
Serenna Beers: Depend on you and and how you want to move. Okay, but I just want

498
00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.670
Serenna Beers: To know that I'm here for you.

499
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:51.630
Tricia Frederick: Okay, thank you, Sabrina. Thank you very much. And yeah, what I'll do is I'll definitely keep in touch with you.

500
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:54.000
Serenna Beers: Okay. And then before

501
00:48:54.060 --> 00:49:11.310
Tricia Frederick: I will let you know I do go and see Tony Costa in group. So I am going to group. I do want you to know that because I want you to feel comfortable enough to know that I am doing everything in my toolbox to keep everything kosher.

502
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:13.680
Serenna Beers: Everything in line. Our alright

503
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:24.750
Serenna Beers: That works then and then really quick before I get you off the phone. There was one question. I know you mentioned that you have a son, but do you have any other kids and I know that you're married.

504
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:25.980
Tricia Frederick: Or two, so yes.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.450
Serenna Beers: Okay, and you and you currently live with your husband. Right.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.450

Serenna Beers: If I don't hear from you for a few weeks. Just know that I'll probably ask the VC to get a hold of you. The clinic because sounds like you know maybe there might be some stuff that you still want to work on or work through or just talk about, you know,

520
