Dr Jameson: Are we having fun yet.

6
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.150
iPhone: Took a little bit longer to check it. Then I thought

7
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.930
Dr Jameson: Oh, that's okay. I was fiddling with a

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:30.060
Dr Jameson: An account at my bank that wasn't behaving so I called her help desk so it worked out okay. Um, let's see, I don't

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.230
Dr Jameson: Let's see. I don't remember why we have this

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.230
iPhone: I requested this meeting.

11
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.950
Dr Jameson: Okay.

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.700
Dr Jameson: Well, that would be

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.980
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.260
iPhone: So I'm having

15
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.340
iPhone: I'm running out of medication before

16
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.500
iPhone: The

17
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.960
iPhone: I think the 10 day or the 14 days. Okay. And I'm not sure what's happening.

18
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.980
Dr Jameson: Or are you taking, how much are you taking a day.

19
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.970
iPhone: I'm trying to stay at the two thirds of a film of one film each day.

20
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.790
iPhone: And I would say maybe one or two times a week.

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.830
iPhone: Sometimes more that's not enough.

22
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.720
iPhone: And so I start to feel like

23
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.160
iPhone: Like incredibly anxious, like I'm crawling out of my skin. And so I'll take

24
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.990
iPhone: A third of a film and it usually happens around maybe four or five o'clock in the afternoon.

25
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.070
iPhone: But it's not every day. And so what I'm finding is that

26
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.410
iPhone: I'm getting to about

27
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.450
iPhone: Maybe 12 days instead of 14 days. Okay.

28
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.990
Dr Jameson: So that would be like, on average, one day a week that you take

29
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.900
Dr Jameson: Extra do you

30
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.260
Dr Jameson: How long have you been at this current dose.

31
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.490
iPhone: I've been at this current dose.

32
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.280
iPhone: Say like maybe since September. Okay.

33
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.650
Dr Jameson: What is this been going on all along, or

34
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.210
Dr Jameson: Is this know recent

35
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.060
iPhone: It's more recent

36
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.630
Dr Jameson: And do you feel like it's more anxiety that's happening. Or do you feel like it's truly with draw symptoms.

37
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.910
iPhone: Um,

38
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.040
iPhone: Well, definitely my anxieties.

39
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.500
iPhone: There's no question about

40
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.690
Dr Jameson: It. Yeah. But if you had you had

41
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.530
Dr Jameson: Anxiety to start with and then we then we through this pandemic catch

42
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.480
iPhone: Yeah yeah so

43
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.720
iPhone: I mean,

44
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.050
Dr Jameson: I can write a prescription that says one a day. And then if you get to two

45
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.970
Dr Jameson: Thirds and you know you can. We can make it so it's not a stressor, if you need it a little extra in a day. But I guess.

46
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.010
Dr Jameson: You know also addressing anxiety, if we can, I think would make

47
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.480
iPhone: Any sense

48
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.770

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.580

Dr Jameson: To eat meat and to refill. And I'll just change it to one film a day so

Dr Jameson: There isn't.

80
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.670
Dr Jameson: An additional stress.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.020
Stress about this.

82
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.870
iPhone: That would be really helpful.

83
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:41.160
Dr Jameson: And I think, you know, still working on other coping mechanisms or your tablet or film.

84
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.390
iPhone: Chill.

85
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.380
That's right.

86
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.790
Just

87
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.140
Okay.

88
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.760
Dr Jameson: Do you do any deep breathing or meditation or I don't know if you're allowed outside to go for a walk. At this point, but

89
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.030
iPhone: You know, I'm trying to do when I can.

90
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.000

91
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.220
iPhone: Challenging

92
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.960
Yeah.

93
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.930

94
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:24.240
Dr Jameson: Changes in your life. And so I guess I'm I feel like I might have some idea, but is there anything new. In addition, or

95
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.830
Um,

96
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.260

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.530

iPhone: In California now.

105
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:13.200
iPhone: I actually don't know. Totally what's going on. He was kicked out of his SLE, he was on the street.

106
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.730

109
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.940
iPhone: His license was taken away. He was kicked out of the SLA and so

110
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.040
Dr Jameson: It's high end to or

111
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.170
iPhone: He

112
00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.620

Listen.

114
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.190
Dr Jameson: I lost you for a minute. I guess now you're back. I didn't hear that.

115
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.280
iPhone: I'm so sorry. He's drinking or

116
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.260
iPhone: He drink.

117
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.470
iPhone: He doesn't drink on a regular basis, but he drank. So he's in a

118
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:24.990
iPhone: I was able to get like an Airbnb room for him. And today he's supposed to go back into the SLA.

119
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:33.900
iPhone: But now he doesn't have a car. He doesn't have a job because of you know everything that's going on. So,

120
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.560
iPhone: It's just a matter of me getting to the point where you know I can.

121
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.870
iPhone: Let him truly suffer the consequences.

122
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.190
Dr Jameson: Or yeah

123
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.110
Dr Jameson: It's so hard to do that.

124
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.520
iPhone: It's, it's really hard. I keep thinking, you know,

125
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:04.380
iPhone: I can save him, even though you can imagine, over the years, I've tried everything humanly possible.

126
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.120
Dr Jameson: Right, I imagine.

127
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.800
Dr Jameson: Well, and because there's a difference between certain trying to find my pencil, which I'm fine, but

128
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.610
Dr Jameson: You know, loving someone and and

129
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.320

130
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.930
Dr Jameson: He sounds like he's sort of

131
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.710
Dr Jameson: Getting back a little bit on the on the

132
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.980
Dr Jameson: Band. What are getting back end in order so they're letting him back in and

133
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.560

134
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:44.580
iPhone: I actually don't know what's going to happen with his car, you know, it was impounded yeah

135
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.330

iPhone: Are you

137
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.110

141
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.740
Dr Jameson: Yeah i mean i'm i'm not really

142
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.270
Dr Jameson: I'm not merely adequately equipped to sort of

143
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.440
iPhone: Know that

144
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:23.310
Dr Jameson: Help with the mindset and all that stuff. I guess just, I would say the mantra will be people don't change unless until they need to chase so

145
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.900
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so making it so

146
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:41.790
Dr Jameson: Things don't become essential it's anyway. So if we make things too easy and keep fixing problems for other people. They don't not necessarily be motivated to make different choices. Yeah.

147
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.640
Dr Jameson: The but that's not. I mean,

148
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.920
Dr Jameson: You know, then when it's your kid or your loved one, it's, it's

149
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.860
Dr Jameson: It's not so easy, I

150
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.540

151
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:04.590
Dr Jameson: Um, does he have anyone else that that he sort of liens on or that helps him our monthly

152
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:16.230
iPhone: He has a girlfriend. Does that is more like an ex girlfriend, she's not in the area, but they do talk. Okay.

153
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.830
Dr Jameson: So she separated herself somewhat from

154
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.050

155
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.470
Dr Jameson: Is she in recovery or ever had it.

156
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.930
iPhone: Happen. She's in recovery. Okay. Okay.

157
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:36.150
Dr Jameson: Well then, I think it's good that she's kind of put up some berries, but it's nice that she's still willing to talk to them like

158
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.880
iPhone: Yeah, I think that is too.

159
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.180
Dr Jameson: And how about your daughter that you're living with his worst

160
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.060
Dr Jameson: You know about any of this or

161
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.210

162
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:53.820
Dr Jameson: How do you

163
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.980
Dr Jameson: Mean, what do you think about that, too.

164
00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.740
iPhone: I think if I were in her shoes. I probably would, would be the same way.

165
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.070
Dr Jameson: Just you know that you feel you get that

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.880
Dr Jameson: If these stupid emotions, what's getting in the way, would

171
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:37.200
Dr Jameson: make things easier but yeah okay i mean i think you know it's easy from a completely removed non attached perspective to be like don't help him and he's not gonna, you know, but but it's, it's, you know,

172
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.070
Dr Jameson: Doesn't just magically

173
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.530
Dr Jameson: happen that way, necessarily, but

174
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.670
iPhone: I know

175
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.840
Dr Jameson: I guess, um,

176
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:54.330
Dr Jameson: What was your son's drug of choice or is it I guess doesn't change, it's not alcohol. Right.

177
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.610
iPhone: No, I'm

178
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.780
iPhone: You know it's whatever he can get his hands on. He takes

179
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.680
iPhone: But he didn't.

180
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.500
Dr Jameson: He didn't get to go down that deep of into a hole. This time he he just drink instead of

181
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.280
Yeah.

182
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.670
iPhone: Yeah i mean it's it's always

183
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:33.150
iPhone: You know, like taking medications in a in an addictive way. So whatever it is and how he gets people to prescribe him things is a mystery to me well.

184
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.790
Dr Jameson: It's an art form, but

185
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:37.680
iPhone: I get

186
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:46.530
Dr Jameson: You know, it's so hard. You know, I'm sure I've been duped any number of times before, and often the people that seem the most appropriate are the ones that are, you know,

187
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.100
Dr Jameson: The best. Yeah. You know what I mean, like, well, you don't know it'd be cool. So

188
00:13:53.970 --> 00:14:01.230
Dr Jameson: Yeah, good. Good job. But does he in any kind of counseling. What says status on that.

189
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.240
iPhone: I'm

190
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:13.260
iPhone: Not really. He's not I'm trying to encourage him to talk with his sponsor, you know, things like that.

191
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:18.510
Dr Jameson: Well, I mean, I guess 111 approach might be. Maybe you've already tried this, but it's

192
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.800
Dr Jameson: Sort of put a lot of

193
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:32.820
Dr Jameson: You know, what's the word I'm trying to say like 10 word finding problem conditions on assistance, like from you. Going forward, like, you know,

194
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:45.000
Dr Jameson: I'm not answering the phone, unless you send me the receipt from the, you know, your counseling appointment every two weeks, or whatever. You know what I mean, like, make make roles that

195
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:54.810
Dr Jameson: You know, you have to tell me what you talk about or yeah anyway. But you know, that's sort of a thing so that there's at least some skin in the game, you know, for him.

196
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.420
And that's

197
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:05.160
Dr Jameson: And then I guess you could also pass along our does he know he knows about bright heart.

198
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.050
iPhone: Yeah, doesn't mean you could consider

199
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.400
Dr Jameson: Sharing this

200
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.980
Dr Jameson: Information with him in case that might be a good resource for him to

201
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:24.420
Dr Jameson: It can be, you know, tricky to find a place and get in with somebody, especially these days.

202
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.600
Dr Jameson: But, you know, he might be able to meet with one of our counselors and you know from for visa.

203
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:39.120
iPhone: Oh, I mean, you can imagine the other night trying to get a place for him.

204
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:52.410
iPhone: With the time difference here. He had his I do take it away from him and the hotels. He's in the Bay Area. So the hotels are mostly closed. Yeah.

Dr Jameson: Who took the police, is it

206
00:15:59.310 --> 00:15:59.760

Dr Jameson: Okay.

So,

216
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:29.550
Dr Jameson: So this is all anxiety. Adding to anxiety, I guess, in addition to the other, you know,

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.680
iPhone: And see, yeah. Yeah.

226

iPhone: But the appointment that I had has been moved back to August

227
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.400

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.020
iPhone: See, I was. It was hoping to get into the rheumatologist

229
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.710
Dr Jameson: I wonder if there be doing any telemedicine.

230
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.510
Dr Jameson: I'll be wanting to do that with a new patient but

231
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.470
Dr Jameson: Or with your old rheumatologists now that

232
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.860
Dr Jameson: You know, you don't have to be licensed in the state right now they waved some of those kinds of

233
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.550
Dr Jameson: Require. No, I didn't know that.

234
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:49.110
Dr Jameson: Yes, so it's possible. I can't make any guarantees, of course, but it's possible that your old rheumatologists in California.

235
00:17:50.220 --> 00:18:02.940
Dr Jameson: In this current situation could see you remotely and treat you. Because right now, they don't, you're not required to be licensed in

236
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.670
Dr Jameson: Any state. If you have a license in one state in the US, you're

237
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.130
Dr Jameson: Temporarily allowed to practice medicine in any other state.

238
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.250
iPhone: Is that with any, any type of special

239
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:17.670
Dr Jameson: Team.

240
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.550
iPhone: I would. Well, that's great.

241
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.350
Dr Jameson: So this whole pandemic emergency thing.

242
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.230
Dr Jameson: So I wouldn't such a great suggestion. Yeah.

243
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:34.620
Dr Jameson: I would just make a call reach out, hey, you know, especially because you're kind of strange and it's not

244
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:42.780
Dr Jameson: You know whether they whether they can find your medicine. I don't know. But if there's some sort of adjustment or tweak that they can

245
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.620
Dr Jameson: Consider some other I don't know replacement for

246
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.370
Yeah.

247
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.500
Dr Jameson: I was just looking up i don't i don't know the dose of

248
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.260
Dr Jameson: Range for its rheumatoid you have our Lucas, what do you have

249
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.060
iPhone: An undiagnosed.

250
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.740
Dr Jameson: Music Okay.

251
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.990
iPhone: Yeah, whatever. I'm called nonspecific

252
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.410
iPhone: Okay.

253
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.540
Dr Jameson: In other words, we don't know. Okay.

254
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.960
Right.

255
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:22.890
Dr Jameson: And you take two hundreds. I was just looking to see what the dose range was if there was some way for you to like

256
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.580
preserve your

257
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:38.220
Dr Jameson: Supply but but then again, you're feeling worse than usual. Anyway, so it's probably not a good time to try to drop the dose.

258
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:53.070
Dr Jameson: It looks like 200 to 400 is standard. Okay. But anyway, I would reach out and just see if there's if they're doing that yet. Or it you know make you know ask that you be on the list for when they do and

259
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.700
Dr Jameson: You know, see if they have any capability there been a lot of

260
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.650
Dr Jameson: So that's one of the things that's been sort of temporarily

261
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:14.580
Dr Jameson: Suspended and the other is that, you know, used to be you have to use a HIPAA compliant encrypted, you know, sort of,

262
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.860
Dr Jameson: Program of some sort. In, in order to do telemedicine.

263
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.270
Dr Jameson: But right now, you can just use FaceTime

264
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.870
Dr Jameson: The doctors can just use their own record, you know, if they are not equipped with that kind of a

265
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:38.820
Dr Jameson: System, it's okay. They can just use they've kind of been waived all the HIPAA requirements as well.

266
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.560
iPhone: Okay, thanks.

267
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:46.050
Dr Jameson: though. Yeah. So there's really a lot of there's a lot more flexibility.

268
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:53.640
Dr Jameson: For regular know until medicine people to actually do it that way. So,

269
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.080
Dr Jameson: Um, anyway. So hopefully that will be helpful.

270
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.580
Dr Jameson: And or the new person may, you know, I don't know how they'll feel about

271
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.840
Dr Jameson: The new patients without hands on, but

272
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.480
iPhone: Are you still there.

273
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:10.260

280
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:30.390
Dr Jameson: Whether they you know I do tell them. So for my other thing. Now I'm willing to be a guinea pig. If you

281
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.040
Dr Jameson: Want to give it a whirl, you know,

282
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.840
Dr Jameson: If we're not already doing that.

283
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:40.380

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.710
iPhone: It's been really cold here and I'm not used to that.

294

303
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.650

304
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:52.620
Dr Jameson: Well, I mean, you can exercise inside to not walking and there is a certainly there's a very for sure.

Dr Jameson: You know,

311
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:29.100
Dr Jameson: It doesn't actually take all that much to to really get a good heart rate up and that is typically quite

312
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.500
Dr Jameson: It typically helps with anxiety quite a bit.

313
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.870
iPhone: Just to get the heart rate up

314
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.990

327
00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.590
iPhone: I'll definitely do that.

328
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.030
Insight

329
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.540
iPhone: Let me write it down.

330
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.540
iPhone: Write it down to see this.

331
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.640
Dr Jameson: I just sent you a name and a little chat. Do you can you see that

332
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:49.650
iPhone: I did.

333
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.580
Dr Jameson: So that's the name of it and you can

334
00:24:54.690 --> 00:25:05.040
Dr Jameson: Mean, they have extensive content they have things to help you fall asleep. They've got music where you know they've got TED Talks. They've got

335
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:26.400
Dr Jameson: Any number of an, you know, in every kind of mental health department that you can think of in there. So you might experiment or explore and see if we can find a couple that really feel most you know do you prefer Australian accent or a British

336
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.830
Dr Jameson: accent or a man or a

337
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.760
Dr Jameson: Female you know there's like, I mean, so many

338
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.890
Dr Jameson: And then you may you might find there's something there that you can

339
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.660
Dr Jameson: Turn to and those more mean what I would

340
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:49.410
Dr Jameson: What I would maybe recommend or suggest or request is, you know,

341
00:25:49.800 --> 00:26:06.300
Dr Jameson: You can take the extra third if you need it. But before you do that, maybe try doing a 10 or 15 minute meditation or go for a walk or do some take some other action or two to see if you can get that to pass without you needing to take the extra

342
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:07.710
iPhone: Okay.

343
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.940
Dr Jameson: You know, I think it's

344
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:19.530
Dr Jameson: Always worth trying and continuing to try different things new. You know, trying new new playbooks and exploring because

345
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:29.340
Dr Jameson: You know, at the end of the day, you're on a very low dose and, you know, I don't really have a concern necessarily about you taking the whole one instead of two thirds

346
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:42.150
Dr Jameson: But you know if there were, if we can help you learn other ways of coping without just numbing you know i think that's that's still helpful.

347
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.850
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Life Hack

348
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:45.720
Yeah.

349
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:47.040
Right.

350
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:57.960
Dr Jameson: Okay, so yeah, so I would reach out to both old and new rheumatologists about whether they're doing any talent medicine and can you be seen if so

351
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:07.710
Dr Jameson: Consider sharing bright heart information with your son. See if you can offload some of his stuff on to professional people

352
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.000
Dr Jameson: And then you have your own appointment coming up with the

353
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.410
Dr Jameson: Counter and then try this.

354
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.420
Dr Jameson: app or any of the other one. I mean,

355
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.280
Dr Jameson: We don't own stock in this one. It's just that it's free and it's pretty extensive so

356
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:34.050
Dr Jameson: It keeps on popping up places I just started working part time for hospice in my area and they have like a they give you a phone, and they have like a list of different apps you can download and one of them is this one.

357
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.000
iPhone: Interested so good and

358
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.770
Dr Jameson: One of our patients who works in a

359
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:56.190
Dr Jameson: Homeless facility in the Bay Area was saying that I guess the government gives people cell phones. Sometimes if you know certain people and the ones that this in the Bay Area, the phones that are being given out to people come pre loaded with the same

360
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:14.760
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so it's, I mean, I think it's pretty. It's a pretty good resource I sent a refill for you for two weeks I'll double check. I did it properly, but two weeks supply saying a full strip a day.

361
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.170
Dr Jameson: And if you, you know, so you won't run out anyway but

362
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.040
Dr Jameson: My hope is that you'll maybe every so often need to take the rest but

363
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.930
iPhone: Mainly just know I think

364
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:28.590
Dr Jameson: There is

365
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.100
Dr Jameson: One time

366
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.930
iPhone: It was just gonna say that just knowing it's there, makes a big difference.

367
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.540
iPhone: Instead of thinking that you're going to run out. Yeah, so it's

368
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:48.270
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I bet that's 100% true even with like the Xanax is and sometimes people just knowing it's in the cabinet there.

369
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.890
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you just know you don't have, you don't have to worry about worrying, I guess.

370
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.180
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah, add to your

371
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.700
Dr Jameson: To your list of things.

372
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.750
Dr Jameson: And I guess the only other thing I would

373
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:13.590
Dr Jameson: Say, which I know also is easier said than done, but the amount of wasted energy that is spent by people worrying about things. They can't change or control.

374
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:14.610
Dr Jameson: Or have

375
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.630
Dr Jameson: You know, do anything about is, you know, kind of a travesty really

376
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.510
Dr Jameson: It's really a shame. So

377
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:31.110
Dr Jameson: You know, asking yourself questions of me worrying about this going to make any does it going to change anything. Is there anything I can actually do

378
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:49.320
Dr Jameson: To change this, you know what, you know, and if the answer is no, then, you know, okay, well, what can I, what can I do to either make my situation better or help somebody else or, you know, to take some action to be actually making a difference.

379
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.700
Yeah.

380
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.280
iPhone: Yeah, exactly.

381
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:53.700
Dr Jameson: Wrapping

382
00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.460
Dr Jameson: Wrapping up the end. So, which is

383
00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.460
Dr Jameson: Okay.

384
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.530
Dr Jameson: Any

385
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.410
Dr Jameson: Questions or other

386
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.250
iPhone: Now, thanks. Thank you. I

387
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:17.520
iPhone: Really appreciate this meeting. I was planning to get on the group just Wednesday, but

388
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.610
Dr Jameson: I was just gonna ask, well, we will be able to see you in group.

389
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.030
iPhone: Yeah.

390
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:21.720
I think

391
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.300
Dr Jameson: You have an insurance thing that right

392
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.630
iPhone: Your insurance. My insurance is not covering this. Okay.

393
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.830
iPhone: I'm gonna talk to them and see if now.

394
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.050
Dr Jameson: That's all reasonable. Yeah.

395
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.620
Yeah.

396
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:46.470
Dr Jameson: There are all sorts of, you know, regulations that are being waved so

397
00:30:48.300 --> 00:31:08.700
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so I was gonna say. But then I remember, like, I think there's a there's a thing about that, you know, we would be, I would encourage as much, you know, participation and communication and reaching out as you can but obviously financial Invitations are, you know,

398
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.180
iPhone: Yeah.

399
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:17.340
Dr Jameson: There were there. But there are other support groups. And I think we've talked about those in some of our other groups too, but well

400
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.700
Dr Jameson: There's two. There's in the rooms.

401
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.050
Dr Jameson: And then I've heard that A is doing some sort of

402
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:40.200
Dr Jameson: My meetings true so you can explore other sort of channels that you might be able to keep keep connected and grounded and

403
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:41.940
Dr Jameson: Maybe an

404
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.560
Dr Jameson: Island on, you know, sort of other

405
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:50.160
iPhone: People Eleanor would be really helpful at this point.

406
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.390
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I think that might be a good, just a little refresher.

407
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.600
Dr Jameson: A little you know cheerleading.

408
00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:58.620
Yeah.

409
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.320
iPhone: Because it's it's

410
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.760
Dr Jameson: So understandable. I

411
00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.600
Dr Jameson: Completely I don't blame you.

412
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.020
Dr Jameson: I think you're right. Like there's

413
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:11.790
You know,

414
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:18.060
Dr Jameson: Hopefully you know he's kind of back on his sort of on his feet at least a little bit

415
00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:20.220
Dr Jameson: But it might be

416
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:35.970
Dr Jameson: You know, it's also a risk that you end up sort of teetering a little bit and you're, you know, recovery. If you're sort of going down the dark path you know paths with him so

417
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:36.540
Yeah.

418
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:45.150
Dr Jameson: I think anyway. So yeah, I would see if you can find something like that where you just an online sort of thing and

419
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.170
Dr Jameson: See what you find, and let us know if you find something good.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:51.390
iPhone: I will

421
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.380
All right.

422
00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:03.510
Dr Jameson: So if we can see you on Wednesday. That would be great. Um, but yeah, I mean don't add to your stressors by spending money, you don't have, for example, but

423
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.870

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.000
Leana Nguyen: After man you're moving right after me. Okay.

478
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.490
Dr Jameson: And then is are you working. Is he working

479
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.470
Leana Nguyen: He's working. I'm not working.

480
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.060
Dr Jameson: I'm

481
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.670
Dr Jameson: Sorry, and then you are. You're on.

482
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.010
Dr Jameson: In treatment. Now, or

483
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:07.800
Leana Nguyen: No. So I was in treatment in Sacramento. Where is. It's like a second I was like an hour away from where I live. But then all sudden, they told me that they couldn't see me anymore because I don't live in that county

484
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:15.120
Dr Jameson: Because of the way that they're they're they're they're probably a county program or something.

485
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:20.850
Leana Nguyen: Yeah. And then everybody in my county Solano County, like the doctors, I go to like no one

486
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:34.650
Leana Nguyen: Does a treatment for Suboxone or like anything like it for pregnant, you know, someone that's pregnant. Besides that, please. So I've been going to the emergency room to get medicine which they switched me from Suboxone to

487
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.350
Leana Nguyen: Use full Norsemen this tablet tablet instead of the film.

488
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.090
Dr Jameson: Well, okay. So there's a couple things. So you were on a film.

489
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.410
Leana Nguyen: And how many

490
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.520
Dr Jameson: How many a day.

491
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.770
Leana Nguyen: Or two, A three a day, a day.

492
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.380
Dr Jameson: So they give you the tablets, you're still doing three a day.

493
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.370
Leana Nguyen: Yeah.

494
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.090
Dr Jameson: So there's two things. So how did you August

495
00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:57.450
Leana Nguyen: So you

496
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.720
Dr Jameson: It's not a new pregnancies not new.

497
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.250
Dr Jameson: You do.

498
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.420
Dr Jameson: You want so

499
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.010
Dr Jameson: So there's a couple of things.

500
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.450
Dr Jameson: There the sub you text comes in a film, too.

501
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.800
Leana Nguyen: Much positive

502
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:20.850
Leana Nguyen: Do you prefer the film. Oh no, I actually liked the tablet more because I feel like the film. Um, I don't know how to explain it.

503
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:36.030
Leana Nguyen: Oh, the, the tablet made me feel like just nothing. And then I feel like the film make you feel like a little euphoric feeling and I don't like that. But that's not that's not what I'm trying to escape that you know when they gave me this. It was a better. Like, I feel normal.

504
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:43.290
Dr Jameson: Um, and how long had you been on the Suboxone prior

505
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.670
Leana Nguyen: Um, so I started my treatment in September of last year.

506
00:37:49.680 --> 00:38:00.480
Leana Nguyen: And then so I've been on this Suboxone and then they just recently switched me to the this one right ago. I've been on for two weeks. I ran out of medicine or anything. Okay, well,

507
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:05.640
Dr Jameson: So even though it's probably more of a

508
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:13.680
Dr Jameson: How do I say like we worry about this, in theory, like in the textbook in real life. It's probably fine.

509
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:21.810
Dr Jameson: But the naloxone, the second ingredient in the Suboxone there's some supposedly concerned about safety.

510
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:29.310
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, that's what my obesity. So my mom will be also suggested, and I can tell you without the that medic medicine.

511
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.960
Leana Nguyen: So,

512
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.310
Dr Jameson: What's funny to me is

513
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.170
Dr Jameson: That the whole reason the

514
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.600
Dr Jameson: Way that the Suboxone works, then the lock zone if you're taking it properly.

515
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.400
Dr Jameson: You're not even absorbing the rocks.

516
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:44.280
Leana Nguyen: So probably not a

517
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.110
Dr Jameson: Big deal. But anyway, yes. That's what we do, etc.

518
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.910
Dr Jameson: So on the buprenorphine alone.

519
00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:54.720
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you've been on that since September and it's been working well.

520
00:38:55.170 --> 00:39:01.050
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, I mean, I just had a relapse because I ran out of the medicine and and they had stopped seeing the sex. So in the

521
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:10.770
Leana Nguyen: Time of me trying to get this medicine. I just got two weeks ago, I am like took some Narcos just so I could feel like I was still going. I was going through really bad withdrawals i would i

522
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:16.890
Leana Nguyen: I just didn't know. I didn't know it would be like have to feel like that because I haven't took it. I've been on my medicine, but

523
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.330
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well,

524
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:30.300
Leana Nguyen: There's a pregnancy, like my body's working harder because before I was pregnant. I was stopped taking the medicine for like a week and now be okay. But then my doctor, a nice day on it. I don't stop taking it. So I just stayed on it.

525
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.130
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so we

526
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:32.790
Leana Nguyen: Feel

527
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:36.180
Dr Jameson: It's still an opiate and you're still dependent on it.

528
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.310
Dr Jameson: Like addicted, but

529
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.020
Dr Jameson: So when you stopped.

530
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:44.790
Dr Jameson: If you stop taking it suddenly you'll feel withdrawal symptoms. It's a more

531
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:51.000
Dr Jameson: LONG ACTING drug. So medication. So usually, it takes

532
00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.060
Dr Jameson: A little longer for you to start feeling sick and it's a little bit more

533
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:54.870
Dr Jameson: Gradual

534
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.910
Dr Jameson: Like, people will say they don't feel good.

535
00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.680
Dr Jameson: The second day, but then the third day is when they're like, okay, but it takes it different than

536
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.100
Dr Jameson: Other you know street drugs when people

537
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.270
Dr Jameson: You know, they can quickly feel sick after running out.

538
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:09.720
So,

539
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.950
Dr Jameson: I noticed you don't have any withdrawal symptoms right now. Right.

540
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:19.950
Leana Nguyen: Um I my stomach just starting to hurt today, like I I'm starting to feel like the diarrhea, stomach pain again.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:45:01.470
Leana Nguyen: We got this. She took pills and died. That was the story, but then when I went to the hospital when her son was dying. I talked to the nurse that took care of her, and it was anarchism, like in her brain or something, just like went off and she died.

733
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.050
Dr Jameson: When where

734
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:38.190
Leana Nguyen: How long ago was that

735
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.700

Leana Nguyen: I went in January. Last one.

737
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:49.740
Dr Jameson: So that was just for a couple months.

738
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:51.750
Leana Nguyen: off and on. Okay.

739
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.220
Dr Jameson: What did you think of that.

740
00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:13.650
Leana Nguyen: Yes. Okay. I mean, well, when I was talking to the lady lady, she's she said, I like my like my mindset is like there to stop, you know, to stop. She like I'm on the right track of doing it. So I think that's why she said that she asked me if I wanted to. She feels. I didn't really need it and

741
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.570
Dr Jameson: Kind of dismissed. You okay

742
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:23.820
Dr Jameson: Did you work on like relaxation techniques and that kind of stuff for, like, what did you know

743
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:32.640
Dr Jameson: You don't have to get into, like, any kind of details or anything, but you said you were dealing with something. So it was there like a loss or

744
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:35.970
Dr Jameson: Started

745
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:51.390
Leana Nguyen: Well, when I started Xanax, it was like lost my job. I lost my boyfriend. I was, was the five years and then like I end up like stripping and stuff and get into like

746
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:58.260
Leana Nguyen: An evening a bad guy just making me do bad things, you know, got it.

747
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.690
Dr Jameson: So it was definitely self medicating

748
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.750
Leana Nguyen: I was a really dark time in my life.

749
00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:04.620
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

750
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:07.770
Dr Jameson: That things have changed so

751
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.480
So I know for you.

752
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.940
Dr Jameson: I think one thing that's

753
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:20.550
Dr Jameson: Hard to see when you're in a place up period like that, is that it's not going to stay like this forever, but it will like

754
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.630
Dr Jameson: Things will change, there will be, you know, but it can be really hard to

755
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.760
Leana Nguyen: Believe that when you're really young.

756
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:31.350
Leana Nguyen: Family everybody caught me off like it was just really bad.

757
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.990
Leana Nguyen: I haven't family now so I know that police getting better.

758
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.210
Dr Jameson: And again, no matter how bad a search certain situation is they will they will they will not last for, you know, things

759
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.070
Leana Nguyen: Things that

760
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:49.890
Leana Nguyen: You that you let it last.

761
00:55:51.330 --> 00:56:01.110
Dr Jameson: Well, yeah. And that's a mindset thing like if you've convinced yourself. This is it. And it's ever going to change. Then you maybe you don't make you don't look for opportunities you don't

762
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.320
Dr Jameson: take chances to to learn something new or do

763
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.280
Dr Jameson: Something different.

764
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:06.330
Yeah.

765
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:11.610

766
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.790
Leana Nguyen: I'm fine here just five feet short

Leana Nguyen: Little peanuts. Okay.

768
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:24.510
Dr Jameson: And I know it's right now. It's not really a fair representation. But how much do you, how much do you

769
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:27.450

Leana Nguyen: That's good.

772
00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.450
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

773
00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:42.780
Leana Nguyen: Talks about the symptoms that

774
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:43.350
Dr Jameson: You get

775
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.710
Dr Jameson: When you're in withdrawal, which I guess you are having a little bit right now.

776
00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:48.810
Leana Nguyen: And

777
00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:49.830
Then

778
00:56:58.830 --> 00:56:59.400
Leana Nguyen: What else do

779
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:10.500
Dr Jameson: You do. I don't want to go, usually at this initial visit, we talked about how the medicine works and just sort of that kind of stuff. And I, I know you're already taking it so I

780
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.330
Dr Jameson: Don't necessarily need to speak.

781
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:13.410
Leana Nguyen: But

782
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:13.980
Leana Nguyen: Do you have any

783
00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:16.110
Dr Jameson: Questions about or any

784
00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:16.620
Anything.

785
00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.260
Dr Jameson: To clear up a little bit more

786
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:24.600
Leana Nguyen: On what other questions answered. Okay.

787
00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:26.730
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, and to get inside.

788
00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.050
Dr Jameson: That all from it.

789
00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.990
Dr Jameson: No constitution.

790
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:39.210
Leana Nguyen: Oh, I definitely think I get, but I feel like I don't know. It's like a batter, batter. Good thing. So I don't like to use a number two.

791
00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:39.720
Oh,

792
00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:42.540
Leana Nguyen: So me

793
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:50.580
Leana Nguyen: It doesn't make you go as daily, but I know there is a time where I know that I need to go. So I'll take like five minutes or even five or so I will

794
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.330
Dr Jameson: Also, say I

795
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:53.250
Leana Nguyen: Don't let myself go like

796
00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:55.950
Dr Jameson: To it's not it's not becoming a problem.

797
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.190
Leana Nguyen: Film that that's made me not ever like, I will go maybe to like a week and a half without it.

798
00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.370
Dr Jameson: Oh, so then the Suboxone was

799
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:15.060
Leana Nguyen: I feel like those Suboxone will stronger like like a strong medicine down here. So the thing is out here. They give you methadone and I was like, I don't want like

800
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.190
Dr Jameson: That sounds. Yeah. Well, that's another

801
00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:23.010
Dr Jameson: treatment option for this. Yeah, but that has its own that's a whole different ballgame.

802
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:27.690
Dr Jameson: I mean some of its as its this similar idea, but it's obviously have to go every day and it's

803
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:38.910
Dr Jameson: Okay. Yeah, I mean I eating more vegetables is definitely none of us eat enough, almost none of us eat enough vegetables, nobody but very few people do.

804
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.900
Dr Jameson: So that's always a

805
00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:41.670
Dr Jameson: Good thing to do, anyway.

806
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.310
Dr Jameson: And then, did they

807
00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:51.000
Dr Jameson: Score they set up a place where you're going to get your labs done or what's the

808
00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:56.820
Leana Nguyen: Today, now I have a place I won't before. That's where my doctor sent me to get my laptop so I know where do

809
00:58:57.210 --> 00:58:57.360
Leana Nguyen: You

810
00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:08.040
Leana Nguyen: Do that it was go either on Wednesday after my doctor's appointment. My OB. Okay, see you on Wednesday. Okay, so I wanted. Okay.

811
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.380
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I usually just if we can try to

812
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:12.660
Dr Jameson: The thing is, is the longer people

813
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.170
Leana Nguyen: Wait.

814
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.560
Dr Jameson: For so that I don't know. It's like we lose our momentum.

815
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:16.740
As

816
00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:18.390
Leana Nguyen: I, you know,

817
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.900
Dr Jameson: Get it out of the way so that you don't get kind of

818
00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:22.950
Dr Jameson: About it.

819
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:30.090
Dr Jameson: Did they explain to you how our program works with groups every week and

820
00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:32.130
Leana Nguyen: Not really, okay.

821
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.110
Dr Jameson: So,

822
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:45.690
Dr Jameson: So we have this initial meeting about, I don't know, three or four different sort of requirements of the program. The initial labs and then you monthly drug screens going forward.

823
00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:52.170
Dr Jameson: This initial visit with me, you do one at least minimum visit with a counselor.

824
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.990
Dr Jameson: And then we do

825
00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.270
Leana Nguyen: Every week

826
00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:57.750
Dr Jameson: So it's

827
00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:58.170
Leana Nguyen: Eight.

828
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:07.080
Dr Jameson: To 10 patients, you're still wherever you are, like, you are today. It's just, it's just like this on zoom, except there's like Brady Bunch, you know, lots of

829
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:07.740
Well,

830
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:15.510
Dr Jameson: I'm there a counselor, is there. And so it's kind of a twofer. Because we do like

831
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:18.000
Dr Jameson: You know, we talk about some sort of

832
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.440
Dr Jameson: Subject related to recovery and then I am also checking in with people who needs a refill.

833
01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:27.300
Dr Jameson: And usually they don't

834
01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.210
Dr Jameson: Show up and change once we get you where you're going to be, but you know just

835
01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.680
Leana Nguyen: Those adjustments or

836
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.370
Leana Nguyen: Or whatever.

837
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:32.970
So,

838
01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:44.850
Dr Jameson: So going forward, you and I will see each other in this weekly group and then we'll so it should be relatively efficient as far as

839
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:47.850
Dr Jameson: You know how much time is is

840
01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.270
Dr Jameson: Needed to, you know, dedicated to this.

841
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:59.970
Dr Jameson: My groups. I mean, my California groups are on Wednesdays, I said it backwards. But I guess, get the idea.

842
01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:00.870
I heard

843
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.810
Leana Nguyen: Ob appointment this week.

844
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:06.150
Dr Jameson: So,

845
01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:14.850
Dr Jameson: I can, we can you know have you skip this coming week but after that.

846
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:19.320
Dr Jameson: But options is daytime going to be okay.

847
01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.140
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, just find what time do you guys usually do it.

848
01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.090
Dr Jameson: So I have a

849
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:31.050
Dr Jameson: Kind of have to do the math because I'm on the East Coast. It's 1030

850
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:34.470
Dr Jameson: Your time or noon.

851
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.190
Dr Jameson: 30 gets a little bit bigger. So then, well, am I lying about the same.

852
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:44.820
Dr Jameson: Is either one of those that are worse.

853
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.820
Leana Nguyen: So 10 over here and over there.

854
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.700
Leana Nguyen: Your time 1030 or no. Okay. Whenever unless you for 12

855
01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.170
Dr Jameson: was better. Okay.

856
01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:57.570
Leana Nguyen: Yeah so 10 choose a ticker now.

857
01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:00.840
Dr Jameson: Is she supposed to be sleeping.

858
01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:08.100
Leana Nguyen: What time does she take her now. She takes a nap at 10 but the thing is is I have to lay with her. She's like doesn't have a routine.

859
01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:10.860
Leana Nguyen: Okay, yes.

860
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.460
Dr Jameson: Walsh law, they're taking their nap, but OK.

861
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:16.470
Leana Nguyen: I can just let her just like

862
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:18.750
Leana Nguyen: Play in like middle the room. So right now it's

863
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:20.940
Dr Jameson: Fine.

864
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:29.850
Dr Jameson: Okay, alright. So we'll plan on that. So the way that that works is that you kind of do what you did today. So you start at the virtual clinic.

865
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:43.470
Dr Jameson: We actually asked people to start checking in about half an hour early because sometimes there's a backup with, you know, the number of people checking in and depending on what if somebody has to do their drug screen before you know what I mean.

866
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.190
Leana Nguyen: Yeah.

867
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:48.690
Dr Jameson: Let's take our time. So if you can keep it in your head. More like 1130

868
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:57.420
Dr Jameson: And then if it's real quick and you get checked in, in five minutes. Then you go do what you whatever until it's actually 12 o'clock, and then you come to the end, I'll give you a

869
01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.560
Leana Nguyen: Topic today so

870
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:06.090
Dr Jameson: Yeah, we'll give you the code for the group that week, which is changing every week. So, so you have to check

871
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:16.320
Dr Jameson: Okay so there'll be some like surveys, they asked you to fill out every week. And if you're due for a drug screen then

872
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:20.370
Leana Nguyen: That might, you know, happen at that point.

873
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.830
Dr Jameson: We'll get to that to this.

874
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.320
Dr Jameson: You don't have to worry about that for a month or so, but

875
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.930
Leana Nguyen: Hadn't dropped into you go actually go take the

876
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.960
Dr Jameson: The actual. So the first time we're going to do one at the lab.

877
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:32.760
Dr Jameson: Because we're going to do blood work in urine, but

878
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:40.980
Dr Jameson: Then we mail you a cup. Did your did your other program, have you do a little cup that had all the things right on the side of it.

879
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.050
Leana Nguyen: We all know day. I just had. I did, I did it, but they took the cup.

880
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:46.770
Dr Jameson: Okay.

881
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:47.820
Leana Nguyen: Like there. Yeah.

882
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.050
Dr Jameson: Well, so we have

883
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:53.760
Dr Jameson: They make cup that have the little testing like built into the side of the cup.

884
01:03:54.390 --> 01:04:02.400
Dr Jameson: Mm hmm. So we send you the cup and then we'll they'll explain it in more detail. Basically, when you receive the package.

885
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.560
Dr Jameson: You don't open it or anything, but you sign into virtual clinic and then

886
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:07.950
Leana Nguyen: Thing.

887
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.450
Dr Jameson: You know, watch you open it and then

888
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:15.150
Dr Jameson: You go and they don't make they don't like watch you put the pee in the cup but you know like

889
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.350
Dr Jameson: You're still on iron

890
01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:20.670
Dr Jameson: I guess they can hear the they're looking at the ceiling, whatever you put your phone down but

891
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.620
Leana Nguyen: And then

892
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.470
Dr Jameson: And then they can read it right off the cup right on the spot.

893
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:30.600
Leana Nguyen: On a school. Okay. Yeah. So it's kind of, but people can still cheap.

894
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.970
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, they're only chin themselves, but I'm just saying.

895
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.910
Dr Jameson: I know people cheat, going to the

896
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.770
Dr Jameson: Lab to i know i mean

897
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.300
Leana Nguyen: Crazy. We can't

898
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:42.960
We can't

899
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:46.530
Dr Jameson: We do have a saliva test.

900
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:50.520
Dr Jameson: Which you never know if that's what's going to be in the box.

901
01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:51.150
So,

902
01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:52.650
Leana Nguyen: You're right.

903
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.540
Dr Jameson: That one is hard to cheat because we

904
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.150
Dr Jameson: Yeah, to put it in your mouth on on Cameron.

905
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:00.450
Dr Jameson: Right.

906
01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:01.230
Right.

907
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:13.980
Dr Jameson: And then we occasionally we do pill counts, so we could, you know, reach out and say please show us your pill bottle and let us count how many you have.

908
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.310
Dr Jameson: You know, that kind of thing.

909
01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:19.980
Dr Jameson: To

910
01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.140
Dr Jameson: Kind of as well not kind of

911
01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:22.380
Leana Nguyen: It's

912
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:25.980
Dr Jameson: It's important that there's open communication.

913
01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.690
Dr Jameson: We're not. I guess this is important for you to know we're not a program where if

914
01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:33.630
Leana Nguyen: You're like,

915
01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.060
Leana Nguyen: Me. Yeah.

916
01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:43.770
Dr Jameson: If you test positive for something you're not supposed to have in you. We don't kick you out. We're not like a few new

917
01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:45.390
Leana Nguyen: People now.

918
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:49.020
Dr Jameson: It's really more about. Okay. Well, tell us what's going on, what happened.

919
01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:55.770
Leana Nguyen: Going on, you know, let's let's like out and work. Work on helping you. Yeah.

920
01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:56.760
Leana Nguyen: Look forward so

921
01:05:57.210 --> 01:06:06.540
Dr Jameson: Um, we do have a responsibility to make sure that you are actually ingesting the medication were prescribing and not selling it to somebody else. So

922
01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.830
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's part of

923
01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.970
Dr Jameson: That's part of the deal here in part of what we're testing for is that you

924
01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:13.170
Leana Nguyen: Actually, you

925
01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:14.310
Are feeling Friday.

926
01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.760
Dr Jameson: And then we have

927
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:31.410
Dr Jameson: So I, I say this to everybody. I'm not assuming anything about you specifically, but we have a tendency to have a problem with people missing their appointments and then crawling. Oh, I'm at a medicine well

928
01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.290
Dr Jameson: You need to come to the group to get your

929
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.670
Dr Jameson: If there's something going on. You have an appointment something

930
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.270
Leana Nguyen: Happen.

931
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:55.260
Dr Jameson: Your phone dies or something, you know, if you can phone and reach out and let us know what's going on. We can always reschedule or but we we kind of just need to hear from you upfront or ahead of time instead of after the fact, it's

932
01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:56.640
Leana Nguyen: Okay, yeah.

933
01:06:57.570 --> 01:07:06.480
Dr Jameson: I mean, it's because you were in a car accident and he didn't go. I mean, okay. Like, we're not reasonable. But we do like ask that you can

934
01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:09.990
Dr Jameson: That you

935
01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:16.470
Dr Jameson: Be respectful, especially like the counselors, they get blown off all the time, and it's just like so.

936
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.200
Leana Nguyen: No. Yeah, so

937
01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:24.540
Dr Jameson: Um, okay. So that's kind of the structure of

938
01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:28.350
Dr Jameson: The program. We typically start out with

939
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:33.180
Dr Jameson: One week at a time prescriptions.

940
01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:33.870
Okay.

941
01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:46.560
Dr Jameson: Great, you know with with time as things get it looks like your other place did that for a while, but then you kind of graduated two weeks. Right, that's kind of the way

942
01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:47.010
Yeah.

943
01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:53.550
Leana Nguyen: So it was given every two or three weeks because of the dry for me. That's what they're there to understand because I had

944
01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:57.690
Leana Nguyen: I took her with me. I'm appointment and I did drive an hour out so yeah

945
01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.740
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so you're new to medical, is that right

946
01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.050
Leana Nguyen: I don't know, I just, I don't know. I didn't know they discontinued my account and obvious.

947
01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:12.540
Dr Jameson: So like, this isn't what I was asking about was, do you have a copay or you just say, give me your

948
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.680
Leana Nguyen: I don't know. So I've been getting my medicine before at the clinic where I was going.

949
01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:31.950
Leana Nguyen: To be for free. So I, I know that this last time when I had to send to my my my pharmacy when I ran out and asked her, I didn't have mental I had it was a lot, but now that I'm in a coffee shop. I'm hoping that co pays

950
01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:33.810
Can I think

951
01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:47.190
Dr Jameson: Maybe there is anyway. So that can be an issue. Right. Like if somebody's paying a copay and you get the same you get your a month supply for the same copay or seven days with the same Kobe depending, that's a little bit

952
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:48.600
Leana Nguyen: annoying sometimes

953
01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:56.280
Dr Jameson: I do sometimes extend the courtesy to people that have been in treatment and have been

954
01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.990
Dr Jameson: Have been you know compliant or whatever, you know,

955
01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:02.640
Not in trouble.

956
01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:18.870
Dr Jameson: It looks like you were pretty stay stable and then come November know December, you're getting like one or two days worth at a time. I don't know what was going on.

957
01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:21.390
And

958
01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:23.580
Then

959
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:28.170
Dr Jameson: Several weeks, so I don't have a problem with starting you at the two week

960
01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:44.040
Dr Jameson: Point because you're not brand new to all this, but just be aware that if you know there are missing components are you are Mia for certain amount of time, then we can we be we sometimes drop people down to a shorter supply

961
01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.530
Leana Nguyen: Know, I'll be on my

962
01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:48.540
Leana Nguyen: Hope is nice and then taking lightly.

963
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:52.860
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so I'm not, I'm not necessarily worried, but so right and then anyway.

964
01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.080
Dr Jameson: What time is your appointment this week.

965
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:56.010
Dr Jameson: For your OB.

966
01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:57.630
Leana Nguyen: Is 11

967
01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:04.890
Dr Jameson: So you're probably not going to make group this week. So I'll give you a do will do enough to bridge you through to the next time we have group.

968
01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:09.510
Dr Jameson: And then after that, we'll do that two weeks at a time from now.

969
01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:12.960
Dr Jameson: So come to group every week, even if you don't need a refill.

970
01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.580
Leana Nguyen: Okay, no, I well

971
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:19.500
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we have the Walgreens, and a plane.

972
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:20.490
Leana Nguyen: And working

973
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.260
Dr Jameson: And you said three a day. Correct.

974
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:22.950
Yeah.

975
01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.060
Dr Jameson: Alright so today's Monday.

976
01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.890
Dr Jameson: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, what

977
01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:38.460
Dr Jameson: I'll do 10 days worth. So we have a little bit of

978
01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.460
Leana Nguyen: Overlap good if you come to

979
01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:45.150
Dr Jameson: Come to

980
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.140
Leana Nguyen: Green.

981
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:49.260
Dr Jameson: Wednesday. All right. I'll send another prescription that same day.

982
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:50.790
Dr Jameson: Um,

983
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.920
Dr Jameson: Okay, so that's going to be 30 pills and

984
01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:01.650
Dr Jameson: Do you take them set like separated or do you take them all at once.

985
01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:07.860
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, I know. I took them separately. I take one in the morning and then one like in the, like, three o'clock and then one little before bed.

986
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.280
Dr Jameson: Okay, sometimes people do like one and a half.

987
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.330
Twice a day.

988
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:20.940
Dr Jameson: I don't know if it's a pain for you to remember to take it to that many times a day or not. Well,

989
01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:25.230
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, I mean, there's time where I would just take like one or two a day.

990
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:35.550
Leana Nguyen: Just depending on the day I guess if I remember right, I remember kind of or if I'm feeling like I'm like, you know, I feel load off or

991
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.690
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well,

992
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:44.340
Dr Jameson: I mean, the truth is that the medication is a 24 hour or longer. Our medication. So it was designed

993
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:46.710
Dr Jameson: To be like methadone just taken once a day.

994
01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:57.900
Dr Jameson: For whatever reason, it seems to bet, I think some of its probably a sort of a behavioral psychological thing like you're used to dosing yourself.

995
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:05.910
Dr Jameson: Many times in a day. And it seems like going too long without taking medicine just doesn't feel comfortable, I think, to a lot of our patients.

996
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:17.790
Dr Jameson: But I will tell you that a lot of us some of the patients who have been in treatment for years will say, Oh, yeah. First, I always took it three days, twice a day, three times a day. But gradually I realized I could just take it once a day and I'm fine.

997
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:22.350
Dr Jameson: But that it took some time for them to like adjust to that. What I will

998
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.690
Leana Nguyen: Reach a reach thing.

999
01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:25.740
Dr Jameson: Yes.

1000
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.250
Leana Nguyen: And it's just

1001
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.750
Dr Jameson: This kind of that's what you're used to, for so long that it's hard to suddenly

1002
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:32.550
Leana Nguyen: Just, you know, doing that.

1003
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:37.770
Dr Jameson: But you could try taking if you can break one of the tablets. You could take one and a half.

1004
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.030
Leana Nguyen: In the morning, and then one and a

1005
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.970
Dr Jameson: Half at night and just that would, you know, simplify

1006
01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.490
Dr Jameson: It's up to you. You can keep

1007
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:46.680
Dr Jameson: Your time today it's perfectly fine. There's nothing

1008
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:48.090
Dr Jameson: Wrong with doing it that way but

1009
01:12:49.410 --> 01:12:50.730
Dr Jameson: You know, just

1010
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:51.870
Leana Nguyen: Just

1011
01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:54.270
Leana Nguyen: knock you down with simplicity. Yeah.

1012
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.940
Dr Jameson: And then of course you're super duper careful with keeping them careful

1013
01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:07.560
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I have read up on like how babies died from my actual desktop. I'm not okay well I

1014
01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.410
Dr Jameson: Know, I know I just, just a friendly reminder

1015
01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:18.930
Dr Jameson: Oh, yeah. So, um, yeah. So it's either way. You can take it three separate times you can take all three of them once a day, you can take one and a half of them twice a day.

1016
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.650
Leana Nguyen: Let me let you take all my once mentioned as

1017
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:27.510
Dr Jameson: Well yeah, I guess, or just get it all over with him today. I don't

1018
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.660
Leana Nguyen: Know,

1019
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:33.000
Dr Jameson: I mean, I don't know. Anyway, it's fine either way. Um, okay, so

1020
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:41.790
Dr Jameson: That's all the, all the things I need like to touch sort of touch on unless you have

1021
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:42.960
Dr Jameson: Any other questions.

1022
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:45.570
Leana Nguyen: No.

1023
01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:49.950
Leana Nguyen: No honey clear how this program works. I like it is more convenient.

1024
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:55.560
Dr Jameson: Hopefully by the next time we see which will be in 10 days you'll have had your labs done

1025
01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.250
Dr Jameson: And then I know you'll be running down to the last

1026
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.260
Dr Jameson: You know, few tablets that day so

1027
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:18.510
Dr Jameson: We do have that earlier group. So I actually have. It's mostly patients in Tennessee. But if you had to, I have groups on. I have a group at 9am your time on Wednesday. Also groups on Tuesday. So you know if there's a one time you know something going on a certain week and

1028
01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:20.970
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Early that's

1029
01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:27.300
Dr Jameson: Not on a regular basis. But it's, it's an option for the one time thing here and there.

1030
01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:29.940
Leana Nguyen: Keep things, you know,

1031
01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:39.360
Dr Jameson: Keep the continuity of you showing up. But that's the kind of thing we just like to hear from you about

1032
01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.220
Leana Nguyen: Okay.

1033
01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:49.650
Leana Nguyen: Okay then. So one when I go into before I go to. I just, like, go to the main to administer the admin right

1034
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:50.490
Leana Nguyen: The first

1035
01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:52.230
Dr Jameson: Call virtual clinic. Yeah.

1036
01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:53.280
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, okay.

1037
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:58.710
Dr Jameson: Second in around 1130 you could check in earlier than that. If you want to

1038
01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:00.990
Leana Nguyen: Follow Dr.

1039
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:04.290
Leana Nguyen: Know, hold on.

1040
01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:06.180
Dr Jameson: I'm

1041
01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:18.960
Dr Jameson: So you can check in earlier than that if you want to, I guess, maybe you're laying there you could sit on hold while you're leading with your daughter, I guess, although they will ask you questions at some point. But you have to talk, but um

1042
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.960
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so we'll plan on seeing you.

1043
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:23.520
Dr Jameson: A week from Wednesday.

1044
01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:27.360
Dr Jameson: Around at noon, but you'll check in at 1130

1045
01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:28.320
Leana Nguyen: Okay.

1046
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:37.140
Dr Jameson: And I sent the prescription to the pharmacy electronically so just follow up with them in the next hour, so make sure they received it.

1047
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.380
Dr Jameson: Every so often, they get upset because

1048
01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.330
Dr Jameson: You know, we're telemedicine and

1049
01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:47.490
Dr Jameson: I guess that's less of a thing right now, given the Copa now pandemic, but

1050
01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:55.650
Dr Jameson: You know, sometimes you might want to let them know you're you've switched to a new program. So it's a different doctor just so that that you know they see that you

1051
01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:56.040
Leana Nguyen: Know,

1052
01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.630
Dr Jameson: It's good. I'm saying just kind of

1053
01:15:57.690 --> 01:15:58.980
Leana Nguyen: You know, yeah.

1054
01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.020
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1055
01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:02.940
Dr Jameson: Well, any last questions before we go.

1062
01:16:16.290 --> 01:16:18.180
Dr Jameson: I don't really speak Spanish, but I know that word.

1063
01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:26.610
Dr Jameson: All right. Well, it was nice to meet you. And we will. I look forward to seeing you next time.

1064
01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.860
Leana Nguyen: Okay, thank you. You're welcome.

1065
01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:29.520
Leana Nguyen: Bye.

1066
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:30.900
Dr Jameson: Bye. You know how to get out of here.

1067
01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.970
Leana Nguyen: Yeah, just leave. Yep.

1068
01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.880
Dr Jameson: People get stuck by

1069
01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.020
Dr Jameson: Okay, so first was Eileen Mason.

1070
01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:47.700
Dr Jameson: To ask to see me because she's been

1071
01:16:48.720 --> 01:17:11.730
Dr Jameson: Finding that on occasion. She's developing really significant anxiety type symptoms typically late afternoon and these do seem to resolve she takes at the last third of her Suboxone strip. She does acknowledge that this is likely mainly anxiety because this is only began in the last

1072
01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:13.590
Dr Jameson: Few

1073
01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:19.890
Dr Jameson: weeks to a month and she's been dealing with some

1074
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:25.710
Dr Jameson: Troubles her son has been involved in lately.

1075
01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:32.040
Dr Jameson: Related to some drinking and crashing a car and having license removed and

1076
01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.580
Dr Jameson: Getting kicked out of his SLE

1077
01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:52.470
Dr Jameson: She's still living in Tennessee with her daughter.

1078
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:55.650
Dr Jameson: While her son is in California.

1079
01:17:56.730 --> 01:18:10.740
Dr Jameson: She's also concerned because of the quarantines lately. Sure. Our new rheumatology consultation got pushed back to August. She worries that she will not

1080
01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:13.770
Dr Jameson: Have enough plaque. When l to get her through

1081
01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:22.500
Dr Jameson: She is meeting with a counselor her next appointment is within the next week.

1082
01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:28.200
Dr Jameson: She used to like to walk but hasn't been as active recently.

1083
01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.310
Dr Jameson: This has helped with anxiety in the past.

1084
01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:36.450
Dr Jameson: So mental status physical normal

1085
01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:42.480
Dr Jameson: Odd severe, number one. Number two, anxiety plan. I sent him a prescription

1086
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:54.690
Dr Jameson: For the full strip a day just for sort of peace of mind. But I asked that she at least attempt one or two other anxiety.

1087
01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:01.320
Dr Jameson: Relieving measures prior to going ahead with that last

1088
01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:03.750
Dr Jameson: Dose

1089
01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:13.590
Dr Jameson: Such as meditation deep breathing exercise provided her with some more resources for line.

1090
01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.000
Dr Jameson: Things ID.

1091
01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.690
Dr Jameson: Measures, as well as

1092
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:25.350
Dr Jameson: recovery support groups.

1093
01:19:26.490 --> 01:19:32.520
Dr Jameson: And incidentally, I did encourage her to reach out to her both new and old rheumatologists, given the current

1094
01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:41.700
Dr Jameson: Pandemic there are fewer regulations regarding

1095
01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:44.190
Dr Jameson: Across state.

1096
01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:52.800
Dr Jameson: Treatment, as well as telemedicine. So she may be able to consult with her California rheumatologist, at least in the interim

1097
01:19:53.820 --> 01:20:03.000
Dr Jameson: Continue with group weekly ideally, but she's got a financial limitations on that. So probably bi weekly

1098
01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:12.390
Dr Jameson: And continue with her individual counseling. Then we have Leanne. And when was a new patient here for history and physical

1099
01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.040
Dr Jameson: She is living in the Sacramento area.

1100
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:23.130
Dr Jameson: But I guess recently moved and has no longer

1101
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:33.270
Dr Jameson: Candidate for the clinic where she had been getting treatment period. She's also pregnant.

1102
01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:54.810
Dr Jameson: As of two to three months ago and that clinic was uncomfortable treating her during pregnancy as well. Period. She had run out of she was maintained on Suboxone films eight plus two, three a day she's been going to the local er in the more recent

1103
01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:06.930
Dr Jameson: Past and then two weeks ago was switched to buprenorphine eight milligram tablets three a day but has worn on those two or three days ago now.

1104
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:11.910
Dr Jameson: She first started treatment September of 2019

1105
01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:15.120
Dr Jameson: She did take some Norco

1106
01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:23.550
Dr Jameson: During the past few months. Another point when she'd run out of her Suboxone medication.

1107
01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:26.400
Dr Jameson: But otherwise, has been

1108
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.680
Dr Jameson: doing quite well in sobriety. She has a one year old daughter as well.

1109
01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:44.010
Dr Jameson: Her withdrawal symptoms include insomnia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, runny nose, anxiety, I said that I guess anxiety.

1110
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:51.000
Dr Jameson: So she currently has some mild symptoms today.

1111
01:21:54.660 --> 01:22:00.030
Dr Jameson: She's not been in an inpatient treatment programs, no legal issues.

1112
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:09.420
Dr Jameson: Her drug use really began about four years ago and she was dealing with some

1113
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.320
Dr Jameson: Difficulties in life. Period. She started with Xanax sexually

1114
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:36.480
Dr Jameson: Which she stopped while pregnant with her first daughter. But what had been occasional opiate use turned into daily regular opiate use after that pregnancy and she was as as much as 40 milligrams a day of more Co. She's nice any snorting or installation.

1115
01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.190
Dr Jameson: And no IV administration.

1116
01:22:47.190 --> 01:23:04.950
Dr Jameson: She actually prefers the buprenorphine tablets to the Suboxone films which caused more constipation and at times created also somewhat of a euphoric feeling, neither of which she's noted with her machine dose.

1117
01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.220
Dr Jameson: She did complete at least a short

1118
01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:22.710
Dr Jameson: Course of individual counseling, but a couple months ago, the counselor.

1119
01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:25.320
Dr Jameson: offered her the option of

1120
01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:29.640
Dr Jameson: Just continuing that so she did.

1121
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.710
Dr Jameson: I filled in her past medical stuff.

1122
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:40.710
Dr Jameson: She's not allergic to any medication. Her only other medication is prenatal vitamin

1123
01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:51.630
Dr Jameson: Family history there is definitely addiction on her father's side. She never really knew him and he died by suicide.

1124
01:23:55.710 --> 01:24:05.880
Dr Jameson: She suspects. Her mother has bipolar and or borderline personality that is not a formal diagnosis, they're more or less a strange at this point.

1125
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:14.280
Dr Jameson: Review of systems. As noted above, otherwise negative

1126
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.480
Dr Jameson: I, I was that her height and weight.

1127
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:21.390
Dr Jameson: Her exam is normal.

1128
01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:25.980
Dr Jameson: O. U. D. Severe, number one. Number two, pregnancy.

1129
01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:36.480
Dr Jameson: Yes, she's in her second trimester. Now plan. I ran her cures report, which is consistent with her history today.

1130
01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:47.640
Dr Jameson: We reviewed the structure of our program. She's already familiar with medication and mechanism of action and agile side effects.

1131
01:24:49.890 --> 01:24:58.290
Dr Jameson: She's chosen the 12 o'clock noon Wednesday group, but will not be able to attend this coming this week because she has an OB appointment that day.

1132
01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:09.210
Dr Jameson: I sent a prescription for eight milligram tablets three a day for 10 days number 13 I'll refill she's going to have our initial labs done sometime this week.

1133
01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:12.900
Dr Jameson: Explained our

1134
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:31.290
Dr Jameson: Minimum at least one meeting with a counselor and weekly groups, I will extend the courtesy of starting at two week supply of medication after next time because she's been in another treatment program prior

1135
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.990
Dr Jameson: I think that's all. Thanks.

1136
01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.340
Dr Jameson: Hello.

1137
01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:51.210
Dr Jameson: Can you hear me.

1138
01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:52.770
Michael Flores: Yes, I can.

1139
01:25:53.040 --> 01:26:00.000
Dr Jameson: Okay, um, my name is Dr. Jamison tipping myself because I get this glare right in my eyes, but now

1140
01:26:00.330 --> 01:26:08.580
Dr Jameson: I'm not really in my professional looking spot there. I can't win anyway if you wouldn't mind confirming your name and date of birth. Now,

1141
01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:14.250
Michael Flores: Michael florists October 24 1989

1142
01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:19.200
Dr Jameson: Thank you, and you're in California. Right. Correct.

1143
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:28.110
Dr Jameson: So I guess they already kind of probably went through the sort of consent for treatment stuff.

1144
01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:32.790
Dr Jameson: You're comfortable with the fact that we're in a telemedicine visit and

1145
01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.370
Dr Jameson: That we do record and transcribed these visits, so

1146
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.370
Dr Jameson: Just so you know, you're

1147
01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:49.020
Dr Jameson: We are being recorded. We don't save the videos forever, but they do see the transcription of what what was said so.

1148
01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:49.980
That's

1149
01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:53.580
Dr Jameson: Good, so

1150
01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.580
Dr Jameson: Are you already taking Suboxone today.

1151
01:26:57.630 --> 01:26:58.140
Michael Flores: No.

1152
01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.390
Dr Jameson: No. Okay. Sorry, I'm I had two new patients, and I must have flipped them in my head.

1153
01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:22.740
Dr Jameson: Okay, so the basic purpose of this visit is to kind of review your medical history in general and then confirm that you are probably a good candidate for Suboxone or sub you tax and that buprenorphine and then explain how it works and get you started. Ideally, hopefully.

1154
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:29.040
Dr Jameson: So let me just start with some easy questions like are you allergic to any medication.

1155
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:31.110
Michael Flores: No. And do you

1156
01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:36.450
Dr Jameson: Take any prescriptions that your or you want any other any medication that's prescribed to you.

1157
01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:39.540
Michael Flores: Have I bought any

1158
01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:43.080
Dr Jameson: Know, are you like, are you under the care of a doctor for any

1159
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:56.310
Michael Flores: Particular No. Okay. No, I was taking heartburn medicine, but I stopped going to the doctor. So now I just buy over the counter medicine like pilot SEC or the attack or something. Yeah, yeah, produce it. Okay.

1160
01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:59.370
Dr Jameson: Let's say you have heartburn, but it's controlled with that.

1161
01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.100
Michael Flores: Yeah, good. Okay.

1162
01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:20.640
Dr Jameson: I don't want to digress but sometime I might share with you some diet dietary changes that may be different than what people have mentioned to you before, not just the spicy food thing we can come back to that. Another day

1163
01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:29.850
Michael Flores: Are you able, are you able to give me like because I used to take protonix the 40 milligrams. But yeah, Eric named the pencil puzzle.

1164
01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.010
Michael Flores: Yeah, are you able to give me

1165
01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:33.150
I'm

1166
01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.510
Michael Flores: Technical like cheaper. It's

1167
01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:41.070
Michael Flores: Cheaper and then the Polish. That's pretty expensive. Yeah.

1168
01:28:41.370 --> 01:28:44.190
Dr Jameson: We don't tip the week, try to kind of stay in our own lane.

1169
01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:50.070
Dr Jameson: You know, sometimes things that have to do with sleep and anxiety. That's kind of more related to

1170
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.710
Dr Jameson: Potentially, we get, we will do, but

1171
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:55.230
Dr Jameson: That kind of stuff. We really try to

1172
01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:56.250
Michael Flores: Okay.

1173
01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:01.920
Dr Jameson: I don't think our malpractice even covers, like, you know, non addiction type stuff, that sort of thing.

1174
01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:21.240
Dr Jameson: But I guess or on the subject, I would suggest you consider experimenting with a dairy free diet for a little bit and see if you notice any change. There's a huge correlation with dairy sensitivity and Heartburn, reflux. Your irritation. So

1175
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:22.890
Michael Flores: Okay, you can

1176
01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:27.570
Dr Jameson: Try it for a couple weeks and see if you notice any difference. Anyway, um,

1177
01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:36.450
Dr Jameson: Okay. So then let's see where are you living at these days, with whom are by to have your own place or

1178
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:40.920
Michael Flores: I live with my, my mom and my girlfriend and my kids.

1179
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:42.330
Dr Jameson: How many kids. Yeah.

1180
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:50.970
Michael Flores: True well one's mine like my blood, but basically step child, but it's basically like mine. Yeah, so

1181
01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:56.730
Dr Jameson: Okay, so when you with you one between you and your girlfriend and then she had another one. Before you

1182
01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:58.260
For me, okay.

1183
01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:02.520
Dr Jameson: And are you working or in school or not.

1184
01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:03.990
Michael Flores: Anything we have some working

1185
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:09.660
Michael Flores: What do you do. I'm an intake coordinator for a home health agency.

1186
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:11.130
Dr Jameson: Oh, okay.

1187
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:15.210
Agency.

1188
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:22.260
Dr Jameson: All right. And you see you finished high school or did you go further than that.

1189
01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:26.160
Michael Flores: Yeah, a finished high school and some college

1190
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:34.950
Dr Jameson: I just got this new pet set. I'm not used to want to keep walking into it. Yeah.

1191
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:41.190
Dr Jameson: Alright, so let's look girlfriend kids and homeless your mom.

1192
01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:42.300
Dr Jameson: Your mom.

1193
01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:42.840
Okay.

1194
01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.790
Dr Jameson: And do you smoke cigarettes.

1195
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.840
Yes.

1196
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:51.120
Dr Jameson: How much

1197
01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:54.600
Michael Flores: Probably like half a pack a day. So like 10 cigarettes.

1198
01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.780
Dr Jameson: He has that is that cut back from were used to be or

1199
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:16.320
Michael Flores: Yeah. Yeah. And I, and I definitely think I will stop once I stopped taking pills, because I only smoke when I'm taking pills, so I can feel that little extra high, but I don't crave them when I'm not on the pills. So, pretty sure I'll stop.

1200
01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:18.600
Dr Jameson: I hope so. That'd be great.

1201
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:20.520
Dr Jameson: How about alcohol.

1202
01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:24.030
Michael Flores: Any know occasionally. Okay.

1203
01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:25.890
Michael Flores: I used to

1204
01:31:26.610 --> 01:31:32.610
Michael Flores: I used to, but then he was a trigger for wanting to do cocaine. So I just stopped overall

1205
01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:34.110
Dr Jameson: Come back on. Okay.

1206
01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:38.460
Dr Jameson: So okay, so cocaine and then other

1207
01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.420
Dr Jameson: What other kinds of pills and things have you been

1208
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:47.670
Michael Flores: Just, just Percocet and Marco's that's what my thing is mainly okay

1209
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:51.420
Dr Jameson: mathur know Ben pencils or anything. Okay, no.

1210
01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.420
Dr Jameson: The cocaine was before, not anymore or

1211
01:31:54.810 --> 01:32:04.920
Michael Flores: No, it was just before when I when I drink it, I do it, so I don't drink, but last time I drinking done, it was

1212
01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:12.270
Michael Flores: My younger brother, when he passed away his services. So probably about six months ago. Okay.

1213
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.490
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1214
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:19.410
Dr Jameson: I'm sorry to hear about your breath. That sounds

1215
01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:21.000
Dr Jameson: Horrifying

1216
01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:26.250
Michael Flores: Yeah, it was. Yeah, it's been tough tough few months.

1217
01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:30.600
Dr Jameson: What happened to him.

1218
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:46.560
Michael Flores: Honestly, he was a year and a half, clean and we don't know cuz there's like a bad batch of some axes will fit now and he had been clean and

1219
01:32:47.190 --> 01:33:03.630
Michael Flores: Some of it came out in his toxicology and he just didn't wake up one day, my mom found them. So he probably just really I don't know if he overdosed because it wasn't a high amount to where the toxicology, said he, overdose. They determine good I'm

1220
01:33:04.890 --> 01:33:08.370
Michael Flores: undetermined, but there was no in his system.

1221
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:13.890
Dr Jameson: So that's properly and if he had been clean. This is like one of the scariest things to me.

1222
01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:16.770
Dr Jameson: It makes it makes my

1223
01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:26.880
Dr Jameson: hair on my head. But you know when people relapse. If they haven't been using in a while their tolerance is different and the stuff that's out there keeps getting stronger.

1224
01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:31.200
Dr Jameson: So it's been those two things. It's like very high

1225
01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:37.230
Dr Jameson: risk of mortality rate for first returned to us. It's really scary.

1226
01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:39.360
Dr Jameson: I'm sorry that happened.

1227
01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:43.590
Alright.

1228
01:33:45.150 --> 01:33:46.800
Dr Jameson: So actually it was pills, but

1229
01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.340
Dr Jameson: We don't actually know. I saw what he thought

1230
01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.570
Michael Flores: He was 24

1231
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.270
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1232
01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.150
Dr Jameson: Do you have other siblings.

1233
01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:11.820
Michael Flores: Yeah, I have an older brother and 133 year old and a 15 year old.

1234
01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:13.680
Dr Jameson: Oh, wide range

1235
01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:14.730
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1236
01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:18.780
Dr Jameson: And. Are they healthy anybody else struggling with

1237
01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:22.530
Michael Flores: My older brother. No.

1238
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:26.220
Michael Flores: He's a pretty bad.

1239
01:34:28.530 --> 01:34:30.270
Dr Jameson: And opiates hostile with opiates.

1240
01:34:30.930 --> 01:34:31.320
Dr Jameson: Huh.

1241
01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.120
Dr Jameson: Oh yeah, so he's

1242
01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:42.360
Michael Flores: Yeah, he says, I think probably heroin or math. I'm not too sure. Okay.

1243
01:34:42.630 --> 01:34:44.160
Dr Jameson: You don't talk too much these days are

1244
01:34:44.490 --> 01:34:50.040
Michael Flores: Know he he says he doesn't need help. So he

1245
01:34:51.930 --> 01:34:55.020
Michael Flores: Tends to not talk to us or stay away.

1246
01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:04.770
Dr Jameson: Okay, how about parents and your younger brother. So far so good.

1247
01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.530
Michael Flores: Oh, please. Yeah, so far so okay

1248
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:09.000
Dr Jameson: And how about parents

1249
01:35:09.690 --> 01:35:13.740
Michael Flores: Know, they're good. They're yeah they're good.

1250
01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.920
Dr Jameson: Anybody with alcohol.

1251
01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:34.500
Michael Flores: Oh yeah, my grandpa on both sides. My all my uncle's are alcoholics and my uncle's on my mom's side, they're all drug addicts from every drug like crack math crank.

1252
01:35:35.610 --> 01:35:40.080
Michael Flores: I don't think they really dived into heroin too much, but a lot of the uppers.

1253
01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:45.120
Michael Flores: So there's a high addiction is

1254
01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:52.860
Dr Jameson: Likely. Yeah, there's probably some specially wire D receptors in your brains, unfortunately.

1255
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:57.390
Dr Jameson: But that doesn't mean it's not over. It's not

1256
01:36:00.210 --> 01:36:02.640
Dr Jameson: treatable, you know, just, yeah.

1257
01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:07.050
Dr Jameson: Have you ever had any app accidents or operations.

1258
01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:08.160
No.

1259
01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:13.620
Dr Jameson: No hospitalizations any overdoses for you.

1260
01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:14.670
Know,

1261
01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:24.210
Dr Jameson: Alright, so you're 30 or and let's see. So when did you start. Tell me, or tell me your story.

1262
01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:42.180
Michael Flores: Pills Turner, just one day we ditch high school probably when I was in my junior year we got into my mom's friends medicine. Me and started taking some Vikings and then ever since then.

1263
01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:55.920
Michael Flores: I mean, we would take them. I was probably 16 and where we just take them here and there. And then when I actually graduated high school when I turned 18 I worked for a pharmacy I delivered

1264
01:36:57.150 --> 01:37:16.590
Michael Flores: For five years. So I had pretty much access to everything that got sent back. So I was always taking them then and then I stopped, maybe a few times for like eight months, three months and then always just went back to it. So it's been since like probably I was 16 about 14 years. Yeah.

1265
01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.460
Dr Jameson: So when you would stop on your own. How did you do that.

1266
01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:41.610
Michael Flores: Honestly, I just stop and I just want the very first time I did stop. I went through the withdrawals myself and started working, you know, just staying busy and I went to school and that's when I was clean for like eight months. I got my medical assistant surf certification.

1267
01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:45.480
Michael Flores: And then the other time.

1268
01:37:47.370 --> 01:37:55.080
Michael Flores: I just had terminals to help me get through the night, the pain and then I just stopped and I started working out again.

1269
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.420
Michael Flores: That's pretty much it.

1270
01:37:57.690 --> 01:37:59.430
Dr Jameson: So the exercise has been yeah

1271
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:01.230
Michael Flores: Well, yeah, definitely.

1272
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:04.740
Dr Jameson: Um, are you working out now.

1273
01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.800
Michael Flores: No, no, but I plan to one.

1274
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:08.790
Michael Flores: Is it kind of like

1275
01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.320
Dr Jameson: One or the other but not

1276
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:12.090
Dr Jameson: You don't work out when you're also using

1277
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:13.800
Michael Flores: Okay, yeah, now

1278
01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:23.370
Dr Jameson: I was at a conference where they were talking about exercise. And while we know that it boosts you know good endorphins and

1279
01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:34.440
Dr Jameson: You know dopamine and stuff, but they were also saying that they have suspicions that you know the sensations. When you're sweating and hot and all this stuff when you're working out.

1280
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:47.100
Dr Jameson: Some of that overlaps a little bit with with withdrawal symptoms and they said that people that work out regularly seem to be able to tolerate those withdrawal symptoms, a little bit better.

1281
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:53.100
Dr Jameson: Interesting. Yeah, so okay so lately I've been using. Did you say Norco

1282
01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:56.040
Michael Flores: North North who's in purposes. Okay.

1283
01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.890
Dr Jameson: And do you solve them or

1284
01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:02.670
Michael Flores: Nighttime or what do you do. Yeah. Nice. Well done. Okay.

1285
01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.910
Dr Jameson: How much a day about what do you say

1286
01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:18.000
Michael Flores: I would say it depends on how much money I have, and how would I get my hands on anywhere from want to say 20 to 35 pills a day day 10 milligrams

1287
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:26.190
Michael Flores: Wow. That's expensive. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. It really is.

1288
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:32.040
Michael Flores: My new daughter. She's seven months now and it's just like it's time

1289
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:34.620
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1290
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:39.630
Dr Jameson: Well, he'll be much more present. I think if you're not distracted.

1291
01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:41.100
Michael Flores: I'm

1292
01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.940
Dr Jameson: Sorry, did I already asked you, have you had any overdoses know

1293
01:39:46.590 --> 01:39:48.810
Michael Flores: Me, but you can remember. Yeah, sorry. No. Okay.

1294
01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:53.970
Dr Jameson: And then, have you been in any like formal treatment programs, either in

1295
01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:54.870
Dr Jameson: Agent or

1296
01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:59.580
Michael Flores: I have one. So I went to a detox a seven day program.

1297
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:12.420
Michael Flores: And I wanted to stay longer. But I really didn't. I felt bad because my girlfriend was still praying it and I left it at home by yourself. So I just did the seven days and I stopped.

1298
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:16.890
Dr Jameson: Okay, and how long ago was that

1299
01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:18.030
It was

1300
01:40:19.530 --> 01:40:21.570
Michael Flores: like nine months ago. Okay.

1301
01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.480
Dr Jameson: Okay, did they give you any medication. When you were there.

1302
01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:41.550
Michael Flores: Yeah, they gave me some charity techs and mentor corporal like a muscle relaxer, and then some transit on to sleep. I think just

1303
01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.850
Michael Flores: Tell me sleep one of those. And then so yeah savvy text and met the carnival.

1304
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:52.590
Dr Jameson: Okay. And then so once he left that was that no more.

1305
01:40:53.460 --> 01:41:01.140
Michael Flores: Yeah, once I left, I was I started with you. I've been happy with my brother and they just, they just want all that again.

1306
01:41:02.370 --> 01:41:04.980
Dr Jameson: I see. Okay, so that was shortly. Okay.

1307
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:07.380
Dr Jameson: So he was playing how long

1308
01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:15.750
Michael Flores: Was it not that long, how it's any wasn't even because of my brother. I just relax myself. There's probably a few days a week.

1309
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:19.800
Yeah.

1310
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.620
Dr Jameson: Well,

1311
01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:30.030
Dr Jameson: I'm sure you know this too. Unfortunately withdrawal lasts an awfully long time. It's way longer than

1312
01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:32.760
Dr Jameson: Alcohol and a lot of other

1313
01:41:33.810 --> 01:41:36.660
Dr Jameson: Drugs, so it doesn't seven days.

1314
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:39.780
Dr Jameson: That's not going to probably cut it.

1315
01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:41.190
Michael Flores: Yeah, I know.

1316
01:41:41.250 --> 01:41:43.620
Michael Flores: Yeah, and they were begging me to stay longer.

1317
01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.540
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no, no. I am not. I'm not.

1318
01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:50.040
Dr Jameson: Saying, Oh, I wish something good. I'm just saying it's it's a very long.

1319
01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:58.080
Dr Jameson: And there's a depression that often sets and it just takes it takes a good long time for the receptors to Reese re

1320
01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:01.710
Dr Jameson: rewind back to

1321
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:03.840
Dr Jameson: Back to normal.

1322
01:42:05.490 --> 01:42:15.480
Dr Jameson: Okay, so this has been really 1010 years probably when did it get really like, when did you know okay i really have a problem.

1323
01:42:16.110 --> 01:42:22.200
Michael Flores: When I when I started working for the pharmacy, so probably when I was 18 so 12 years so

1324
01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.250
Dr Jameson: It's been okay

1325
01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.480
Dr Jameson: And tell me what sort of when's the last time you use something now.

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:28.890
Michael Flores: This morning

1327
01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:33.570
Dr Jameson: And then when you have, what do you have any withdrawal symptoms right now.

1328
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:35.190
Yeah.

1329
01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:40.320
Michael Flores: I would say my stomach starting to feel a little funny but other than that.

Um,

1339
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:26.400
Dr Jameson: And then you said pain. So you get kind of paint all over

1340
01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.520
Michael Flores: Oh, yeah, yeah. My whole body would hurt.

1341
01:43:30.330 --> 01:43:35.100
Dr Jameson: Do you have anything that hurts you. Anyway, regularly.

1342
01:43:35.130 --> 01:43:37.740

1343
01:43:38.970 --> 01:43:50.010
Michael Flores: About three years ago, playing softball, but I just felt like I i did go to the doctor prescribing some channels I tore my already said, I took my

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.330
Michael Flores: Practice or

1345
01:43:51.930 --> 01:43:55.050
Michael Flores: Not the rotator cuff because I that's something you might still there, forget

1346
01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:59.100
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, so you have children and still bothers you.

1347
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.760
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1348
01:43:59.970 --> 01:44:01.980
Dr Jameson: From time to time or pretty much every day.

1349
01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:02.580
Michael Flores: Every day.

1350
01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:07.680
Dr Jameson: Did they want to do. Did they recommend surgery or anything.

1351
01:44:07.770 --> 01:44:14.790
Michael Flores: No, it wasn't. I mean, it's tall taller. Boy, I forgot what it was it we're

1352
01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.210
Michael Flores: Not my rotator my

1353
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:21.630
Dr Jameson: tendinitis or

1354
01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.490
Michael Flores: It's honestly

1355
01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:26.220
Dr Jameson: The you can separate your shoulder.

1356
01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:31.710
Michael Flores: Did you fall I fell on it. I don't want you. I was diving for being small

1357
01:44:32.010 --> 01:44:34.710
Dr Jameson: Did you kind of land like on your side.

1358
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:37.860
Dr Jameson: Yeah, it's a good way to separate yourself.

1359
01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.600
Dr Jameson: And then the little AC.

1360
01:44:44.010 --> 01:44:46.590
Dr Jameson: Joint here can sometimes be a mess.

1361
01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:48.510
Michael Flores: Yeah, okay.

1362
01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:50.340
Dr Jameson: Well, anyway, so you had a shoulder injury.

1363
01:44:51.450 --> 01:44:51.720
Okay.

1364
01:44:53.490 --> 01:45:10.710
Dr Jameson: All right. So tell me what you already know. I don't want to go through stuff you already know, but tell me what you know about we primarily use Suboxone or the generic of it which is only different from Sub you text in that it also contains the the no locks on our can

1365
01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:15.180
Dr Jameson: So anyway, tell me what you know about

1366
01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:16.650
Dr Jameson: If anything,

1367
01:45:16.710 --> 01:45:18.360
Dr Jameson: If nothing else go sir from the ring any

1368
01:45:19.170 --> 01:45:20.880
Michael Flores: Like seven tests are Suboxone

1369
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:41.100
Michael Flores: Yeah, well I know he helps with the withdrawals and I know the difference is like from that in methadone like methadone, you could still use but this stuff if you use. You can get sick and you'll get sick with you. So that's why I wanted to

1370
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.940
Michael Flores: Go because

1371
01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:51.480
Dr Jameson: Well, so. Okay, so, and you probably, I don't know if you would even remember how much somebody text, they were giving you

1372
01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:58.410
Michael Flores: Well, honestly, I don't remember. No. Okay. I don't even think they even told me the milligrams

1373
01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah, yeah. And it was it where they the film strip you things are, where they tablets.

1374
01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.670
Michael Flores: It was it's heavily yet to put a new year.

1375
01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.260
Michael Flores: So, yeah.

1376
01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:23.550
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, I don't know. You know, you're, you're at least initially, I would expect that you might need a little on the higher dose on the higher side because you that's a pretty healthy dose of of

1377
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.850
Dr Jameson: oxycodone that you're taking every day. Yeah.

1378
01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:29.850
Dr Jameson: So,

1379
01:46:30.930 --> 01:46:39.660
Dr Jameson: I guess. Anyway, so, um, do you, do you remember they made you wait until you were pretty sick before they started this apotex

1380
01:46:40.710 --> 01:46:47.070
Michael Flores: No, because I honestly didn't get to see they made me we honestly I think it was

1381
01:46:48.540 --> 01:47:00.870
Michael Flores: I want to say 12 hours because they gave it to me that even. Okay. And before I went in. It was about nine o'clock in the morning and they gave me some that night.

1382
01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:02.880
Michael Flores: So,

1383
01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:07.920
Dr Jameson: Okay, so, so if I had to. How long after you took it. Did you feel better. Do you remember

1384
01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:19.410
Michael Flores: Honestly, when I was taking them. I felt good. I didn't have really no way jaws. I honestly didn't have any I just couldn't sleep. Yeah.

1385
01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:20.730
Michael Flores: I was amazed.

1386
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:22.440
Michael Flores: I was really amazed. The house like

1387
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.110
Michael Flores: So yeah, I think, I mean,

1388
01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:34.320
Dr Jameson: Suboxone or somebody texts or whatever you want to call it either one. I mean, they're really, it's an amazing I find I, in my opinion, is it's kind of

1389
01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:46.860
Dr Jameson: Almost like a miracle drug i mean it's it's a designer drug anyway. But it's the one thing that's a little bit of a down downside to it. It's a, you have to be careful when you first take your first dose.

1390
01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:48.600
Dr Jameson: Yes, so

1391
01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:54.270
Dr Jameson: Um, the way that it works is actually often

1392
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.930
Michael Flores: Not

1393
01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:59.190
Dr Jameson: A lot even doctors, I find sometimes they're confused by this if they haven't done

1394
01:47:59.610 --> 01:48:01.380
Dr Jameson: The special training about it so

1395
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:10.470
Dr Jameson: buprenorphine which is in the Suboxone and the semi texts either one of those both contain the buprenorphine. The buprenorphine is the blocker.

1396
01:48:11.370 --> 01:48:24.750
Dr Jameson: So a lot of times people think. I think it's the Narcan part which is a blocker, but it's actually not absorbed. When you take it dissolved the way it's designed to be taken does not that are can is really there as a

1397
01:48:25.170 --> 01:48:31.860
Dr Jameson: deterrent to people that might otherwise have creative ideas about how to take the medicine and

1398
01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.120
Michael Flores: What to do with it.

1399
01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:42.270
Dr Jameson: So if you snort it or shoot it or something that you're not supposed to be doing anyway. Then you get your in our camp with it and then obviously that

1400
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:52.200
Dr Jameson: Even the buprenorphine along the sub you text without the that is the block. That's the main ingredient is the blocker so

1401
01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.570
It's a really strong.

1402
01:48:56.490 --> 01:49:07.080
Dr Jameson: It sticks to the opiate receptors very we call it has a high affinity. It's very strong and it's it's much stronger than many other opiates and heroin.

1403
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:19.140
Dr Jameson: So if you've taken any other opiate recently. And so there are still molecules in your brain stuck to those receptors and we introduce the buprenorphine in your system that

1404
01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.150
Dr Jameson: We will come in and actually

1405
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:24.750
Dr Jameson: Push off clear. Get out of my way.

1406
01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.160
Dr Jameson: And jump on

1407
01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:29.910
Dr Jameson: To the receptor that can actually make you feel really sick.

1408
01:49:30.450 --> 01:49:36.180
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so we need the receptors to already be mostly empty before you start

1409
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:37.470
Michael Flores: The buprenorphine.

1410
01:49:37.710 --> 01:49:39.630
Dr Jameson: So this is the one sort of

1411
01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:46.530
Dr Jameson: Not such a great thing about it is that we have to kind of wait for you to be pretty uncomfortable.

1412
01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.340
Dr Jameson: Because otherwise, you can actually suddenly feel

1413
01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:59.100
Dr Jameson: Even more terrible than a regular withdrawal because it happens like really fast. All of a sudden, and it's from what I'm told. It's, it's

1414
01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:03.510
Dr Jameson: Not something you can even imagine. And so

1415
01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.900
Dr Jameson: We usually suggest

1416
01:50:08.850 --> 01:50:20.730
Dr Jameson: You know, you want to be past that just, Oh, I can tell I'm starting to not feel good. You want to be into the, like, oh, I don't know how much more of this. I can take kind of stage and then take your first dose so that

1417
01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:24.120
Dr Jameson: We can just bring you up to normal and not

1418
01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:25.980
Michael Flores: Risk taking you suddenly feel

1419
01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:27.660
Michael Flores: Bad. Yeah.

1420
01:50:27.810 --> 01:50:29.430
Dr Jameson: Does that make sense. I want to make sure

1421
01:50:30.630 --> 01:50:32.070
Michael Flores: Yeah definitely understand that. Okay.

1422
01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:41.550
Dr Jameson: So given what you're telling me, my recommendation would be and I can give you some sleep medicine. And so I don't know if they gave you

1423
01:50:43.110 --> 01:50:53.400
Dr Jameson: Quantity or any of these other withdrawal symptom type things, but I can give you some of that to try to help help overnight, but I would very strongly encourage you to

1424
01:50:53.400 --> 01:51:02.100
Michael Flores: Wait until tomorrow morning before you take your first dose. Oh yeah, I will. I mean, because I don't want to go into that.

1425
01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.900
Michael Flores: I've ever heard of that happening.

1426
01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:04.530
Dr Jameson: To people

1427
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:05.370
Yeah.

1428
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:08.040
Michael Flores: Yeah, and I don't want to go into that.

1429
01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:18.540
Dr Jameson: Now I don't want for you. I did not wait I kind of, I almost think it sometimes like creates this like a version to the medication like if that's your first experience with it so

1430
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.120
Dr Jameson: I certainly don't want that to happen to

1431
01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:24.750
Michael Flores: You okay, so I'm just looking up, you

1432
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:26.370
Dr Jameson: Live in Madera right

1433
01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:27.300
Correct.

1434
01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:30.930
Just

1435
01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:43.740
Dr Jameson: To look you up in the system. Okay, so, oh, they did they give. Maybe they did they give you a prescription for 70 text when you left the other place or

1436
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:50.580
Michael Flores: No. When I left know they made sure I when I left. They made me stop for

1437
01:51:51.630 --> 01:51:54.900
Michael Flores: 12 hours before I can even reuse. So

1438
01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:55.560
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1439
01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:57.150
Michael Flores: You saw my life I've been ours.

1440
01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:10.500
Dr Jameson: In the database about prescription there. They have these prescription drug monitoring programs that we like to refer back to, and I can see from it was July 19 they gave you actually Tim as a Pam, which is also

1441
01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:16.500
Dr Jameson: A well I guess it's considered a muscle relaxant, but it's it's a benzo

1442
01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:22.020
Dr Jameson: So I must give me that, too. So maybe that maybe they gave you that first and

1443
01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:38.190
Dr Jameson: Kept me kept you sleepy through beginning of your withdrawal until they could give you the subtext, but they had to milligram tablets and they only get the only they only got 20 of them for you. So do you remember how many times a day, they were giving the sublime.

1444
01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:50.730
Michael Flores: Text. I think it was about three and then it cut down to two and then okay but there was days like where I did feel like I know you're more but they wouldn't give me more because

1445
01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:56.880
Michael Flores: Yeah, I don't. And a lot of people, honestly, were complaining about the way they were making them.

1446
01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:59.730
Michael Flores: Yeah, go through that.

1447
01:53:01.290 --> 01:53:04.230
Michael Flores: Yeah, so the withdraw.

1448
01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:05.550
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1449
01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:20.220
Dr Jameson: So, okay, well anyway I you know I wasn't there. And I don't know what the average dose. First of all, we usually use usually we use eight milligram, it has to predicting two things in it. So it's eight slash two. It's the second ingredient. The two

1450
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:33.870
Dr Jameson: We usually eight milligram either films or tablets and then most people take it to two a day, which would be the same as taking eight of the ones that you had been getting there. It looks like.

1451
01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:43.560
Dr Jameson: So be quite a bit more. Sometimes people need even a little more than that, you know, we don't really want to overshoot, either because

1452
01:53:43.590 --> 01:53:43.830
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1453
01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:55.050
Dr Jameson: You know, someday, hopefully someday we'll, we'll be talking about tapering you off of it and the less you're taking the start with the less well you know distance will have to go

1454
01:53:55.710 --> 01:53:56.940
Dr Jameson: That's usually

1455
01:53:58.470 --> 01:54:00.750
Dr Jameson: Literally probably years down the road, but

1456
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:08.550
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so I would, I would recommend that we start

1457
01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:19.530
Dr Jameson: With the eight milligram strengths and you could take a half of one and wait half an hour, see how that goes. And take the other half. If you still don't feel good or

1458
01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:20.430
Dr Jameson: Or something.

1459
01:54:21.810 --> 01:54:26.280
Dr Jameson: And if you end up finding that okay and in the whole thing, then you can just take the whole thing. The next time, but

1460
01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:41.880
Dr Jameson: You know, we can start with the one half to one twice a day and then see see where we are with that. And then I can send. I don't really want to use them as a pan, but we can certainly send some trouser down did that help you when he took it.

1461
01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:43.440
He

1462
01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:47.850
Michael Flores: Yeah, it helped me. I just wanted stay asleep via

1463
01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:52.470
Michael Flores: I remember because I remember I took it and I was watching a baseball game and

1464
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:57.360
Michael Flores: I don't even remember falling asleep and I woke up was, and I don't remember falling asleep.

1465
01:54:57.630 --> 01:54:58.770
Michael Flores: Okay well alright

1466
01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:08.310
Dr Jameson: And then there's also for the hot and cold and restlessness and stuff. Sometimes we use. There's a couple of the two other medications. One's called quantity and I think I already mentioned that name.

1467
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:17.040
Dr Jameson: I don't know if you've ever heard of it or to use that before and then hydroxyl the nervous drill is another another one so

1468
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:24.090
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so if you feel like you're going to have a hard time overnight. I can send a couple things.

1469
01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:38.850
Michael Flores: Yeah, I will try. Nice. I mean, yeah, I would appreciate that just because like you said I, this is the first time I've actually been there's bad like up to this many a day and I'm kind of alone. Or if somebody

1470
01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:43.800
Dr Jameson: Saying that credit. So you've gone up considerably since you were in that treatment. Last time I think

1471
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:54.120
Michael Flores: No, I was. But since achievements you I was about the same with these last two years. My dosage as a lot

1472
01:55:54.450 --> 01:55:56.250
Michael Flores: Well, that's called tolerance. Right.

1473
01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:57.840
Dr Jameson: You've heard that term before. Yeah.

1474
01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:58.290
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1475
01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:00.300
Dr Jameson: That it's unfortunately what happens

1476
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:06.150
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I mean, it's just a medical phenomenon that happens in our body. So

1477
01:56:08.490 --> 01:56:16.410
Dr Jameson: Right. So, so what we're trying to do is meet meet your receptors, where they are right now and then over time as we kind of help.

1478
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:26.700
Dr Jameson: Stabilize and build your toolbox of ways to cope with discomfort, whether it's physical or emotional, mental, whatever.

1479
01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.170
Michael Flores: You know, we can

1480
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:37.950
Dr Jameson: Eventually start talking about the year Riviere you gradually like so you can barely even notice it dropping doses down and again that's way down the road.

1481
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:39.840
Dr Jameson: And some people never do.

1482
01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:45.480
Dr Jameson: I mean, some people just aren't going to, they don't have the motivation or they're just there's too many

1483
01:56:46.140 --> 01:57:01.410
Dr Jameson: crazy things in their life, and it's just not something doesn't feel like a good idea. And so we just leave them. I mean, still better than then using especially people who are you know injecting and doing things that are super extra risky.

1484
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:04.860
Michael Flores: Yeah. Not that taking opiates every day isn't risky.

1485
01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.950
Dr Jameson: And okay so

1486
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:15.030
Dr Jameson: There you have a plan in place for when and where you're going to have labs done

1487
01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:26.880
Michael Flores: Yeah, um, I have to check if my lab places open. I know the girl, let me know that normally it's a week they want us to do as well because what's going on.

1488
01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:29.610
Michael Flores: The, you know, the coronavirus yeah

1489
01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:30.960
Michael Flores: I mean, if they

1490
01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.250
Michael Flores: depend a little extra

1491
01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:34.950
Dr Jameson: I mean, if there's if their clothes or something but

1492
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:45.900
Dr Jameson: Otherwise I would, you know, try to try to get it out, out of the way, just because the longer it seems like the longer we go without doing them, the harder it is to get them done. I don't know why, but yeah.

1493
01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:46.950
Dr Jameson: I mean we have to be

1494
01:57:47.370 --> 01:57:55.950
Dr Jameson: Reasonable in the crazy times we're in right now. And then I don't. It doesn't sound like it doesn't seem like people are very often sort of

1495
01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:06.060
Dr Jameson: Prep prepare are informed, I guess is the better word for how how our program is structured going forward.

1496
01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:13.530
Dr Jameson: I don't know if anybody mentioned to you that we have weekly group sort of support group meetings.

1497
01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.360
Michael Flores: Yeah yeah

1498
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:16.800
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then

1499
01:58:19.590 --> 01:58:28.140
Dr Jameson: See me with me once, at least, and we can we sometimes do have men check follow up, depending, just to go over dosing and tweeting things

1500
01:58:29.190 --> 01:58:40.620
Dr Jameson: Then you do the month the weekly groups and within the first few weeks doesn't necessarily have to be instantly. But we have you meet with a therapist counselor person as well.

1501
01:58:41.250 --> 01:58:52.740
Dr Jameson: And then at that visit, they will decide you the two of you will decide together what the best approach will be as far as how long, or how often anyway to be meeting.

1502
01:58:53.310 --> 01:59:01.980
Dr Jameson: To do the individual counseling piece. So some people have a lot of stuff that needs to get dealt what work through

1503
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:13.140
Dr Jameson: Then I'll honestly when there is that much stuff that's like going to be the you know game, you know, that's going to be the determinant of, you know, how well this goes in the big picture, you know,

1504
01:59:13.890 --> 01:59:16.200
Dr Jameson: Some people don't have that much. It's really kind of

1505
01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:29.790
Dr Jameson: Simple sort of stuff. And they, they, you know, meet with somebody, meet with the person for, you know, four or five sessions or something and then kind of, you know, just call me if you need me. So it you know just that's very variable.

1506
01:59:30.270 --> 01:59:37.140
Dr Jameson: And that'll have to do with, you know, they'll get into more personal questions. And how was your childhood and all this kind of stuff.

1507
01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:45.030
Dr Jameson: So that will happen. They call the initial visit a bio cycles social evaluation.

1508
01:59:46.650 --> 01:59:49.440
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so if you heard that term. That's what that means.

1509
01:59:51.360 --> 02:00:10.200
Dr Jameson: And then we don't have to worry about it quite yet, but we'll get the initial labs done at the lab. And then after that, once a month we we require a drug screen which is done urine usually almost always but we send you a cup at home so you can

1510
02:00:10.860 --> 02:00:14.880
Dr Jameson: Do that, without having to step into the lab every month.

1511
02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:21.420
Dr Jameson: So we'll get we'll get to that at the time comes, but that's sort of the general

1512
02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:25.320
Dr Jameson: Structure. They have some

1513
02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:34.140
Dr Jameson: Survey. They're really into data collection and monitoring data to look at, which is cool, really, but it's it's a chore for you guys.

1514
02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:35.580
Michael Flores: Yeah, these

1515
02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:52.890
Dr Jameson: These surveys every week, but it allows them to kind of identify different factors that seem to be associated with, you know, good outcomes bad outcomes. You know, things happening can can kind of be warning signs that we need to you know get

1516
02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:55.560
Dr Jameson: Get together a little bit more often or something.

1517
02:00:57.630 --> 02:00:59.940
Dr Jameson: So what is your work schedule like

1518
02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:02.430
Michael Flores: I'm I'm normally work.

1519
02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:12.600
Michael Flores: Monday through Friday ANYWHERE I COULD GO IN anywhere from eight to nine. So from eight to 438 to five or nine to 530

1520
02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:23.190
Michael Flores: And then we work. One, two, Saturdays, a month and one Sunday, a month one full weekend and extra Saturday but actually

1521
02:01:24.090 --> 02:01:37.050
Michael Flores: I'm off for two weeks for bonding time starting today. So it kind of worked out in case I do go through some bear with George some I was off because we were gonna we plan on going to Disneyland, but doesn't coronavirus well

1522
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:40.560
Michael Flores: But he said months.

1523
02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:43.110
Michael Flores: My son, that's five years old so

1524
02:01:44.970 --> 02:01:56.910
Michael Flores: And we didn't end up going so yeah but i'm i'm probably since I'm we're not going I might go back to work. Next Monday, probably because, I mean, I might as well do you see my time for

1525
02:01:56.970 --> 02:02:00.780
Dr Jameson: Yeah, do something more interesting than stare at the walls. Yes.

1526
02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:02.520
Dr Jameson: Okay.

1527
02:02:02.730 --> 02:02:06.810
Michael Flores: So pretty much in a funk function that was able to go to work. You just know

1528
02:02:07.710 --> 02:02:10.200
Dr Jameson: Yeah, luckily, that's good.

1529
02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:17.880
Dr Jameson: Yeah. And did I ask any legal issues. Nope, okay.

1530
02:02:18.990 --> 02:02:35.250
Dr Jameson: Great. Um, so my California groups are on Wednesdays, but most of them what my they're all in the daytime. So then the other option is Tuesday evening, I have a 6:15pm

1531
02:02:35.250 --> 02:02:38.940
Dr Jameson: That's fine, but that works. Okay, sounds like that would work better for you. Okay.

1532
02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:41.880
Dr Jameson: All right, so

1533
02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:45.360
Dr Jameson: You go by Michael Mike, how do you go

1534
02:02:45.690 --> 02:02:46.200
To Michael

1535
02:02:47.610 --> 02:02:48.900
Dr Jameson: Michael Yeah.

1536
02:02:50.700 --> 02:03:00.090
Dr Jameson: Okay, I'm just penciling you and so I don't forget what we decided on. Okay. So as far as the prescription goes prescriptions, I guess, let me send

1537
02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.070
Dr Jameson: To this be from anxiety slash well

1538
02:03:15.690 --> 02:03:16.380
What's

1539
02:03:22.050 --> 02:03:24.780
Dr Jameson: Hey, Reagan. Can you shut my door.

1540
02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:36.150
Dr Jameson: Do you get nasza nauseated at all. No.

1541
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:37.410
Michael Flores: No. Okay.

1542
02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:44.010
Dr Jameson: Oh, we don't have a pharmacy. What did you have a pharmacy in mind.

1543
02:03:44.610 --> 02:03:49.260
Michael Flores: Oh yeah, I thought he put it on there it was. I go to the right, eating in Madeira.

1544
02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:51.750
In

1545
02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:54.720
Dr Jameson: West all of. Yeah.

1546
02:03:59.370 --> 02:04:05.730
Michael Flores: Well, we can say if they don't have what I need. Can why you want to transfer to a different policy your

1547
02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:09.810
Dr Jameson: Well, yes and no. It might require a phone call.

1548
02:04:11.190 --> 02:04:17.580
Dr Jameson: As opposed to like a regular medication where they can just, they can go in to the computer and pull it out at a different store.

1549
02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:18.660
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1550
02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:22.290
Michael Flores: That doesn't always apply for this kind of medicine, but yeah.

1551
02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:34.860
Michael Flores: I'm hoping like tomorrow. Well, tomorrow morning. I

1552
02:04:35.130 --> 02:04:38.640
Michael Flores: Hope they say 123 days right so

1553
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:54.330
Dr Jameson: That's a good yes your, your experience on the pharmacy side of things. Yes, I would give them a call and confirm that they have it in stock and that you're going to be able to pick it up and you can pick it hopefully pick everything up today and then

1554
02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:59.430
Dr Jameson: We'll have it ready but you can use the other stuff tonight. And then, yeah.

1555
02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:07.200
Michael Flores: And if they say they don't have it. Should I give you, then

1556
02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:17.580
Dr Jameson: I guess what I would suggest is called other options in your areas and confirm that you have found somebody that does have it and then yes, give us a call and we will

1557
02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:22.380
Dr Jameson: I can either change it and just send it to a new pharmacy. If you

1558
02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:25.470
Michael Flores: Give us a specific list and then yoga.

1559
02:05:25.590 --> 02:05:33.390
Dr Jameson: Or if it's just a different Rite Aid store for this time or something like that. We sometimes will call and just do it for police so they can

1560
02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:35.190
Michael Flores: Because

1561
02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:38.790
Dr Jameson: You're right. They do sometimes have to order it less of a

1562
02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:50.910
Dr Jameson: Well, we're at the very end of a month. Sometimes that is hard. But generally, the eight milligrams are pretty commonly used. So if we're doing like an unusual strength.

1563
02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:54.480
Michael Flores: Then yeah, it's more of a problem but ok

1564
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:57.720
Dr Jameson: Alright, so then travel and don't

1565
02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:03.150
Dr Jameson: It comes in different strengths. I don't know if you remember

1566
02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:04.290
They don't

1567
02:06:07.710 --> 02:06:09.060
I guess.

1568
02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:17.040
Dr Jameson: I'll start with 50 and you can take one or two.

1569
02:06:18.330 --> 02:06:18.960
Michael Flores: If one is

1570
02:06:19.170 --> 02:06:23.250
Dr Jameson: Enough. Now the hydroxyl seen visceral also can be sedating so

1571
02:06:25.230 --> 02:06:26.940
Dr Jameson: Just bear that in mind, you know,

1572
02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:30.240
Michael Flores: At that time,

1573
02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:43.380
And then I haven't even gotten to the

1574
02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:45.600
Dr Jameson: Main Event.

1575
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:54.570
Dr Jameson: But I know it can be a rough a rough way, you know, waiting game with them.

1576
02:06:55.950 --> 02:07:09.510
Dr Jameson: I mean, if you start, you know, when you get to a point where you're like, I, you know, in tremendous discomfort, as far as withdrawal goes and it's it's time to take your first dose, so you don't have to wait all the way till the morning if it's really bad, but

1577
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:10.890
Yeah.

1578
02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:17.520
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then there's tablets and there's film.

1579
02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:29.910
Dr Jameson: If you. Some people don't like the taste of one or the other one you know one of them makes them nauseous. Neither does. Do you remember if the tablets bother you, and then you

1580
02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:31.350
Michael Flores: Know they were fine. Okay.

1581
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:36.720
Dr Jameson: So we'll start with tablets. They're usually preferred by insurance anyway because they're cheaper.

1582
02:07:38.730 --> 02:07:45.870
Dr Jameson: Sometimes the like medical wants the brand, strangely enough, so if they want the brand will change it but I

1583
02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:59.700
Dr Jameson: You know guest guessing what you want to start with. We'll start with that. Okay, so I'm going to say one tablet twice a day, you're going to have group tomorrow night because it's already my it's Monday. So it's just tomorrow.

1584
02:08:00.090 --> 02:08:05.010
Dr Jameson: So we'll be able to touch base pretty quickly to see how things are going.

1585
02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:06.060
Okay.

1586
02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:14.790
Dr Jameson: I'm gonna just send a couple days worth of medicine for now just to keep

1587
02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:19.470
Dr Jameson: Keep you close, close, close eye on you.

1588
02:08:19.890 --> 02:08:24.900
Michael Flores: And then if you know we can send another prescription even tomorrow night, but I just kind of want to

1589
02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:26.610
Dr Jameson: See where we're at with this.

1590
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.320
Michael Flores: In case it seems like we might

1591
02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:33.270
Dr Jameson: Need three a day and then I'll send a new prescription with a higher amount. So, um,

1592
02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:35.100
Dr Jameson: So,

1593
02:08:36.810 --> 02:08:40.350
Dr Jameson: You know, I said earlier, something about breaking them in half. But I would say

1594
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.700
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1595
02:08:42.090 --> 02:08:46.020
Dr Jameson: I would just take one. I don't think you need to draw

1596
02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:48.570
Dr Jameson: The disk draw it out any longer.

1597
02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:59.160
Dr Jameson: But you can just take one and it's the same way you remember where you let it dissolve and you have to wait 10 minutes before you eat or drink anything

1598
02:08:59.430 --> 02:09:00.690
Michael Flores: Yeah. Remember all that

1599
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:06.810
Dr Jameson: And then, tomorrow, we can see how you're feeling how the day is gone.

1600
02:09:09.930 --> 02:09:17.400
Dr Jameson: You know, if you if you really barely feel any better after a whole one, you know, you can take another half of less of a second one.

1601
02:09:18.930 --> 02:09:19.470
Michael Flores: And then

1602
02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:27.720
Dr Jameson: Do one and a half the SEC for your second dose of the day don't do any more than three and 24 hours so without talking to me.

1603
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:28.110
Okay.

1604
02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:32.970
Dr Jameson: So,

1605
02:09:36.090 --> 02:09:36.570
Dr Jameson: You know,

1606
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:40.320
Dr Jameson: In general, you know, when we're starting and we're still

1607
02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:41.640
Dr Jameson: Trying to sort out what the doses.

1608
02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:43.470
Michael Flores: On a little bit more flexible.

1609
02:09:43.890 --> 02:09:44.910
Michael Flores: Once we get you

1610
02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:45.510
Dr Jameson: Into a

1611
02:09:47.130 --> 02:09:49.200
Michael Flores: Certain dose.

1612
02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:54.330
Dr Jameson: Then this whole. Oh, you can take an extra one if you that's not going to be

1613
02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:56.730
Dr Jameson: A standing. Okay.

1614
02:09:57.180 --> 02:09:58.260
Michael Flores: After we get things

1615
02:09:58.290 --> 02:10:09.240
Dr Jameson: squared away in the next couple days. Okay, so I'm always open to conversation about what's going on and discussing, maybe it does change, but I want to have a conversation before we make changes.

1616
02:10:09.810 --> 02:10:18.660
Dr Jameson: That you know it's a problem at the pharmacy. If you run out early because you were taking more than your medicine prescription said then, you know, they won't fill it. If it's not

1617
02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:19.890
Dr Jameson: Time, yet you know

1618
02:10:20.070 --> 02:10:24.990
Dr Jameson: So we need to we need to make sure that we're really proactive about about keeping

1619
02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:28.020
Dr Jameson: Kind of all on the same page.

1620
02:10:29.670 --> 02:10:44.370
Dr Jameson: So then I'm going to just give you a couple of the other little sort of rules. I guess for group. We ask that everyone has some sort of headphones or earbuds or something which is mainly for privacy purposes of here.

1621
02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:45.330
Michael Flores: Okay, yeah.

1622
02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:50.970
Dr Jameson: I'm patriots, then we're not broadcasting. Who knows what to a room of who knows how many

1623
02:10:50.970 --> 02:10:51.450
People

1624
02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:56.430
Dr Jameson: We ask people not to smoke during group because some people

1625
02:10:56.670 --> 02:10:57.900
Dr Jameson: Quit or trying to quit.

1626
02:10:57.900 --> 02:10:58.140
And

1627
02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:01.140
Dr Jameson: Don't need to see somebody else puffing

1628
02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:01.530
Away.

1629
02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:04.380
And then

1630
02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:16.020
Dr Jameson: As much as possible a quiet private place where you know your full attention is on the group and not you know making dinner or grocery shopping or

1631
02:11:16.050 --> 02:11:16.920
Michael Flores: Something else.

1632
02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:22.230
Dr Jameson: Unrelated. So that's kind of the main spiel for the group's

1633
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:32.550
Dr Jameson: It can take a little time for the check in process and every you know there's 10 people checking in, for the same group. So we asked people to check in.

1634
02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:42.600
Dr Jameson: At least half an hour before the group starts and you can do it even like if you're driving home from work or something. Well, I guess that's not a good example because you don't want

1635
02:11:43.050 --> 02:11:43.800
Dr Jameson: The driving, but

1636
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:51.780
Dr Jameson: Um, you know, you can check in even earlier than half an hour. Once you get through all the different, you know, check, check, check and make sure they

1637
02:11:51.960 --> 02:12:04.050
Dr Jameson: Have everything they need. They'll give you or email you the meeting ID. Maybe they did that today to and then you can go about your business until 615 comes in and jump. Join the meeting for the group.

1638
02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:10.560
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so you don't have to stand the whole the whole the whole time. If you're early, you can go do something else and then come back.

1639
02:12:12.570 --> 02:12:17.430
Dr Jameson: So I think in your mind 545 for tomorrow, just a year.

1640
02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:20.610
Dr Jameson: Sometimes it can take a little while in there.

1641
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:23.280
Dr Jameson: And then

1642
02:12:24.510 --> 02:12:26.880
Dr Jameson: Just a general reminder. I

1643
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:33.900
Dr Jameson: Kind of say to everyone, because I don't know at the beginning, who's going to be the problem child and who isn't. But

1644
02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:46.020
Dr Jameson: You know the vision is you come to group to get your prescription. So if you don't make it to group, then you know getting a refill becomes chopped, you know, problematic.

1645
02:12:46.800 --> 02:13:00.150
Dr Jameson: Know we also at the same time, understand life is life. So if something comes up, you have a conflict, it's, you know, whatever. Just be in touch. Reach out. We can either maybe find a different time for you.

1646
02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:18.420
Dr Jameson: Maybe not, but at least the we're kind of know what's going on. Maybe I meet with you individually, especially this week. See how it's going, but just in general, you know, be at seven o'clock on a Friday night. Oh, I took my last pill yesterday, and now I'm out. It's like

1647
02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:20.580
Dr Jameson: You know,

1648
02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:37.710
Dr Jameson: You're not really. Not really appropriate so just do your best to be as proactive as possible. I'm, I'm not necessarily worried about this in your case, but I just find if I don't say it out loud. And I just, I don't know, I feel like

1649
02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:42.180
Dr Jameson: I've learned the hard way. I have to kind of set the ground rules from the beginning.

1650
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:54.690
Dr Jameson: Same. Same thing with appointments. We actually have probably the biggest problem with no shows on the counselor visits, especially people that haven't met the counselor, yet they seem to be very

1651
02:13:56.250 --> 02:14:06.000
Dr Jameson: Reluctant, I guess, I don't know. So we have a lot of no shows. And that's really unfair for the professionals who are making their time available, so

1652
02:14:06.690 --> 02:14:14.820
Dr Jameson: Yeah, the way that we usually where I didn't say this, either the way that we usually do this as we start with a week at a time. So yours is shorter this week.

1653
02:14:15.090 --> 02:14:19.890
Dr Jameson: Today, just because we're so brand new. I need to. I want to know what your dose looks like it's going to be before I even send more

1654
02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:28.260
Dr Jameson: But we generally do a week at a time when medication until a couple months have gone by and you're showing up and you're following through. And, you know,

1655
02:14:29.490 --> 02:14:31.830
Dr Jameson: Participating and, you know, and then we

1656
02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:46.980
Dr Jameson: Do two weeks at a time and then ultimately people earn me you know PRIVILEGE OF A MONTH WORTH OF prescription medicine per, per trip to the pharmacy, which is just more convenient. So ultimately, that's the, that's the sort of

1657
02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:51.120
Dr Jameson: Path pathway or whatever. So

1658
02:14:51.660 --> 02:15:04.890
Dr Jameson: On the flip side, if things are going great. And all of a sudden you stop showing up or missing thing, you know, then we can we sometimes have to go backwards and cut back on the prescriptions if if we need to. So that's sort of our general approach.

1659
02:15:06.450 --> 02:15:25.830
Dr Jameson: With the drug screens when when that gets going. I, you know, we're not a program where if you fail your, your drug tests for whatever reason you get kicked. We don't kick people out for that necessarily. I know some programs do, but I think we're more pragmatic about it like

1660
02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:36.060
Dr Jameson: Let's talk about what's going on. What happened, what's what the, what the issues are and make sure we're sort of learning from our

1661
02:15:36.690 --> 02:15:47.580
Dr Jameson: From our setbacks and not not. We don't just blanket kick you out. So I'd rather know about what's going on and have someone be very, you know, honest and forth, you know, open and

1662
02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:59.310
Dr Jameson: forthcoming about what's happening and said of stealing someone else's P and putting in the cup to make it look good. I don't think that's serving anybody. Well, you know what I mean, let's be real about what's really happening.

1663
02:16:00.330 --> 02:16:00.690
Michael Flores: Yeah.

1664
02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:05.460
Dr Jameson: My personal opinion i, which I think is not unusual is that

1665
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:10.080
Dr Jameson: There's usually more to this story than simply

1666
02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:12.090
Dr Jameson: Oh, I took a lot of pills and

1667
02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:22.140
Dr Jameson: Now, my body is is dependent on it. Like there's usually reasons why you found yourself drawn to these things. And we talked about, there's a genetic component, for sure.

1668
02:16:22.770 --> 02:16:35.880
Dr Jameson: But often there are other factors that have to do with the way we think about the world the way we deal with difficulty. The way we don't don't don't deal well with with discomfort of some sort.

1669
02:16:36.390 --> 02:16:37.080
Dr Jameson: Anxiety.

1670
02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:39.900
Dr Jameson: Anger, you know, so I am a very strong

1671
02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:51.000
Dr Jameson: Proponent for some, you know, one on one counseling, which I feel is usually kind of critical to the long term.

1672
02:16:52.290 --> 02:16:55.710
Dr Jameson: Success and having people fly. Eventually, you know, with their

1673
02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:59.580
Dr Jameson: You know sail away into the sunset. You know what I mean. So

1674
02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:09.540
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so I will, I will focus on that quite a bit. As far as, you know, hopefully I won't have to wrangle you as much wrangles on the patients, but

1675
02:17:10.650 --> 02:17:14.700
Dr Jameson: I find that it's amazing actually even then the people who are most

1676
02:17:16.770 --> 02:17:26.040
Dr Jameson: resistant to the idea, often are the ones that actually need it the most. And there'd be no it in some subconscious way. They just are afraid to go there. So I try to avoid it, but

1677
02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:29.580
Dr Jameson: Most of the time the people that we really have to

1678
02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:37.830
Dr Jameson: Twist arms to get see the counselor find that it's actually really helpful and they are really glad that they ended up getting there. So,

1679
02:17:39.300 --> 02:17:48.600
Dr Jameson: Anyway, we'll see how it goes and maybe you'll be one of the small subset where they don't have much to talk to you about after after they meet with you a couple of times. So

1680
02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:51.510
Dr Jameson: Yeah, whichever way it works out. Okay.

1681
02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:56.160
Dr Jameson: Do you have any. I do a lot of talking. I'm sorry.

1682
02:17:57.810 --> 02:18:00.120
Dr Jameson: Do you have any questions for me.

1683
02:18:01.470 --> 02:18:04.890
Michael Flores: As of now, no, you actually answer any question that I might have been

1684
02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:11.430
Michael Flores: Like, Oh, that's good. No, no, it's getting. But yeah, no.

1685
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:19.080
Dr Jameson: I'm okay. So with as far as I mean, last thing, and then I'll let you go. So you'll follow up with a pharmacy in

1686
02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:25.560
Dr Jameson: A few minutes just, hey, they sent a bunch of things just checking on when, when will I be able to pick those up. Would you think

1687
02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:36.810
Dr Jameson: And if there's any issues, then yeah be in touch and you can sign back into the virtual clinic is usually your best bet for any issue really, that's the place to start.

1688
02:18:38.430 --> 02:18:40.140
Dr Jameson: As far as the group goes

1689
02:18:41.490 --> 02:18:47.490
Dr Jameson: The count is a counselor and me and then other patients or clients, whatever. Want to call them.

1690
02:18:48.630 --> 02:18:54.120
Dr Jameson: So it's just like this is in the zoom but there'll be a bunch of lots of different faces on your screen.

1691
02:18:56.190 --> 02:19:11.670
Dr Jameson: We are happy to hear your input. But obviously, knowing your brand new. This is all completely. No, you haven't even ever taken medicine before really barely so you're not Levada is the name of the counselor. She may

1692
02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:17.130
Dr Jameson: throw you a softball. Like, would you like to, but

1693
02:19:17.730 --> 02:19:27.990
Dr Jameson: feel very comfortable. Not today. I don't really know. I don't have anything to say about this. I'd rather just listen. Today, like you can say no if you don't feel comfortable. That's really okay

1694
02:19:28.590 --> 02:19:31.740
Michael Flores: So then I don't they did at the at the other program like

1695
02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:35.490
Michael Flores: When we're on detox stadium and how is. Yeah.

1696
02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:37.170
Dr Jameson: So she

1697
02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:39.150
Michael Flores: She usually start going through which

1698
02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:41.430
Michael Flores: Yeah, it's like okay like

1699
02:19:43.530 --> 02:19:52.560
Dr Jameson: The way that she starts her group their youth counselor is different. But the way that she tends to start them and she asked people, she calls it a three point check in.

1700
02:19:52.920 --> 02:20:00.510
Dr Jameson: And she asked people to, you know, check in with how they're feeling mentally, physically and spiritually and she means spiritually like

1701
02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:12.960
Dr Jameson: How's your spirit like your outlook on life. If you happen to be a spiritual person that's fine too but it doesn't mean religious necessarily, you can do so.

1702
02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:19.440
Dr Jameson: And sometimes we end with what something we're grateful for. So

1703
02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:20.670
Dr Jameson: Those kinds of

1704
02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:23.550
Dr Jameson: Things you know that's the only time I would

1705
02:20:23.850 --> 02:20:26.760
Michael Flores: Think that you may, you know, be expected to say

1706
02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:29.610
Dr Jameson: Something but but otherwise you can

1707
02:20:29.730 --> 02:20:31.350
Michael Flores: Say as much or as little as you feel

1708
02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:34.410
Dr Jameson: Comfortable and I'm sure after a couple weeks. It'll be

1709
02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:35.700
Dr Jameson: A little bit less.

1710
02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:37.500
Michael Flores: Over. Yeah.

1711
02:20:37.710 --> 02:20:38.970
Michael Flores: Intimidated, yes.

1712
02:20:39.210 --> 02:20:39.480
Yeah.

1713
02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:42.600
Dr Jameson: It's a nice group of people really

1714
02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:43.170
Honestly,

1715
02:20:46.050 --> 02:20:48.630
Dr Jameson: People with kids people without kids.

1716
02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:53.670
Dr Jameson: One guy has a wife who's expected to do

1717
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.970
Michael Flores: In

1718
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:54.990
Dr Jameson: May I think

1719
02:20:55.410 --> 02:20:56.580
Michael Flores: Yeah, so

1720
02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:59.850
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so it's, you know, mostly younger people. So I think you'll

1721
02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:00.450
You'll feel

1722
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:03.600
Dr Jameson: Part of a gang at some point anyway.

1723
02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:04.050
Dr Jameson: That's it.

1724
02:21:07.890 --> 02:21:09.690
Dr Jameson: Okay, well I'm

1725
02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:12.180
Michael Flores: Last chance for any other

1726
02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:14.940
Michael Flores: Questions No, I'm good. Good.

1727
02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:18.810
Dr Jameson: So I hope everything will be smooth at the pharmacy. What's my

1728
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:19.290
Region.

1729
02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:30.720
Dr Jameson: And if but if not, you know, like I say, it is the end of the month, and sometimes they run kind of low when it gets down to the maybe, you know, maybe more about how pharmacies. What

1730
02:21:31.170 --> 02:21:32.130
Michael Flores: Most people do when

1731
02:21:33.450 --> 02:21:38.280
Dr Jameson: They get a certain amount per month. So sometimes it gets hurt at this point.

1732
02:21:40.650 --> 02:21:47.370
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, I look forward to working with you and we'll see you tomorrow. If you have any questions problems you've taken the medicine.

1733
02:21:47.370 --> 02:21:47.940
Michael Flores: And

1734
02:21:47.970 --> 02:21:49.650
Dr Jameson: something's not going right.

1735
02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:51.390
Dr Jameson: You know, any, any problems just

1736
02:21:51.810 --> 02:22:01.140
Dr Jameson: Feel free to you know get into the virtual clinic I have other groups during the day tomorrow. So I i'm I'm at my desk and in the computer. So I should

1737
02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:02.910
Dr Jameson: Be able to answer questions or

1738
02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:03.750
Michael Flores: Okay.

1739
02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:07.020
Dr Jameson: No problem solve, if we if we have anything that comes up.

1740
02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:10.680
Michael Flores: Over. Okay.

1741
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:14.640
Dr Jameson: All right. Well, I hope. Tonight isn't too too terrible. I hope it's a

1742
02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:19.230
Dr Jameson: Medium, you know, not not tremendous I'm sure it will be uncomfortable.

1743
02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:22.710
Michael Flores: Yeah hopefully we can minimize that. Okay.

1744
02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:24.360
Michael Flores: All right, well, nice to meet you.

1745
02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:25.680
Dr Jameson: Likewise, take care.

1746
02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:28.890
Michael Flores: Thank you. You're already Uber. Hi.

1747
02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:35.580
Okay, Michael Flores

1748
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:43.740
Dr Jameson: Here for his initial history and physical

1749
02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:46.200
chief complaint.

1750
02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:57.150
Dr Jameson: I want to stop taking pills API. This 30 year old gentleman present today.

1751
02:22:58.170 --> 02:22:59.730
To requesting

1752
02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:04.830
Dr Jameson: Assistance with opioid

1753
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:07.650
Dr Jameson: Addiction period.

1754
02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:10.170
Dr Jameson: He's been taking

1755
02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:14.940
Dr Jameson: Norco and or Percocet.

1756
02:23:17.550 --> 02:23:28.200
Dr Jameson: Daily now for any number of years period currently taking between 25 and 30 tablets, a day of the 10 milligram strength.

1757
02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:37.140
Dr Jameson: started late high school kind of recreationally but quickly became a daily

1758
02:23:38.430 --> 02:23:50.640
Dr Jameson: Daily phenomenon for him. Period. He said, one prior treatment inpatient detox last summer left after a week because he was

1759
02:23:52.020 --> 02:24:05.700
Dr Jameson: Concerned about his girlfriend home by yourself or pregnant. He only stayed clean for a few days after he got home and sadly his brother died shortly thereafter, which

1760
02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:11.130
Dr Jameson: also contributed to his return to use

1761
02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:21.690
Dr Jameson: His he's no history of overdose no legal issues. Um, he has been working

1762
02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:33.330
Dr Jameson: But obviously spent significant amounts of money on this drug use his girlfriend is expecting another child.

1763
02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:38.970
As well. I think he said that belief.

1764
02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:46.530
Dr Jameson: Withdrawal symptoms include diarrhea upset stomach restlessness.

1765
02:24:47.910 --> 02:25:02.100
Dr Jameson: Chills and hot sweats insomnia generalized body pain and runny nose, he's currently just beginning to experience some mild upset stomach his last use was

1766
02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:04.920
This morning

1767
02:25:08.970 --> 02:25:10.980
Dr Jameson: I filled in with his medical history.

1768
02:25:18.210 --> 02:25:20.670
His height this five nine weight is one, Ed.

1769
02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:31.290
Dr Jameson: physical, spiritual, mental status is normal assessment opioid use disorder severe

1770
02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:33.600
Plan.

1771
02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:41.850
I do, I do find that he seems to be an excellent candidate for medication assisted therapy.

1772
02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:57.600
Dr Jameson: The financial burden of this amount of daily opioid often becomes insurmountable and can lead to conversion to more illicit

1773
02:25:59.130 --> 02:26:01.440
And dangerous forms.

1774
02:26:05.310 --> 02:26:13.620
Dr Jameson: So we, we will begin with buprenorphine Suboxone its last two tablets.

1775
02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:17.640
Dr Jameson: will attempt to twice daily dosing

1776
02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:24.840
But it's not unlikely that he may require higher doses, at least initially, based on the

1777
02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:33.720
daily dose of his current opioid use period I did run a cures report.

1778
02:26:36.750 --> 02:26:45.840
Dr Jameson: We discussed the structure of the program. The mechanism of action of the medication risks for precipitated withdraw withdraw.

1779
02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:52.500
He did not have any side effects when he used to have your texts previously.

1780
02:26:55.560 --> 02:27:03.120
Dr Jameson: He's going to start in the Tuesday 615 group due to his work schedule which is tomorrow.

1781
02:27:04.410 --> 02:27:07.650
Dr Jameson: And I sent a number six. No refill.

1782
02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:13.440
Dr Jameson: Then

1783
02:27:14.610 --> 02:27:16.020
Dr Jameson: He's going to have labs done

1784
02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:20.490
Dr Jameson: Will schedule an initial bio psychosocial evaluation.

1785
02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:24.780
I

1786
02:27:30.030 --> 02:27:31.710
Can't think of anything else to add,

1787
02:27:35.130 --> 02:27:37.320
So that's it for today.
