Dawn Abriel: Me.

32
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.250
Dawn Abriel: Will kind of tell me kind of what's been going on.

33
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.050
Tamara Pierce: Um,

34
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.680
Dawn Abriel: Well, I

35
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.550
Dawn Abriel: Settled here.

36
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.360
Tamara Pierce: Going back and forth on Suboxone and heroin.

37
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.890
Tamara Pierce: Just a matter of having it.

38
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.770
Tamara Pierce: And my appointments, you know, down in the south valley. They were extremely hard to get to. So I couldn't

39
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.240
Tamara Pierce: That was I've gone to rehab. That was one of the recommendations that you and your daughter had given me so I did go to rehab.

40
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:43.560
Tamara Pierce: And went to an inpatient rehab and then I went to a program afterwards and did a residential I lived in Santa Fe, and they're super sober apartment for three months and then came back to Burnham Leo and things just got bad again right away just

41
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.800
Tamara Pierce: This just because I didn't have a you know a program that I was working on. So,

42
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.590
Tamara Pierce: I think in this might be

43
00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.280
Tamara Pierce: Hopefully the the thing that I need to do because we can't do any meetings and unless you're doing them online and

44
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:11.070
Tamara Pierce: Yeah, yeah. So this is the best way I think this might be a good, a good way to do this, then I won't have to be

45
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.380
Tamara Pierce: getting in the car and going anywhere, cuz I don't have a car. Oh.

46
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.270

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.280
Dawn Abriel: Especially the first hundred and 20 days.

51
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:24.180
Dawn Abriel: They've got to have the support. They've got to have people whose job it is to be on your side, you've got to have something you can say, I want to use. I want to use, you know, terribly bad talk me down.

52
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:32.790

53
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.550
Dawn Abriel: Right, he doesn't understand addiction.

Dawn Abriel: All right. Okay.

213
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:44.850
Dawn Abriel: Okay, good. So let's right let's go over this stuff for the program.

214
00:17:46.470 --> 00:18:06.870
Dawn Abriel: You remember that we need a set of, like, please go to class and right now. You can't just walk in, you have to make an appointment and they'll tell you what their procedure is at the same thing. Have a national list. So you just tell them I'm with bright heart health, and I

215
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.820
Dawn Abriel: These are the orders.

216
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:16.530
Dawn Abriel: They don't have them, don't leave the lab called bright heart health and have them fax over an order.

217
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:25.320
Dawn Abriel: Okay, okay. And we do the urine drug screens once a month, make sure that bright heart health. Has your correct address

218
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:33.090
Dawn Abriel: And you'll get the envelope in the mail. Just make sure you do not open it until you're in front of the virtual clinic people

219
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.200
Dawn Abriel: So the

220
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:42.750
Dawn Abriel: Record meters will watch you open it up and then you'll go to the bathroom, come back and roll the cup in front of the camera.

221
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.900
Dawn Abriel: And that's how we do it. Now the docs in the therapists don't have to do it anymore.

222
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.040
Dawn Abriel: I'm going to

223
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.350
Dawn Abriel: Sending you some Narc can

224
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.700
Tamara Pierce: Okay, by

225
00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:07.050
Dawn Abriel: Law, I have to always send people are can, yeah. When you're in group. I'm sure you remember the routine there can't be any one in the room because you wouldn't want anyone accidentally recognizing you

226
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.910
Dawn Abriel: It would be awful if you recognize someone on your camera.

227
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:19.230
Dawn Abriel: Yeah. Did you already do an ace an adverse childhood experiences.

228
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.380
Dawn Abriel: To 10 question survey.

229
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.070
Tamara Pierce: I think so. To see about trauma.

230
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.780
Dawn Abriel: Right, yeah. If you've done it, then we've got it. But if you haven't

231
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.720
Dawn Abriel: Will ask you to do it again.

232
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.220
Dawn Abriel: Remember, every

233
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:39.780
Dawn Abriel: Week before group, you have to do a brief addiction monitor the BAM.

234
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:56.490
Dawn Abriel: Okay. And you can do that. An hour before a day before two days before doesn't matter. It's just that we read them all. We read every single patient every week because you can't talk about everything, while you're

235
00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.300
Dawn Abriel: Writing group. So this way, it gives us a chance of

236
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.580
Dawn Abriel: Paying attention to what

237
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.700
Dawn Abriel: Risks you're having

238
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:17.310
Dawn Abriel: Sure. I'm going to send you an email that has a lot of the important information on it, so be sure and keep the email. We need to decide what group you're going to be in

239
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.530
Dawn Abriel: You were with one of your before but she's vole so I've got to put you

240
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.950
Dawn Abriel: I could put you in our

241
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.860
Dawn Abriel: Our Wednesday at 130 if you wanted

242
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.230
Tamara Pierce: Okay, that's fine.

243
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.350
Dawn Abriel: So you weren't in the program long enough to start tapering down where you

244
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.820
Tamara Pierce: Know I was been

245
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:48.750
Dawn Abriel: Okay.

246
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.390
Tamara Pierce: And I am eager to do that as well.

247
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:52.710
Right.

248
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.910
Dawn Abriel: Here the caper eventually first stable.

249
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.700
Dawn Abriel: About how much hair. When were you doing today.

250
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:11.940
Tamara Pierce: I'm very much, maybe $10 whereas I mean it came right down. So that's why my sickness isn't as bad as it could be. So

251
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.100
Dawn Abriel: Ah, great. Okay.

252
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:14.940
Tamara Pierce: Yeah.

253
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.030
Dawn Abriel: Well, let's let's start you on one

254
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.460
Dawn Abriel: So today's

255
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.860
Dawn Abriel: Thursday.

256
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:42.780
Dawn Abriel: Oh, I don't know if I can pull this off with all that I have going on. We're putting a roof on our house, my brothers again from Washington State to help me do it. So it's cooking three meals a day, cleaning, going to the hardware store two, three times. It's really

257
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.510
Dawn Abriel: And I've been trying to still work so

258
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:54.120
Dawn Abriel: Like to meet with you like Saturday or Sunday.

259
00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:01.950
Dawn Abriel: Okay, let's say, let's do it this way. I'm going to give you eight milligrams

260
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:11.580
Dawn Abriel: And and you'll have my email. So if the eight milligrams isn't covering you the whole time.

261
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:19.830
Dawn Abriel: Let's meet on film. I'll email you and say let's get together and we'll figure out what's what you need.

262
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:24.330
Dawn Abriel: Okay, because I don't want to go a whole seven days.

263
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.650
Right.

264
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.420
Dawn Abriel: Yeah.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.760
Dawn Abriel: Don't hesitate to email me and I will make myself.

267
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.130
Dawn Abriel: Look in my email every day and

268
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.480
Tamara Pierce: He decides to take two a day. I think you're

269
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.770
Dawn Abriel: Right, there's

270
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.730
Tamara Pierce: A song.

271
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.890
Dawn Abriel: We just don't know at this point.

272
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:44.580
Dawn Abriel: What's

273
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.130
Tamara Pierce: What you read, read.

274
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.640
Dawn Abriel: And check in over a week and

275
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.280
Dawn Abriel: All right.

276
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:04.650
Dawn Abriel: And your group will be Wednesday. So that means your therapist will probably be a lady named Lisa

277
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:14.370
Dawn Abriel: Okay, Lisa Anderson. So you'll see on the email that I send you it will have her address

278
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:21.840
Dawn Abriel: Will do and Nelson to to design a treatment plan for you and to start the individual therapy.

279
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:32.160
Dawn Abriel: Therapy is a really personal. I mean, it's awful. When you get a bad haircut right

280
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.270
Tamara Pierce: No, no.

281
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.760
Dawn Abriel: Go get go find another

282
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:43.560
Dawn Abriel: hairdresser, but to stay with the therapist that you don't trust that you don't match.

283
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.830
Dawn Abriel: Okay, much worse. Don't let that happen.

284
00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:56.010
Dawn Abriel: You know, after four or five tries just tell the therapist. You know, I don't think this is working.

285
00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.920
Dawn Abriel: They don't take it personally if it happens to all of us, I mean,

286
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.110
Tamara Pierce: Not in the right feeling too.

287
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.290
Dawn Abriel: Right. Well, usually they do. Right.

288
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.400
Tamara Pierce: And right now.

289
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.380
Dawn Abriel: I have been to some therapists that I thought were

290
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.730
Dawn Abriel: Well, mostly, I think they're too soft, they let me get away with.

291
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.620
Tamara Pierce: Yeah.

292
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.810
Dawn Abriel: Three therapist because they let me get away with just telling them stories. I thought

293
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.860
Dawn Abriel: I'm not going to pay you $150 now.

294
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.200
Tamara Pierce: For my creativity.

295
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.120
Dawn Abriel: That's right. No, thank you. Alright, so I will send that

296
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.280
Dawn Abriel: Note to Lisa

297
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.240
Dawn Abriel: And if you're a match that be great.

298
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:52.650
Dawn Abriel: And I will order your medicine, just as soon as I can get upstairs and

299
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.940
Dawn Abriel: things even more interesting. Here I have clean people

300
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.140
Tamara Pierce: Oh, no.

301
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.600
Tamara Pierce: You are busy.

302
00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.100
Dawn Abriel: So I'm in the pool room, I'm in the greenhouse.

303
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.770
Dawn Abriel: Yeah, just to find a quiet and

304
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.330
Tamara Pierce: You're in Santa Fe. Right.

305
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.230
Tamara Pierce: Well, that's where

306
00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.830
Tamara Pierce: The inpatient Santa Fe recovery. I went to this.

307
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.150
Dawn Abriel: What was that like

308
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.100
Tamara Pierce: I thought it was great. I think the people running it a little bit.

309
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:32.370
Tamara Pierce: I mean I got kicked out because of some confusion between my counselors that I was given permission to spend the night after three months. This was my third month and I was given permission to spend the night in Bernal Leo.

310
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.950
Tamara Pierce: With my parents and

311
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:51.330
Tamara Pierce: Apparently, it wasn't okay with the director and they kicked me out. And to me, that was just really preposterous and I relapsed pretty quickly, because it was such a surprise, and I didn't have anywhere to go, except for back to my boyfriend and

312
00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:59.250
Tamara Pierce: Wow, not ready to be living with each other again and it was horrible. So other than that I really enjoyed it. I thought it was great.

313
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.260
Tamara Pierce: That was a shock.

314
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.960
Dawn Abriel: That's good. You know, you hear people say, I want that in writing.

315
00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.540
Tamara Pierce: Yeah, absolutely.

316
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:19.890
Dawn Abriel: And that reminds me. We're having kind of an issue. I've noticed with the pandemic. I'm, I'm telling all of my patients.

317
00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:31.920
Dawn Abriel: When you go to the pharmacy. So you're going to call and say, Is my script ready to pick up tell them I'm going to ask for them to be counted in front of me.

318
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:40.260
Dawn Abriel: Okay with them count in front of you. They don't care. It's a real bother it backs up the line.

319
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.390
Dawn Abriel: It's too important because I can't write for more

320
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.640
Tamara Pierce: It right when I drive away. That's it.

321
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.780
Dawn Abriel: No, it's worse than that, once you touch the bag.

322
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.450
Tamara Pierce: Oh my gosh. Wow.

323
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.260
Worse.

324
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:02.370
Dawn Abriel: So, okay, hold your hands and say my doc is a bitch. She's a horrible person.

325
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:03.810
Tamara Pierce: I can

326
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.150
Dawn Abriel: Make me she will yell at me if I don't have my medicine counted. But it's really

327
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.530
Tamara Pierce: Okay.

328
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.270
Dawn Abriel: But I don't mind taking the heat.

329
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.590
OK.

330
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:27.210
Dawn Abriel: OK, so we've got the lab, the prescription the urine drug screen group and you're going to, yeah. We'll see if you've already done the ACE exam.

331
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:36.720
Dawn Abriel: So you know that before every group and every individual appointment, you have to go to the virtual clinic.

332
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.090
Tamara Pierce: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

333
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.050
Tamara Pierce: Are you

Dawn Abriel: Right, right. They gave you the number. Yes.

336
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:58.380
Dawn Abriel: So we have a tighter hold now on people. We were getting dinged for not having not following up with people getting their urine drug screen. So we found this system where

337
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.390
Dawn Abriel: They don't give you the number for the group, unless you

338
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.610
Dawn Abriel: So you go yeah

339
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.870
Dawn Abriel: So that's really made it work better. Do you have any questions.

340
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.760
