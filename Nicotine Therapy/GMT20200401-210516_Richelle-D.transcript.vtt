39
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.720
Donita McClintic: Because the last time I think I

40
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.080
Richelle Direny: May well talk to you. I think his mom had died.

41
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.670
Donita McClintic: And his Grandpa, Grandpa passed away.

42
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.690
Donita McClintic: Yeah.

43
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.230
Donita McClintic: He just he wants to. He chose drugs over a marriage so

44
00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:00.690
Donita McClintic: Yeah, I am. I would have better myself and being around stuff is tempting. And I mean, not that he was doing all the time, but it was still enough to

45
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:10.110
Donita McClintic: Make i just i want to be better. I want to better myself. I don't want that lifestyle anymore. I want nowhere around it. And I thought, I

46
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:24.570
Donita McClintic: was stronger than what I really am. I guess. But I mean, I've done good I did, I did mess up once I done. I thought I was doing some speed, but it didn't even speed me up. So, only thing you've done was

47
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:35.400
Donita McClintic: Make me feel bad about doing any doing something, but I hadn't had medicine for three days because where where my I couldn't go to the lab to do my work.

48
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.800
Donita McClintic: With the doctor wanted me to do.

49
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:54.120
Donita McClintic: Because my ID is still expired, but where I can go get it done. But site I done my urine cup and so took three days to get my medicine. So I was feeling bad. So I thought, speed, my make me feel better. Well now, it didn't.

50
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.700
Donita McClintic: But when when

51
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.490
Donita McClintic: That was

52
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.470
Donita McClintic: Two weeks ago, three weeks ago. It's been a little while.

53
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.730
Richelle Direny: Is this the time when you were talking to Dr. Jamison and

54
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.800
Richelle Direny: Tom, are you were concerned about

55
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.200
Richelle Direny: How you were concerned about

56
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.690
Donita McClintic: The positive in your system.

57
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.670
Donita McClintic: Yes, uh huh.

58
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.670
Richelle Direny: Okay. And so what did you do

59
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.360
Donita McClintic: What did, yeah.

60
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.520
Richelle Direny: Is it that you something you got from him.

61
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:34.740
Donita McClintic: It's well I got it from one of his friends. But that's when I said it wasn't even it didn't really even do anything to me. I felt no different. It was weird.

62
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.300
Donita McClintic: So that's even more reason I'm not to even do anything, really. It's scary. It's hard to tell what it was.

63
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.740
Donita McClintic: So,

64
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.250
Richelle Direny: What's

65
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:52.200
Richelle Direny: Going on at the time because I know that we've spoken about, you know, like when you're feeling overwhelmed and I know we haven't met in a while.

66
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.120
Richelle Direny: So like what was going on. Yeah.

67
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.460
Donita McClintic: That was tempting for young

68
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.730
Donita McClintic: To use my husband.

69
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:09.540
Donita McClintic: My husband, he's mean and I'm tired of I'm trying to take care of me and myself and him. He doesn't do anything.

70
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:18.180
Donita McClintic: And then when things doesn't go his way he's. I mean, he's been violent before but I just don't want it to escalate to that.

71
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:28.830
Donita McClintic: I don't want it to go that far anymore, but it was just that. And I just, I hadn't had any medicine and I, yeah, I just, and it wasn't even

72
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:39.120
Donita McClintic: I mean, it wasn't even much, but it was enough to I feel horrible about it. I mean, I felt, and that's what it does to me. It made me feel even worse about myself.

73
00:06:39.600 --> 00:07:00.180
Donita McClintic: But I'm I've left them. I've been he's it's been like almost say month and a half since I left but I CD once since then. And I just, I'm done. He just what I told him he chose drugs over marriage and I am not doing it no more like I'm, I, I'm better than that.

74
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.090
Donita McClintic: And I mean, I feel so much better. It's like I feel like I'm a completely different person.

75
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.590
Donita McClintic: Now I feel

76
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.250
Donita McClintic: It'll be four years in May.

77
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.880
Okay.

78
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.810
Richelle Direny: And so when you

79
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.430
Richelle Direny: So it was it was a mutual agreement when you decided to to walk out.

80
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:38.700
Donita McClintic: Um, no. He doesn't he wants me to be with him, but I'm not. I'm not. No I'm not, like I said, he

81
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:47.490
Donita McClintic: Didn't have a place to live. Yeah, but I'm not. I have you talked to him. Like I blocked him out on my own Facebook Messenger I blocked him.

82
00:07:47.910 --> 00:08:03.600
Donita McClintic: And I don't. I mean, I don't care what he does, because he was threatening me with like, Well, I'm gonna go do slow is when he call it, which I assume would be heroin. I don't know what they call it now, but because I'm not messed with heroin since I overdosed. Four years ago, but

83
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:15.120
Donita McClintic: Yes, he's threatening me with that and I just told him you know your big boy. He's gonna be 46 tomorrow he can do whatever he wants to do, but you know it's cowardly way and he's not putting that on me.

84
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:26.280
Donita McClintic: If that's what he chooses to do, then you can do it. I'm not going to feel bad if he overdoses and dies. And honestly, I mean, I really wouldn't. It's not my that's his problem. That's not my problem.

85
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:34.560
Donita McClintic: But I mean, I think he was just saying it for me to come back or whatever. But it didn't work and I blocked him I blocked him on all my stuff.

86
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:51.360
Donita McClintic: Like I'm seriously done like, I'm done. Done. He went to prison was married a year and a half or something and he went to prison for assaulting a police officer and he was there for 18 months and I waited for him the whole time for this.

87
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.810
Donita McClintic: For nothing like I should have went on, then.

88
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:07.320
Donita McClintic: But I do I feel so much better. I'm a better like I'd get out and do things I've been out going out and doing stuff I have like like I got more energy. I don't know. It's just different.

89
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:09.510
Donita McClintic: Like

90
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.980
Richelle Direny: I just saw that you're

91
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.880
Richelle Direny: Feeling that way.

92
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:24.540
Richelle Direny: That's good that you're calling in, what, what's helping you to maintain that confidence that you're having now that you know you're, you're pretty serious about maintaining your sobriety at this point.

93
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:38.370
Donita McClintic: Yeah, because I'm I'm back at my parents house. My, my parents being out here with my mom and dad because remember I told you, like I felt ashamed of myself and didn't really talk about things with some because of how

94
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.800
Donita McClintic: You know when I overdose to whatever like really never talked about it. Well, I

95
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.740
Donita McClintic: Have talked to so and you kept it a secret for a

96
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.370
Donita McClintic: Long time

97
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:56.580
Donita McClintic: Yeah, yeah. Well, we talked about it and I feel so much better. And like their support me. I mean, they're my dad.

98
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:07.320
Donita McClintic: Because before he would like you know say things in it would make me cry. He's like, tried to tough love stuff, but he's not been like that at all. Like they just been

99
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:15.930
Donita McClintic: Supportive like I'm in their car right now so I can do my group like or my my counseling with you because before they absolutely would not let me even

100
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.380
Donita McClintic: My mom would have brought me. You know what I mean.

101
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.630
Donita McClintic: Like their trusted me and

102
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.330
Richelle Direny: So what. So what's the what's what.

103
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.810
Donita McClintic: So because I'm trying to better myself.

104
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.190
Donita McClintic: Hmm. Because, because I'm trying to better myself and they can see it.

105
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.470
Donita McClintic: Okay, I'm just not blowing smoke up there, but this time.

106
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.020
Richelle Direny: Okay, that's good.

107
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.550
Yeah.

108
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.520
Richelle Direny: So then that's what it's all did. They Are they supportive of us being separated

109
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.400
Donita McClintic: Yes, yes. Yeah, they don't they don't want me around them at all.

110
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:02.580
Richelle Direny: I mean, but then, you know, and so this is where while you know everything that you're doing and you're you're choosing you

111
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.220
Richelle Direny: overdrawn your life.

112
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.690
Donita McClintic: You're choosing

113
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.500
Richelle Direny: You know, just wanting to live life in love life.

114
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.360
Donita McClintic: I'm right.

115
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:21.180
Richelle Direny: And now coming out and sharing about, you know, the overdose and just all of that and just being honest, not just with everybody else around you, but first being honest with yourself.

116
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.650
Donita McClintic: Right.

117
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:30.750
Richelle Direny: You know, that's good. But this is the thing, you know, right now it's somewhat of a honeymoon phase that you're in, in terms of, you know, being away from him.

118
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.760
Richelle Direny: But then after a while.

119
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.140
Richelle Direny: You're going to start missing him.

120
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.000
Donita McClintic: And you're going to

121
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.460
Richelle Direny: Say you have to prepare final moments and having that extra support and

122
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.780
Donita McClintic: And, you know, having people

123
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.460

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.800
Donita McClintic: You know, life is just one way.

139
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.330
Richelle Direny: But then eventually

140
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.110

Donita McClintic: About because right

144
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:53.040
Richelle Direny: You know, it's just remembering what was the reason why you left in the first place.

145
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.150
Richelle Direny: Why, remind yourself why you chose you.

146
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.600
Richelle Direny: What is it about this life and everything, why you chose it. And I want you to hold on to that for their

147
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:15.540
Donita McClintic: Dear life. Right, right. Okay, I got it. Yeah. Like, I mean, there's like I was basically homeless like being down there with them and I'm not

Donita McClintic: I'm yeah I'm 42 years old. I've had it all once before and I you know my addiction. I lost it all and I'm ready to I want to be a part of society. Again, like I've not been a part of society for four years and I'm ready.

149
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.450
Richelle Direny: How long have you been part of society now.

150
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:40.290
Donita McClintic: For like almost a month, which I won't even go fine.

151
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.070
Richelle Direny: Okay, so how do you feel being part of society.

152
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:52.680
Donita McClintic: Good. I do. I don't have that, like my anxieties, not like it was like I can go in the public in the daytime.

153
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.740
Donita McClintic: Which before I didn't do that. I would wait till like two, three in the morning to go to Walmart, but I've been getting out and

154
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:09.990
Donita McClintic: Yeah, so it makes me feel better. Like I feel like I accomplished something even though it's like something small. I accomplished it and it makes me feel good you feel good. Yeah.

155
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.730
Richelle Direny: Yes, I do.

156
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.670
Donita McClintic: Um, what

157
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.720
Richelle Direny: Do you like the feeling you get when you, when those feelings of being now.

158
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:20.460
Donita McClintic: Yes.

159
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.500
Richelle Direny: Yeah yeah out in the day.

160
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:32.580
Donita McClintic: It's been. I mean, I went out today. And I mean, I like it like it's kind of like when I went to when I had a job, you know, waiting.

161
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:44.580
Donita McClintic: On because I ran it, I run some errands for my mom earlier today and it's coming home. And, you know, bringing everything in made me feel like I just got back from work, like it was a good feeling like I feel like I

162
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.550
Donita McClintic: Contributed to, you know what I mean, like, that's how it made me feel

163
00:14:51.630 --> 00:15:00.660
Donita McClintic: Yeah, and it made me feel good. I like it. Even something as small as me helping my mom take out her dogs. She has great Danes and if you fungus and a dragger

164
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:22.950
Donita McClintic: Like I hope to do that. And that makes me feel good about myself because I actually got up and done something instead of just sit there and do nothing. Yeah. So I like it. I like it. And I'm not, I'm not giving it back up. I don't plan on giving them back up. Yeah, that's why.

165
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.240
Donita McClintic: I think that's the thing.

166
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:33.030
Richelle Direny: And the reason why I want you to think about all of that it's thinking about for every even, like you said, even though it's small, just think about for every little thing that you did.

167
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:39.600
Richelle Direny: That you not just contributed to someone else or to help someone else or whatever it is that you do and your foot smelling the

168
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.290
Richelle Direny: Fresh air, all of this because I know one of the things was being it

169
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.050
Donita McClintic: So now that yeah all of this and you're seeing

170
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.780
Richelle Direny: Oh wow, I look, I really like this. I really like. I mean, the world has his troubles. Don't get me wrong. And it's always going

171
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.730
Donita McClintic: To have right and it's always

172
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.990
Richelle Direny: stressors and it's temptations and all of that, like, you're never going to be rid of that.

173
00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.580
Richelle Direny: Like, you know, it's just the right

174
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:01.530
Donita McClintic: Route

175
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.860
Richelle Direny: For what you can enjoy. It's just

176
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:05.760
Donita McClintic: If you try

177
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:15.060
Richelle Direny: I want you to just keep that feeling like every little thing that you do and just what draw joy. It brought you and remember that.

178
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:20.580
Richelle Direny: And that's thinking that you might end is that you said you're going to try not

179
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.290
Richelle Direny: To give it up.

180
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.780
Richelle Direny: It's not to say I'm not gonna give it up.

181
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.190
Donita McClintic: Because right

182
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.260
Richelle Direny: You know, you may not. But it's just, you're going to try your deadline.

183
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.560
Richelle Direny: Because the more you perfect it

184
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.620
Donita McClintic: Yeah yeah

185
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:46.470
Richelle Direny: So, I mean, that's good. And so those are the little things. It's kind of like jotting it down. It's like keeping a little diary and I know I often

186
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.610
Donita McClintic: Suggest it

187
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:53.910
Richelle Direny: That's one is at it, it's a different thing, but it is to, you know, journal

188
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.770
Donita McClintic: What you said to me was

189
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.520
Richelle Direny: I do that.

190
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.730
Richelle Direny: But it's a great. Oh, yes. I remember you say you write down

191
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.170
Donita McClintic: Everything to help you remember

192
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.160
Donita McClintic: You do right now.

193
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.200
Donita McClintic: But

194
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:18.900
Richelle Direny: Things that that's a great starter in your journal is for four years, you weren't a part of society for four years you chuck because of your you chose and you are in this

195
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:32.970
Richelle Direny: This life of or the season of active addiction everything that you had everything that you enjoyed at the time you lost it simply because of you choosing this life.

196
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.920
Donita McClintic: That you enter right

197
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:43.950
Richelle Direny: And now you're realizing that this life. It seems fun at the time, but the reality is it really wasn't all that fun

198
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.870
Donita McClintic: No, no, it wasn't at all.

199
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.980
Richelle Direny: So then it's now that you're trying to regain

200
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:54.840
Richelle Direny: Your life.

201
00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:01.380
Richelle Direny: And so far, you like the feeling it comes with. It's just holding on to that.

202
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.480
Donita McClintic: Trouble will cry.

203
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.610
Richelle Direny: On to it's okay if it comes

204
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:20.070
Donita McClintic: It's fine. Right. Okay. That's those big potholes in the road. Remember, remember, you tell me about the potholes in the road, I remember to and I think that when something comes up.

205
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:35.820
Donita McClintic: Off things that, like I come back to our conversation, which was a while ago, but I i do I stop and I think that what would Rochelle say it's like, yeah, yeah, we're going to take out the pothole or take the car out in the pothole like stop and I think

206
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:49.260
Richelle Direny: You're going to find a way to go. Right. Or, you know, like, it's so you know like when you even with the analogy of the potholes. It's like, you can. There are some potholes that are small and there's some holes that are huge.

207
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:56.400
Richelle Direny: In the ones that are you, it's that sometimes you have no there's no way of getting around it, you have to

208
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.390
Donita McClintic: Like if you think about it.

209
00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.910
Richelle Direny: In the literal sense

210
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:07.290
Richelle Direny: A pothole in the road, sometimes there's no way for you to get the car around it. What are you going to do and then cause more damages.

211
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.160
Richelle Direny: Are you

212
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.550
Donita McClintic: Got it down. You got to

213
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:21.480
Richelle Direny: Take it, take it to a real good call and take your time to get through it because if I go if I speed through this. I'm causing more way more damages.

214
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.850
Donita McClintic: Then I really need to. So, yes.

215
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.450
Richelle Direny: Lonely. Take your yeah you and how to slowly take it.

216
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.900
Richelle Direny: Is you guys something you have to think, how do I get through this. Right.

217
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.350
Richelle Direny: And that's what, that's how do I really get through this.

218
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.850
Donita McClintic: How can I maneuver it. Yeah.

219
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.680
Richelle Direny: I'm a new version. And if I can't how

220
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.310
Donita McClintic: Can I get

221
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.000

222
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:55.080
Donita McClintic: Yeah, and that's how I've been doing my problems. Yeah, I mean that's how I've been trying to, you know, set my mind to like I stopped and I think about it before I just react. Yeah, so

223
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.240
Donita McClintic: Because that's how I've been doing it.

224
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:06.150
Richelle Direny: Like you said you went through a little patch. Think about the little patch that you went through when you were offered what you thought was speed.

225
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.030
Donita McClintic: But it didn't really see

226
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.500
Richelle Direny: How did you feel

227
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.160
Richelle Direny: In that

228
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.060
Richelle Direny: You did it.

229
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.370
Richelle Direny: The temptation.

230
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:14.700
Donita McClintic: Same

231
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.230
Richelle Direny: And you convince yourself that it's okay. You talked yourself into. It's okay. But then after right

232
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:29.850
Richelle Direny: You surrender to those feelings in those thoughts. How did you feel after and

233
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.950
Donita McClintic: During the past. Oh, yeah.

234
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.240
Richelle Direny: And after that.

235
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:46.140
Donita McClintic: How did you feel horrible. I felt horrible. I felt like a failure. Again, really. I mean, that's how it made me feel it makes me so mad at myself. Yeah, and I don't

236
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.820
Donita McClintic: I mean, I know that I have in order for me to stay

237
00:20:52.170 --> 00:21:05.520
Donita McClintic: Clean and what I have to, I don't have friends. I mean, I have family. I don't. I never really had friends. I have a big family. And we that's just who I associated with my family's who you know where I got on drugs that part of

238
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:13.680
Donita McClintic: My family, which I don't associate with anymore. So I know that in order for me to stay on the right path that I have to

239
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:21.570
Donita McClintic: Just let him go and worry about myself. Like, I know that. And that like

240
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:32.760
Donita McClintic: Because I thought I was strong enough, like with being with Mark if I was still to be down there and he goes and does stuff like there's sometimes, it didn't bother me at all. But there's other times where I was like, well,

241
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:43.410
Donita McClintic: I want to do that to, like, you know, if I wasn't feeling well or whatever he does speed. That's what Mark That's what my husband does. Um, but it just

242
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:59.370
Donita McClintic: I don't know, I just, I tried to, um, I don't have no reason to go back where he is. And I just want. I need to make new friends and real friends. I like knock someone because you know when you do drugs, everybody's friend.

243
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.230
Donita McClintic: Your best friend. Yeah. Yeah. And I learned that

244
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:05.790
Richelle Direny: Um,

245
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:15.090
Donita McClintic: Yeah, so I need to talk to him saying, well, now get now you can't really get out, you know, we can only go to the store if we need to. But

246
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:29.100
Donita McClintic: I just enjoy being a home. I mean, that's where I grew. This is where I grew up. I'm back in my old bedroom. You know, when I was a teenager. It's like, it's like how yeah and then I like, I love it. I do.

247
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:39.270
Richelle Direny: I love it. It's okay. I mean after like right now because you're away, it's different, like right now everything is different. It's kind of like you move into a new place when you first moved into the

248
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.860
Richelle Direny: New way. Or let's say you move back into your whole family place in which you what you're doing now.

249
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:49.890
Richelle Direny: It's different from the situation in the circumstances that you lived in or the temptation was real, they're

250
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.490
Richelle Direny: dragging you down right it's it feels good. It's like

251
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.510
Donita McClintic: Oh, yes.

252
00:22:54.570 --> 00:23:01.770
Richelle Direny: You know, I think about it best. Actually, you're in a job that is horrible. You hate it, you have you ate every minute of the job.

253
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.440
Richelle Direny: You get a new job. And they're like, oh,

254
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.180
Richelle Direny: It's so great.

255
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.100
Donita McClintic: Wonderful. I'm in heaven right

256
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.900
Richelle Direny: Do you think you're in heaven at the new job.

257
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.610
Donita McClintic: Because you like it it's it's not

258
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.550
Richelle Direny: Like it it's it's that you're no longer

259
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:17.970
Donita McClintic: In that

260
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.290
Richelle Direny: Old job.

261
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.180
Donita McClintic: Right, right.

262
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.250
Donita McClintic: That's why is it yes then

263
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:39.210
Richelle Direny: Eventually you're going to see the quirks that this has which is everything has its problems, its own set of problems that might not be the same intensity but right now it feels great. But you also have to prepare yourself and have like your toolbox, like I always say of

264
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:48.300
Richelle Direny: coping skills so little issues come up, then you will know how to address it, but you have to learn how to identify them.

265
00:23:48.690 --> 00:24:02.310
Richelle Direny: And knowing right it's like you have a flat head phillips head you have wrench. You have all these tools a flat head can't be used for everything a Phillips head can't be right. It has to fit the right problem.

266
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.560
Donita McClintic: And that's how you're cold right well

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:35.460
Richelle Direny: Right steps is if like I am hanging out with you and I'm drinking a glass of wine.

307
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.680
Donita McClintic: Because you

308
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:18.210
Richelle Direny: Know, learning how to tread waters, because for so many years, you had taught your mind and your body to get adjusted to this new normal.

309
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.070

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.880
Donita McClintic: One day, that's all I do. I

326
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:10.200
Donita McClintic: Yep. Yeah, that's how I that's how I've been living, it's one day at a time. Yeah. And I've also i mean

327
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:18.900
Donita McClintic: I've been helping like since I've been out here at my parents. I've also been helping out. He used to be an old landlord of mine back 1012 years ago.

328
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:33.540
Donita McClintic: It's probably been longer than that. But anyway, he's 82 and he doesn't have anybody to help him. So I've been helping them out, like, you know, taking dirty dishes, stuff like that, running errands for him also

329
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:49.650
Donita McClintic: And so i mean it's it's kind of like a job because he's paying me to do it like so much an hour when I help him. So that's also another thing that that is like going good, because I've not worked a job job since

330
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.800
Donita McClintic: 2007. It's been a while.

331
00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.710

332
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:05.940
Donita McClintic: I mean I babysat and stuff like that. But like actual company was 2017 I have for college degrees.

333
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:15.330
Donita McClintic: I gotta go. I'm supposed to go on April 7 to get my teeth done. So that's another thing that's also why I kind of stayed out of the public in

334
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:27.990
Donita McClintic: Whatever because of my mouth, but I go on supposed to April 7 but Ohio put the thing where you're supposed to stay at home until the 30th of April. So I don't know if they're still going to do that or not.

335
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:37.800
Richelle Direny: It goes on to the dental I know here in Florida. They like all the dentist, because like my dentist called me like I swear it 10 times to reschedule the appointment.

336
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.780
Richelle Direny: And I think now, they're not doing. Yeah.

337
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.130
Donita McClintic: Like sometime in May.

342
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:58.200
Richelle Direny: Dental stuff. If it's something that kind of puts a downer on you. I know when you get it done. It's going to give you some boost in your self esteem.

343
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:59.730
Donita McClintic: Yeah yeah

344
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.030
Richelle Direny: I know it will again, it's still about

345
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.660
Richelle Direny: You know, even though it will give you your boosting your self esteem is still working on you, you

346
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.260
Donita McClintic: And you can only do I think you can only

347
00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:17.910
Richelle Direny: Write you is doing that daily identifying those things.

348
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.800
Richelle Direny: That

349
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.790
Richelle Direny: overwhelms you

350
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:22.830
Donita McClintic: And

351
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.980
Richelle Direny: Then apply those things that overwhelm you, though.

352
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.850
You know,

353
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.260
Richelle Direny: And I think I want to make it a part of, like, your treatment plan because that's another

354
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.010
Richelle Direny: Thing that I wanted to

355
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.720
Donita McClintic: Discuss with you. It's kind of like

356
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.280
Richelle Direny: Your treatment plan. And then we're going to review.

357
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.090
Donita McClintic: It in a few months.

358
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.100
Richelle Direny: Just to kind of see what that is that

359
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:56.280
Richelle Direny: That we meet, you're going to self report on through each of our encounters when we meet it's identifying those emotional like those thoughts, um, that, you know, like one of the

360
00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.720
Donita McClintic: Some of the things that you struggle.

361
00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:57.840
Richelle Direny: With

362
00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.380
Donita McClintic: Whether it's

363
00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.790
Richelle Direny: You know, the thoughts or

364
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:04.050
Richelle Direny: What are some things that you struggle with for you that kind of puts you

365
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.560
Richelle Direny: In that state of mind of going kind of taking

366
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.870
Richelle Direny: Like a step back, like what are some things that you struggle with.

367
00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:16.950
Donita McClintic: Just my like why parents with my mouth and stuff that bothers me.

368
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:33.900
Donita McClintic: My where I don't have transportation and stuff like I don't like being a nuisance to people like asking. I don't like asking for help. Really with anything. I'm used to being the ones that help people. So for me to ask for help.

369
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.350
Donita McClintic: It's hard for me to do if I ask someone for help. It's because I really need it or I wouldn't

370
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.020
Donita McClintic: Do it. I'm

371
00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.510
Richelle Direny: So, and so this is what I am, because I know one of the things is

372
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:54.270
Richelle Direny: Your maybe identifying the those things that increases your social anxiety.

373
00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.570
Donita McClintic: Okay. I mean, because

374
00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.120
Richelle Direny: I'd like what you identify like your appearance.

375
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.180
Richelle Direny: You, you're afraid to really go out in public because you

376
00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.790
Richelle Direny: You're my you wonder what people are thinking about you and

377
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:16.290
Richelle Direny: saying about you. Right. So, and I know one of the reason why you isolated a lot is because you didn't want the world to look at you and judge you based on your past and people at the

378
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.970
Richelle Direny: Reality is they worried about you're looking at you, but your son.

379
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.080
Donita McClintic: I know

380
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.060
Richelle Direny: You're so self.

381
00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.080
Richelle Direny: conscious about it.

382
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.430
Donita McClintic: That, um,

383
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.920
Donita McClintic: Yeah, it makes you become

384
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:31.470
Richelle Direny: Very anxious in and it

385
00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.690
Richelle Direny: stops you from wanting to go out in the world.

386
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:35.580
Donita McClintic: So one of the goals is that, yeah.

387
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:41.970
Richelle Direny: I those things that increases your social anxiety that will affect your recovery, um,

388
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.870
Richelle Direny: So you're going to

389
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.480
Richelle Direny: We're going to report that in every time that we meet

390
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.450
Donita McClintic: Okay. All right.

391
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.650

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.260
Donita McClintic: Is big time because you said

407
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:45.090
Donita McClintic: that's bigger than your social anxiety, just because of like how, like I said before, I can't imagine getting a phone call, because I have children. I can't imagine getting a phone call.

408
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:55.710
Donita McClintic: Telling me that one of my kids has overdosed and isn't breathing so that that bothers me of what I what I've done to him by that like

409
00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:04.920
Donita McClintic: I can't imagine how it made them feel. And I just, I feel guilty. I feel guilty about it. Like, I mean, they know I'm not that same person today, but I still

410
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:22.680
Donita McClintic: I'm a worrier I have worried. My whole life about everything. I mean, things that is not in my control. I mean, I'm talking like the smallest silliest thing I worried to death. I always idolized that working myself to death. I probably really will do that. And I try

411
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:33.210
Donita McClintic: To let things go and not, you know, like for instance the weather. Okay, I worry if it's storming we're going to have a tornado.

412
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:50.940
Donita McClintic: I mean, it's just like small things that, you know, chances are, where I'm at. We probably won't. But, I mean, there's a chance we could, and I just worry about stuff like that. So where I overdosed and stuff. I just I just worry about my parents.

413
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.880
Donita McClintic: And I mean, since I've been out here, our relationship has gotten better.

414
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:10.080
Donita McClintic: Because before, really. I wasn't hardly even talking to them because I was ashamed of my side didn't know what to say to them, or if they're judging me or you know not judging me. But if they

415
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:26.790
Donita McClintic: You know, felt different about me since that happened, but I talked to them about it. So when I first came out here and it, uh, you know, my mom. They just, I mean they don't hate me, which, you know, a part of me thought maybe they did.

416
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.630
Donita McClintic: But I'm not hate me. But you know what I mean. Um,

417
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:39.150
Donita McClintic: But I did talk to him about it, which was hard to do, but I done it. We had I did talk to him and I cried, and it's

418
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:56.550
Donita McClintic: You know, and I said, well, I can't live in the past, you know, none of us can live in the past. So I just wanted to address it and see how they felt about it and you know get and then just leave it there, like you said, in our last meeting, so that's that's what

419
00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:57.930
Donita McClintic: I'm putting

420
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:08.430
Richelle Direny: Where it is it's working, you want to work on improving the relationship with your parents and how you're going to do that is that I'm going to recommend that we really try to keep to, you know, at least maybe bi weekly

421
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:15.180
Richelle Direny: Meeting for the next two months. And in that we will talk about how, like, what efforts have you made.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.940
Donita McClintic: To make baby steps in working

423
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.260

Donita McClintic: You're talking about 10

427
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.430
Richelle Direny: Years of inactive recovery and so

428
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.970

430
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.950

431
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.780

436
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.760
Richelle Direny: And they are feeling every

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.480
Richelle Direny: Turn every

438
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.530
Donita McClintic: Twice every dip.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.870
Donita McClintic: You're going to feel a sense of guilt.

563
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.700
Richelle Direny: They're going to remind you

564
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.960
Donita McClintic: Of the things that you've done.

565
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.270
Richelle Direny: And it's going to make you feel horrible.

566
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.280
Richelle Direny: Because like I reminded

567
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:29.760
Donita McClintic: My

568
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.030
Richelle Direny: Your reason why I got on this stupid, right in the

569
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.750
Donita McClintic: First place.

570
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.860
Donita McClintic: It's your fault.

571
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:38.370
Donita McClintic: That but

572
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:38.820
Donita McClintic: You know,

573
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:40.290
Richelle Direny: You're looking like

574
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.610
Richelle Direny: You had your choice, you

575
00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:42.390
Richelle Direny: Have to do it.

576
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:43.800
Donita McClintic: And that's kind of how

577
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.890
Donita McClintic: You see that back and forth conversation.

578
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.220
Richelle Direny: And that's and that's just kind of how

579
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:50.670
Donita McClintic: It is

580
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.020
Donita McClintic: So you have to

581
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.840
Donita McClintic: You know, work on

582
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.580
Richelle Direny: First yourself.

583
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.320
Donita McClintic: That's what you have to work on first.

584
00:43:59.100 --> 00:43:59.700
Richelle Direny: And how you

585
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:01.260
Donita McClintic: First and foremost,

586
00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.730
Richelle Direny: Is identify

587
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.430
Donita McClintic: Those things that make you

588
00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.830
Richelle Direny: feel overwhelmed that puts you in anguish.

589
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:08.700
Donita McClintic: That makes you

590
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.480
Richelle Direny: Feel like you know what, maybe going back on.

591
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:14.850
Donita McClintic: Any type of drugs.

592
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.410
Richelle Direny: Going to make me feel better.

593
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.480
Donita McClintic: Than I'm feeling right if

594
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:22.080
Donita McClintic: We have to first identify it in each of our sessions.

595
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.970
Richelle Direny: You learn to process all

596
00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:24.330
Donita McClintic: Of that

597
00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.760
Richelle Direny: Because we need to show

598
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:28.590
Donita McClintic: The knife, you need to sharpen it

599
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:29.730
Richelle Direny: Every so often that I have

600
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:30.870
Richelle Direny: No, stay sharp forever.

601
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:35.310
Donita McClintic: You gotta sharpen it right. It's the same way we are coping skills. We have to

602
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:35.940
Donita McClintic: Sharpen those

603
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.570
Donita McClintic: That toolbox and so

Richelle Direny: An individual or group.

607
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.570
Donita McClintic: You're going to work through

662
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:29.190
Donita McClintic: You moved out of your house and your husband, because if you feel like it wasn't a good support and he was continue to relax always think about that.

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:01.260
Tyler B: Okay.

670
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:03.360
Richelle Direny: Cold

671
00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:05.550
Tyler B: What's that

672
00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.290

673
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:13.410
Tyler B: Know, I've, I've got multiple sclerosis. So I have my good days and I have my bad days.

674
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.420
Tyler B: Seems

675
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:17.640
Tyler B: To be one of those rough phones.

676
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.420
Richelle Direny: Oh ok ok ok

677
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:29.190
Richelle Direny: Now you you come to the group. The first Tuesday, the first

678
00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:31.860
Richelle Direny: Tuesday of the month. Right.

679
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.480
Tyler B: Correct. Yep.

680
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.900
Richelle Direny: Okay, so I guess you'll be improved next week.

681
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.390
Richelle Direny: Yeah, okay.

682
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.820
Richelle Direny: Okay, so what's up.

683
00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:47.820
Richelle Direny: With everything in light of everything that's going on, you've been working from home.

684
00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:56.400
Tyler B: I'm actually I was laid off for this week. And then our jobs going kind of a week to week basis.

685
00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:02.730
Tyler B: On one they're going to bring us back. But it's looking like next week we'll probably start back

686
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:10.440
Richelle Direny: Oh, okay. Well, weren't you supposed to your living, um, you were in Kentucky, and then you move to Tennessee. Right.

687
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:14.520
Tyler B: No, I'm in. I'm actually in Michigan, but I was

688
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.460
Richelle Direny: But you're moving to where Tennessee.

689
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:28.860
Tyler B: Yep. I interviewed for that. And I haven't heard back and I think it's probably in light of everything that's happened so I hadn't heard back on that one yet.

690
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:36.120
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. So for right now, you're pretty much where you are and you're going to be there until you hear from them.

691
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.470
Richelle Direny: Yep, you were only going to move just because of the job right.

692
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.800
Tyler B: Correct. Yep. Okay. Okay.

693
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:44.730
So,

694
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.570
Tyler B: We'll see how it goes.

695
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:54.720
Richelle Direny: Okay, so how was the family with the whole idea that they may not necessarily move again.

696
00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:02.760
Tyler B: There. Okay, so I think it was kinda. Either way, you know, okay.

697
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.490
Richelle Direny: You have you have young children. Right.

698
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.810
Tyler B: Yeah. Yep.

699
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.630
Richelle Direny: And they're all working. They're all schooling from home.

700
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.990
Richelle Direny: Yep, how's that going so far.

701
00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:13.800
That

702
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.250
Tyler B: That's a challenge, that's for sure.

703
00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:29.160
Richelle Direny: It's a challenge for all of us, because some kids are some kids like some aspects of it. Other kids are just like, I'm ready to get out of the house.

704
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:30.660
Yeah.

705
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:36.780
Richelle Direny: So it's, it's, it's, I guess it's a given how old are your kids.

706
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.200
Tyler B: As six and 10

707
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:43.380
Tyler B: So,

708
00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:45.480
Tyler B: Yeah, Germans.

709
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:50.850
Richelle Direny: The, is it more challenging for it with the six year old.

710
00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:53.940
Tyler B: No, she's actually really

711
00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:56.370
Tyler B: She's on top of it.

712
00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.240
Tyler B: It's the older one that we

713
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.610
Tyler B: Struggle with a little bit

714
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:04.890
Okay.

715
00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.200
Tyler B: She's got

716
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.490
Tyler B: Add so it's hard to keep her on track.

717
00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.200
Tyler B: Okay, okay.

718
00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:24.450
Richelle Direny: Hey, listen. Here's a challenge for everyone. Everyone hold on me. I'm pulling up your

719
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:33.780
Tyler B: Have you noticed things picking up

720
00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:37.710
Tyler B: These been more busy now than you were before.

721
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.800
Richelle Direny: You know,

722
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.620
Richelle Direny: I would say

723
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:49.320
Richelle Direny: Yes, but not because of everybody being shut in

724
00:51:51.630 --> 00:52:00.330
Richelle Direny: It takes a whole life. I feel like I'm a marketer, because it takes a whole lot of prompting and reminding and all of this, you know, things of that nature.

725
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:03.270
Richelle Direny: I think a lot of it.

726
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:20.490
Richelle Direny: I would think that things will be picking up because of the fact that everyone is home. But then the reality of it is, it's that from A to B, you know, either your insurance is paying for you to do it or you're paying cash. So, you know, everyone is probably

727
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:31.080
Richelle Direny: Being a little bit more arm you know mindful of how much they spend because, you know, some people are losing their jobs completely

728
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.070
Tyler B: Right.

729
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:38.610
Richelle Direny: Know that some jobs. What do they call it furlough where you still keep your benefits for X amount of time.

730
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.930
Tyler B: Yo, yo.

731
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:47.370
Richelle Direny: Or just some jobs or just, you know, just laying them off because you know they say the smaller companies are they may not recover from this at all.

732
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.140
Tyler B: Yeah, that's crazy.

733
00:52:49.680 --> 00:53:07.170
Richelle Direny: So it's like a mixture of a little bit, you know, just the mixture. But we'll see. Cuz I thought hey you're home. So, you know, why not attend, but it's it i for me. I don't see an increase in volume because of this whole thing.

734
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.880
Richelle Direny: And you meet what Dr Fraga one someone right

735
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:15.780
Yep.

736
00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:19.800
Okay.

737
00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.280
Richelle Direny: I'm trying to I'm trying to look up your treatment plan to see

738
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.870
Richelle Direny: How often do you use to meet with God, when you met with her.

739
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:32.970
Tyler B: Once a month.

740
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.750
Tyler B: I believe

741
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:50.370
Oh yes, the treatment plan needs to be updated. Big time.

742
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:59.730
Tyler B: I don't think guys started with bright heart Intel

743
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.250
Tyler B: Oh, I bet it was October of last year.

744
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:12.420
Tyler B: But I've actually been on Suboxone now for almost 15 years. Yeah, six years.

745
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:20.190
Richelle Direny: Yes, I remember. And you said, like you're getting to that point. I remember when you were sharing your story. You're getting to that point where you kind of want to wean off because

746
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:29.340
Richelle Direny: For you, you said that you know it's going to the store and picking it up and everything that you got to go through with that. So you are at that point where

747
00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.390
Richelle Direny: You want to start weaning from it. You said right

748
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:39.210
Tyler B: Um, I, I think I'm comfortable with where I'm at, for the time being.

749
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.950
Tyler B: But eventually, I'd like to get there, that's for sure.

750
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:49.080
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay, how much do you take per day.

751
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.860
Tyler B: 324 milligrams

752
00:54:53.970 --> 00:55:00.750
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. And in, in conjunction with you said it's a mess, right.

753
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:01.590
Tyler B: Yep.

754
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:10.980
Richelle Direny: Okay, and it doesn't interfere well for 16 years or 1516 years, it doesn't interfere with the medications that you take for it.

755
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:12.570
Tyler B: No, it doesn't.

756
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.650
Richelle Direny: Okay, so that's a good thing. That's a good thing.

757
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.190
Tyler B: Let's see here.

758
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:29.610
Tyler B: I think if anything it on my rougher days does provide some relief.

759
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:40.950
Richelle Direny: OK, now it shows here that there was a point in the beginning of the year that you were you attending marriage counseling once a week.

760
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.720
Tyler B: Yes, yes.

761
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.640
Tyler B: Men kind of

762
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:53.490
Tyler B: With the way things have gone and how black lives gotten busy we've kind of gotten away from doing that.

763
00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.800
Richelle Direny: And you were waiting outside counselor.

764
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.440
Tyler B: Yes. Yep, but

765
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:02.130
Richelle Direny: Even with

766
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:10.830
Richelle Direny: Even with the weekly counseling at the time for whatever that it was going on in the relationship that brought about the word you both.

767
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.060
Richelle Direny: Said, You know what, we need to go to counseling.

768
00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:33.000
Richelle Direny: For the time that you were going to constantly up until life kind of gotten the best of both of your times and you kind of stopped going. Do you find that there has been an improvement in terms of the communication and just kind of how you guys have been going about the relationship

769
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:34.680
Tyler B: Yeah, I think so.

770
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.070
Tyler B: I, I do.

771
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:47.280
Tyler B: It seems like we disagreements are further and further apart. Um, I know you'll always have some so

772
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:59.520
Richelle Direny: But if there's more intentionality in hearing each other's points of view and before because and that's, I mean, you know, with relationships. It's all about the communication.

773
00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:01.410
Tyler B: Right, absolutely.

774
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:06.270
Richelle Direny: In the effectiveness of the Community communication and feeling heard

775
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:08.190
Tyler B: Yeah. Yep.

776
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:17.340
Richelle Direny: So, okay, now is it something that once things picks back up with with everything. Are you guys gonna go back

777
00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.720
Tyler B: As I'm pretty sure that that's the the plan.

778
00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:30.210
Tyler B: My wife's a nurse, so her schedule is just atrocious right now.

779
00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:34.830
Richelle Direny: I know how is it, how is it there in Michigan.

780
00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.370
Tyler B: It's rough, it's really, really rough here.

781
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:46.860
Tyler B: Well, I think we're fortunate to be in a more rural area, but over towards Detroit, it's it's scary.

782
00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:51.450
Richelle Direny: Okay, but where you are, where she's up. She's a nurse in the hospital.

783
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:52.170
Yep.

784
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:58.950
Tyler B: It's she's we're just starting to see it starts climb so

785
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:00.960
Tyler B: Anything.

786
00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.130
Richelle Direny: More hours.

787
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:06.750
Tyler B: Yeah, she has been she usually she's a nurse navigator

788
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:15.540
Tyler B: And she usually has a day shift no weekends, no holidays and now she's had to go in and start doing nights and things like that, in order to

789
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:17.550
Tyler B: provide relief.

790
00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:19.920
Richelle Direny: I think that's what they've been

791
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.700
Richelle Direny: Doing asking a lot of people coming out of retirement to go hell.

792
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.530
Tyler B: Yeah. Yep.

793
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.960
Richelle Direny: So,

794
00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:38.760
Richelle Direny: It is. And even if they're not helping within their own city or town because maybe it's not as bad they're having to go to different places to help

795
00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:48.750
Richelle Direny: Now, do you, it says, I see that there was one point you were working on

796
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.140
Richelle Direny: To make it to your doctor. Where you going to the doctor week how often were you going to the doctor. That was one of the goals that you were working on

797
00:58:59.160 --> 00:58:59.790
Tyler B: And

798
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.340
Tyler B: What did she put in there.

799
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:13.590
Richelle Direny: Well, this was back in November. It says, continue to make it to your doctor's appointment at some point. That was really hard for you to go

800
00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:14.100
Yeah.

801
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:21.960
Tyler B: I think there's so far. And in between. And I've got so many of them have my primary care.

802
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:35.460
Tyler B: And I think at that point I was weekly with God and it just got to be too much, but I, I have been making my appointments and things have been going well that way.

803
00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:49.440
Richelle Direny: I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you get it. Yeah. I mean, when it's all said and done, you know, when you have all of these, you have medical issues and all of that. You don't want to overwhelm yourself and

804
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:49.890
Tyler B: I mean,

805
00:59:50.790 --> 01:00:02.070
Richelle Direny: You know, if it wasn't you were meeting and I think like you're in a good place. Because if you've been, you know, on this maintenance program for so many years. I mean, checking in.

806
01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:12.570
Richelle Direny: What is it every other month or, you know, kind of checking in every three months. I think it's pretty it's pretty decent, but then I mean I think that will be pretty decent. I mean,

807
01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:28.110
Richelle Direny: Where are you now in terms of not just in your sobriety. Are your recovery aren't just in life in general with how you're coping you handle digger different stressors. Where are you, do you feel at this point.

808
01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.860
Tyler B: I think I've been able to do pretty well with it.

809
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.500
Tyler B: I have a stable family. I have a good support network.

810
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:45.210
Tyler B: I think I'm in a lot better place than I was 15 years ago, that's for sure.

811
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.950
Richelle Direny: And I'm in kind of one of the things that I had said to someone

812
01:00:54.870 --> 01:01:10.890
Richelle Direny: When you look at, and I don't remember if I kind of use this analogy in our in the group that you were in, but it's like if you've been in active addiction for 15 years

813
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:25.230
Richelle Direny: And now you have been in active recovery for the last two years, sometimes we feel okay I'm strong. I can, I can do this. And I can do that. And the reality is, no, you're not that strong because

814
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:32.340
Richelle Direny: 15 years of active addiction. Two years. It just means that you're still, you're still on the boat, my friend.

815
01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.510
Tyler B: Yeah.

816
01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.310
Richelle Direny: You're not ready to Love. Love.

817
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:40.500
Richelle Direny: Hey, I could go hang out with my friends while they don't know you can't, I can't, can't

818
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:53.910
Richelle Direny: And so that, in comparison to you know where you are now in terms of stability and, you know, being able to identify who will be there for you.

819
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.640
Richelle Direny: Who you know is

820
01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:02.490
Richelle Direny: Have a facade and don't really mean you well where are you with that.

821
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.760
Tyler B: I'm I'm doing well. I think

822
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:15.720
Tyler B: I've got outlets. I, I have people that I can reach out to

823
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:23.970
Tyler B: I do have other peers that I relate with that have had issues in the past.

824
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:33.930
Tyler B: Every now and again I do go to a meeting with one of one of my friends that I met when I first came here. Oh.

825
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:38.280
Tyler B: No.

826
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.990
Richelle Direny: No.

827
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:46.830
Tyler B: No, I've kind of backed off from doing anything was like I said every now and again him, and I'll attend the meeting.

828
01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.110
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay.

829
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.010
Tyler B: With soul group that we use to relate with

830
01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:00.960
Richelle Direny: So you said you've backed off, meaning that you were a sponsor. At one point, like helping people who are up on their recovery.

831
01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:02.280
Tyler B: Yes, yes.

832
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:10.110
Richelle Direny: Okay, what is it, was it becoming too overwhelming for you in trying to manage your own life and everything that you had going on.

833
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:21.270
Tyler B: Yep, okay with the family and I mean I've worked 5060 hours a week, and it did get to be too much.

834
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:36.690
Richelle Direny: And that's good I and I think just naturally. You know, I think all of us. We just need to get to that point where we identify those moments in our life where we have to say no, I can't.

835
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:49.500
Richelle Direny: Yeah, I come first, my family, you know, is there. I really that that's more important to me and I need to balance my time and not feel overwhelmed and stressed.

836
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:50.640
Tyler B: Yep.

837
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:58.320
Richelle Direny: You know, that is that is truly where I think a lot of us falter because we don't

838
01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.740
Richelle Direny: Know when to say no.

839
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:03.150
Tyler B: I agree.

840
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:04.170
Richelle Direny: Oh yeah, you

841
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:05.880
Richelle Direny: Want to help people.

842
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.370
Richelle Direny: Who is newly on that journey.

843
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:19.260
Richelle Direny: Or think or think that they have really arrived. You really want to be there to kind of tell them you know know let's take baby steps. Let's really understand each step.

844
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:22.710
Richelle Direny: As you you're you're on the journey.

845
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.020
Richelle Direny: Right, so

846
01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.790
Richelle Direny: Now help me to understand what is called pet Paxson

847
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.620
Tyler B: Yep, that is the

848
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.250
Tyler B: Medicine. I use for my multiple sclerosis and it's

849
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:49.440
Tyler B: How it's been explained to me is it's basically a synthetic cerebral spinal fluid.

850
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.920
Tyler B: So it's almost like somebody who's ALLERGIC TO BEES where they'll get stung.

851
01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.450
Tyler B: Time after time after time and it will eventually make it so

852
01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:03.480
Tyler B: You're no longer allergic to it.

853
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:13.020
Tyler B: Because that's because that's kind of what multiple sclerosis is is it's your body fighting the Milan that covers your nerves.

854
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.050
Richelle Direny: OK. OK.

855
01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:23.550
Richelle Direny: OK, now in arm. I mean, one of the things that I can put like in

856
01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:30.570
Richelle Direny: How do you feel about, you know, you're still checking in for groups. One someone

857
01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:45.150
Richelle Direny: And while I still of course will still like to get to know you, because it's, you know, from God to myself, and I don't know how long you were meeting with God for on a monthly basis. But, you know,

858
01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:55.470
Richelle Direny: Kind of reading everything here and what you've accomplished and you know you've been on this journey for so many years it's checking in probably every

859
01:05:56.550 --> 01:06:03.000
Richelle Direny: You know, let's go two months and then we'll see. And then we can increase it to every three months in there and you know we go from there.

860
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.200
Richelle Direny: You know, working on

861
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:22.260
Richelle Direny: Even like you, you know, your relationship issues and we all know no matter. I don't care if you're, you know, one of the things I love to do is talk to people like I have another job and I work with the senior population.

862
01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:27.720
Richelle Direny: A lot of these couples have been married for like 6070 years so

863
01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.130
Tyler B: That's crazy.

864
01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:32.160
Richelle Direny: How'd you do it.

865
01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.860
Tyler B: Yeah, absolutely.

866
01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.650
Richelle Direny: Like how did you do it because why if it's a real struggle. It's a real struggle to get there.

867
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:58.050
Richelle Direny: And you know, you always hear you know communication or compromise, you know, you always hear that it's never all let's go on like you know hundred watts per day. And let's do this. And it's all about the date nights, you never really hear that

868
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.520
Richelle Direny: Nah, you always hear its compromise.

869
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:03.960
Tyler B: Or you

870
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:13.380
Richelle Direny: It's about the communication and it's about like knowing how to pick your battles like it's not everything that you need to address. And it's not everything you need to

871
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:29.640
Richelle Direny: You know, get into. So that is definitely something that you know every whatever time. It's just checking in, just even for your own self care with your relationship, being a parent and the challenges that because those are two big things that that would test anybody's face.

872
01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:30.900
Tyler B: Oh, yeah.

873
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.430
Richelle Direny: And being a parent.

874
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:40.470
Richelle Direny: You know, I remember growing up in my parents used my mom used to always use these words. And when I was younger, I never, you know, I believe.

875
01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:43.860
Richelle Direny: I brought you in this world and I could take you out.

876
01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:49.110
Richelle Direny: Yeah, you got older, your life just a lot you can do that.

877
01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:52.110
Tyler B: Right.

878
01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:55.470
Richelle Direny: But then as you become a parent you learn

879
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.350
Richelle Direny: What those words meant like

880
01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.220
Richelle Direny: What do you to make you feel like you get overwhelmed.

881
01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:03.900
Tyler B: Right and

882
01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:07.980
Richelle Direny: Even just with relationships. They're just really overwhelming.

883
01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:18.750
Richelle Direny: So you don't having like those check ins, just to say, you know, in life, like what do you face. And how do you get through that and how is that sometimes challenging for you.

884
01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:30.000
Richelle Direny: And what are some skills or suggestions and recommendations to help you to press through these challenging times because like now it comes

885
01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:44.250
Richelle Direny: You know they are here, there's this little thing that was circulating where it was this. I don't know if you've seen the clip, but there was this this thing circulated. I think it even made the news about this guy he was being asked the question.

886
01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:51.330
Richelle Direny: With this whole Corona thing it says, What would you

887
01:08:52.410 --> 01:09:11.640
Richelle Direny: I think you had to say you had a choice to stay at home with either your wife to be locked in for X amount of time either with your wife on it. Be no a is with your wife or be in before the person can say what be was the guy also jumped to be the i don't i don't want to be locked in.

888
01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:13.410
Tyler B: You

889
01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:23.490
Richelle Direny: When you're because you're we're so used to being out of the house and being away from each other. Now we're forced to look at each other and

890
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:35.430
Richelle Direny: tolerate each other and now seeing everything and being a part of everything. And so, you know, those challenges as it comes up, you know, how do you get through that. How do you work through that.

891
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:49.260
Richelle Direny: So, you know, those are things that we can we can check in. But, um, let me ask you this for like, what are your self care routine that you're implementing

892
01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.000
Richelle Direny: In this time.

893
01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.500
Tyler B: I'm

894
01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.090
Tyler B: Staying busy. I think that that's my biggest

895
01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:06.810
Tyler B: You know, I've got a lot of projects that have put to the side for a long time, and it's really given me some time to actually go back after those projects.

896
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:08.190
Tyler B: So,

897
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:10.650
Tyler B: And I think

898
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.550
Richelle Direny: So work or just for your personal projects at

899
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.230
Tyler B: Just my home.

900
01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.540
Tyler B: So,

901
01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:24.930
Tyler B: I think it's this time off has actually been really good. But, um,

902
01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:29.190
Tyler B: I've found if I can keep myself busy.

903
01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.060
Tyler B: Both mentally mentally and physically that

904
01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:34.800
Tyler B: Keeps me

905
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.600
Tyler B: Moving forward.

906
01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:42.360
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, even in this time, especially with now how your

907
01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.660
Richelle Direny: Your underlining medical illness its

908
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:56.010
Richelle Direny: Issues are. It's like you are having a difficult time this week. And, you know, what are some of the limitations and how do you get through that.

909
01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:58.590
Tyler B: I think

910
01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:06.390
Tyler B: Listen, until your body has a lot to do with that your body. I'll tell you when you're overdoing it.

911
01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:18.090
Tyler B: That's kind of how I get through that when I need to when my body isn't tells me know I have to just sit down and relax and

912
01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:23.670
Tyler B: Even though I'm not so used to doing that.

913
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.250
Richelle Direny: Relaxing in that you're better

914
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.600
You're better no

915
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:33.630
Tyler B: I

916
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:49.650
Richelle Direny: Think so much of US society has taught us that we always have to be on the move. We have to be on the move. We have to work. We have to provide we have to do this. So, sitting down, it's just like, oh my god, the clock is ticking. It's going slow.

917
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.580
Yeah.

918
01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.230
Tyler B: So it's been nice though I've gotten to

919
01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:01.740
Tyler B: Spend time with the kids and listen to their thoughts and it's been good.

920
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.290
Richelle Direny: And are they interesting thoughts.

921
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:11.790
Tyler B: Yeah, they are. They've been they've always got something that will amaze me, you know,

922
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.260
Richelle Direny: Okay.

923
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.220
Tyler B: What about

924
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:20.760
Richelle Direny: Do you find. Are you becoming a little bit more creative. Because, are you guys under a stay at home order there.

925
01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:36.750
Tyler B: Yes, we are. Yeah, we have the. So one of the goals that I've had is to teach my daughter to cook basic items. So she's been we've been cooking the small things, you know, like

926
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.180
Tyler B: donuts or, you know, what did we do the other night.

927
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:45.900
Tyler B: Just basic waffles.

928
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:53.010
Tyler B: Eggs. That way, she can start learning the basics, so she can take care of herself, you know,

929
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:54.930
Richelle Direny: Your daughters, the oldest

930
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:56.160
Tyler B: Yeah. Yep.

931
01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:03.330
Richelle Direny: Okay, okay. And you have taken on that that task to teach her how to do something in the kitchen.

932
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:06.210
Tyler B: Yep, I liked. I liked your own cooking.

933
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:08.940
Tyler B: That's good, that's good.

934
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:09.840
That is good.

935
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.070
Richelle Direny: Lady she, you know, learning how to do that.

936
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:21.180
Richelle Direny: Always a good thing. So what about the little one, he doesn't, you have a son and a daughter. Right. Nope.

937
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.410
Tyler B: Both honors

938
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:26.130
Richelle Direny: Oh, so what about the little one. She doesn't want to be a part of that whole venture

939
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.500
Tyler B: No. Not yet. Not yeah

940
01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:29.760
Um,

941
01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:36.390
Tyler B: She's kind of a bookworm, she would rather have her nose on book than anything so

942
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:40.560
Richelle Direny: Okay, well, very interesting. That's, um,

943
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:41.700
Tyler B: Yeah.

944
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.810
Richelle Direny: That's nice. To complete opposite. So one will be a chef in the kitchen.

945
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:48.540
Tyler B: Uh huh.

946
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.580
Richelle Direny: The other one will be speaking to the chef in the kitchen and using all these big words and then

947
01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:55.560
Richelle Direny: She's looking like I have no clue what you're talking about.

948
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:56.640
Tyler B: Uh huh.

949
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.330
Richelle Direny: So that's a, that's a good thing.

950
01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:08.580
Richelle Direny: That's a good thing. So what about. Have you guys been using this platform to just stay in contact and communication with the family outside

951
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.710
Tyler B: Yeah, actually.

952
01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:20.910
Tyler B: That and those phone calls. Most of my side of the family actually lives in Utah, so

953
01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.480
Tyler B: Frequent phone calls to make sure they're okay and

954
01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:31.410
Tyler B: Um, I think right at the beginning of this to they had an earthquake out there so

955
01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:34.260
Tyler B: Kind of crazy times

956
01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:37.530
Richelle Direny: Oh, wow. Did they just have an earthquake in

957
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.210
Tyler B: in Salt Lake. Yep.

958
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:44.670
Richelle Direny: It was Utah. I did hear about it this morning. I didn't know. I thought it was another. It was a 6.5

959
01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:46.590
Tyler B: Or something like that.

960
01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:53.430
Richelle Direny: I can't hear you anymore.

961
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.400
Tyler B: It was a 5.6

962
01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.830
Tyler B: K was a 5.6

963
01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:00.660
Richelle Direny: It was a 5.6 earthquake.

964
01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:05.190
Tyler B: Yep, so it did, it did some damage to some of the buildings and such.

965
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.550
Richelle Direny: Wow, nowhere close to where your family is

966
01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:15.390
Tyler B: They all felt it. So within 30 miles of them probably

967
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:18.000
Richelle Direny: Wow.

968
01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:25.290
Richelle Direny: Wow. Listen, I've never really truly felt an earthquake and where I'm from. They, they did have him.

969
01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:33.780
Richelle Direny: But I never really felt it. I was always asleep during is what they would call them. They were tremors.

970
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.850
Uh huh. So

971
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:43.710
Richelle Direny: That's, that's it. Well, to go through this, the covert 19 an earthquake.

972
01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.940
Richelle Direny: That's, that's pretty intense.

973
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:52.560
Tyler B: Yeah, was so I think if it would have been any bigger would have been

974
01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.170
Tyler B: Once you get up into the sixes is where you get it gets scary. I think

975
01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.630
Richelle Direny: I have they ever had one there.

976
01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:02.700
Tyler B: Yeah, they do.

977
01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:13.980
Tyler B: I don't think they've ever had one 6.4 I think is the biggest one, they had, and it was in like 1992

978
01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:22.950
Tyler B: But most of the structures are fairly new there. So they all have earthquake proofing and things like that so

979
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:26.910
Richelle Direny: Oh, so that's so that's not something new to them.

980
01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:30.480
Richelle Direny: makes their. It's not something new to them.

981
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:35.160
Tyler B: Know it's it's in the mountains and you're right along a fault line so

982
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:39.990
Tyler B: Oh yeah, mostly get a lot of little ones.

983
01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:45.420
Richelle Direny: Wow, so you're very used to it when you were, you were, you were born and raised in Utah.

984
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.990
Tyler B: Yep.

985
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:48.210
Richelle Direny: Wow, so you're you're

986
01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.540
Tyler B: quite used to all of that. Yeah.

987
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:58.770
Richelle Direny: It's amazing how depending on what side of the world you live on what your, your, what seems like the norm.

988
01:16:58.890 --> 01:16:59.520
Tyler B: And to another.

989
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.080
Richelle Direny: Oh my gosh.

990
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:07.230
Richelle Direny: It's kind of like here in Florida, where we get

991
01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.120
Richelle Direny: Hurricanes.

992
01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:10.800
Tyler B: Yeah, that's scary.

993
01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:19.740
Richelle Direny: It is not as scary as people think it is not even that bad, like it was last year we were supposed to get the monstrosity of a hurricane.

994
01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:20.460
Tyler B: And

995
01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:27.090
Richelle Direny: We all locked down boarded up in everything, and the most we got was a little wind and rain.

996
01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.460
Tyler B: Hmm. And then that was it.

997
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:32.460
Richelle Direny: And we were all ready for it.

998
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:35.670
Tyler B: To be ready.

999
01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:38.430
Richelle Direny: For a few weeks and that wasn't nothing happened.

1000
01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:44.130
Richelle Direny: It's and that's where it stopped in the Bahamas and it just decided to die right and will harness

1001
01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:46.680
Richelle Direny: Yep, so it never heard of it.

1002
01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:47.940
Yeah.

1003
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:51.060
Richelle Direny: It did real damage is in the Bahamas.

1004
01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:57.990
Richelle Direny: It's sat on the Bahamas and you're talking about hundred and 50 miles an hour wind

1005
01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:18.810
Richelle Direny: It quite a lot in the Bahamas. But here it does. It's not even. It's not even that I actually don't mind them because, you know, kind of like, now you get to it's it's it's it's amazing because when it's a hurricane. We all kind of like peek through through a hole in the window to see it.

1006
01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:19.980
Tyler B: Right.

1007
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:22.560
Richelle Direny: What are you looking at wind and rain.

1008
01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:26.430
Richelle Direny: That's really all we're looking at this window.

1009
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.260
Richelle Direny: The window, unless the trees are blown

1010
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:33.330
Tyler B: Right, so

1011
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:37.710
Tyler B: So that's, that's how exciting life here is in Florida.

1012
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:44.910
Tyler B: So, oh, are you in the northern part or Southern part or Southern southern

1013
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:46.260
Richelle Direny: Southern part

1014
01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.650
Richelle Direny: Of Florida. I went to the end of the United States, a few years ago.

1015
01:18:54.630 --> 01:19:10.770
Richelle Direny: Which is the peak of Florida, the very, very tip. Well, yeah, where they which is Florida where they technically tell you that is the the end of the United States when you really look at the map and you look at the state of Florida and kind of how we hang off the map.

1016
01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:26.610
Richelle Direny: Yes, there's a seven mile bridge to the keys, which is a bridge that connects the island, the keys to the rest of the United States. Technically, and it's a seven mile bridge. It's like a chain of bridges that you

1017
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:36.690
Richelle Direny: Get to cross the ocean to get to the to the keys and so they tell you it's the southern most end of the United States when you go there. Have you ever been to the keys.

1018
01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:45.000
Tyler B: No, I haven't we that we do Florida quite a bit, but we haven't been down that far. Yes.

1019
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:57.990
Richelle Direny: They it's if you ever come back to Florida. That is definitely a trip and they tell you when you're there, there is a point that you span and they tell you from that point you're 90 miles from Cuba.

1020
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.930
Tyler B: Oh, that's crazy. Yeah.

1021
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:05.040
Richelle Direny: And they tell you, depending on where you stand. That's what they tell you I see nothing.

1022
01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.080
Tyler B: But they type be so were you saying

1023
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:11.790
Richelle Direny: Like you can see Cuba, because like you're 90 miles from Cuba.

1024
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:21.900
Richelle Direny: Huh, yeah. So, but it's it's a chain of like really long bridge that crosses the ocean and what's what's really neat as you're traveling

1025
01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:36.390
Richelle Direny: As you're traveling to the keys you you're traveling on the new bridge and you're looking at the old bridge that the slaves bills because when you go down to the keys and you take the little tours and they tell it all to you.

1026
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:41.280
Richelle Direny: You're riding along for the majority of the way the old bridge with the slaves.

1027
01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:57.660
Richelle Direny: The what the slave spilled back in whatever the 17 1800s, whatever. Were they that they built and how many people died them building these bridge and when you see these bridge. That's all you're thinking about like how in the world.

1028
01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:03.990
Richelle Direny: In the middle of the ocean. Did they really build these bridges going all the way out to the keys.

1029
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.250
Tyler B: So,

1030
01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:14.670
Richelle Direny: It's, it's very interesting. If you ever go back to Florida. That will be a nice trip or if you go on a cruise. Whenever were ever able to go back on a cruise.

1031
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:20.100
Richelle Direny: That will be a nice crews to go on.

1032
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:22.860
Richelle Direny: That stops in the keys.

1033
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:26.580
Richelle Direny: Yeah, that's a big tourist spot to go to the keys.

1034
01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:35.760
Richelle Direny: I'm especially if you're into water life. I'm not a big fan of water life. I tell you, this is the best hand that you'd ever get going to the keys.

1035
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:38.520
Tyler B: I bet.

1036
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:42.120
Richelle Direny: The best tan. The sun shines very differently now there.

1037
01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:46.950
Richelle Direny: So that is definitely something to to go

1038
01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:51.720
Richelle Direny: Um, yeah, so I will definitely recommend like maybe

1039
01:21:53.340 --> 01:22:03.180
Richelle Direny: What are we in April, May, maybe in June, we can check back in again in June, kind of, to see how everything is where you are.

1040
01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:06.600
Richelle Direny: How things is going with you.

1041
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.220
Richelle Direny: As we all try to survive the

1042
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.470
Richelle Direny: coven 19

1043
01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:14.700
Yeah.

1044
01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:22.920
Tyler B: I think it'll, it'll be good. Once, once we get past that we just got to get past that, as all

1045
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.910
Richelle Direny: Yes, yes, yes. We got to get there. So my speculations of

1046
01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:40.410
Richelle Direny: What it was that doctor's name foot foot foot cine or whatever his name is there was something I think it was on CNN or one of them saying that a next wave of it is going to come in the fall. And I was like, how he knows that.

1047
01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:41.850
Tyler B: Like I know

1048
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.700
Richelle Direny: The kind of you know next wave of it is coming

1049
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:52.500
Richelle Direny: So he had said that, but there's so many different things that's been said, but I think you know this too shall pass.

1050
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.380
Tyler B: Yeah, we just have to find a way to

1051
01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:01.740
Richelle Direny: Get through it. But you know, I hope that everything remains well with your wife.

1052
01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:05.700
Richelle Direny: Yeah, and she doesn't get exposed because

1053
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:09.900
Richelle Direny: That's some of the thing. Has anybody died there in Michigan.

1054
01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.360
Tyler B: Yeah, we've had a lot

1055
01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.910
Tyler B: I think we're over 200

1056
01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:16.590
Richelle Direny: That died.

1057
01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:17.460
Tyler B: Mm hmm.

1058
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:19.410
Richelle Direny: Wow. Wow.

Tyler B: Yeah, they say.

1060
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:22.800
Tyler B: Detroit, one of the worst.

1061
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:26.160
Tyler B: Worst of the bigger cities so far.

1062
01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.720
Tyler B: But I think it's because there's a lot of poverty there.

1063
01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:36.780
Richelle Direny: Oh wow, that's very interesting.

1064
01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.010
Tyler B: Huh.

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:46.320
