00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I just wanted to know if

13
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the last time we left it was like, Fine, you know. You don't need me then.

14
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:22.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't appreciate my work. So I didn't know if it's one back and you are going into work because I think you're benefiting from the income to and because I don't want, right, because then I lost you lost john here with the phone. I'm like, wait a minute, wait, he's gotta have that phone.

19
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you lost your phone for a minute. So how'd that happen. You're so stable.

20
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.530
Jay: Well, because see, it's on a payment plan with my mom.

21
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.820
Jay: She had forgot to pay it, I guess. I don't know.

22
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.580
Jay: I didn't know when it was doing. They shut it off at the end of the month. I figured it would have been that because I was getting alerts on my phone, but I didn't think that it would shut off like that.

23
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, no.

24
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So you gotta pay attention to the alerts.

25
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.120
Jay: Well, yeah, and I need to get a debit card. Yeah.

26
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.320
Jay: Because everything's closed so I couldn't make a cash payment.

27
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm just in case.

28
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's just see how it would feel for you to just, just turn your attention to just this part what you and I are doing. Can we do that together.

29
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.740
Yeah.

Gwenevere Abriel: coco, coco

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't know if it's handy. Go for it. If not, we'll live

34
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.990
Jay: Yeah, bring it

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's do this one.

38
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So you have

39
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Me see if the timings right because you're, are you in a like

40
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Not really angry. Not really much you're just kind of like you kind of like chill like even keeled right now.

41
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.620
Jay: Yeah.

42
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.520
Yeah.

43
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Just might be good timing.

44
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.850
Jay: On the fire. I don't know if you can see my black eye.

45
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well yeah, I was looking at it and I'm and and so that that. How did that come about.

46
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.240
Jay: Oh my girlfriend ex boyfriend ran up on me and also

47
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess he wants her back.

48
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.880
Jay: Yeah.

49
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, it's the end of my day. I start getting really sarcastic so

50
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: And so, is that worth kind of getting into talking a little bit about how, like is there a part that you played in provoking it or you just kind of like you just got sucker punch. SHE WAS STANDING THERE and you DIDN'T provoke it and you have nothing to do with it.

51
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.410
Jay: Yeah, I didn't, I didn't expect it. Okay.

52
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.450
And girlfriend.

53
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You aware that she said, ah, Jay, does this for me. You didn't do this for me, like what she provoking it

54
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.680
Jay: No, no, we have both just got out in. It was crazy, because I just seen him jump out of the backseat of another vehicle like parking spaces down

55
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Uh huh.

56
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:16.020
Jay: And then he came and got close to me and the funny part is is swing at me and Mr pick them up and slammed him on the ground, but I trip. Whenever I was getting up over the step.

57
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But, but she helped me out.

58
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.900
Jay: Why does it happen so much violence. I mean, dang. Let it go like

59
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.480
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the deal between those two.

60
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.250
Jay: I didn't even throw a punch.

61
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Why would he be so violent

62
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.790
Jay: So people are

63
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Also some nobody jumped me like that.

64
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: I got plenty of axes. They don't do that.

65
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.350
Jay: Why would you want it.

66
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know. That's a lot of violence. Yeah, but it's normal for you.

67
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.100
Jay: Crazy, huh, uh huh.

68
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But I'm freaking out.

69
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.330
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not okay. I don't want my client getting hit

70
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: So what's so I tempted to start talking about about that relationship. But I'm going to just do the pin that for a minute pen.

71
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.590
Gwenevere Abriel: This other idea. I will just kind of, hmm, keep an eye on that back burner.

72
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

73
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.980
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to develop an anchor room with you.

74
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:47.190
Gwenevere Abriel: This is member of the metaphor stuff. This one's really this is a long one. This one could take days. That's how big this one is you just that was for kittens. The distancing metaphor was figure nurturing fair

75
00:06:48.900 --> 00:07:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Baby school stuff, this one, this one could take days. Okay, but you've got it. You've got that creative side and there's there's just enough curiosity about this. I think that it will be just fine. I'm exaggerating. We could be done today.

76
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: It all depends on you. In other words, I just like to say up front. There's no wrong way for you to do it no possible way that you could do. You can get up and walk off the screen. I mean, that would get in the way of us accomplishing this task from now.

77
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel like I think what's important is that you be conscious of

78
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:38.820
Gwenevere Abriel: The. You don't need to censor that you can rely on that, my next question. My next question. My next question will guide the next step. All you have to do is pay attention.

79
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:52.380
Gwenevere Abriel: To what spontaneously comes up for you. It can be physical could be physical, ooh out oh my shoulder hurts out that might come up or foot. I feel nauseous or

80
00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I crying. I feel sad and so we'll say it because I can't read your mind. So I'm going to need you to tell me, and I don't get to see much of my clients bodies through this Telehealth business. So you're going to have to tell me what's up with your feet.

81
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:13.800
Gwenevere Abriel: If the reddit tech tech happened down there. I will know you have to tell me, are you pop up all your hand might start, start moving and I won't see it. Let's say I like that. I can see a little bit. I can see a little bit of your hands.

82
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: That's more than I usually get from most of my glands.

83
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So I like that.

84
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:37.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But my point is to say when I say this question, J. What's coming up for you. What are you noticing. I mean, the whole Mandela, all of you emotion thought belief physical feeling I'm interested in all of it. Okay, there's no wrong way to answer me.

85
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Except if it well well

86
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Even not saying could be useful.

87
00:08:48.960 --> 00:09:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I think it would be more like when like fibbing would be a problem like that might get in the way of you being having this be a productive experience. Like, if you'll be asked me because you thought maybe maybe this lady wants to hear this. Yeah, you're going to be wrong.

88
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You'll be wrong, because I just want whatever just came up. That's the one I want that will help me do my detective work.

89
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

90
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:22.260
Gwenevere Abriel: All you gotta do is be true to you, you just tell me what's happening now and then just rely on my next question.

91
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: So a couple more more things about the second anchor room. It's not so there's going to be three times that I asked you to dip into memory. The rest of the time.

92
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not saying, Hey, Jay force this technique into a memory. Yeah, well. The room was red, it's got to be ready because that's what it was when I was 10

93
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:54.660
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, that's not what we're up to. I'm not trying to pull a memory out and jam it into this room. I'm not, you may end up doing that on your own, but that's your business. This I mine.

94
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:08.160
Gwenevere Abriel: But I will ask you three times will be three questions that I will ask that you dip into memory and I'ma tell you what they are. I won't tell you the last one that when I'm going to keep it interesting, but I'll tell you two of them. One of them is going to be

95
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: How old are you,

96
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Another one's going to be off of. Is there a nickname.

97
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then the third one. I'll wait until we're kind of in it.

98
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And that will be going back in time. The rest of them are just going to be you doing your thing. Okay, just letting my next question guide the next piece of it.

99
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: It's I've watched you before you haven't been lost in any of my questions you track everything right along just fine, so I'm not worried about it.

100
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:49.320
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want you to feel safe and good and if it does feel distressing. You can walk off the screen, obviously.

101
00:10:49.830 --> 00:11:02.670
Gwenevere Abriel: You can use those protective figures nurturing figures, kind of get grounded in that we can use the breath work. We can use a distancing metaphor, watching the cruise ship kind of sail away with whatever's coming on. Okay.

102
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Me tell you what the purpose of it is the anchor room or a resource room.

103
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Is your safe space.

104
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.320
Gwenevere Abriel: It will have everything that you need.

105
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:31.770
Gwenevere Abriel: And if we're joking around. We might say my happy place right might make a joke and do it like that. But ultimately, that's what it is. It's going to be imagery, where all of your needs are met in there.

106
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I wanted to let you know ahead of time. We're not heading towards something unpleasant. We're heading towards something that should bring a good positive feeling

107
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so let's start. Let's start with where you're at now. So Jay. When you think about something that you've tried to solve.

108
00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:06.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You've tried it your way. You've maybe you've tried psychology you've tried it through talking it through, or maybe through drugs and alcohol or maybe you've tried to change something about a behavior and belief about yourself.

109
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Simply put, where do you still feel kind of stuck.

110
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.210
Jay: Oh, I feel stuck in my relationships.

111
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: What about them. What about them.

112
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.630
Jay: What about relationships.

113
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:34.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What is stuck in the relationship. So let's get specific because I don't know. I don't know how to open a door for her. Now that I'm stuck in relationships. What do you mean

114
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.630
Jay: I just mean like like

115
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.490
Jay: We don't communicate. So I feel like

116
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.050
Jay: It's

117
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:53.310
Jay: pointless if you're not going to communicate with somebody. It's pointless to even be in a relationship because you don't know what the other person.

118
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, you got a good one. Jay, that's a really good one. So take that and let's see if we can kind of way. So would you say

119
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:16.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That you're feeling blocked around. Is it something you're doing something you don't understand about someone is you. Is it, you know, communications important and necessary but don't know how to do it, like, where are you stuck.

120
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So I can

121
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:23.310
Jay: I communicate my feelings just fine. Okay. She doesn't like to tell me shit.

122
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:33.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So now let's go to you, there's still something you're doing because she ain't here. I can talk to you, couples therapy that's a whole different kinds of day, but you're here, so I'm

123
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can say I when I

124
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: I see her. I'm wanting her to talk to me. Where are you struggling in the presence of someone not communicating what is it like for you. You want them to talk and communicate

125
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: They're not doing it. What is that like for you.

126
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.730
Jay: It's like torture. Oh.

127
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. That's the one.

128
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is where we go memory for just second just all remember I said, there'll be aged, they'll be nickname, and then they'll be this other one. We're just going to go super quick ready

129
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Feel that torture, I'm

130
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: knowing what's needed can't get them to do it. How old is that once the earliest age kind of regressing back and saying, I know what's needed and they're not giving it to me.

131

Gwenevere Abriel: Notice anything else.

205
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's pay attention now to we were using our eyes to be in this space noticing what you are seeing for a moment. I want you to picture.

206
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Where you are in that room.

207
00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.670
Jay: You're on the couch.

208
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:07.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You're sitting on the couch. Okay. So let's imagine, and I would invite you to even get more into this imaginary sensory awareness.

209
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if you can close your eyes. Maybe you can turn even more into it. Just imagine how you're sitting on the couch.

210
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Your arms. Here are the spread out feet kicked up like how are you positioned on that couch.

211
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.330
Jay: Just kicking back. I don't know.

212
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:46.170
Gwenevere Abriel: I just imagine those hands, maybe are touching the couch. Can you picture that sure and is, is there a sense of temperature change as soon as those hands touch the couch. Is it warm or cooler. Can you picture anything there.

213
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.350
Jay: Yeah, I guess it's cooler.

214
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.490
Gwenevere Abriel: The couches cooler. Yeah, okay. Feels cooler.

215
00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And if you if you move your hand just even a little bit on that couch. What do you notice

216
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:08.280
Gwenevere Abriel: It's goofy. Right. I know, I know. Okay, so nothing comes up without a little giggle. So you don't notice anything

217
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What about how does it feel on your back on your seat bones on your legs. How do you describe that couch.

218
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.570
Jay: I don't know how to begin describing it coming up.

219
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.680
Gwenevere Abriel: What about me.

220
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.630
Jay: feels like you're sitting on a couch.

221
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, how much is a really uncomfortable and they're too firm. It's not just right.

222
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.370
Jay: If this is all imaginary then I'm assuming. Everything's right

223
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.650
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, some people

224
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

225
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Couch does this know so

226
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So those are my words.

227
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.270
Jay: It's comfortable. There we go.

228
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.160
All right.

229
00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's turn our attention to your feet.

230
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:06.150
Are they touching the carpet. Can you kind of get a sense of how that carpet feels on the feet.

231
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.050
Jay: I'm in my shoes. Oh, okay.

232
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Now turn your attention to the temperature of the room. Let that skin make contact with the air in there, you're kind of chillin kicking back on the couch. Your feet are in the shoes. What's the temperature in there.

233
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.160
Jay: 69 degrees. Huh.

234
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay 69. Exactly. And then, OK, now let's turn awareness to

235
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.570
Gwenevere Abriel: What you hear

236
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: In that space. What do you hear

Gwenevere Abriel: Where are the speakers. I'm heard about speakers.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.920
Jay: TV.

241
00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.920
Jay: Fine. It's good. I gotta surround sound.

242
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Man, Dave. That's it.

243
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.820
Jay: Wasn't a family, not have a bunch of guns in their two

244
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Guns. OK, so maybe we got but you want to put some guns in there, where would they be

245
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Or maybe it's up to you.

246
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.160
Jay: Have floor safe right behind the bar.

247
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.540

Jay: Will say Smith and Wesson.

252
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:52.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I probably mess up on something in there because I think well, so I've got

253
00:24:53.850 --> 00:25:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: A floor safe behind the bar 12 gauge i i know i don't have all the descriptions here. But then I have a 357 mag snub nose comma 357 but I didn't know what to do with that one. Smith and Wesson. So what do I do. It's just a 357 or take it out or add another descriptor to that.

254
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.530
Jay: Well, you could just leave it like that, fine.

255
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.910

Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm wondering what that misinformation was that he had to live by in order to survive.

431
00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to censor what's some of the things coming up for you.

432
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.590
Jay: I don't know, I guess I'm not getting the question.

433
00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay with it. This is only my failure, not yours. So just stay with it. And let's see if, let's see if

434
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:12.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Adult J.

435
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Because right now, we've got this younger version in this room, he's being taken care of. He's getting everything he needs. And in fact, he's a piece and he's comfortable

436
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And this older version this version this adult that is now looks around this room.

437
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The black bar.

438
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:45.360
Gwenevere Abriel: The safe the couch music plasma TV the deadbolt. The two doors of all of it. And he looks at this young man.

439
00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Is trying to do this the answer this question.

440
00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:54.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it possible that this adult version you, Jay.

441
00:41:55.230 --> 00:42:02.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know what this young man had to believe in order to survive. If you look at him from a distance, as if sort of

442
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:11.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Seeing him there out of it. What did he have to believe in order to just survive in his environment as a 13 year old.

443
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.480
Gwenevere Abriel: First thing that comes to mind.

444
00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:20.730
Jay: I'm alone.

445
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.040
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

446
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:26.070
Jay: Yeah.

447
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:27.000
Yeah.

448
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Sure.

449
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:43.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So it took it took the adult to see that this young boy couldn't see it.

450
00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay wasn't aware of it. But this adult can see it now.

451
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.110
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not the truth.

452
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not alone.

453
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:06.930
Gwenevere Abriel: But this young grid Jay had to believe that, in order to survive. He had to reconcile himself to it, make decisions based on it.

454
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this younger. Jay, and I know he's out of it right now he's

455
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm out.

456
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: As soon as I'm out.

457
00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And so it took this adult to see

458
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Can, can this younger self come to consciousness at all even waking and a little or no. Yeah. Okay. So I wonder what would happen if he started to wake up a little bit and here's this is another piece of it can younger version look adult j in the eye.

459
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.810
Jay: Yeah.

460
00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:00.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Does Younger Jay believe adult Jay when he says

461
00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:05.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Dude, you had to believe that you were alone.

462
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:07.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he believe the adult

463
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can look them in the eye, but he doesn't believe them.

464
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.280
No.

465
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:21.810
Jay: I didn't believe nobody back then.

466
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

467
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:31.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you're all alone.

468
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:36.810
Yeah.

469
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:39.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's

470
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take this information and let's be quite respectful of it.

471
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:46.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's be quite gentle

472
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:59.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's place this information very carefully into the container. Right. Remember this black and yellow cruise ship.

473
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.020
Jay: Nope.

474
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:12.930
Gwenevere Abriel: This this thing and you can always challenge it back if something else comes up and you want to do something else with it. He can just tell me which what's coming up for you, but just now. I was thinking, I wonder what would happen if we take

475
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: That on. Yeah.

476
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It feels good to stretch. You can only stand up. We've always got to take care of yourself. Absolutely. Stretch it out.

477
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.730
Jay: My back is killing me.

478
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Do what you need to do, Jay.

479
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:34.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You can always stand up. I mean, because look what we got here. We can stand up. Sometimes I gotta do a little yoga stretch so

480
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: We're going to take that we're going to put it in. Do some visualization. I know you're looking at me. But, see if you can get it. Can you picture what part of that ship is yellow.

481
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.120
Jay: The whole

482
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.320
Jay: The whole book is yellow.

483
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And where's the black

484
00:45:54.600 --> 00:46:00.630
Jay: The Black is like the windows. The doors, the rails. The yeah the completions

485
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:07.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I can see that. And you get a sense soon as you touch it when it's made of iron.

486
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:14.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel okay it's guarded by a bunch of guns.

487
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And

488
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't want people to see it said

489
00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.290
Jay: Yo, it's invisible. Yeah.

490
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So you know where it is. You know how to get this piece that you just did today. And can you picture. Can you picture. What kind of container. It's on a container on the ship or it's just everywhere. It's just an office sales away, can you can you picture it

491
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.660
Jay: Yeah.

492
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting some distance from it.

493
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.190
Jay: It could see putting a

494
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.320
Jay: Reason.

495
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I love it.

496
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:50.010
Putting it

497
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:51.510
Okay.

498
00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:02.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And as you see it moving further and further away. You know, I get to the freezer on this invisible sort of ship. No one can see it.

499
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you see it further away like barely even. It's like a little dot

500
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.800
Jay: You can watch it disappear.

501
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:31.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take some time here and and talk a little bit about what this experience was like for you remember no wrong way to do this. So what was this like for you. I'm imagining you haven't done this before. So what was the slight

502
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:35.010
Jay: Though I mean

503
00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.530
Jay: It kind of makes you

504
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.500
Jay: It kind of made me see.

505
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.940
Jay: Some of the things, maybe I was dealing with back in the day that I didn't know

506
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:48.660
Jay: How to handle and deal with that. I do now.

507
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.470
Jay: I kind of wish I would have taken advice from

508
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.840
Jay: People that are trying to give it to me.

509
00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.430
Jay: Okay.

510
00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:01.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that's a lot. You took a lot. You did that all by yourself, you know,

511
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You've got that you've got that analysis mind that mind that can pull me from different things that's really how it works very fast that mind of yours.

512
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:23.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you notice anything about your body at different points.

513
00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:29.370
Jay: Yeah, my back. I feel tension in the stuff that I didn't want to talk about

514
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Not amazing

515
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.520
It's crazy.

516
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:37.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It is

517
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:39.660
Jay: Stress

518
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.830
Jay: Stress picture, buddy. Oh my.

519
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Gosh. Does it ever

520
00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:53.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're about. So what I didn't hear you say most people say this, they say this was the weirdest thing. This was so weird.

521
00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:55.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Weird. Weird, right.

522
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.000
Middle

523
00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't say that right you wherever there was a little piece at least what I could see if you couldn't come up with it. You sat with a little bit, and if there wasn't there. Let's say there was

524
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: You know this without that we just went with it. Well, it's not there. Can you waited for the answer to come and you push back and said, I don't, I don't know if I'm doing, like, I don't know what you're asking. I don't understand the question.

525
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I try it again. And I came out it again. And then I had to come at it even further right and that only part because you told the truth.

526
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I see only way we're going to get there is every little

527
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:50.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Right along the way, where you go. Oh, wow. I can't come up with anything that's okay too. And I tell you no way to do this wrong.

528
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, well, fantastic. So we're about hmm

529
00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, it depends on where we go from here, but

530
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.050
Gwenevere Abriel: We're done with the three questions of in the past. Right.

531
00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:04.950
Jay: We're done with those

532
00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:13.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Through those. And there's one really big next step. I don't know how long. That'll take us but

533
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:21.030
Gwenevere Abriel: At this rate, it might just take one or two more discussions about it. So I think we're off to a great start with this.

534
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:25.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's schedule another time to meet

535
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:44.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing before happened. What did we have going on before I liked that. Oh, we were like meeting on lunch break or something because this is just, I gotta eat.

536
00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:53.370
Jay: Well, now, now since everything's closed I sleep in, in the mornings.

537
00:50:55.470 --> 00:51:00.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I see, okay, well, we weren't meeting. I thought we were meeting it like a lunch hour for a while anyway.

538
00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:03.210
Jay: Low seven we were at six.

539
00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:08.460

Gwenevere Abriel: I do. Um, I do, actually. How is that possible those get gobbled up right away. Is that a thing. I think I know what I was doing.

544
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.460
She is it

545
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.370
