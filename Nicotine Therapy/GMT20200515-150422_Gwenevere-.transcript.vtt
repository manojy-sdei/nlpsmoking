00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh my god.

2
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.960
Daniel Guerrero: Good morning.

3
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Happy Friday.

4
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's take a little look here.

5
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: So last time we spoke you

6
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Were in group, but you also mentioned that you had a little raise feeling a little bit more optimistic feeling a little bit more acknowledged by your employer is that continuing or has it kind of gone back to kind of feeling taken advantage of their

7
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.480
Daniel Guerrero: Or you don't know. Oh.

8
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.800
Daniel Guerrero: You know there for a while I was just kind of just feeling like I was just like,

9
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.110
Daniel Guerrero: A space filler, you know,

10
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.400
Daniel Guerrero: But like incurably

11
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:04.530
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know. I don't know. I can kind of caught when because I had, I had only I had totally only told one person that you know was looking for something different, you know, you know, looking for a little bit more money or

12
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.020
Daniel Guerrero: And I don't know, he you know that one person just told one person and they just kind of, you know, ignited. You know what I'm saying.

13
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.580
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, so

14
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:33.900
Daniel Guerrero: So now it's just like He seems like he like desk, in my opinion, mores and knows you know we're having all the sudden we're having the manager meeting, then you know you just kind of acknowledging, you know, the fact that, like, we're a little bit more. No other than the race, you know,

15
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.410
Daniel Guerrero: And so to me, and

16
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.080
Daniel Guerrero: It's hard. It's hard to

17
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.540
Daniel Guerrero: I just feel like there's just no for themselves, you know, like you better understand that I work in a family owned business line.

18
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.380
Daniel Guerrero: And this business is not like a franchise or or corporate office. They only

19
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.980
Daniel Guerrero: I just feel like that's as far as I'm ever going to go you know as as being a manager for them.

20
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.360
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know if I'm ever going like, I can't say. Well, we're retired here in 20 years, you know. Uh huh.

21
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I know I get the census isn't forever. But I mean, your ability to sort of enjoy it on a just on the short term, not feel sort of this pressure to have to relocate right away. I'm just kind of checking in on us doing

22
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.090
Daniel Guerrero: You know, you know, just really right now.

23
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.510
Daniel Guerrero: Best thing I got going, you know,

24
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.970
Daniel Guerrero: At the end at the end. At the end of the day, you know, my bills are paid you know I've been. I've been learning to manage

25
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.770
Daniel Guerrero: My money, a little bit better.

26
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.270
Daniel Guerrero: Actually have some money. So it's kind of helping

27
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.470
Okay.

28
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.130
Daniel Guerrero: We don't know enough about or anything like that, you know, I got like $12 in my bank account that's normal better than negative

29
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.170
Daniel Guerrero: $2 away.

30
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm, are you, do you have anything specific that you want to focus on today. Otherwise, I've kind of got an idea of how I'd like today to go. What are your thoughts.

31
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.270
Daniel Guerrero: Well, just, you know, just, you know, just were you able to visit this morning. You know, I really

32
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.030
Daniel Guerrero: You know, today is

33
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.880
Daniel Guerrero: No, I really don't have a whole lot of stressors going on, you know, I just been trying to

34
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.670
Daniel Guerrero: Let go, the petty shit, you know,

35
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:48.870
Daniel Guerrero: And just kind of kind of focus on the bigger picture. You know me, I'm just trying to share go, you know, like I was saying, the group, you know, just like you know each time that my kids be kids. You know I never had that opportunity.

36
00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:03.210
Daniel Guerrero: You know, just try not to be so focused on, you know, the petty shit, you know, I mean, don't give me some things to to annoy me somethings late night here to the show me but

37
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.080
Daniel Guerrero: That should go to, you know,

38
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.800
Daniel Guerrero: Live in the moment instead of

39
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.750
Daniel Guerrero: Always

40
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.300
Daniel Guerrero: Been. I don't want to be that

41
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.470
Daniel Guerrero: I'm already 40 I want to be, you know, and

42
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:29.940
Daniel Guerrero: Like I used to have a grandfather was will grumpy all the time is like super grumbling. He was like going to be around because he was on switching

43
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.520
Daniel Guerrero: Is my language. And so I just like, I don't want to be that person.

44
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.740
Daniel Guerrero: Reason why I was like

45
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:52.620
Daniel Guerrero: Whenever he was younger, I guess he always had always had something to say, you know, always complained about something, and as he got older, they're complaining just got worse and worse and worse. I don't want to be that person, you know,

46
00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.180
Daniel Guerrero: I don't want to be this. You know chill, relax. Do you know that I am I really am you know

47
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.140
Daniel Guerrero: So that's kind of why I'm just like, trying to leave thing.

48
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.970
Daniel Guerrero: I mean,

49
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:15.300
Daniel Guerrero: Don't get it twisted. Like I said, but for the most part I'm I'm trying to let go of the ad stuff just trying to focus on the bigger picture.

50
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's a healthy way to go about life.

51
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So it doesn't sound like you're presenting with anything specific today. So today is right about time where we review how you're progressing with your goals.

52
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:37.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me go over those with you one of your first ones that you have is I want more self control. I'd like to write a little statement.

53
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Of how you assess and let's try to keep it kind of brief and then we'll go on to the next one. So, today's the 15th of May. And when you think about I want more self control, what is your assessment of how you're doing.

54
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.680
Daniel Guerrero: I think I feel pretty good.

55
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.460
Daniel Guerrero: So far I'm doing okay.

56
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.830
Daniel Guerrero: I'm trying, I'm trying, more than I had before trying

57
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.460
Daniel Guerrero: To say

58
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:08.730
Alright.

59
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So we made a little statement about that. We've got a little time stamp on it here. And over the next month, we can continue to make improvements on that. So the next one is I want to get GED education.

60
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.100
Gwenevere Abriel: God bless you.

61
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.450
Daniel Guerrero: Sorry, I was trying to, you know, that was coming.

62
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:51.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Next one is I want to get a GED and education. So I made a little note on the sixth of May.

63
00:08:52.710 --> 00:09:09.240
Gwenevere Abriel: To climb reported intent to set an alarm for five minutes today to go through website or apps or study for the GT reported some progress, but then was busy at work. So don't don't go too quickly want you to just pay attention to.

64
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What it was like to hear that this is your goal.

65
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: And then to also pay attention to whether you are putting energy and investment in your education just track over the last month.

66
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your thoughts about yourself around having followed through with that or having not followed through with it.

67
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't know me an explanation. This is your goal, but just go inside and you assess what's your opinion of yourself. What are your thoughts about yourself around where you're at with this goal.

68
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.880
Daniel Guerrero: To mention know it's kind of like

69
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.690
Daniel Guerrero: A little embarrassed of myself because you know I haven't been putting the effort to that, you know,

70
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.320
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know what it is, you know, I just

71
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.680
Daniel Guerrero: I know I'm not too busy.

72
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:22.230
Daniel Guerrero: Trying to further my education or myself. I'm just

73
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:39.180
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm never say I don't have the time because I always had the time to go to work at home. I was just tired and I'm like silver TV or shower and go to band about one o'clock in the morning, so I i do have the time, which is just not making time means

74
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:45.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, before you continue beating yourself up because that definitely is not the direction that that will help you

75
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a look at how once a week, sometimes twice a week.

76
00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: You create an hour for therapy. There's just enough reward, whether it's oh I know I need to get my medication or

77
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe there's this sense of maybe you feel heard and understood in here or maybe it's all just amount medication that part doesn't matter that that's for you to know. But I want you to see.

78
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: That there's enough motivation, not only do you get in here on time you get in here like early and make sure You're checked in.

79
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:28.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You've already probably brush your teeth. Wash your face, you know you you got your drink right there, whether it's coffee or it's some water, whatever.

80
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You are doing a lot. Make sure you succeed, you're actually doing something in the mornings that's working for you. And if we replace what we're doing in here with an hour of you doing something that feels really, like, oh, I'm kicking ass.

81
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: You already have what it takes to do it. But there isn't quite the motivation. Am I right.

82
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:03.480
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, you know, that makes a lot of sense. Man, but at the same time. It's kind of like embarrassing because I just feel like now that you say that, and it's just like

83
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:14.700
Daniel Guerrero: What am I really here before, you know, where am I really here. Just, just to be like the medication or am I am I really am here for progress, you know, kind of makes me want to sit back and think about

84
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.730
Daniel Guerrero: Think about that. You know, like

85
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.080
Daniel Guerrero: I never thought about it like that, you know, I know.

86
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:22.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You know,

87
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to reinforce that you already have what it takes.

88
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Not for you to question. Yeah, I want to reinforce that.

89
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, sometimes someone on the outside, pointing out something that's right in front of us. It's like we're so close to it, we can't even see what it is. And so we can step back and say, wait a minute.

90
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: If I'm motivated to prevent withdrawal. If I'm motivated to get this

91
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.410
Gwenevere Abriel: This buprenorphine.

92
00:12:53.610 --> 00:13:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Wonder why I'm not motivated right to get an education I value it because I know you do. Right. It's all around you, with your children.

93
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:09.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh. Wonder what what we could put in place where we could get some short term reward and that's why

94
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I had one and just five minute little Sprint's not not even a half hour, not an hour. I was just going to see if we could put something in place where you can feel some success, meaning this feels good. I wanted to feel good feeling around GED or education for even five minutes.

95
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:36.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And we couldn't quite get there. Now let me just ask you, did it occur to you to do it even liked it across your mind at all.

96
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.600
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, I'm sorry, my phone's my phone started ringing. I didn't, I didn't

97
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know what I said, but I just wanted to know if if you thought about it.

98
00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: At any point during this last week about, you know what, I'm just going to log on line. I'm going to go online, or I'm going to make some calls

99
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you didn't even occur to you.

100
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

101
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.200
No.

102
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no.

103
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:26.820
Daniel Guerrero: I'm sorry, because my dad was yesterday was helping my daughter on her on her. They have Chromebooks. Right. And so that's how they're going to school.

104
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:36.750
Daniel Guerrero: I hate God, you know, I need your help. I don't know how to do this well either. Did the computer do it either.

105
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:43.860
Daniel Guerrero: Kind of felt embarrassed. Okay, go to her. I don't know how to do. She's coming to you for the answer.

106
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.360
Daniel Guerrero: And then I'm having to turn on until her well I don't know either.

107
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.090
Daniel Guerrero: Know this, to me, I was kind of embarrassing.

108
00:14:52.440 --> 00:15:02.040
Daniel Guerrero: I didn't show that you know what I started doing I just started poking through the screen are looking for stuff. And I was like, Oh, you did it. It's right there. Dad, you guys like yeah

109
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.840
Daniel Guerrero: I see you know is good.

110
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.180
Daniel Guerrero: But the real inside was like, hey, I can even help her do this because

111
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.630
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know. I don't know if it's

112
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:18.960
Daniel Guerrero: I just had a learning disability. You know, I don't know what you told us that for an excuse because, you know, we all have the same

113
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:27.270
Daniel Guerrero: Opportunities, you know, I use that a lot. You know, I always use that that we all have the same opportunities right

114
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:41.070
Daniel Guerrero: We all have the same opportunity to have a job or have an education, you know that now that I'm older I reflect on it a lot because, you know, I see, I see the mess around me sometimes. But, you know,

115
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:52.350
Daniel Guerrero: The my wife, you know, she has a brothers that are far from perfect. I'm not saying I'm perfect. But they're far from perfect. And so whenever

116
00:15:54.210 --> 00:16:06.150
Daniel Guerrero: I see. I see what how their influence today. Mike and I look back at our life and I look back on it for them either and by no means am I trying to compare my life to their life because, you know, we all have different lines.

117
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.060
Daniel Guerrero: Or I am trying to compare is, is the fact that we all have the same opportunity as far as like employment, for example.

118
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:23.010
Daniel Guerrero: And I'm like, whoa, whoa. We're all on the streets. If we don't pay our rent. We're on the streets, you know, if you don't pay your rent your on the streets, that's

119
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:23.670
Gwenevere Abriel: My rant.

120
00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

121
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.230
Daniel Guerrero: And so, you know, and, and then I and then I turn around and I look at you know

122
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.200
Daniel Guerrero: You know, other situations and I, you know, like for example like

123
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:45.450
Daniel Guerrero: Being a being a police officer or something like that, you know, I had that opportunity. But I flushed down the toilet, you know,

124
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.880
Daniel Guerrero: So for me is

125
00:16:48.960 --> 00:17:00.060
Daniel Guerrero: You know, taking advantage of an opportunity and utilizing the time it's important to me, but I just still, I don't understand why I'm not showing the effort or why am I not even trying.

126
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.330
Daniel Guerrero: It, it's kind of, it's kind of bothered me. You know, now that we talked about it more in my

127
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: And and I

128
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Know there's some

129
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: There's some truth to what you're saying, but there's also

130
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Some facts that that are a little skewed and that has to do with with the type of

131
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.690
Gwenevere Abriel: developmental trauma that you've had in your life.

132
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:39.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not really true that you've had the exact same opportunities you haven't quite had the same opportunities that someone that didn't have that kind of trauma.

133
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So give yourself a break. Let's not go back in time and give yourself a hard time about what if, what if, what if I had done it differently, but rather just sort of gently respect the fact that what what education has in front of you is

134
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: It requires so much delayed gratification.

135
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:15.270
Gwenevere Abriel: It's uncomfortable opening the book it's uncomfortable getting stuck on a problem, it's uncomfortable. Who the heck am I supposed to ask for help is uncomfortable sitting on a computer on what the F. I'm doing

136
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:28.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And then I got my children looking at me and then I got all the shame response, why on I already done with this this pissing me off and now I have to think about. I ain't going to even feel how good this is for how many months.

137
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so of course you're not going to do it.

138
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, because if the reward is so far away.

139
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And

140
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's human. That's you, that's me that's everybody. It's the reason why when you were raising your kids or

141
00:18:50.550 --> 00:19:07.440
Gwenevere Abriel: What have you, you had to push because they don't want to do it either. We don't want to get plenty of things that I'm putting off because I'm not going to be rewarded right away. That is just how the brain works. So just be nicer to yourself on this one. Okay.

142
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: We get a nice

143
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:27.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we get reward money. Money represents I get to have my furniture for my kids I get to pay. I have internet I have cable. I have these things. That's enough. And it gives a little spray of dopamine in your brain that says keep doing that.

144
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:37.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it. It's, it's not this big philosophical things. So that's why when I was saying, just to do five minutes. I wasn't kidding.

145
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:46.260
Gwenevere Abriel: I was literally trying to put in place so that you would experience and positive reward for just doing five minutes of it.

146
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:58.050
Gwenevere Abriel: And I was hoping that when you and I had done it together when we pulled up the internet and I pulled up one of those little problems and we did it together. I was hoping that you would come away with that thinking

147
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Just as smart as anybody else.

148
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:09.030
Gwenevere Abriel: But is that how how you left or did you do something else. What else with that experience.

149
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.420
Daniel Guerrero: No, um,

150
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:14.760
Daniel Guerrero: You know I

151
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:33.060
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I think I'm I am a pretty bright guy you know i just i just i don't understand what it is. It's about understanding, you know, the texts, you know, sometimes, sometimes I just don't understand the text and then I have

152
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:50.040
Daniel Guerrero: This really, you know, pronouncing words and understanding words you know there's something I don't know and you know I Google it. Google tells me how it tells me what it means. And I'm like, oh, not like use it in a sentence. Google it, you

153
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Know,

154
00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.580
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know, I just

155
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.500
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know, I just thought, sometimes it's not normal normally

156
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: It is it's normal and and and i don't know

157
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I didn't meet you when you were

158
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: 10 and I couldn't. You know, I didn't assess whether there was, you know, when you were six and seven and see if you had any any

159
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:32.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Literal cognitive learning disability. I have no idea, but I know you now, and I know I did something spontaneously and you picked up on on. I remember the their th er E versus TH I er you picked up on it before I did.

160
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.090
Gwenevere Abriel: So, so what

161
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: You were had an isolated when you're incarcerated. This little chunk of vocabulary. It is all you need. This little bit right here. That's all you need.

162
00:21:47.250 --> 00:22:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: You come out into the world and you want to, you know, specifically pass the specific exam you study, you can study specifically to pass that test. And now, you'd be doing is be specifically trying to pass that GED thing. That's it. But along the way. If you're saying

163
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:10.710
Gwenevere Abriel: You're dumb. You're stupid. You can't do it there. I just don't think it's likely you're going to even get started.

164
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you meet yourself there was such a negative opinion of you instead of just going using radical acceptance right with every single problem. If it's number two and it gets difficult, you know,

165
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Well this one's hard

166
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.990
Gwenevere Abriel: I gotta walk away from it for a second.

167
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm going to look up a couple of those words.

168
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:39.480
And I look them up.

169
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:48.600
Gwenevere Abriel: It's no different than anybody else. Now, we were fortunate enough maybe to not have such a high a score.

170
00:22:48.900 --> 00:23:04.200
Gwenevere Abriel: You had a lot of negative things that happened coming up. So you're a story first came in here. They probably asked you through a few questions and your score was probably up there because you've witnessed domestic violence, you've experienced it, etc, etc. So I'm

171
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:21.540
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys don't quite seem to get that it does impact learning it does impact self confidence. It impacts it, it sets you on a different direction, even look even a little

172
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: slight angle sets you this way.

173
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Even just a

174
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: slight turn

175
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: What if I had done just a little bit more pat on the back. But if I had gotten 30% because all you really need is 30% of good enough parenting and you're going to be in. All right, you're going to be all right.

176
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:51.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not 100% not at 30 we can pretty much pull that off. But I wonder if you even got that.

177
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I seriously don't think you did.

178
00:23:55.590 --> 00:24:00.270
Daniel Guerrero: Well, you know, no, no. And I'm not trying to kick my mom, you know, or

179
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:15.090
Daniel Guerrero: When I was younger, he always RAN OUT ON THIS, YOU KNOW, SHE ALWAYS THAT THIS behind him left me with my step dad, you know, to raise us, you know, and he kind of just, you know, used to, I don't know what to use those for but

180
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.050
Daniel Guerrero: Anyways, it just wasn't good, you know,

181
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.810
Daniel Guerrero: And then it didn't help.

182
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:23.640
Daniel Guerrero: You know that

183
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:37.560
Daniel Guerrero: No instead of helping me was forcing me, you know, hey, or for an example, for example, like I was scared. I remember as a kid. I was scared to tell him that I even had spelling words because I could not pass the

184
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Test even

185
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.560
Daniel Guerrero: My own I couldn't pass them.

186
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:54.750
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, and so he had a student teacher calm. I mean, the conference and found out that I haven't been passing my spelling test well that turned into a bigger issue right

187
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:55.560
Yeah.

188
00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:56.880
Daniel Guerrero: And

189
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.000
Daniel Guerrero: I remember that.

190
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:11.280
Daniel Guerrero: I would have to take my spelling this home on Monday, and I had to learn how to spell all 20 words before I went to bed.

191
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:13.410
Daniel Guerrero: So that

192
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.360
Daniel Guerrero: You know, so it was

193
00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:16.500
It was pretty difficult.

194
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.420
Daniel Guerrero: It was really tough, you know, living in an environment

195
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.880
Daniel Guerrero: Because if it wasn't right, or

196
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.460
Daniel Guerrero: It would just

197
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:31.530
Daniel Guerrero: Never

198
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:48.030
Gwenevere Abriel: So Daniel just take that one story, how on earth do you think that you're going to be able to go look at learning with excitement when that's your history of learning. It's awful.

199
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: So, it

200
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just going to take a different approach. It's going to have to be this rediscovery

201
00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:07.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That your brain actually does like novelty. It likes it, and like something, it's like, Oh, what's that I've never seen that before. It does. We just got to get it back.

202
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:12.720
Gwenevere Abriel: To the way it was before that damage was done with the stepfather. Okay.

203
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Because the brain does it likes to focus. Oh, I really want to solve this problem. And actually, again with the domain job. It means really important pieces as a human, it will give you just a little spray also once you solve the problem.

204
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: There is a natural a brain chemical happening that that reinforces that we solve a problem or when we reach the end of a story or when you have an aha moment. Doesn't it feel good, like I got it, I got the answer. It feels good.

205
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: What happened to you was so unfortunate that this negative conditioning happened that learning is not only not fun, but it's like awful.

206
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.980
Daniel Guerrero: It is to have been like that.

207
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:03.660
Go ahead.

208
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.780
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, sometimes it's torture, you know, trying to

209
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:16.380
Daniel Guerrero: kind of learn or read, you know, because it wasn't, it wasn't easy. You know, for me or my brother, you know, I

210
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.450
Daniel Guerrero: I remember that, you know, my brother. God has asked was so bad.

211
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.550
Daniel Guerrero: On a Monday when he got his 10 spelling words.

212
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:34.260
Daniel Guerrero: Because as well so bad he couldn't sit down for like two days, and he had to force myself to sit down at school.

213
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:41.220
Daniel Guerrero: You know, he come home and he's like, man, I'm glad at home from school. I couldn't even sit down. I had to force myself.

214
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.570
To be

215
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:50.070
Daniel Guerrero: Terrible man like my step dad was, you know, is

216
00:27:51.870 --> 00:28:08.340
Daniel Guerrero: Anyways, that's just a whole different other but that's that's why I feel like I'm just like today is just like I wasn't help you know to get an education. It was like bam, bam, bam, get it right, bam, bam, bam, bam, you know, fucking idiot. You know, it is like

217
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:15.000
Daniel Guerrero: My down. You know what kind of fun. Is that so education to learn it.

218
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: But you know what, I'm so

219
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: You did do something I listened to your story when you were with your daughter when you are. I'm doing the Chrome, whatever.

220
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice what you did. You didn't know how to do it, but she just, I call it. People will say, oh, you really know a lot about technology. And I'm like, No, I don't. I'm just computer courageous and you are to you just started

221
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Started

222
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's all you need.

223
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a willingness to be uncertain. That's all.

224
00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:00.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And if it turns out you get there if you get there and let's say

225
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's say you go to a GED class. I'm just making up a story there's 100 different ways to do it. You're in G to class and the teacher comes along and says,

226
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:24.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, I keep seeing you're doing this one particular thing where you're switching letters around maybe you have dyslexia, or maybe it's none of that. And maybe it's just this aversion to learning. Who knows.

227
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But I think all you need to move forward is what you did with your daughter, which is the courage.

228
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And if the story that you take, say to yourself, is

229
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:44.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Step Dad expletive like MF like one more, you know, really get into it.

230
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not gonna let you control my adult life. You control my childhood. I'm not gonna let you do it. Today, I'm going to go do something

231
00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: That I enjoy. That's this an investment in in me that I would do for my own children. I'm going to do it for me.

232
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe using anger as a as a motivator. I don't know if you can kind of buy into that, but sort of like, you know what, I'm not going to let you run my life anymore. That's history. And in fact, I'll show you. You know what I'm trying to say like all show you

233
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm not what

234
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: I had

235
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:30.360
Daniel Guerrero: A good day because you know there's something I would like you know it's you know I think about all the time, you know,

236
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:39.360
Daniel Guerrero: Because my mom. My mom only has two kids and my brother got to graduate. You know, he graduated high school and you know we had this big old thing for him.

237
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:49.680
Daniel Guerrero: You know, he got to walk across the stage and diploma. You know, so it was a big it was a big moment, you know, for my mom because you know she was very proud, you know, your brother.

238
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.360
Daniel Guerrero: And

239
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.100
Daniel Guerrero: He was able to do that, we

240
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:54.810
Daniel Guerrero: You know,

241
00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:01.560
Daniel Guerrero: And she told me if anybody was going to graduate. I thought you were going to graduate, rather than one going to be dropping out

242
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:03.570
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, yeah.

243
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.230
Daniel Guerrero: So I always think about how great it would be

244
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.060
Daniel Guerrero: You know, visit my mom a diploma, like you're, you know,

245
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.160
Daniel Guerrero: You know what it

246
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:15.540
Daniel Guerrero: Means

247
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.280
Daniel Guerrero: To me for us but you know with you.

248
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.630
Daniel Guerrero: Because you know there

249
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.090
Daniel Guerrero: It's crazy that

250
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:26.640
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I talked to recruiters.

251
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.710
Daniel Guerrero: From swift, you know, a while back.

252
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.280
Daniel Guerrero: And he hit me up the other day, and he's like,

253
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:45.570
Daniel Guerrero: He's like, hey man, you know, maybe we can work something now that we can get you get you on. Uh huh. I don't know. I don't know if you know what Swift is what

254
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it it's

255
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:49.230
Daniel Guerrero: It's a

256
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.810
Like a food distribution company.

257
00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:02.730
Daniel Guerrero: But when I applied for applying for a truck drove it i don't i don't have a license or CPM

258
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:11.820
Daniel Guerrero: But they'll pay me for my training, you know, pay me as I go. And then you got to assign a one year contract with them.

259
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.730
Daniel Guerrero: And you got to drive for them for one year, you know, as you get your license, whatever.

260
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:30.420
Daniel Guerrero: You know they pretty much take you under their wing and you've got a pretty much, you know, give you one year devotion to them, you know, for, you know, giving you an open, you know, license and then you've got a workflow here.

261
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:33.720
Daniel Guerrero: So I had him.

262
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:34.710
Daniel Guerrero: I hit them up and

263
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:44.100
Daniel Guerrero: I guess now that they're desperate situation they hit me back over, like what so you know this, try to figure this out so you can, we can get one.

264
00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:53.850
Daniel Guerrero: But then there's that. Do you have the education. Do you have a GED or high school diploma and it's like, no.

265
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: So Daniel What if it's not as bad as you think.

266
00:32:58.890 --> 00:32:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to be

267
00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.730
Gwenevere Abriel: 45 some day anyway.

268
00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: You aren't you

269
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not going to die right

270
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So what the heck

271
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:11.850
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, you're

272
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Going to at this point.

273
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Is five minutes. One day this week. What if we just bring it down to one day.

274
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: What if you and I just do five minutes.

275
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And they can have another pair of eyes, you get to feel hopefully good

276
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:38.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Where would you start, we looked online at a school, but you didn't follow up right

277
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:40.080
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

278
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And you didn't hang up with me, even though I'm not going to tell you what to do. I'm not a probation officer. I don't tell people what to do. The closest I'll ever get is

279
00:33:51.090 --> 00:34:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: It'll have the closest little other sound is like, Well, you're invited or I encourage you to set an alarm, that's a strong as it's ever going to get in here. I can't live your life. But I want to, I want to take you in the morning and say, Okay, let's get up early. Let's

280
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:17.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go practice, let's bust open. Our Ji Ji book. Let's review. Let's read together, um, you know, I would do that. I can't

281
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:20.250
Daniel Guerrero: Write I good

282
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:33.000
Gwenevere Abriel: You're going to have to do these first scary steps in the beginning, but I have faith that it will get easier because you're going to end up saying it's not as hard as I thought.

283
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.580
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, it's just

284
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.440
Daniel Guerrero: I'm not trying to make no excuses, you know, because there's something there. I really want

285
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:46.800
Daniel Guerrero: I just, I just don't know.

286
00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:52.350
Daniel Guerrero: I just need to put more effort into it and I agree with that 100%

287
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: About three minutes a day.

288
00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you see what we're doing.

289
00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:02.760
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah, we can go. We can do that, I'm gonna try that, you know, was definitely see what I can do.

290
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.840
Daniel Guerrero: Just quit wasting my time, you know, starting guidelines on me because i i don't know why i appreciate that so much, you know,

291
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.990
Daniel Guerrero: So always know take advantage of the time that you have or, you know,

292
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.790
Daniel Guerrero: Oh, always, always say that stuff will never like

293
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:30.090
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know why I just, I feel like did I am applying it to myself by, you know, our next word I do you know this work I do.

294
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.970
Daniel Guerrero: You clean it to myself, but maybe I'm really not. Maybe I'm just missing it you know

295
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.160
Daniel Guerrero: missing the mark I know so

296
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.130
Daniel Guerrero: Try to focus on

297
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Daniel, what you're doing, gives you short term gratification.

298
00:35:48.660 --> 00:36:03.030
Gwenevere Abriel: It just does. You're going to end up doing those things first. It's just the way we all work, you're going to get money that makes sense to our brain, but do you when I say delayed gratification, you kind of sort of know what I'm talking about.

299
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:14.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Your rap delayed me. I'm gonna have to wait months to get a pat on the head pat on the back. Those are hard for all of us.

300
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And so if we do little bits so that we can get your brain online so that it can say it's not as bad as I thought. And hey, this does feel good. I'm proud of myself. It will reinforce it. You'll do it again.

301
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:31.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

302
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:33.510
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

303
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:36.120
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

304
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:47.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's do, let's do one together. Let's do one right now, what would feel good right now because I have the internet right here. I can share the screen.

305
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:58.410
Gwenevere Abriel: If we could spend three minutes doing something, what would it be that would just be like, I'm scared to do it, but I know it's something that I'll be proud of. Three minutes I'll set my timer.

306
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:05.130
Daniel Guerrero: You know what, I'm you know like

307
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.000
Daniel Guerrero: Algebra or something that I have a really hard time with

308
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.700
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah. And the reason why I have so much

309
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.250
Daniel Guerrero: I just don't get all the numbers that

310
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.800
Daniel Guerrero: Exists in the ends and

311
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.450
Daniel Guerrero: I don't get it.

312
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.380
Okay.

313
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.410
Daniel Guerrero: So struggling

314
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Algebra.

315
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What about all the stuff that comes before it so maybe it's about reviewing some things that are before algebra pre algebra.

316
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And getting comfortable with it. It has been years for you so

317
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's where you review and. Nobody's putting this pressure on you, but you

318
00:37:50.250 --> 00:38:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So you just say wrong. I'll just, I'll just see where I'm at. And so let's just take that this concept of algebra is daunting for you. Okay, so let me just see. As soon as I get this up, then I've got my my timer set for three minutes you can feel what three minutes. Feels like okay

319
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Pre. I'm going to go pre algebra though pre algebra.

320
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Bro.

321
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so GED practice algebra problems GED pre algebra worksheets.

322
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Worksheets

323
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.570
Once

324
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Free GED math practice.

325
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:50.040
Gwenevere Abriel: This guy, Scott. If you saw a good stock on, let me just set it up so you can feel with us. So I'm just starting. It's going to share my screen to see what this guy has to say.

326
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I just, this is random. I don't know, you could stop I'll change it a few seconds.

327
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:11.190
Gwenevere Abriel: For each of these examples I'm going to demonstrate how to figure out what percentage of the whole a given number is, well, here's the number 36 as our whole and for each of these said, you know what a whole means

328
00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.800
Daniel Guerrero: Right, a whole number, right.

329
00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:19.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Perfect. Now I happen to be terrible a percentage. So I'm kind of excited. He's going to do this.

330
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Verse, figure out what percentage of 36 there. Okay, so let's look at these examples, we have four. So to find the percentage of 36 and four is will divide for by 36

331
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:48.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we can treat this as a fraction and reduce it by dividing top and bottom by four. So, this becomes a one. That part makes sense. You're going to how many times is foregoing 36

332
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's great. Right.

333
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:55.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This becomes a nine whatever nine she breaks it down. Whenever nine

334
00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The percentage equivalent of one over nine is 11.1% well how to get that. So for is 11.1% 36

335
00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:15.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Second example we have terrible teacher because I don't even know how I got that. So he sucks. We're going to go to a different one. I want to know how I got that.

336
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.090
Daniel Guerrero: He was not good. Yeah.

337
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.120
Gwenevere Abriel: He was terrible. So let me just see what

338
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, Turkey.

339
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.030
Daniel Guerrero: Was

340
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:34.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Living in 911 yeah it was that percentage is 11.1 but he should have shown how to do it. Um so pre L ship.

341
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.510
Gwenevere Abriel: For algebra.

342
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Lesson. I like that.

343
00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.090
Daniel Guerrero: Let's see if this one's any good.

344
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:52.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Pre algebra review this guys. See you. We're going to focus on pre algebra. We're going to cover some common topics that you might see this course.

345
00:40:52.860 --> 00:41:07.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So the first thing that you need to be able to do is add and subtract integers and example. Let's say you want to add funds blustery. Yeah. How many of you know that 500 students a but if you ever have difficulty with this type of mouth using number

346
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's start with size. You can place it anywhere. Whenever you're adding a number to another number, you need to move to the right of the number line. Anytime you're adding and if you need to subtract

347
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Travel towards the left.

348
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:39.540
Gwenevere Abriel: So in this case we want to add three to five. So we need to travel three units to the right 123 is a 678 so therefore five cluster is a

349
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Now let's try some more examples. What is the negative fourth plus size.

350
00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that was three minutes.

351
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa, okay. And are you interested. Don't you kind of want to know what negative four plus five is I kind of knew

352
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.150
Daniel Guerrero: I kind of do tune

353
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:05.970
Gwenevere Abriel: It to, let's see. Let's use the Netherlands hippie answer. So before we start with negative four.

354
00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:14.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Five to it. So we're gonna try with five minutes. Turn right 12345

355
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: This is negative three, negative two minus one.

356
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:20.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready for

357
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:22.530
This

358
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: One. So it's 12345. That makes sense. You add to the right. Yes, we moved you see my mouse, you see my little arrow.

359
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:43.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay, so we moved or adding to the right because you just told us we move to the right, when we're adding

360
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's 12345 and there it is a positive one. And that's our answer. Now, we knew that already. Like, if we have five things that we take away for we know it's one. But it's this negative number. That kind of is freaky geeky

361
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:08.370
Gwenevere Abriel: And this is a good way to to kind of visualize it, but so now you're telling me that you can't do three minutes a day. And that was kind of fun.

362
00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I've got

363
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.150
Daniel Guerrero: It honestly was because I started that you know i i do kind of like

364
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.290
Daniel Guerrero: This but I'm just, I just have a hard time doing it because

365
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.690
Daniel Guerrero: I don't know if I would, I think I might have told you this last time I had this really tough.

366
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.080
Daniel Guerrero: math teacher right and

367
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:44.070
Daniel Guerrero: Like she didn't make that fun for me at all because like SHOULD I, DO YOU GET IT, YOU GET IT. YOU UNDERSTAND. YOU UNDERSTAND. Yes. Yes. No. Who doesn't know so I can show you. You know how stupid you are

368
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:45.810
Embarrassing

369
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:47.490
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

370
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet, I bet you're talking about because I don't remember all those words, either. It's been too long, but I bet you were talking about order of operations.

371
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:11.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I bet it's this stuff, this lady here I'm just through this up. I bet you're struggling with these things like which order to do things order, you're always going to solve your problem from left to right.

372
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll show some examples to make sure that's understood

373
00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:33.420
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to follow the acronym PIM DOS to remember what order, you're going to go in the P stands for current defeat. The E stands for exponent. The M is multiplication D division. A addition and subtraction.

374
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:42.840
Gwenevere Abriel: So that would be a cool thing to memorize right how the order of rockers. What do I do first, like you know how you were saying all the parentheses and the minuses and the divisions and all that. Right.

375
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:48.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Around what just just from two things we're looking at, we can see that if we memorized.

376
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:58.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we know we're going to parentheses and then whatever that he was an M. And then the division and then the addition and subtraction. So it's written out. We just have to memorize what those letters are

377
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:08.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And then guess what, now we know what to start with when we're looking at one of those algebraic equations and all we did was turn on YouTube.

378
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:14.820
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't have to have a mean old teacher, we have internet is our friend.

379
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.030
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

380
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Feeling that

381
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:32.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And this was no research. This is me just randomly right in front of you, pulling it up and I don't remember pen DOS is as I'm looking at. I'm like, Oh, I bet I have that memorized. I was in school.

382
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I remember now, I'd have to review it. I would have to review all of this, it doesn't mean you're deficient. It means if we aren't thinking about something.

383
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:56.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Our brain pronouns, it gets rid of it. Your brain my brain. Everybody spraying, especially if there was marijuana use it PRUNES IT and it makes it really difficult to learn

384
00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:58.560
Daniel Guerrero: Okay.

385
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's nothing deficient with you. This is you just getting a look at this and say, Yeah, I'm just going to give it a try.

386
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:20.280
Gwenevere Abriel: The N MD or multiplication and division are solved at the same time. The same is true for the NFP addition and subtraction. They're also saw that the same time.

387
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: I know that's kind of a lot to remember. But we're going to jump into some examples. So all of this makes a little portion. Let's get into example number one.

388
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Example number one.

389
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:45.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Before beginning because I know I'm using our order of operations. I always tell my students to start by writing pin DOS at the top of your paper. So I'm going to write it right up here.

390
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: P

391
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:50.910
Gwenevere Abriel: E

392
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.280
Gwenevere Abriel: M.

393
00:46:54.450 --> 00:47:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: D. So what's the paste in parentheses. Right. I think my m amp D. I always say it's a good idea to circle the. Am I, am I, is it is a good idea to circle, though. Okay. Because you do them together.

394
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to circle. These two because just like in the last slide I explaining they work together.

395
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Now if you remember the first bullet point I made unless flag was you solve your problem from left to right. That's right. So what I do is look at each letter of my acronym and take my art from left to right.

396
00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:43.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And determine if I have anything in the problem that is that letter P or so from left to right. I'm going to check to see if I have any parentheses. No, no, I don't know.

397
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I spun it. Nope. Nope. No. Looking from left to right. Do I have any exponent. No, no, I don't.

398
00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:58.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Multiplication and division. This time, when I look, it doesn't matter if I see multiplication or division and it doesn't matter which comes first, I'm going to take note of it.

399
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:08.400
Gwenevere Abriel: As I moved from left to right, so moving from left to right. Yes, I have multiplication. Okay. Because I have multiple five times to. There's your multiplication. Right.

400
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.500
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

401
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep location. That means I need to solve this part right now because that's the stuff that we're on. So to solve this, I say rewrite the entire problem, except for the portion that you are solving you're going to rewrite it. And the solved answer. The answer, so it's

402
00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Like 3232 minus what

403
00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:34.020
Daniel Guerrero: Huh.

404
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:46.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Yeah, see, that was easy. You know what's up. It's this memorizing this nonsense like this is it. There's just rules, that's a neat thing about math we just got to remember what they are.

405
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

406
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:51.750
Daniel Guerrero: Right, right.

407
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so now you know again I threw me into this

408
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:04.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, what do you think it is this, it seemed as overwhelming, or is it something you could do a smidge of

409
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:06.930
Daniel Guerrero: Yeah.

410
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.000
Daniel Guerrero: You know, it's like

411
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:18.150
Daniel Guerrero: It was a perfect example. You know, you know, will will receive on my end because night. It doesn't take long to do that.

412
00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:24.780
Daniel Guerrero: You know it is. It's not hard to just jot it down again, you know, as I'm thinking about this.

413
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:40.380
Daniel Guerrero: So, you know, I'm going to be quite honest, which is to me. I just feel. I feel like a little embarrassed because it's not hard. It's just doing it. You know, it's just going out literally just

414
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:42.420
Daniel Guerrero: Taking time and

415
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.510
Daniel Guerrero: And doing it, you know, because

416
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:53.340
Daniel Guerrero: You know, later on, even my kids are getting older, you know, they're not getting younger, I wish that we get younger, but are not grow at all. So,

417
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.800
Gwenevere Abriel: I know a little tail.

418
00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:07.980
Daniel Guerrero: So, you know, it's going to come. It's not accommodate and I'll be like, you know, this big old math. Math problem, a dad, I need some help with this and

419
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.300
Daniel Guerrero: I want to look at it. I don't know what the heck. That means, you know, and it

420
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.220
Daniel Guerrero: You know, I just, I just want to be able to do that, you know,

421
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:23.790
Daniel Guerrero: I think if I had more time to do it just to be honest, I'm just going to be honest with with the whole thing here, it says

422
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.410
Daniel Guerrero: I'm just not finding the time to do it and I need to. So

423
00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:34.350
Gwenevere Abriel: If your motivation is not there.

424
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: If you are really not motivated by having the CBL license.

425
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Which is preceded by a GED or diploma.

426
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: It's unlikely, it's unlikely that you will set an alarm for five minutes.

427
00:50:54.390 --> 00:51:01.890
Gwenevere Abriel: All you have to do is set an alarm for five minutes earlier in the morning. This is an intervention in

428
00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:15.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Its setting it you do it. You haven't experienced like this today, which is this kind of, quote, I felt kind of smart today and I solved the problem. I watched a YouTube video on right here it says 15 most important GED questions.

429
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:21.000
Gwenevere Abriel: This little blonde twit with their little glasses. And so we've opened it up and we look at

430
00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:34.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Rice for five minutes and then you might say to yourself, I did it once have I set my alarm for tomorrow morning for five minutes or six

431
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:46.680
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you do that and you might laugh with your wife, and you might laugh with your kids and like I see y'all doing all this math and I forgot. Most of it. One half paying attention to. Now I'm just gonna

432
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna do a refresh. And I'm going to, I'm going to work towards my GED. Or maybe you don't tell them yet, that's up to you. It does help to

433
00:51:54.630 --> 00:52:05.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Make a commitment to someone and say, I'm going to do something because then you have pressure to do it, but that's your choice. But these five minutes what you just did in here today.

434
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Was it unpleasant, or did you get to feel a little smart.

435
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.620
Daniel Guerrero: Well, you know, I mean, I enjoyed it, you know.

436
00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.200
Daniel Guerrero: I put my phone on the charges.

437
00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.500
Daniel Guerrero: So, for

438
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.780
Daniel Guerrero: This going to be honest, like

439
00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:36.090
Daniel Guerrero: wasn't as hard as or as good as I thought it was going to be, you know,

440
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:41.820
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's do this. Daniel. Do you want to see if

441
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:58.800
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do it once or twice a week or you get up early and you all you do is go on your phone or on somebody's computer do you have anybody have in the house, like a laptop or anything that they can do some some computer work.

442
00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:05.520
Daniel Guerrero: And my kids actually have some Chromebooks. They're basically the same thing.

443
00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:06.660
Gwenevere Abriel: There you go.

444
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:11.640
Daniel Guerrero: One way of, you can do whatever you want on it. So it's basically the same thing.

445
00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:13.740
Daniel Guerrero: So Daniel so

446
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If I said

447
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Turn right now to your phone and set an alarm that works for you.

448
00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you excited, or are you irritated with me when I

449
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.850
Daniel Guerrero: Know it to me. It's excitement, um,

450
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:35.250
Daniel Guerrero: You know, because I could benefit from him. This is something that I want, you know,

451
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.600
Daniel Guerrero: I took this class one time and it was called breaking barriers and

452
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.100
Daniel Guerrero: It was about. It was about, um,

453
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:48.330
Daniel Guerrero: Long term.

454
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.920
Daniel Guerrero: Benefits and long term.

455
00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.470
Daniel Guerrero: Non beneficial things, you know, so

456
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:06.930
Daniel Guerrero: I mean, this is not to be beneficial. It'd be very easy for me to, you know, get involved in something like this, you know, and, you know,

457
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.270
Daniel Guerrero: So Daniel cook me

458
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Just put me on hold and set an alarm for tomorrow. Go for it. Take your phone and setting the alarm. The video will pause. I don't care. Just, just go for it. This is an in vivo activity where you just do it right away before your mind gets in convinces you to not do it.

459
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. So, what time do you typically wake up on on a on a Saturday.

460
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:43.050
Daniel Guerrero: Saturday i'm i'm not pretty early, because I like to have a day before I go to work, you know I'm always up by eight o'clock.

461
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Most days I'm open 845 set it for 750 is it that big of a difference.

462
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.410
Daniel Guerrero: Not really.

463
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.990
Gwenevere Abriel: And take your phone. Go for it.

464
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.520
Gwenevere Abriel: There.

465
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:21.420
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to label it something that inspires you, some little label about alarm. If it lets you

466
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.800
Daniel Guerrero: Know it's me label.

467
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what would feel good, like you got this manner, go for it or something that gives you a little giggle or inspiration.

468
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:43.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you're worth it or you're smart or something. It feels good.

469
00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:48.960
Gwenevere Abriel: gotchas. You got this, man. I like it. You got this.

470
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.590
Daniel Guerrero: You got this. That's what I put there.

471
00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, perfect.

472
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:55.560
Daniel Guerrero: Okay, I'm gonna put there you

473
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: If it turns out you don't keep that commitment to yourself.

474
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:08.670
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to ask

475
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

476
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.080
Daniel Guerrero: I'm going to ask you if you kept

477
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll ask you the next time I see you and you'll be honest, because I know you're honest.

478
00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:30.180
Gwenevere Abriel: That little bit of pressure that knowing that I'm going to ask you if you kept that commitment to yourself might be, just enough to compel you to do it.

479
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:35.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe or if, in addition you have even if

480
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:37.500
Daniel Guerrero: You go already

481
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

482
00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And guess what, then, if you do it, then you go into growth and I do these little activities and I'll say things like, what, what do you proud of, you know, or I'll say, wherever you brave.

483
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:56.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Or I'll say it'd be like, I got one. And you can raise your hand and be like, look what I did and you can brag.

484
00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: You did something hard don't minimize it. Daniel, what you're about to do is go in to a dark unlit jungle, it is terrifying don't minimize how scary. This is. But the reality is when you get there, you'll realize, oh,

485
00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The fundings just about the same as it was right outside the jungle. And it turns out, I can see a little bit in front of me.

486
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:36.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I know I've had, I recognize this plant. I know this tree I recognize that sound. I think you're going to be okay. We just got to get that first couple steps in and then you'll remember, everything's gonna be okay.

487
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.210
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Alright, um, I

488
00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Better go I thought someone not gonna miss cyber door here.

489
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:51.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see what I've got for next week. This was an impromptu but I thought we had something planned out for the following week, didn't we

490
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:54.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, second

491
00:57:54.990 --> 00:58:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, um, I had you in here twice. Tell me if this is okay. I have 9am Wednesday, May 20 I had you both. And then I I felt I made a mistake and I gave away Friday to someone else. Are you okay with Wednesday at nine.

492
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Made one

493
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

494
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:22.200
Gwenevere Abriel: May 20 okay so put that in your in your in your phone and

495
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: If I remember over the weekend to to text you a little, like, How'd that go on Saturday.

496
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:32.340
Daniel Guerrero: Right.

497
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:47.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Just pay. Yeah. Just pay attention to whether you end up getting irritated with it because I'm going to want to know, or if you felt like, Oh, someone cares

498
00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Want you to just pay attention to yourself and see whether you welcome it as support or whether you're like what a pain in the butt. This lady is just notice in yourself whether you're drawing

499
00:58:57.570 --> 00:59:03.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What I want to know, because otherwise right I'll back off. If it's a pain in the butt. But if it's. Ooh.

500
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: She's helping me she's kind of niche niche newedge then that's a positive thing. So just pay attention to yourself and speak and see if you like it, or if you don't like it, because I want to hear it either way.

501
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, I better go. Have a good weekend. Right.

502
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.980
Daniel Guerrero: Right. Thank you.

503
00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:20.700
Bye.

504
00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.230
Daniel Guerrero: Bye.
