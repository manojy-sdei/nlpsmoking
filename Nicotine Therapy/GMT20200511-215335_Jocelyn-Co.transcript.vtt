108
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.270
Jocelyn Corrales: Baby. So in this case, we're

109
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.870

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:06.510

116
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.990
Eric D.S.: Yeah you those, you definitely have to take care of.

117
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.640
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, maybe let's just stick with it, you know, small plants, you know,

118
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Not so sensitive plans, just like the cactus are the bonsai.

119
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.380
Jocelyn Corrales: I think that's good. Yeah, that's relaxing also

120
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.840
Eric D.S.: Radius. Yeah.

121
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:41.640
Jocelyn Corrales: So with regards to mental health. How do you, how do you regulate your mood, just in case you're cranky or feeling cranky or feeling angry or, you know, feeling emotional. How do you manage it in, you know, if you have stress. How do you handle it.

122
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:53.010
Eric D.S.: If it's if it's anything like that. I usually just work out or and like the music helps to but I mean if it's something that where I feel that way. I'll usually just

123
00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:02.070
Eric D.S.: Go to myself because I live with my family still so usually for myself and either work out or do something like that. That'll keep my mind off of it.

124
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:12.120
Jocelyn Corrales: And listen to music work out and go to your family or sometimes be alone.

125
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.700
Eric D.S.: Yeah, either or depends on the feeling is, I want to talk to somebody than I have people here I can talk to

126
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.010
Jocelyn Corrales: Go to family when you want someone to talk to.

127
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Or me just be alone. Yeah.

128
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.670
Jocelyn Corrales: I think that's good thing to do. You know when you're feeling cranky so that you know one you want to get mad at someone you know

129
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.150
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, death at least

130
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:47.700
Jocelyn Corrales: At least try to be alone. You know, do some self meditation self reflection.

131
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.190
Eric D.S.: Don't take it out on the wrong person.

132
00:11:50.790 --> 00:12:06.420
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true. Because when you're angry. You know, you tend to hurt someone. You know, so once feeling sometimes you don't mean it. But once the words are out once you set it to the person you know you can take it back. Even if you tried to say sorry for that person.

133
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.650
Jocelyn Corrales: Once it's out, you know,

134
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:24.780
Jocelyn Corrales: That's. Yes. So it's better to, you know, just like you mentioned, be alone in aside from being alone. That's good. You're doing music listening to music that also works out. And maybe you could also read some books, you mentioned you love reading books.

135
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:25.800
Eric D.S.: Yeah, I do.

136
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.640
Eric D.S.: Any a book.

137
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:34.710
Jocelyn Corrales: And you could do. So aside from that, you could. Yeah. You mentioned listen to music and do some self meditation and self reflection.

138
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.660
Jocelyn Corrales: And a lap of thinking

139
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.120
Eric D.S.: On on YouTube. I'll go on like the like mindfulness, I'll do that.

140
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.250
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, that's true.

141
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.070
Jocelyn Corrales: I'll put that in the plan so that I could do that.

142
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.610
Eric D.S.: Yeah, I like mindfulness meditation. Mm hmm.

143
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.560
Jocelyn Corrales: It actually helps

144
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.390

146
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:34.140

147
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.640

204
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.170
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay that's good to hear. I think it's going to it's safer.

205
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:32.580
Eric D.S.: Yeah, it is.

206
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:39.870
Jocelyn Corrales: And do you do, you mentioned that you're you're working full time and you're also sitting

207
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.770
Jocelyn Corrales: Do you manage your own finances or your parents manage your finances for you.

208
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.850
Eric D.S.: Know I manage my own

209
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.440
Jocelyn Corrales: And up for automobiles.

210
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.490
Yes.

211
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:15.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so could you tell me what's not really working out for you. So we talked about what's working out for you. Could you tell me some things that you think this not work out for you.

212
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:26.280
Eric D.S.: Well, one thing I can definitely think of is, I'm not even though we have to do the online thing. Like for me, I don't like it. I prefer to be in person and class.

213
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:39.180
Eric D.S.: So that's something I'm having to adjust to it. I've never done online classes before. So the end of the last semester I had to do it and I struggled with it a little bit, so I know I have to keep getting used to it for summer.

214
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.320
Jocelyn Corrales: So you like doing class on a classroom, rather than doing it.

215
00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:47.940
Eric D.S.: Online. Yeah.

216
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:54.780
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, it's actually, you know, yeah, it's actually more helpful doing it in, you know, one on one with a teacher.

217
00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:09.210
Jocelyn Corrales: It's actually different when doing it. He actually needs adjustment. But, you know, doing to school physically is actually different from doing it online. How about your therapies doing therapies online. Are you okay with that.

218
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.110
Eric D.S.: Yeah, I don't mind that for me is convenient. So I don't mind.

219
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.280
Eric D.S.: Them because then like today. I barely made it in time, but

220
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.050
Eric D.S.: You know, if I if I have somewhere to go then. I probably wouldn't have gone to the store because I went to

221
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:29.520
Eric D.S.: Maybe you know so easier in that sense. And that helps and which school it's easier in some ways to if you're getting used to the program is hard.

222
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.500
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm hmm. Yeah.

223
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.790
Jocelyn Corrales: It is, but you're trying. Yeah.

224
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:36.870
Eric D.S.: I have no choice.

225
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so are you currently on probation or something like that.

226
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.670
Eric D.S.: Yes, I'm on probation right now.

227
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, so you have to stick to the program.

228
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:47.940
Yeah.

229
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.650

Jocelyn Corrales: Okay that's good to hear.

236
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.820
Eric D.S.: It will always be as easy as it has been. But so far, I have no complaints.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.820
Jocelyn Corrales: And you are able to adjust to it.

238
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.050
Yes.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.360
Jocelyn Corrales: You're not feeling cranky, you know, no.

240
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.620
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah, I have actually said actually have some patience, you know,

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.020
Eric D.S.: So just a few days.

244
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:07.110

246
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:37.080
Eric D.S.: Um, maybe I've taper down twice already. And both time there was a milligram each time. And the second time maybe like a couple of days, it was more like for me it was like a mental thing when I was at work, I would start feeling like I was getting tired or or

247
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.140
Eric D.S.: more tired than usual, but I would just tell myself. It's just a medication. I'm adjusting and I'd be able to push

248
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.270
Eric D.S.: Through the day but it wasn't that bad.

249
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.100

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.660
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could read or study in advance.

285
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:28.410
Jocelyn Corrales: Maybe you could do. We could put this in your activities of daily living, make out the daily plan, you could make a weekly plan and a daily plan.

286
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:42.510
Jocelyn Corrales: So your daily plan would be your routine plan and your weekly plan would be something that you would, you know, like for example you have some projects.

287
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:55.890
Jocelyn Corrales: You put it in your weekly plan so that you know when you have your daily plan, you could set out or you could list down what's you know your routine. Like, for example, you could you wake up at these are then after waking up, you know,

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:34.380
Jocelyn Corrales: And so that you know you won't spend most of your time watching TV, a piece when you stick to your plan, you would be doing so much more in your day. Yeah.

Jocelyn Corrales: And I have listed down things. It's really good to see your mental health spiritual self social relationships in your financial

295
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:23.970
Jocelyn Corrales: And what's not working out for you. I'll just fill in the other things because I believe it all here and I just noted, no problems for those areas that you mentioned that you have no problems. So let's go to the plan.

296
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:33.300
Jocelyn Corrales: You routinely wake up at eight o'clock, so I have no problem with that. We don't need to change that you eat regularly and you mentioned that you eat.

297
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:43.860
Jocelyn Corrales: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and I don't think you're in the diet spine and just continue on eating with healthy meals snacks and avoid eating junk foods.

298
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:50.910
Jocelyn Corrales: And for your daily activities of daily living. So I suggested for you to make a plan because you mentioned

299
00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:59.340
Jocelyn Corrales: You just read and you watch TV. And, you know, right now, because you're currently not working in not yet back in school.

300
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:09.150
Jocelyn Corrales: So try to make out a plan for your week in the elite plan so include in your plan for the week you know when when the, when

301
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:16.050
Jocelyn Corrales: When is the approximate date for you to go shopping or buy some groceries or anything or any

302
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:26.040
Jocelyn Corrales: Any errands that you have to do for you know for your family or for for the week. So you place it on a weekly plan and for your daily life. For example,

303
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:42.990
Jocelyn Corrales: You wake up at the same time you exercise on this time you watch TV, even when you watch TV, you try to time it or you limit yourself to maybe watching TV, about an hour, instead of doing it for the whole we are so probably limit it to one hour so that he could do more in a day.

304
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:49.530
Jocelyn Corrales: And maybe you could instead of, you know, watching TV, you could do.

305
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.800
Jocelyn Corrales: Some arts or crafts.

306
00:31:54.690 --> 00:32:01.260
Jocelyn Corrales: Let's split arts here. Maybe you're interested with arts also arts or graphs and some pop gardening.

307
00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:19.230
Jocelyn Corrales: And avoid watching too much TV, try to read also and study in advance, you know, maybe when you're doing your online classes. You could also insert the one they're studying in advance. So since you know you're I think you're having school in how many weeks.

308
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.730
Eric D.S.: Next week,

309
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:34.440
Jocelyn Corrales: Oh, you're having school next week already so at least you could also include that their study in advance. So instead of watching too much TV or you could spend a few hours of those time studying for your lessons.

310
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:46.620
Jocelyn Corrales: And sleep around at 10 o'clock, so I'm going to check on you again in the next 30 days probably check on you again, their own 4pm same time for PM.

311
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.890
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay. And do you have an support people right our tails staffs

312
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:58.650
Jocelyn Corrales: In your family. Yes, and friends.

313
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.990
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes. Okay.

314
00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.800
Jocelyn Corrales: And do you have anything to add. Maybe you there's something that you want to add, you know, something that we missed out

315
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.410
Eric D.S.: No, I think that's pretty good.

316
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:25.050
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay, after I have edited this one I'm going to send you a copy of our meeting today. And so that you would also have a guide, although I think you're able to memorize all the things because there's not much here.

317
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.840
Jocelyn Corrales: So I hope you try to stick

318
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:45.570
Jocelyn Corrales: To our plan and you know this. These are just basic. These are just things that you usually do. So maybe instead of spending too much time hanging around. They're lying or watching TV, tried to make yourself more productive. Do you do chores, also for your mom or the house.

319
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Yes, yes. Let's see, do that here.

320
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.100
Jocelyn Corrales: Do household chores.

321
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.590
Jocelyn Corrales: Okay.

322
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.920
Jocelyn Corrales: You may miss out on anything. You couldn't do.

323
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.430
Eric D.S.: Not so much.

324
00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.410
Jocelyn Corrales: That's fine.

325
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.240
Eric D.S.: I prefer cooking.

326
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Yeah. Yeah, I know. Like, it also fall under tours.

327
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:16.710
To Kenya.

328
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:27.960
Jocelyn Corrales: Mm Hmm, maybe you'll get maybe if you have time, maybe, but you know you're starting school next week, maybe, you know, a lot of your time would be, you know,

329
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:35.700
Jocelyn Corrales: More of studying and doing online classes, but for your weekend time, you know, at least try to

330
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:46.080
Jocelyn Corrales: Exercise in the morning when you're feeling cranky. Try to self meditate, you know, just be alone. Listen to music and, you know, meditate and study

331
00:34:46.890 --> 00:35:00.840
Jocelyn Corrales: And on your vacation time instead of watching TV, why not try instead of shopping online, do some art graphs in some Park garden, you know, times like this, it's very

332
00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:05.010
Jocelyn Corrales: It's very tempting to do online shopping

333
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.150
Eric D.S.: It is

334
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:18.780
Jocelyn Corrales: So try to avoid watching the home or the on you know your phone searching for things or stuff to buy unless it's necessary or important

335
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:29.400
Jocelyn Corrales: So avoid looking at your phone and TV. So try to do some craft. Maybe you can, you know, due to the store, go to the store, buy some art or

336
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:37.950
Jocelyn Corrales: Craft stuff, you know, at least make yourself productive your do household chores. Maybe you could do some gardening instead of doing a lot of shopping, you know,
