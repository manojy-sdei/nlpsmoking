00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.350
Richard McElwain: And I, after all this is said and done, I could probably chew on actual healthy food.

152
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.990
Richard McElwain: So able to you know actually put weight back on, which is a good thing. So

153
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.070
Richard McElwain: I'm trying

154
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.270
Richard McElwain: Right steps.

155
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:47.100
Richard McElwain: I just want to run on time, you're doing well you're doing well so

156
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:54.240
Mary Kastner: Um, we're gonna keep going. I do have a 930 but she hasn't checked her he hasn't checked in yet so

157
00:29:54.690 --> 00:30:00.270
Mary Kastner: When that person checks in, we're going to have to stop. So right now I want to tell you that we have a mental health group.

158
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:16.680
Mary Kastner: Online like this that I would like you to come to, um, yeah. That person just checked in. It's at seven o'clock on Mondays. So if you could try to be there, we do talk a lot about anxiety.

159
00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:19.020
Mary Kastner: And

160
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:27.150
Mary Kastner: Teaching you some tools to use. And so if you could do that you would check in at 645

161
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:34.590
Mary Kastner: And if you can't come tonight come next Monday. I'll be in the group tonight. I can introduce you next Monday. I won't be

162
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:35.820
Richard McElwain: Okay.

163
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.670
Mary Kastner: In the meantime, would you like to start on some medication. Have you ever been on any kind of medication.

164
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:47.220
Mary Kastner: Or anxiety or any mental health.

165
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.190
Richard McElwain: Problems. No, I haven't.

166
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.960
Richard McElwain: Okay, except for the

167
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.580
Richard McElwain: Prize

168
00:30:54.270 --> 00:31:00.450
Mary Kastner: Yeah, one of the one of the very, you know, kind of, I would say design easy medications to take

169
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.250
Richard McElwain: Sorry, sorry.

170
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.940
Mary Kastner: So laughter sertraline

171
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:12.690
Mary Kastner: We could start that it's a selective serotonin Lee uptake inhibitor, it'll help control your mood.

172
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.110
Mary Kastner: Make it more stable less anxious

173
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:22.740
Mary Kastner: You would take one in the morning for a week and then you go to one and a half.

174
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:30.930
Mary Kastner: What it is, is it lets a serotonin that's already in your brain that controls mood and sleep.

175
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:40.500
Mary Kastner: Stay in the synopsis of your brain, rather than getting reabsorbed. So it's not putting something

176
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:52.110
Mary Kastner: Um, what would I say not naturally into your body. It just allows your brain to keep that nice lubricating serotonin. We're supposed to be, instead of being absorbed.

177
00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.030
Richard McElwain: Okay.

178
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.250
Mary Kastner: We could start that and

179
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:11.970
Mary Kastner: Then I would see you next week, see how you like it and then we could finish doing this intake, because there's a lot of questions. I need to ask you for the intake and we only had 15 minutes today, but we got through the

180
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:19.800
Mary Kastner: Target symptoms. And the reason why you came and came up with the temporary treatment plan.

181
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.380
Richard McElwain: Okay.

182
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.140
Mary Kastner: You want me to try that.

183
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.160
Richard McElwain: Um, yeah, you said that I'd have to take it every day.

184
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:38.460
Mary Kastner: Yeah, you. Yeah. All of these brain medications accept things like for anxiety for situational anxiety, like the Xanax, you take daily

185
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.490
Mary Kastner: Because they have to build up a

186
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:43.710
Mary Kastner: Blood level.

187
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:45.930
Richard McElwain: Okay.

188
00:32:48.300 --> 00:33:01.050
Mary Kastner: And, you know, antidepressants are not something you take lightly because your, your brain really gets nice and used to this nice lubricating factor that I'm talking about in for you to just all of a sudden stop taking it.

189
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.770
Mary Kastner: You know, it's not fair. It's not fair to your brain, Nate.

190
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:11.760
Mary Kastner: The cell size can actually change if you keep going on and off medication.

191
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.200
Mary Kastner: So you don't want to do that.

192
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:15.960
Mary Kastner: Okay.

193
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.920

643
01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.700

Mary Kastner: You don't know what pain was for

645
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:15.720
Erika Sporleder: My legs. I would assume when I was pretty out of it, the whole thing. When I was in the hospital. I think I was missing three times a day. So I don't, I don't know what I would say.

651
01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:29.100
Erika Sporleder: And

652
01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:30.600
Mary Kastner: Did you have a plan.

653
01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:35.220
Erika Sporleder: No, I just, I just think it'd be it'd be better if I was the yourself and

654
01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.120
Mary Kastner: Your son temporarily out of your home.

655
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:49.530
Erika Sporleder: And he lives with his dad down, but I see him like Monday through Friday and we're just getting back now to where he can spit spit in the night again. But he did prior to that he was living with me.

656
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.430
Mary Kastner: Okay.

657
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.370
Erika Sporleder: But when all this all this psychosis and all the hallucinations happened.

658
01:08:54.510 --> 01:09:00.750
Erika Sporleder: And I was going to jail. I go into the hospitals and mental hospitals that they have maybe he took them away, which was the right you do

659
01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:08.400
Mary Kastner: Okay. So you haven't had any alcohol or math since that hospitalization.

660
01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.540
Erika Sporleder: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

661
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:14.070
Mary Kastner: Do you have any plans to stay abstinent

662
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:16.620
Erika Sporleder: Yeah, I mean I have had no problem with it.

663
01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:17.310
Mary Kastner: Okay.

664
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:22.230
Erika Sporleder: I think it was because I was not detoxing was easier when I was in the hospital. Yeah.

665
01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.220
Erika Sporleder: That's really good.

666
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.440
Erika Sporleder: I have no, not at this moment. No, I don't.

667
01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:31.290

668
01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:46.800
Mary Kastner: Okay, so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to just continue with our intake process. It sounds like you could benefit from a major tranquilizer. Just keep you from having the hallucinations.

669
01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.920
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm. And also from having

670
01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.780
Mary Kastner: The sleep problems because you would take this at night.

671
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.720
Mary Kastner: Okay, and it would, you know, help you

672
01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:01.860
Mary Kastner: stay asleep. Have you ever tried anything like

673
01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.250
Mary Kastner: Today,

674
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:10.590
Erika Sporleder: No, I think my, I think my second I just have to be on recipe for a little bit.

675
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:12.630
Mary Kastner: Had one one.

676
01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.610
Erika Sporleder: Lorazepam. Yeah.

677
01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:16.020
Mary Kastner: Yeah, that's to add a band.

678
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:18.210
Erika Sporleder: Oh, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah.

679
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:20.610
Mary Kastner: That's a minor tranquilizer. I'm thinking

680
01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.170
Mary Kastner: About more of a major one

681
01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:29.970
Mary Kastner: And I'm wondering if you're not a little bipolar. Has anybody ever told you that

682
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.650
Erika Sporleder: I think it went to my reports from my psychiatrist is that there's a possibility. Yeah.

683
01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:38.370
Mary Kastner: Yeah, anybody in your family with psychiatric or better.

684
01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:41.850
Erika Sporleder: Now, oh, my mom said the fan. I don't know my father's side of the family.

685
01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.660
Erika Sporleder: I have no clue on my mom's family. No.

686
01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:49.470
Mary Kastner: No. And how about brothers or sisters

687
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:50.550
Erika Sporleder: Parents

688
01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.470
Mary Kastner: Oh, you're an only child.

689
01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:57.240
Mary Kastner: Yes. Okay. And your parents have any medical or psychiatric problems.

690
01:10:57.510 --> 01:11:00.840
Erika Sporleder: My mom has cancer and she's diabetic. Okay.

691
01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.130
Mary Kastner: What kind of cancer.

692
01:11:05.610 --> 01:11:06.180
Leukemia

693
01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:07.830
Boy.

694
01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.330
Mary Kastner: But nobody has any substance abuse issues or

695
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.250
Erika Sporleder: I remember as a kid my mom used to use cocaine, but I don't think it was

696
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:30.300
Erika Sporleder: I wouldn't back that I didn't identify it. But now being an adult and having used it as I know now I look back I know that's where they will come out of the room sniffing and you know they locked me out. It makes sense. But I don't think it was a problem. So the last very long.

697
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.080
Mary Kastner: Okay.

698
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:32.910
Erika Sporleder: He was a phase that she was going through. I don't know.

699
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.820
Mary Kastner: So she might have used cocaine, but

700
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.900
Erika Sporleder: Yeah, she was using cocaine with her best friend. Yeah, but she never had any treatment for

701
01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.860
Erika Sporleder: This no not

702
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:42.390
Erika Sporleder: A problem.

703
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.310
Mary Kastner: Or any psychiatric problem.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.810
Erika Sporleder: No, not at all. Okay.

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.100
Mary Kastner: And your dad.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.020
Erika Sporleder: I don't. I've never met him.

707
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:51.540
Mary Kastner: I thought he came over and found you.

708
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.910
Erika Sporleder: Definitely. Well, he adopted me when I was a baby.

709
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:55.920

Erika Sporleder: Correct. Right.

717
01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.740
Mary Kastner: And suicide risk. I would say a

718
01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:34.170
Mary Kastner: Moderate because you have had some thoughts but absolutely no plan.

719
01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:35.850
Erika Sporleder: And, you know, no attempt. Now, you

720
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:39.600
Erika Sporleder: Have your thoughts are there with the wishing I wasn't year which would make

721
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:43.890
Erika Sporleder: It make everybody feel better if I wasn't here.

722
01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:46.470

Erika Sporleder: But I don't act on it. Yeah.

1053
01:33:24.690 --> 01:33:29.130
ethant: I went to use love I have one medical as my primary care.

1054
01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.080
ethant: Doctor

1055
01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:41.250
ethant: And I called them because I was over the weekend I was trying to detox myself like completely or as much as possible from

1056
01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.380
ethant: Multiple

1057
01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:46.320
ethant: Substances that I've been using

1058
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:54.030
ethant: And I it as the days went by my symptoms got worse and worse.

1059
01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:58.470
ethant: To the point where I was really kind of scared for my life.

1060
01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:08.880
ethant: I couldn't like I didn't have any appetite. I couldn't eat or use, use the restroom. When I did use the restroom. It was like bright yellow, yellow

1061
01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.020
ethant: So the

1062
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:26.370
ethant: One medical WAS CONCERNED. CONCERNED enough that even though they could see me at one of their offices, they told me to go to the ER at at UCSF.

1063
01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:29.610
ethant: Which I'm glad I did. They were really

1064
01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.690
ethant: It took a little while to get in but they were really excellent.

1065
01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:38.190
ethant: Like that. The doctors and nurses, they were really excellent.

1066
01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.210
ethant: So they referred, they

1067
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:48.660
ethant: Listened to my story which I can tell you about my more about my backstory.

1068
01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:50.730
ethant: Of it actually been

1069
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:56.100
ethant: Sober for more than 10 years of my of my life.

1070
01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:06.810
ethant: And then last year I had a surgery and and kind of went down a slippery slope. After the surgery and I've been struggling ever since.

1071
01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.210
Mary Kastner: Oh, kind of surgery.

1072
01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.390
ethant: So it was a brain surgery.

1073
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.910
ethant: I have a

1074
01:35:15.930 --> 01:35:18.900
ethant: Thing is called Chiari Malformation

1075
01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:19.380
Mary Kastner: Yes.

1076
01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:41.970
ethant: Yeah, so they went in the back of my the back of my spine and forget all the terms, but they they got the fluid flowing correctly, like all around my brain. Yeah, so, um, one thing that contributed contributes to all of this is, I have really serious migraine.

1077
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:44.700
ethant: Headaches

1078
01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:53.460
ethant: At the worst. They used to come, like, you know, it was like

1079
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:57.870
ethant: Seven plus seven to 10 days a month.

1080
01:35:59.010 --> 01:36:02.040
ethant: I was missing. Missing so much work in

1081
01:36:03.810 --> 01:36:11.940
ethant: The best. There are two medicines that we found that helped with that one medical one was sumatriptan

1082
01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:21.270
ethant: And the other miracle drug was Klonopin if I was on like a very low dose of Kalani open

1083
01:36:22.290 --> 01:36:27.900
ethant: And not taking it every day that taking like skipping. Skipping days.

1084
01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:33.780
ethant: And that somehow the variation of it. I'm

1085
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:40.290
ethant: Like I would go months and months and months and not having a single migraine day

1086
01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.480
ethant: So, um,

1087
01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:58.050
ethant: I started the, the use of these, all these subs and the other substances. I'm a little worried I'm concerned about privacy because the walls are paper thin I'm

1088
01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:00.840
Mary Kastner: Calling from

1089
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:14.310
ethant: I'm in my apartment. My wife is in the other room. And that's no problem. But there are other other units where you can. I don't know how well they can hear me, but I can certainly hear, hear them pretty well.

1090
01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:21.660
ethant: Um, I don't know if I can type certain things or

1091
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:30.420
Mary Kastner: Yeah, you could type it in. I think there's a chat. You can use at the bottom. Yeah, I'm

1092
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:34.380

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.260

1134
01:40:58.230 --> 01:40:58.920
Mary Kastner: Oh really,

1135
01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.440
Mary Kastner: So the anxiety, the worst anxiety, you've ever had.

1136
01:41:10.050 --> 01:41:10.860

1137
01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:18.960
ethant: Eight, you know, eight to nine scale, the worst I've ever had. You talking about right this very minute

1138
01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:21.720
ethant: Yeah i mean it's it's high

1139
01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:32.070
ethant: Okay, I would the whole process of connecting with your guys system. I was like terrified that something wasn't going to work or it wasn't doing something correctly.

1140
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:35.700
Mary Kastner: Yeah, yeah. And how about depression, where do you put your depression.

1141
01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:57.960
ethant: It's funny, it's hard for me to to separate the two. Sometimes, but I don't actually don't feel particularly depress actually feel like I have a fairly positive, you know, positive outlook on on life. And I love my family and have good relationships.

1142
01:41:59.490 --> 01:42:00.210
Stuff like that.

1143
01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:11.730

Mary Kastner: Yeah, I think it. I think it's 20. So you've been taking that pretty routinely. Yeah, okay.

1150
01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:46.380
Mary Kastner: And you think it's helping you.

1151
01:42:47.130 --> 01:42:53.580
ethant: But yeah, that helps. Um, that that's always helped my depression. I've taken that for for a long time. Okay.

1152

Mary Kastner: Yeah.

1160
01:43:34.230 --> 01:43:37.020
ethant: The problem is the stuff that I get myself.

Mary Kastner: Okay, now I'm gonna look at what you just put me gave me here in the chat room. Yep, your audit. I'm talking to myself because I'm talking to the person doing the transcribing so you can correct me if I'm wrong. I have you on forgot it. See score was zero, meaning you're not using alcohol.

Mary Kastner: Are you having any pain right now.

1272
01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:30.540
Mary Kastner: No. Okay, so this is the withdraw scale score, which is the seat.

01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:57.990

1307
01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:58.620

ethant: I mean,

1312
01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:33.720
ethant: How do I learn about my prescription at Walgreens like

1313
01:57:34.290 --> 01:57:37.680
Mary Kastner: I don't know, do they, do they, do they typically

1314
01:57:38.850 --> 01:57:39.660
Mary Kastner: Let you know

1315
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:45.630
ethant: Sometimes I get a notification that I have a prescription right ready, but it's not like 100%

1316
01:57:46.650 --> 01:57:47.040
Mm hmm.

1317
01:57:49.050 --> 01:57:59.100
Mary Kastner: You can call them, I guess, and find out. I said, check in a group, this afternoon about quarter to four. Yeah, and

1318
01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:00.720
ethant: Then

1319
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:11.850
Mary Kastner: Make an appointment with me call back into the in the office here. The what they call the virtual clinic and make an appointment for me, Nick for next Monday.

1320
01:58:12.210 --> 01:58:12.540
ethant: Okay.

1321
01:58:12.810 --> 01:58:14.700
Mary Kastner: We're gonna finish our intake.

1322
01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.800
Mary Kastner: And I'm putting this in right now.

1323
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.600
ethant: Great. So are we going to do any treatment in terms of the

1324
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:30.960
ethant: The Xanax, that's the one that I'm particularly concerned about

1325
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:34.020
Mary Kastner: Yeah, how often are you taking that now.

1326
01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:39.120
ethant: So that was 44 milligrams a day two in the morning and at night.

1327
01:58:40.290 --> 01:58:45.930
ethant: That's been for months, you know, I don't know, six, eight months that I've been taking not

1328
01:58:47.940 --> 01:59:01.710
Mary Kastner: Gonna have to when you on that. Just so you know it is a typical street drug. It is an anti anxiety medication oftentimes abused, because it um

1329
01:59:03.150 --> 01:59:20.760
Mary Kastner: It is is quick acting and then it's quick quickly gone. So then you need more and more and more. I'm the only deaths that we've had with Suboxone known deaths are those that are using it in conjunction with a Xanax type medication or pens or die as a p

1330
01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:21.630
ethant: O. C.

1331
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:28.020
Mary Kastner: We don't typically like people on Suboxone on a benzodiazepine

1332
01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.640
Mary Kastner: I see. However,

1333
01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:34.110
Mary Kastner: We can just cold turkey, you

1334
01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:38.940
Mary Kastner: Right and the libertarian they gave you is gonna last a while.

1335
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:46.050
Mary Kastner: It may be last three days, very, very long acting. Okay, so I would not take any

1336
01:59:51.810 --> 01:59:53.700
Mary Kastner: Other benzodiazepine

1337
01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:01.410
Mary Kastner: Okay, unless you absolutely felt the need. I'm going to give you Klonopin it's a much longer acting. Okay.

1338
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:06.870
Mary Kastner: And when they feel to Klonopin for your headache. I can't remember. Was it a one milligram

1339
02:00:08.190 --> 02:00:10.380
Mary Kastner: It wasn't that wasn't one milligram. No.

1340
02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:16.110
Mary Kastner: Okay, so I'm just going to say PRN not daily as you need it. So,

02:18:08.310 --> 02:18:21.600
Deborah Preslar: What I call normal which isn't normal to somebody else. I don't do anything because my knee hurts so bad, even on the Norco. That's why I say I don't really miss an ortho because it really doesn't do that much for me. I mean, you're getting going. That's as far as it'll go you know

1507
02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:25.740

1562
02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:34.110
Deborah Preslar: a panic attack usually hit me when I'm

1563
02:23:35.250 --> 02:23:44.250
Deborah Preslar: A family member or friend. That's something of me and I can't produce it. You know, like a chore, or whatever it might be because of my health reasons I it's either too much pain.

1564
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:51.930
Deborah Preslar: It's mostly the pain, the pain keeps you from wanting to do things and doing things and I'll have an anxiety attack because I'm mad at the situation.

1565
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.770
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

1566
02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:55.200

02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:21.450
Deborah Preslar: To many evenings days over to urgent care didn't get it with my heart or whatever. Right. You know what was going on.

1571
02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:32.970
Deborah Preslar: So they would send me home with you know after sort of Ambien or add an Ambien and Ben and a, I guess, as a de stressor, and I'd be fine.

1572
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:41.040

02:26:14.130 --> 02:26:14.580
Deborah Preslar: What's like

1592
02:26:16.470 --> 02:26:18.180

1598
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.700
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I think you're doing fine. I'm just wondering

1599
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:49.350
Mary Kastner: If I were you, I would take the tuba.

1600
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:54.840
Mary Kastner: Twice to twice a day.

1601
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:56.130
Like he suggested

1602
02:26:57.210 --> 02:26:58.140
Deborah Preslar: Also trying like

1603
02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:04.350
Mary Kastner: And then I also like your idea of moving your Gavin Penton to the bedtime.

1604
02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:08.790
Mary Kastner: And you could actually take

1605
02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:11.940
Mary Kastner: Three to four those at bedtime.

1606
02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:20.190
Deborah Preslar: Yeah, I knew, I knew I could. The reason why I wasn't taken so many nighttime was my ability to walk. I have to go to the bathroom.

1607
02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:21.390
Deborah Preslar: I see I can keep

1608
02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:30.240
Deborah Preslar: On going to take to I can wake up to the bathroom. I can do to the Gabba pin at the same time, I can get up every three or four hours.

1609
02:27:30.540 --> 02:27:37.830
Deborah Preslar: Or less to go to the bathroom. I'll take my government. And then, but I don't like the idea of a bunch of them up like that because the way I sleep. I have to walk.

1610
02:27:38.370 --> 02:27:40.020
Mary Kastner: How many hours of sleep. Are you getting

1611
02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:44.970
Deborah Preslar: Last night I got a good four hours and another three

1612
02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:49.830
Deborah Preslar: I think only woke up once, go to the bathroom, which is unusual for me.

1613
02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:50.670
Okay.

1614
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:59.820

02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:05.100
Deborah Preslar: Caregiver toilet here. It's on a bucket.

02:28:07.050 --> 02:28:19.560
Deborah Preslar: I wait till either my brother can empty or if I can empty it I don't let it get real, for I just, you know, through the night or whatever every two days, maybe it's a it's just P i don't worry about it too much, you know, but

1618
02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:23.790
Deborah Preslar: I have been using a bucket down for about a month and a half.

1619
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:26.970
Mary Kastner: Okay. Is your brother living with you or dizzy check

1620
02:28:26.970 --> 02:28:27.720
Deborah Preslar: In oh

1621
02:28:28.350 --> 02:28:30.540
Deborah Preslar: No, he lives in a trailer Outback

1622
02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:34.290
Deborah Preslar: Uh huh. Him and His caregiver, my brother has cured. Your also but

1623
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:44.820
Deborah Preslar: David doesn't have. I don't expect you to MTA. I just did it once or twice when it was kind of heavy for me. I wasn't feeling good.

1624
02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:53.070
Deborah Preslar: It's almost impossible for me to lift anything in the morning. Yeah, I just, I, I'm not supposed to be lifting anything heavy anyway because the spinal stenosis.

1625
02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:56.430
Deborah Preslar: Yeah, but then they just found out that I have a

1626
02:28:59.070 --> 02:29:00.960
Deborah Preslar: Distance really bad in my lower back.

1627
02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:01.680
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

1628
02:29:01.770 --> 02:29:02.070
Are

1629
02:29:03.150 --> 02:29:05.970
Mary Kastner: They gonna do any surgeries on your near your back.

1630
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:08.430
Deborah Preslar: Well, I mean, I'm leading

1631
02:29:09.690 --> 02:29:18.240
Deborah Preslar: From I finally got a doctor who's willing to accept partnership yes expects a bunch of crap out of me. Um, he's going to

1632
02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:27.900
Deborah Preslar: I'm waiting for Justin to co to send a referral this Dr Asante I had a doctor all lined up, but it wasn't working out.

1633
02:29:29.310 --> 02:29:32.790
Deborah Preslar: I was going over there, a lot and he wasn't giving me any

1634
02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:40.560
Deborah Preslar: Scheduled 30 days or anything. So I found another doctor the same outfit Asante in

1635
02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:55.530
Deborah Preslar: Progress testimony and he doesn't do that he either tells you it's gonna take you on or do the surgery or what he does Mr around about it. Um, but I'm fairly certain that I'll probably be seeing him for the knee relatively soon.

1636
02:29:56.340 --> 02:29:57.060
Mary Kastner: Okay, good.

1637
02:29:58.470 --> 02:30:05.550
Deborah Preslar: That back, they don't want to do any surgery and killing it can figure out think eliminate the pain. I've undergone an epidural injection on

1638
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:09.180
Deborah Preslar: December know December, I'm

1639
02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:19.500
Deborah Preslar: Jeff really easy on my dates. I don't remember a moment, but I just had an epidural injection within the last month and a half or so. Anyway, I went in Saturday.

1640
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:22.620
Deborah Preslar: For my checkup for

1641
02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:36.240
Deborah Preslar: After you know whatever they call it chicken and after you've had a procedure done. And he said, my oxygen levels. Good luck for everything was good. We discussed my back and

1642
02:30:37.260 --> 02:30:40.770
Deborah Preslar: They're going to do another epidural injection because they've taken as well as he had hoped.

1643
02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:47.760
Deborah Preslar: And as far as the egos he offered me two different solutions if I can't get surgery. Either they're gonna put some duping money.

1644
02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:55.800
Deborah Preslar: That's all he said goop is something where they put school and your knee, it kind of helps us a false false some shock absorber for it.

1645
02:30:56.310 --> 02:31:05.820
Deborah Preslar: Or they're going to go in and put an go in and get on my nerves are somehow blocked my going to my knee so that I'm not experiencing such excruciating pain.

1646
02:31:07.650 --> 02:31:16.860
Deborah Preslar: But the problem is so much pain anymore. It pops out any given moment. And it's excruciating yet, but I can't use my legs for at least a day and a half after pops out

1647
02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:26.400
Deborah Preslar: It's been doing it more and more all the time. So I don't want to put a nerf blocker in there. And then how many go out and I may not know what to do because I can't feel any pain.

1648
02:31:26.850 --> 02:31:39.360
Deborah Preslar: Where I don't know. So, I mean, I don't know. I'm just like you and I don't anyway. But I'm not seeing any other doctors, other than Dr. M stands for and he's the one that's been doing the the epidural injections and stuff.

1649
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:40.080
Okay.

1650
02:31:41.130 --> 02:31:47.460
Mary Kastner: Whatever. What I'm gonna do is check with our, our program to see

1651
02:31:48.690 --> 02:31:52.380
Mary Kastner: What we can offer as far as his pain goes

1652
02:31:53.340 --> 02:32:03.780
Deborah Preslar: Well, will I be able to get what I was under the assumption or maybe I just took him too much, but I was told that I could probably get a prescription for Suboxone by today.

1653
02:32:04.410 --> 02:32:05.430
Deborah Preslar: Yeah, true.

1654
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:08.850
Mary Kastner: Well for pain. The

1655
02:32:10.050 --> 02:32:13.380
Mary Kastner: Suboxone derivative is called be trans

1656
02:32:14.610 --> 02:32:15.180
And you're like,

1657
02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:19.110
Mary Kastner: Yeah, you said you tried that and it didn't work.

1658
02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:22.050
Deborah Preslar: The matches the pain patches.

1659
02:32:22.290 --> 02:32:23.820
Mary Kastner: Yeah, so

1660
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:27.660
Deborah Preslar: And I, but I've tried to Suboxone and it didn't make me feel that way.

1661
02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:32.700
Mary Kastner: Yeah, it is illegal to prescribe Suboxone for pain.

1662
02:32:33.930 --> 02:32:35.010
Mary Kastner: You need to have

1663
02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:39.570
Deborah Preslar: A. I don't understand, because that's what they told me I was getting Suboxone for

1664
02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:42.660
Mary Kastner: Yeah Suboxone is treatment.

1665
02:32:43.950 --> 02:32:47.010
Mary Kastner: For opioid dependence or

1666
02:32:47.820 --> 02:32:52.650
Deborah Preslar: I think that's why I think that's why they wanted me on next. They don't want me taking the narcos anymore.

1667
02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:53.820
Deborah Preslar: Yeah, I don't have

1668
02:32:55.050 --> 02:33:00.000
Mary Kastner: So that you know I'm just going to check with our medical director and

1669
02:33:03.180 --> 02:33:03.810
Deborah Preslar: Your middle name.

1670
02:33:03.930 --> 02:33:05.820
Mary Kastner: Your middle name is Lynn right

Deborah Preslar: Yes, that's correct. Right.

Deborah Preslar: Basically killing me. You're not going to give me a nice to Boston for my thing.

1673
02:33:11.610 --> 02:33:15.750
Mary Kastner: Not right now. Until I check out if we can do that.

1674
02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:26.760
Deborah Preslar: Well, if you don't have them all these other people get thing I have five people I talked to yesterday that I know personally. It was getting squashed it for pain.

1675
02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:29.190
Mary Kastner: That's interesting.

1676
02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:38.970
Deborah Preslar: I don't understand, because that's what they told me I was getting it for it. That's what Dr. Pearson said. He said, we're going to get used to boxing for pain relief. That's what he said.

1677
02:33:40.050 --> 02:33:41.070
Mary Kastner: Well, like I said,

1678
02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:42.540
Deborah Preslar: I'm making it up.

1679
02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:47.280
Mary Kastner: They could prove me wrong on this, I need to check with the medical director

1680
02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:57.630
Deborah Preslar: Well, this got me really upset because I hate kids keep putting I keep getting put on the back burner for my page and I keep getting denied. And I'd like to know why.

1681
02:33:57.870 --> 02:34:02.160
Mary Kastner: Yeah, well, the pain treatment is pure trance. The Cymbalta

1682
02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:04.080
Mary Kastner: The Gabba Penton

1683
02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:15.150
Mary Kastner: The flexor, those are all appropriate pain medications, but we don't use Suboxone for that. Now, I could be wrong. That's why I'm checking with

1684
02:34:16.350 --> 02:34:17.490
Mary Kastner: With the program.

1685
02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:21.270
Mary Kastner: Is they should have given you that information up front.

1686
02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:33.360
Deborah Preslar: They all they told me was, was that when he gave me the number for you guys. They said that that was to be treated for my pain and no I wouldn't need anything else, once I got out of the box. Did I went

1687
02:34:33.570 --> 02:34:34.530
Deborah Preslar: North hills or anything.

1688
02:34:34.860 --> 02:34:40.110
Deborah Preslar: Yet he said not to take more goes to the same time as you're watching it will make you very sick. Besides that, it's

1689
02:34:40.410 --> 02:34:52.020
Deborah Preslar: blocking agent in it, it will block any opiates put in your system while you're on it and it will make you sick. And I will. I don't have a problem without quit normals all together. I just getting them too much pain. I mean,

1690
02:34:54.510 --> 02:34:54.930
Mary Kastner: Yeah.

1691
02:34:54.990 --> 02:35:00.600
Mary Kastner: Well, I don't, don't get too upset yet until we know the doors closed on this. I've got to ask

1692
02:35:04.530 --> 02:35:07.860
Deborah Preslar: Well, I don't know, I just, I feel like I'm getting the runaround

1693
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:16.110
Deborah Preslar: I've been trying to get on Suboxone for two months and I and my phone was all acting up and it wouldn't let me get into you guys

1694
02:35:16.350 --> 02:35:20.160
Deborah Preslar: So I've been waiting for you guys to call me. I didn't get a call. So I finally got a number for somebody else.

1695
02:35:20.610 --> 02:35:27.180
Deborah Preslar: Who's on it and they told me, and Dr. Pearson wanted to focus on it yet or not. And I said, No, but I'm going to try really hard today to do that.

1696
02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:38.730
Deborah Preslar: As well. I've been trying. I've been on the phone all morning trying to get this great now and now I'm told that I may not get it because it's not giving out for a. That was the sole reason why they give me this information to begin with.

1697
02:35:40.290 --> 02:35:43.410
Deborah Preslar: I have a right to be upset because I feel like I'm getting the runaround

1698
02:35:43.950 --> 02:35:46.350
Mary Kastner: Yeah, it sounds like it.

1699
02:35:49.530 --> 02:35:50.340
Deborah Preslar: Okay, well,

1700
02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:53.370
Mary Kastner: Trans made you

02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:56.970
Deborah Preslar: Are you talking about the packages now.

1702
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.570
Mary Kastner: Yeah, no.

1703
02:35:58.260 --> 02:36:01.770
Mary Kastner: Yeah, you said what did. What did that do for you, nothing.

1704
02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:13.710
Deborah Preslar: It made me sick. It made me feel like I'm I mean it first. It worked. It worked pretty good at first, and then it made me feel like I wanted to go out and get some math, like I was chosen for a mess.

1705
02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:25.800
Deborah Preslar: And I didn't like that feeling. So I called the clinic, cuz I'm going to stop taking it. Get the patch or off the not to move them on anymore. That's when I had to go see another doctor, Dr. Pearson and he put me through to thought right heart.

1706
02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:33.840
Deborah Preslar: And he said, we need to get your pain I'm taking care of this. What we're gonna do we're gonna have you go through this company and they'll give you the prescription that you need.

1707
02:36:34.380 --> 02:36:45.030
Deborah Preslar: Okay, that's exactly what he said you could call him over there today. If you want to ask him, but that's Dr. Pearson. He's the one who prescribed me to Suboxone or said he'll I get a prescription for it.

1708
02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:48.810
Mary Kastner: Yeah, I'm just writing that down so we can get to the answer here.

1709
02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:59.040
Deborah Preslar: His he is in a wheelchair. He has Parkinson's or something. He hasn't debilitating disease in a wheelchair. He doesn't have the bodily functions for his head.

1710
02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:07.590
Deborah Preslar: He has a helper and his helper said because I said, What am I supposed to do for you know this box. And he said, that's what it is, is a painkiller.

1711
02:37:08.730 --> 02:37:17.400
Deborah Preslar: It will help you get through what you're going through the fibromyalgia and the spinal stenosis and everything else and you won't have to. You can't take any normals with it.

1712
02:37:17.850 --> 02:37:25.290
Deborah Preslar: You have to just take it and I've talked to five different people. They all said the same thing. They're getting it for pain and it's helped him like night and day.

1713
02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:34.290
Deborah Preslar: From their God. They weren't taking any more knuckles are invited and whatever. And he was strictly on Suboxone doing wonders for them and they are, they're the ones that company.

1714
02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:41.160
Deborah Preslar: You're boosting me into getting getting on here as who's like cancel. I could be like them. I'm not gonna suffer every day, like I am.

Mary Kastner: Okay, so I'm sending this to

1718
02:38:04.410 --> 02:38:09.180
Mary Kastner: To the medical director. I'm hoping that we get any answer for you.

1719
02:38:25.290 --> 02:38:25.650
Deborah Preslar: Today,

1720
02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:28.380
Deborah Preslar: Your pain and you

1721
02:38:29.940 --> 02:38:30.240
Deborah Preslar: Really

1722
02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:34.140
Deborah Preslar: Don't

1723
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:37.590
Mary Kastner: So I'm Deborah.

1724
02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:39.660
Mary Kastner: You're breaking

1725
02:38:41.700 --> 02:38:42.240
Mary Kastner: Deborah.

1726
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:48.360
Deborah Preslar: Yeah.

1727
02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:56.490
Mary Kastner: Okay. Um, so that I sent this off. We're going to try to get any here yeah I sent this off. We're going to try to get an

1728
02:38:56.490 --> 02:38:57.960
Deborah Preslar: Answer for you and

1729
02:38:59.580 --> 02:39:00.660
Mary Kastner: Yes, something happened.

1730
02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:01.320
Deborah Preslar: Cutting out

1731
02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:04.020
Mary Kastner: Something happened to connection.

1732
02:39:05.730 --> 02:39:06.900
Deborah Preslar: So, okay, now

1733
02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:15.150
Mary Kastner: Okay, so I sent this to the medical director in the program director. We're going to try to get an answer and get back to you later today.

1734
02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:18.540
Deborah Preslar: I'm like, Okay.

1735
02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:25.980
Mary Kastner: Because right now, I, my hands are tied because that's not what Suboxone issues for

1736
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:34.980
Deborah Preslar: That just doesn't make any sense to me because every person I talked to one of them was having surgery on her hand and he said he probably wouldn't have been from there on out.

1737
02:39:35.730 --> 02:39:41.250
Deborah Preslar: She, she's on Suboxone my other friend she was. She has severe back pain.

1738
02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:54.660
Deborah Preslar: Then she had a herniated disc and so they put her on Suboxone for the pain, the other one had it had a surgery on her leg and prior to your habits are on her like she's done a lot of pain. So they put her on Suboxone. See, I'm good. I'm totally confused.

1739
02:39:55.530 --> 02:40:00.090
Mary Kastner: Yeah I am, too, because I'm either they're not telling you the whole story.

1740
02:40:00.690 --> 02:40:16.260
Deborah Preslar: You know as to why people I know these people. And I know which ones had an opiate problem and with which ones didn't. Yeah. And what did he, he knows me well I know that she didn't tell me if that was what the problem was.

1741
02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:25.800
Deborah Preslar: But yes, I have an opiate addiction, I suppose, because if I can't get any other help. I go to the north coast.

1742
02:40:26.610 --> 02:40:27.120
Mary Kastner: Mm hmm.

1743
02:40:28.140 --> 02:40:34.530
Deborah Preslar: I guess I am addicted, because I know that they'll work, to a certain degree, it just don't work like this washing does

1744
02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:48.360
Mary Kastner: Okay.

1745
02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:53.970
Mary Kastner: So I sent a note, hopefully I'll get back to you later today.

1746
02:40:55.140 --> 02:40:56.970
Mary Kastner: Or someone in the program well

1747
02:40:59.370 --> 02:41:04.620
Deborah Preslar: It has to be today. Okay, I just, just make a note, I cannot be reached on Wednesday, because I haven't

1748
02:41:05.130 --> 02:41:18.690
Deborah Preslar: dental appointment up in Brookings and that's that takes up half my day. And then I have to be there for when they're taking my puppy and for her. Her shots and stuff so I won't be in here that afternoon either Wednesday.
