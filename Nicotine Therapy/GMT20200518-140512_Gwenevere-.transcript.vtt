Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, thank you. It's nice to get me out of the white everyone smile isn't it.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.010
Alicia Noedel: Is looks very angelic that you

9
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

10
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.460
Alicia Noedel: It's very fitting

11
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I want to get out of that color, just for today, try something else.

12
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.370
Gwenevere Abriel: I got this morons sweater that I like to wear. I thought I'd read this with it.

13
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.560
Alicia Noedel: Your glasses matched to your, your usually purple or they

14
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been. I couldn't find my blue ones. These are a little strong

15
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I think they were set for me standing back a little further for my screen. So it does, they will be a little sore later today. I can't find my little ones.

16
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.770
Alicia Noedel: I had to order some new ones because my prescription. It's like two years old.

17
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.400
Alicia Noedel: So I ordered two new ones.

18
00:01:41.700 --> 00:02:03.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, good, good, quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter. I was thinking about all my clients. This week all y'all doing your gardening and doing your, your first attempt and learnings and was working with concrete and I am clueless concrete behaves. All of them so differently.

19
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.080
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm yes I'm used to plaster I I use you know this texture paint and I've

20
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.210
Alicia Noedel: Done really different, though, super dad is

21
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:27.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Very different. And so the first level was quick dry. So I would mix it. So that was I wanted to die. This is a month ago I did the quick dry month ago I did perfect, but I didn't know that it was when they say quick

22
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.230
Alicia Noedel: It's fast.

23
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Rapid set like what the. So, that was making me cry. Then, but I did it. I did it by by myself, because no one's helping me so I have to mix it and do it.

24
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.270
Gwenevere Abriel: So that that was stressful.

25
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.790
Alicia Noedel: So anyway, like mixing it, it wouldn't dry as fast, but of course you have to stop what you're doing.

26
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.170
Alicia Noedel: Pick it up during it.

27
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I would had to take it by hand because it was underneath a sliding glass door a huge one like picture.

28
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture for and underneath that they had used, would it rot it so I had to stuff it in there and I didn't know it got hot. I didn't. It ended up expanding and it put I don't even wanna talk about anyway. So that was my first attempt at learning

29
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.390
Alicia Noedel: Your house. You did that on your house.

30
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So then, so this weekend. I did note that it was raining this whole time. I didn't know I should have locked

31
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Then I did just 16 grit concrete.

32
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:48.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. This time, I was like, Okay, I know it's not going to be that rapid said, I'll be okay because I had experimented what how to do knock down but so it is, but the vertical. So there's only this much space right about like that long strip of it underneath where blah, blah, blah. Just replace

33
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It proceeded to thunderstorm.

34
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.220
Alicia Noedel: Oh, gosh.

35
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.550
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, it's crazy that there's

36
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.830
Alicia Noedel: No way to set concrete like that either.

37
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I persevered. I was like, all I said, well, if I start stressing out. I know my brain work won't work. Right, so I'm just like,

38
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:25.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what do you do, I had to literally step back, because what I thought I had done for preparation work which is I had this tarp down and all of the dry concrete that fell out as I was making a mass was now wet and about to go over my deck.

39
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.090
Alicia Noedel: Oh no, oh gosh that's Suggs

40
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Like, and I'm dressed right

41
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.810
And I

42
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.140
Gwenevere Abriel: I have all these tools. All concrete out there, my bag is submit everything

43
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.080
Alicia Noedel: That's horrible. I'm so sorry. Glenn.

44
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:57.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Pick up the bag, put that in the driest place, which was inside drugs, a concrete under shelter took the whole wet bag drug it out kind of made like a

45
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Hold the sides up and all that water.

46
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Onto water.

47
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And then when the sun cleared went back out, did it again.

48
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And it did it again.

49
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.600
Alicia Noedel: Oh my god.

50
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I was thinking about you guys. I was like, I'm gonna do it because this is what I've been talking about. And I just want to sit here and cry.

51
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:33.930
Alicia Noedel: That checks about all four of those questions on that one situation bravery, you know,

52
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:44.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Tony and I mean just just weird things like then last night. Right. So it's storming and I'm like, I want to give it a chance to dry this because it's going to take like a week or so to set and

53
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:57.390
Gwenevere Abriel: It kept reading. And so then going out with bags and then I'm like, Well, those are filled up with water, then it will dress in a poking holes in the bottom. So then it can drain, but at least is protected. I was just my

54
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I was a problem solver.

55
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: So know

56
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.510
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a little story. Just to let you know that I'm doing the same thing. You guys are

57
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.730
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, brain everywhere.

58
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.840
Gwenevere Abriel: What did you do this weekend.

59
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.920
Alicia Noedel: Um, they my, my aunt and uncle came over to finish the door.

60
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.410
Alicia Noedel: On Friday, the day after. Yeah, the day after group.

61
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:37.380
Alicia Noedel: We tried to go outside in the morning and throw the trash and we were locked in our door knob wasn't put on right

62
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.370
Alicia Noedel: And so it was

63
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.810
Alicia Noedel: Wasn't turning

64
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:52.890
Alicia Noedel: Geez. So I took it apart and I put back together with a grown man who said he knew everything put on and put it on. Perfect. And we haven't had any problems that they

65
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.090
Girl.

66
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.960
Alicia Noedel: And we put on the screen. They put on the screen door but um

67
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.820
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, we did that and my plants everything sprouting now.

68
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.250
Alicia Noedel: Outside and inside

69
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.680
Alicia Noedel: Oh that's well yeah

70
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.580
Alicia Noedel: The corn is like super high. It's crazy.

71
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.990
Alicia Noedel: But that's pretty much it.

72
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:34.590
Gwenevere Abriel: How have you been thinking about, you know, doing a big piece of work around sort of that maintaining your inner truth, while in the presence of your mother. What are you noticing about that work.

73
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.130
Alicia Noedel: Um,

74
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.120
Alicia Noedel: You had a little bump the other day.

75
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me about it.

76
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.440
Alicia Noedel: We were in the kitchen cleaning like

77
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:59.730
Alicia Noedel: Seven o'clock at night and I was talking to her about how it's really nice to eat whatever we want, whenever you are

78
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:09.900
Alicia Noedel: Because when I was a kid, we couldn't do that. You know, we didn't have the money we and I couldn't eat cereal. I did o'clock at night. If I wanted, because there wasn't even cereal for the morning

79
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:29.010
Alicia Noedel: Baby, and I was just talking about it and she, I guess, you know, I didn't, I'm really good at reading people and she was washing dishes and I was walking around trying to clean and so I guess I didn't, you know, see her facial expressions or body movement, whatever. But I guess I

80
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.170
Alicia Noedel: I I've never, I've talked to her about it so many times.

81
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.440
Alicia Noedel: And I've never gotten this kind of pushback from her before.

82
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:48.810
Alicia Noedel: But a little while later, I was washing the BP bottles and I guess I'd lost. I lost one under something under her crib.

83
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:59.280
Alicia Noedel: And so it was kind of like old like on the inside like there was still milking it and so she ruined to this bottle and like started making it bigger deal like it wasn't about the bottle.

84
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:14.670
Alicia Noedel: Right. And I was like, It's okay, Mom, you know, I said, Oh, sorry. Let's just move on. Let's get over it and she was like, oh, says the person who reminds me every day. How hard of a life she had

85
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.880
Alicia Noedel: Like over

86
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now how did, how did that make you feel right there. What was

87
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.330
Gwenevere Abriel: The AMA. I know it's complicated, but

88
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.930
To

89
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me.

90
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.660
Alicia Noedel: Industry me

91
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:34.530
Alicia Noedel: It really hurt me at the moment at the exact moment I was very upset. I didn't show it.

92
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.120
Alicia Noedel: I just kinda like I was all I said, Wow, that's all I said

93
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.280
Alicia Noedel: Okay, you need to clean and I didn't address it that night.

94
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

95
00:09:52.650 --> 00:10:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: We are starting nice and early today. We have plenty of time. Do you want to do. I'm pretty sure we have all the setup for em, Dr. If you could have a little

96
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:18.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me just make sure I've got all your protective figures and you've got to save space and I see got an anchor room develops not quite done yet. But we've got distancing metaphor container protective figures.

97
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

98
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: What if we did some em Dr today around that.

99
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.490
Alicia Noedel: That's what you want to do ready

100
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.430
Alicia Noedel: Okay. Am I gonna cry probably

101
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.630
Gwenevere Abriel: This actually takes some really specific preparation. So the phone will have to be set down don't don't feel rushed

102
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't feel rushed by it.

103
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And then we want to have to sort of

104
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.150
Alicia Noedel: All the same thing we did

105
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, this

106
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Right you know about shoulder width apart from the phone.

107
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:59.970
Gwenevere Abriel: But this one, if we have done it. And we probably did a positive installation of those protective team.

108
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.220
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

109
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Probably ended up feeling

110
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:09.360
Alicia Noedel: I have to clean up. I need to get a trash bag in here because you make me cry so much I have tissues all over

111
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.340
Gwenevere Abriel: The body.

112
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Nobody said therapy was easy.

113
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.790
Alicia Noedel: There's physical and metaphorical messages.

114
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.700
Alicia Noedel: Okay, I think I'm ready.

115
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.110
Okay.

116
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's see.

117
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:51.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's go to. I'm going to keep a little bit of note. Let me make sure you've got those two. You've got the two containers about shoulder

118
00:11:51.840 --> 00:12:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: shoulder width apart. Okay, you've got me right in the center, so that if I were to point. Let me just see where your eyes go from left to right. So I can see if we're getting enough

119
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Distance. So they're literally there, right, the left and right in the phone.

120
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.270
Alicia Noedel: Because one phone up there.

121
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So here's what you want.

122
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:23.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Your hand on. There we go. Yeah, you want to have me dead center in front so that when I do this, then the eyes do this.

123
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:24.510
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

124
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You want to experience. Otherwise it's

125
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not getting the bilateral experience.

126
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.320
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I think I got it.

127
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.640
Okay.

128
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just checking. I can definitely be wrong. Is it possible that that left one is a little bit closer to your center your bodies that possible.

129
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.700
Gwenevere Abriel: They're literally right in front of you like this.

130
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:53.220
Alicia Noedel: It's not perfectly parallel with the right one is what it is. It's a little higher.

131
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.530
Alicia Noedel: Oh, water your water bottle, though.

132
00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I'm not too worried about the height. I'm more worried that that when you bring

133
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.920
Alicia Noedel: Is

134
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.930
Alicia Noedel: A little closer to me.

135
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:05.550
Alicia Noedel: There, I'm

136
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Not I'm not too worried about that part what I'm worried about is that left

137
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.360
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't see you looking left. That's my concern.

138
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think it is a matter of

139
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.340
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't normally have this much difficulty. I wonder what I'm doing wrong.

140
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a

141
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:26.850
Alicia Noedel: Little bit.

142
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe you're sitting back too far, it should only be wrist to nose distance, then I might be able to get more of a, of an eye movement. Now, let me see.

143
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.360
Alicia Noedel: I'm kind of off center with the camera, too.

144
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, that might okay see. So I mean, because I would typically

145
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.430
The wall.

146
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, all right. I should see. So now you look left and right.

147
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, your eyes are in the center. I don't think it's going to work today. I'm sorry, I don't want to take a chance

148
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.220
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

149
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:10.800
Gwenevere Abriel: For some reason, whenever your eyes go to the left there just center, they're not going left like this.

150
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.720
Alicia Noedel: They might be too close.

151
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.760
Alicia Noedel: I mean, I'm too far. Let's see.

152
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, so

153
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.980
Alicia Noedel: Still doing the same thing.

154
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.240
Gwenevere Abriel: No, no, that's better.

155
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: But I also don't want to strain. So somewhere between that and sitting all the way back somewhere between. They're like, can you be comfortable. I know it's asking a lot so sorry. Okay.

156
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that I think is going to get it. Alright, so we're going to go with that.

157
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.590
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's work on a target. One of the things you just said is

158
00:14:53.250 --> 00:15:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Something that I've seen kind of keep repeating. And I want to ask you this hurt that you felt is that sad is the emotion sad when she said that passive aggressive comment to you.

159
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.840
Alicia Noedel: In a way. Yeah.

160
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, you tell me sad. But it's a combination of sad and something else, maybe

161
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.220
Alicia Noedel: I'm I feel

162
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.320
Alicia Noedel: Defeated

163
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.160
Alicia Noedel: At the moment, oh no, right now, but

164
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.680
Alicia Noedel: When it happened. Yeah.

165
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.660
Alicia Noedel: I felt

166
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:41.610
Alicia Noedel: Really sad. I wasn't angry. I was really talking back like very

167
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.110
Alicia Noedel: It wasn't expecting it.

168
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.870
Alicia Noedel: So it caught me off guard.

169
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:50.880
Alicia Noedel: Really bad

170
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.430
Alicia Noedel: Surprised, yes.

171
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, because normally you could see her an effect. And normally, but you weren't seeing her face because you are busy cleaning so

172
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:07.320
Alicia Noedel: We talked about it so many times that she and she's never ever responded that way.

173
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:16.020
Alicia Noedel: Um, I'm sure you know, it could have been a combination of know it's the end of the day, you know, they had just came fixed the door, whatever.

174
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.860
Okay.

175
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.230
Gwenevere Abriel: make excuses for not in here. You get to let it out. You can be just

176
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.790
Alicia Noedel: Say that

177
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:42.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You know that that. So let's stay with what your experience was, which was this really sad and the additional part of really surprised you couldn't ready your emotional self or even your physical body for was to brace yourself for what's about to come

178
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: I think you thought things are fine.

179
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, came out of the blue.

180
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.490
Alicia Noedel: I shut down completely.

181
00:16:50.880 --> 00:17:06.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so let me have right now is we're talking about it. Let me just check in on your on your side how distressed, you are from zero to 100 100 is anger, fear, want to run out of the house.

182
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:12.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What number would you put it up just today 2020. Okay, so I'll put down here. Okay.

183
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.790
Alicia Noedel: I'm still a little sore about it, but it's not

184
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:15.270
Yeah.

185
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:17.400
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

186
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.850
Gwenevere Abriel: And. Give me, give me that statement. One more time, what mom said

187
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:30.240
Alicia Noedel: She said, says the person who reminds me every day that she had a hard life.

188
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.560
Alicia Noedel: Hard childhood. Yeah.

189
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.170
Alicia Noedel: Like as if those two things even compare to

190
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's right. That has nothing to do with you.

191
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And we've got, we know the

192
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.450
Feeling

193
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is really sad. You said

194
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Motion.

195
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Really sad.

196
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Defeated

197
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Surprised

198
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.030
invalidated.

199
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah you got fancy one in there.

200
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Elevated

201
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: Destroyed

202
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.840
Gwenevere Abriel: And I shut down. That was the behavior. Your, your adaptation was I shut down. That's how you coped with it.

203
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.030
Alicia Noedel: As a tunnel vision.

204
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:34.650
Alicia Noedel: I couldn't think about anything else. I just, you know, I tried to, you know, do what I did the other day and

205
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:41.730
Alicia Noedel: But I couldn't a try, but it was just so overwhelming for me. Yeah.

206
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: I got you.

207
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.960
Gwenevere Abriel: And let's get into the

208
00:18:48.750 --> 00:19:01.500
Gwenevere Abriel: belief about yourself. What did that experience. What did it say about who I am in that moment. So go to. I am what

209
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:25.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Try not to filter too much all all help you through it. Okay, just just had those first ones that come through, if you could share them them you and I'll weed out the ones that aren't perfect.

210
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.540
Alicia Noedel: Oh goodness see strong for dealing with it the way I did.

211
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's that sounds like a positive one.

212
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:44.610
Alicia Noedel: Um, I feel like it was I'm whiny that's how it made me feel like I was whiny

213
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:45.840
Okay.

214
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.310
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and

215
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.960
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me just stay there on that one for a moment, just want to check on it.

216
00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:01.650
Gwenevere Abriel: The check the belief you had about yourself at that moment, I'm whiny

217
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm a complainer

218
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:13.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. And then there's a realization. Do you remember during that you really because remember you shut down.

219
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.240
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you remember thinking about yourself. I'm strong.

220
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:28.590
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I remember thinking, you know, this is ridiculous. I know.

221
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.320
Alicia Noedel: I know how

222
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.230
Alicia Noedel: This is supposed to work and and you don't just get over things I'm

223
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.610
Alicia Noedel: Either I knew that I wasn't wrong.

224
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.620
Alicia Noedel: But, um, it just kind of made me

225
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.120
Alicia Noedel: second guess all the things I thought about

226
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.820
Alicia Noedel: My life like

227
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.720
Alicia Noedel: I don't want to say this.

228
00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.220
Oh,

229
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.140
Alicia Noedel: It makes me feel like I wasn't as

230
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.450
Alicia Noedel: Like my mom didn't feel doesn't feel the way I feel about

231
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.650
Alicia Noedel: Like like as if I'm, you know, feeling very close and

232
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:27.750
Alicia Noedel: It made me feel like she's lying about loving like because of me. Why would you say this to me.

233
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I got you. That's the hard one to say there's another way to look at it just from for now.

234
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: At least. Yeah. Your mom doesn't have new skill. She's not learning any of these things that you and I are working on together.

235
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:55.770
Gwenevere Abriel: All she has most of us pick up on aggression passive aggression withdraw acting out we pick up on those things just naturally when we're young.

236
00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:11.790
Gwenevere Abriel: What she just did was she scratched you clock out to. So you would not continue talking. Okay. She got aggressive and hostile. It doesn't mean she doesn't love you. It just me. She did not know how to cope with that much honesty.

237
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:19.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I, you don't have to go to. I wonder if if the love that we have is real.

238
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.120
Alicia Noedel: I just, it's one of those things. It's been in the back of that question.

239
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.820
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, been back of my mind my whole life.

240
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.430
Alicia Noedel: And you know, I try and push it away, but

241
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:41.610
Alicia Noedel: Every now and again it comes back and it makes me feel like my whole life is a lie because why would you treat me like that.

242
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.100
Alicia Noedel: If you you know

243
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.500
Alicia Noedel: I can never see myself talking to my daughter like are you. Don't be mean to her.

244
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.610
Alicia Noedel: This way sometimes she has, you know,

245
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.720
Gwenevere Abriel: I know this is the suffering part right here. Do you feel that

246
00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:58.710
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

247
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It happened that was painful, in and of itself. It's a beautiful thing. We have this this analytical mind that prefrontal cortex is beautiful in its analysis of what might come in the future, tying it into our past, but it's a source of torture.

248
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:20.100
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

249
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.120
Alicia Noedel: And I thought to myself, though, when

250
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.350
Alicia Noedel: Because I think about it.

251
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, that's what we're we're working on right now is to say

252
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.840
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a both and that happened, what you felt and experienced is real.

253
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's also in the past.

254
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And that

255
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.030
Alicia Noedel: Until this morning.

256
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: It's

257
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:55.170
Alicia Noedel: Been it's been it's Monday. It happened on Friday, and today I'm barely waking up and feeling like

258
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.920
Alicia Noedel: I've been silent for a while.

259
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.890
Alicia Noedel: Because I really

260
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:03.420
Alicia Noedel: stuck with me.

261
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's a big one.

262
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:18.000
Gwenevere Abriel: But that in and of itself that piece you just did. I think it's a different target. I think it's probably a primary target the

263
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Am I love

264
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: The big one right and

265
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:32.010
Gwenevere Abriel: You decide what you want to focus on this morning. You want it to be.

266
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.040
Gwenevere Abriel: His concepts of

267
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I think you're going to know with my next question.

268
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Take this this experience that you had this weekend. Right.

269
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And that very sad defeated surprise surprised.

270
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.630
Gwenevere Abriel: And Bridget to your earliest, earliest recollection of that same feeling

271
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.150
Gwenevere Abriel: When you were little.

272
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Can get about the oldest image of it.

273
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't have to tell me about it. Just hold it. That's the difference about this exercise. Just hold it in your awareness.

274
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:41.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is desensitization. It's. Yes. So all of the self soothing. If you want to rock.

275
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want to kind of have have some self soothing behaviors and also I want to remind you that when we do this activity.

276
00:25:48.570 --> 00:26:02.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The goal is less sensitivity, although there may be an increase in it for a little while, maybe even days, the goal, the destination is putting the emotional experience of that event in the past.

277
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:11.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yes, there's this sort of emotional hangover. That happens like what you did with yourself, right. Those days how painful.

278
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The difference is that when you and I do this work.

279
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: It might mean it's forever. In the past, and that the intensity, you won't have these episodes of day after day of having to question your own reality.

280
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:31.560
Gwenevere Abriel: So just want I'm offering you some reassurance that although on the front end. This might be intense later on.

281
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:43.710
Gwenevere Abriel: It might mean there's a timestamp and it's set in the past. And now you can kind of go, you know what, that's not that's not happening now. I'm okay. I'm loved. So, do you have something in your mind right now.

282
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.920
Gwenevere Abriel: earliest age, you don't have any tell me what it is, but maybe how old you were might be handy.

283
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:02.940
Okay.

284
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:10.080
Alicia Noedel: I think nine those when things were probably worse. I'm years old.

285
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah, I've got one in here.

286
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.640
Alicia Noedel: Around 29 yeah

287
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: That's I've got a few stories like that in here, what, how does stress. Are you right now from zero to 100

288
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Just give me a number.

289
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.980
Alicia Noedel: I think I'm we're like a 35 new

290
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:30.450
Alicia Noedel: Money.

291
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah 35 will say age nine, and

292
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Just going to call this in validating is that or you want me to call it something else.

293
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.250
Alicia Noedel: As then that that you know he probably wouldn't even know

294
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.920
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you want to call it something that brings us back to that story if we have to

295
00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.970
Alicia Noedel: I remember being shocked.

296
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.390
Alicia Noedel: Like I was and

297
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.190
Alicia Noedel: extremely upset questioning you know

298
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.490
Alicia Noedel: People's affection towards me.

299
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.930
Alicia Noedel: Didn't want to deal with it. I didn't know how to deal with it. So I didn't want to

300
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:42.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Like you to bring into your awareness, your resources. Your nurturing figure john the poet, a natural flow. Okay. I want you to bring into your awareness, your own

301
00:28:42.690 --> 00:29:00.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Really intuitive instinctual self as it protective figure. And also, you've got, let me see Clarice Sterling and you've got Scooby Doo sort of bringing, bringing those guys into your awareness. Okay, and then to POC

302
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:09.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Who has zero self doubt. Okay. Can you see that bringing them all together.

303
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Confident, as well as

304
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.310
Gwenevere Abriel: The figure of course of Jesus Christ self sacrificing for everyone.

305
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And there's a real sense of confidence in that as well.

306
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And whatever you don't want, you can sort of even though I'm saying it. You don't have to bring it in, but just at least have a wise figure

307
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:42.870
Gwenevere Abriel: A nurturing figure and a protective figure just, just sort of get present with it for a moment. Let's do some installation. Once you get them real clear

308
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And we'll do some nice slow iterations with those guys first

309
00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:03.810
Gwenevere Abriel: And when you're ready, and you have them in your mind. So I want you to just think about them and we'll do some nice slow bilateral movement.

310
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so just at the rate. You don't have to look at me just look left and right.

311
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just setting the pace. You don't have to look at me.

312
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:17.400
Good.

313
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Holding on to those images.

314
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Being very present

315
00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.260
Gwenevere Abriel: With your protective quality.

316
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Assurance.

317
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And wisdom.

318
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget to breathe into those. There we go. Nice.

319
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: To close

320
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:51.600
It might be too.

321
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:53.880
Alicia Noedel: Dry

322
00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's, let's just stop right there. Let's. Okay. So, just tell me what's going on in your mind what's passenger there.

323
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.190
Alicia Noedel: Um,

324
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:10.980
Alicia Noedel: I got more of like

325
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.190
Alicia Noedel: Calm.

326
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:16.200
Alicia Noedel: Sort of

327
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:22.320
Alicia Noedel: Feeling like it's I felt more grounded.

328
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.540
Alicia Noedel: And better

329
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.350
Alicia Noedel: I'm kind of like having

330
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:37.770
Alicia Noedel: Like this, like a shield around me like it's okay I projected

331
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there we go, a shield and you're at 35 in a side subjective unit of distress. What number are you at now.

332
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.240
Alicia Noedel: 40 oh

333
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: It went up.

334
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:56.760
Alicia Noedel: Oh,

335
00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.940
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I mean a little bit for a minute. Yeah.

336
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.340
Gwenevere Abriel: And right now, same thing at a 40

337
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.910
Alicia Noedel: Oh no, I think it's like 30 again.

338
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:19.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So was that 35 for a moment, went to 40 and now it's at 3030. So I think that is just enough of

339
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Both relevant right it's not at zero, we're not talking about like

340
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, do I brush my teeth starting on the left side of my mouth and my right side. Really, that's like zero stress.

341
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:42.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus something we want it to be a little bit agitating right so then we're talking about something relevant, but at the same time, I also don't want you overwhelmed, you start to it.

342
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:53.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Sort of the hot feelings in the core stomach turning things like that when I check in with you. Feel free to tell me those things so that I know and I can check in and see if

343
00:32:54.660 --> 00:33:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: How this side is doing. So I want to do an actual desensitization. So these iterations are faster. Okay. And yes, the emotions might be there. They, you can always do this.

344
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:17.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you can just stop. It's me. Okay. You should never going to do anything wrong.

345
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, there's no way to do this wrong and you can't make a mistake. Okay.

346
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: But I want to do my job correctly. So I want to make sure that I'm staying in tune with the stress level.

347
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.140
Right.

348
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's um that negative cognition that you had

349
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Changed from I'm whiny

350
00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not really still relevant to that.

351
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.500
Gwenevere Abriel: What is it, what's the negative cognition for this one.

352
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.170
Alicia Noedel: I'm

353
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.300
Alicia Noedel: Mean complainer still but that's the same thing.

354
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:25.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so I'm, I'm a complainer, this is H nine. I'm a complainer, I'm like,

355
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.970
Alicia Noedel: Well, oh, at age nine,

356
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. What was it back then.

357
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:34.770
Alicia Noedel: I'm back then it was I'm not worried. I shouldn't be here.

358
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, there we go. I shouldn't be here. I'm not where I belong. I shouldn't be here.

359
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.700
Alicia Noedel: I don't deserve it. Yeah, I should have someone loves me.

360
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I should have a family that loves me.

361
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Now those are thoughts. What does that say about you.

362
00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I am what

363
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:04.350
Alicia Noedel: I am

364
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:22.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, what would you like to believe about yourself that would have felt just right. Let's go to the positive

365
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Or would have been often Uh huh. Like, I am what a positive thought about yourself.

366
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:34.080
Alicia Noedel: zillion

367
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: You would have liked to have thought I'm resilient.

368
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I am resilient.

369
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so

370
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the opposite of

371
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.950
Alicia Noedel: Hollywood. You know what that was, get, you know, but I would have felt it.

372
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. So what's the opposite of resilient.

373
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.140
Um,

374
00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:00.840
Alicia Noedel: I don't know if I can figure out where where it's like getting letting things beat you down.

375
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.160
This

376
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Some people in it therapy call themselves week when they go to the office of resilient. I'm certainly by no means saying that but I'm wondering if that's what

377
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.000
Alicia Noedel: Yeah. OK.

378
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:27.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Now go back to that age, age nine, when the thoughts were, I shouldn't be here. I should have a family that was it loves me or cares about me.

379
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.040
Alicia Noedel: Both

380
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:38.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's go back to it again. What do you think you believed about yourself back then I am what

381
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.060
Alicia Noedel: I am

382
00:36:55.290 --> 00:37:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I am last. Okay, so we're going to do. We're going to take that negative, you're going to hold two things we're going to have that WORST piece. You didn't even tell him what it was, but you just hold that in your awareness to that memory at nine and I am lost

383
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.450
Gwenevere Abriel: And I want to remind you

384
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: That not only that but if you want to move away and you want to incorporate your resource figures.

385
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You can do that at any time. You don't have to wait for me to invite you, that is always the case. You can also stop. You can do this or if you're onto something important to

386
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:39.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Say I want more. Keep going. Don't stop okay and kind of say just want to keep working through this. Maybe you like a fragment that came up

387
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.160
Okay.

388
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:42.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Start now.

389
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:59.790
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's perfectly fine to cry. If you want to have to, that's okay. That's part of it too. I'll do it first short iteration of spin it won't start with that worst image of that memory and I'm lost. This is a faster pace.

390
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's inhale together. Inhale, big belly breath.

391
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, letting it all go

392
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Just kind of tell me what what passes through your mind.

393
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.170
Alicia Noedel: I feel

394
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.800
Alicia Noedel: Stuck

395
00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.770
Alicia Noedel: Stuck and hopeless.

396
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Stuck and helpless go with that pull up the worst, worst part of that memory. Okay, we're still image. There's still pretty quick.

397
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You feel your eyes moving left and right. Correct.

398
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you thinking about right now.

399
00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:56.940
Alicia Noedel: Pain.

400
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me again.

401
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.770
Gwenevere Abriel: pain, pain, okay.

402
00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you describe the pain.

403
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:09.240
Alicia Noedel: Physical

404
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:18.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Physical pain. So we're going to pull up that worst image that nine year old memory, pull it up and physical pain go with that.

405
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:21.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing.

406
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Inhale, inhale with me. Inhale, big belly breath.

407
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And exhale, letting it all go

408
00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: This time, let your mind just go blank just for a moment, just look that quiet space happen.

409
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:12.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Just respect what you're doing and honor it gravity.

410
00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what's passing through your mind those thoughts.

411
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:37.650
Fear.

412
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.570
Alicia Noedel: Terrified.

413
00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: The feeling of being terrified.

414
00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:43.410
Yeah.

415
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.490
Alicia Noedel: An unproductive.

416
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Unprotected okay

417
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.690
Gwenevere Abriel: So why don't we bring that protection back into awareness. Let's pull that in

418
00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:58.860
Okay.

419
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.750
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's bring in that notion of, who are your guys who got

420
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:22.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Yourself, but also pull in, maybe even Jesus Christ sort of that that perfect what oftentimes is perfect love pulling into pocket and his self confidence and john the poet.

421
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:34.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe Clarice with keep she protects victims, she's waiting. She's smart and you have those attributes to

422
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Pulling that into your awareness.

423
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm terrified.

424
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:53.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I want you to picture that there's more to this moment. And that is, you can feel

425
00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:02.790
Gwenevere Abriel: These other characters. These other figures are you seeing Jesus face. Are you getting a sense of the presence

426
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:04.440
Alicia Noedel: Yeah.

427
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:18.480
Gwenevere Abriel: hold those figures and this image that you have at nine. The sun's going to go a little slower because I want those positives right in there.

428
00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Keep breathing.

429
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me what's coming up for you now.

430
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.290
Alicia Noedel: well being and sense of well being.

431
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.890
Gwenevere Abriel: And what SAID, ARE YOU OUT WHAT NUMBER RIGHT NOW.

432
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.380
Alicia Noedel: About the same.

433
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And is that it like 30

434
00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.190
Yeah.

435
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.940
Alicia Noedel: ruin a little bit but

436
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So once you tune into the body. Maybe do a little bit of self soothing kind of noticing where the tension is maybe that right shoulder somewhere maybe somewhere there. What do you think, is there anything going on there.

437
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:48.720
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, I didn't

438
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Mean to just roll the neck and just sort of, let's just take time to

439
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Pay attention to it.

440
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: So we're going to go again.

441
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready.

442
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:53.430
Gwenevere Abriel: So worst image of that memory. And I'd like you to maintain keeping the sense of self assurance right with Tupac and the way he sings and he's a poet and same with with john the poet and yourself and Scooby Doo and all the pieces. Okay. I want them to be integrated and weaved in

443
00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:58.980
Gwenevere Abriel: To the imagery. See if you can find a way to have an interaction with everybody.

444
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Your imagination.

445
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Breathing into it.

446
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Not forgetting the body.

447
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Remembering the body.

448
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.200
Gwenevere Abriel: It was there.

449
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.510
Gwenevere Abriel: It's here now.

450
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:14.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That'll probably be our last one today. Let's just spend some time kind of processing what happened here today. Okay.

451
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.370
Gwenevere Abriel: What level of distress. Did it go

452
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:20.850
Up.

453
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.960
Alicia Noedel: Not necessarily.

454
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, what number. Yeah.

455
00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:33.480
Alicia Noedel: I guess like

456
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I said, they go up a little bit.

457
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.500
Alicia Noedel: Little bit.

458
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, let's not end with it so

459
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:47.280
Gwenevere Abriel: At 35 let's maybe put it somewhere. So let's see what appeals to you.

460
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: That sense of

461
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Breath. Does it need to do the tell scorch drop

462
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:09.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Like we all kind of go over their hands on the rail and drop it off or is it something more like wanting to put it in the big fault size.

463
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: bathroom with a tire tile.

464
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Iron spinning dial.

465
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.320
Alicia Noedel: Like the tire iron dial.

466
00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:20.820
Alicia Noedel: Yeah, those big dials.

467
00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:31.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It changes. I got tile is the wrong word. So no good and tyrant. So, right, or maybe because maybe it's in there. We're going to pull it out again. So it's up to you. Where do you think

468
00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: In there.

469
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so it goes in there. Give it a good spin

470
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:41.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's going to stay in there.

471
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:48.060
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't actually have to process that you don't have to think about it, not in any sort of

472
00:48:48.870 --> 00:49:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: You know ruminative way doesn't need to take any more days away from you. Just knowing that if we want to pull it back out, we can take it out in in here, we can take it out in and continue to process it.

473
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So what more do you think about what you're experiencing today was just share with me a little bit about how you're doing right now. What charges left in the body.

474
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.140
Gwenevere Abriel: If there is any

475
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:21.480
Alicia Noedel: I feel

476
00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:31.500
Alicia Noedel: Relieved, I feel like there was something on me that I didn't know was on like

477
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:34.110
Alicia Noedel: Holding on

478
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.380
Alicia Noedel: To things and

479
00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.280
Alicia Noedel: If you're kind of like

480
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.750
Alicia Noedel: You know, like

481
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.290
Alicia Noedel: Relieved, I guess.

482
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.000
Alicia Noedel: Not as tense.

483
00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Where is tense still present. Where's the charge still left in the body. Where is it still

484
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: In the feet.

485
00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, go to charge in the feet and what are they up to

486
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.800
clenching

487
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.350
Alicia Noedel: My toes.

488
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:23.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think they're up to. What do you think they're trying to tell you as far as the stuff that we're doing today.

489
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:28.320
Alicia Noedel: Probably feels like

490
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:32.550
Alicia Noedel: I'm in danger, you know,

491
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:38.400
Alicia Noedel: The, the emotions are so real to me.

492
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:49.410
Alicia Noedel: Feels like very when I put myself back in that situation, I feel the exact same things and it's it's intense

493
00:50:50.130 --> 00:51:01.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yep. So, and that's pretty important for for my understanding, because what that says to me, is it really is not in the past, yet. So I think you're going to, I think, when we continue this

494
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:15.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I think this is going to be effective for getting it so that it's not relived but let's pay attention to those feet. Can we do and I'll do myself, can you can you let those feet in form let those toes, actually.

495
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Now what I, I would suggest is, is put all all the pressure on the heel kind of lifting the front of the feet up, and then also balls of the feet, just sort of vacillating back and forth, you know, maybe

496
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:45.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe three. And notice how it feels, on the toes on the balls of the feet and then lifting and arching the front of the feet, you know, right at that ankle just lifting and how that feels. Can you feel the heel on the

497
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Ground

498
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:56.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Doll, is it sharp squishy just you tuning into the sensation and then switching

499
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:14.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Also the feet feel those toes to notice one toe holds all the pressure versus another were to to evenly distributed men just switching back and forth. Nice and easy.

500
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Then letting them come to rest with them flat on the floor.

501
00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And expand your awareness.

502
00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:32.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice that there's a tingling. Notice that there any other sensation and those feet.

503
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: The arch.

504
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Heel toes pad.

505
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Notice the temperature and texture.

506
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:45.120
Gwenevere Abriel: As it makes contact with the skin.

507
00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: And notice as gravity pulls those feet to the center of this planet.

508
00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Just breathe into that truth.

509
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what you're experiencing right now in this moment.

510
00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:13.530
Gwenevere Abriel: And this

511
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.180
Gwenevere Abriel: is all there is. It's just right now.

512
00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And have that honest awareness continue to travel.

513
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.580
Gwenevere Abriel: Up through your ankles.

514
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Calves

515
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: At that light of awareness and authentic consciousness move through the knees.

516
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:46.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Vice

517
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: sit bones lower back.

518
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:53.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Up the spine.

519
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Reaching the shoulders.

520
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.600
Gwenevere Abriel: off the back of the neck.

521
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:03.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Into the skull.

522
00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:11.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just being present in this body.

523
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.740
Gwenevere Abriel: In your truth.

524
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.680
Gwenevere Abriel: how it feels to be you in this body right now.

525
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, open eyes.

526
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:52.980
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of just do. We've got my next client isn't quite well actually got to run out and run a group, don't I but I still want to hear from you, though, I want to check in and see how you're doing at this point as we come to the end.

527
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.290
Alicia Noedel: Back to zero.

528
00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:59.340
Gwenevere Abriel: Back to zero. Okay, how the toes are they still

529
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:02.610
Gwenevere Abriel: There. Okay.

530
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.000
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so

531
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe just take with you what you did. Right.

532
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:23.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You were able to have almost real free live something you did some imagery and you made contact with those fields that were messaging you

533
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't run away from it you tuned toward it.

534
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, well that was that was inviting anyway and

535
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:43.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're feeling better. Some those to relax a little bit, but today when those other messages and the shoulder start creeping up

536
00:55:44.160 --> 00:56:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Just drop them down say off something's going to you. You're on alert right just pay attention to what the body's trying to protect you from instead of running from it just tune in Word. See what it wants. What's its fear.

537
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:06.810
Gwenevere Abriel: What it, what is it's perceived threat. And if you need to go journal many rights and poetry around it.

538
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:09.150
Gwenevere Abriel: All the better.

539
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:15.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will see you my Nana or on Thursday.

540
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:16.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Thursday I think

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.810
Alicia Noedel: Have a great day.
