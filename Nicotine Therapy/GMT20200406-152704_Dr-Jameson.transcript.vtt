268
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.620

Dr Jameson: Yeah.

270
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.460
Rhonda shears: I knew I needed and then add

271
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.030
Rhonda shears: That was as bad on the news.

272
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.100
Dr Jameson: How is that affecting you at that point.

273
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:30.690
Rhonda shears: Is effect. Maybe was everything I could keep I couldn't keep my mom's I Kidding kidding. Keep the anything and I mean it was just, I was

274
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:44.820
Rhonda shears: Doing every again everything anything except for sell myself or sell are still adding steel or I didn't sell myself to get it but I mean was more nice have a bag or make

275
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.600
Rhonda shears: Me and evaluated take

276
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.110
Dr Jameson: So okay, so you didn't get into legal trouble. But you were

277
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.530
Dr Jameson: burning a lot of bridges. I guess it was a

278
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.730
Rhonda shears: Man, yeah.

279
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:01.020
Dr Jameson: All right.

280
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.400
Dr Jameson: So then you started Suboxone treatment.

281
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.290
And

282
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.590
Dr Jameson: So that was Julie said.

283
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.950
Dr Jameson: You were an ultimatum.

284
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.630
Rhonda shears: Okay, so as you gave me

285
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.970
Rhonda shears: Oh, sorry. Go ahead. On paper, maybe go the first couple times. I went

286
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:25.050
Dr Jameson: And

287
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:38.490
Rhonda shears: To try to give me, you know, something that I could you tell me if it's eight on the Suboxone i was i was good with a kids now but you know I get out a he knows if I get asked about what

288
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.570
Dr Jameson: What do you think would happen if you off of it.

289
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.530
Rhonda shears: Right now, I probably would like to paint medicine event.

290
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.910
Rhonda shears: I think in I want in the long run. I want to get out of this box in a beach like no

291
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:58.710
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

292
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.040
Rhonda shears: Well,

293
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:08.640
Dr Jameson: I mean, I think. I don't think that's, I think that's very rational I you know I think you're right. But I also think if we try to rush it then.

294
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:10.890
Dr Jameson: It tends to backfire.

295
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:22.440
Dr Jameson: Part of this is, you know, some people that have chronic pain, we use the Suboxone to treat their pain.

296
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.130
Dr Jameson: And yeah, you're physically dependent on it, but

297
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.430
Dr Jameson: It's it's a lot safer than a lot of the other other alternatives. Right.

298
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:51.270
Dr Jameson: So, I mean, if we have if there's a way to keep your pain under control without the Suboxone, you know, like say gab offended or you know something else then okay but sometimes we can only go so far on the tapering because the pain starts to

299
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:52.920
Dr Jameson: Interfere with

300
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:54.300
Dr Jameson: That we're

301
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.770
Dr Jameson: Our goal.

302
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.480
Dr Jameson: So anyway, but we'll see how it goes. I think

303
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.050
Dr Jameson: I think it's awesome. Well, tell me about the the the program you are using your in before. And why are you switching just curious.

304
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:18.360
Rhonda shears: And I was seeing would say when I started, I have a 375 a month and then I have a three ad for my medicine.

305
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:30.990
Rhonda shears: And it's really a real experience if you know and I wanted something that would cover my insurance know and it took a wow did he find you out where I could get somebody that ever did.

306
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.480
Dr Jameson: Okay, so they didn't take insurance there.

307
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.530
Dr Jameson: No. Did they provide you the medication or you went to the pharmacy.

308
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.510
Rhonda shears: I went to the pharmacy.

309
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.910
Dr Jameson: And you're interested in cover it there either.

310
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:51.330
Rhonda shears: And now, because they didn't. They weren't Teen, teen care grapes. They weren't any. So they didn't it wouldn't cover none of my medicine.

311
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.970
Dr Jameson: Are they going to cover your medicine now.

312
00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:02.610
Rhonda shears: It. They yeah I found somebody that was them that change here covered in yeah he would cover my medicine.

313
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.820
Dr Jameson: Is it the pharmacy that you have to find if I were to me.

314
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.250
Rhonda shears: No, no, he was the doctors that I had to find that check my insurance.

315
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.540
Dr Jameson: Okay, but I don't understand. Okay, but

316
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.490
Rhonda shears: You okay, they don't have

317
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:29.220
Rhonda shears: Since the doctors doesn't fit my insurance do the pharmacy. Can't the won't, it won't pay for my medicine at the pharmacy, because the doctor was in England.

318
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.350
Dr Jameson: Oh, they care who prescribed

319
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.670
Rhonda shears: Oh, yes.

320
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:40.230
Dr Jameson: Wow okay that's rough. Alright, so, um, so basically you're switching to us because it's covered by your insurance.

321
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.790
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay.

322
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.220
Rhonda shears: I mean, I like the doctors and all down there, but

323
00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.170
Rhonda shears: You know, it's too expensive.

Rhonda shears: Saying it was there 20 million

354
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.550

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.500
Rhonda shears: Now, yeah.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.100
Rhonda shears: I didn't like it today.

378
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.710
Rhonda shears: Wow.

379
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:17.880
Dr Jameson: That must have been well not for you. I guess you're asleep, but I must care for your family. And when you woke up, I'm hearing. Yeah.

380
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:23.400
Rhonda shears: Yeah, it's fishing at 97 and closing

381
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:24.960
Rhonda shears: A case.

382
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.060
Rhonda shears: In

383
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.840
Rhonda shears: Case, you don't want him around somebody

384
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.690
Rhonda shears: I understand that.

385
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.830
Rhonda shears: This is

386
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.760
Rhonda shears: Than you know

387
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:56.340
Rhonda shears: Better though the one I take his medicine every morning and then I mean I feel a lot better. Um, I don't know any other medicines.

388
00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.980
Rhonda shears: They do hell.

389
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.370
Rhonda shears: They just don't might be a good thing.

390
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:10.830
Dr Jameson: Right, so that broke up a little bit. Again, I just want to make sure I heard what you said. So it was scary for you. And then you're younger son.

391
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:19.500
Dr Jameson: Was the one that he's the one that has the boys and said you can't see them as if you're because he didn't want them to be exposed like the risk of you.

392
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.060
Rhonda shears: Is

393
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.880
Dr Jameson: being affected by yeah okay

394
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:24.540
Yes.

395
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.790
Dr Jameson: Okay.

396
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.830
Dr Jameson: So you had that overdose. And were there any others or that was

397
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:42.000
Rhonda shears: Yeah, I just had to, but the version was that I had in our can you have got a hospital in safety when I did.

398
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.150
Dr Jameson: It and that was shortly before you enter treatment than that big week long one.

399
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:49.230
Yes.

400
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.870
Dr Jameson: So that was probably also part of the trigger for. Okay, enough. It's enough

401
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.330
Dr Jameson: Okay.

402
00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.310
Dr Jameson: Let's see.

403
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:07.380
Dr Jameson: Reverse Marchand in home times one second severe overdose.

404
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:14.160
Dr Jameson: With week five days and I see you. He said, Yeah.

405
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.220
Dr Jameson: That was that in June or in May, when did that happen.

406
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.540
Rhonda shears: And actually happening baby way.

407
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.840
Rhonda shears: Okay, yes.

408
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:28.320
Okay.

409
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.900
Dr Jameson: So,

410
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:50.550
Dr Jameson: My opinion which is just my opinion, but I believe that typically like for someone like you. There was pain that you were treating but you just referred a minute ago to the fact that the medicine was also making you hi

411
00:31:51.720 --> 00:32:05.250
Dr Jameson: I believe that there's usually multiple things that are leading to the use an overuse of of opioids or drugs of any kind of abuse, so

412
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:14.940
Dr Jameson: You know, the desire to feel high, for example, like, not everybody is looking for an escape, you know, some people are really looking for an escape so

413
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:28.260
Dr Jameson: That's to me where I think like we got the chemical stuff kind of covered now with the Suboxone but what we want to make sure we also address are those other factors that

414
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:38.850
Dr Jameson: played a role in you, ending up where you had gotten to with looking for escape or whatever that was trying not to feel something else or

415
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:48.420
Dr Jameson: A lot of times people are self medicating a depression or anxiety or trying to forget about some bad stuff that's happened to them and

416
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.210
Dr Jameson: That's where the counseling piece.

417
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.650
Dr Jameson: Comes into play.

418
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.140
Dr Jameson: So we don't have to get into a deep

419
00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:07.140
Dr Jameson: Discussions right now about things that may or may not be things you like to talk about. But does that like resonate with you. Does that seem like that kind of stuff could be playing a role. Okay.

420
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:24.420
Dr Jameson: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think there's a very small percent of folks that didn't that wasn't part of what why this happened you know lots of people get prescription for pain medicines. But, and many of you can, you know, into big trouble. But not everybody does. So

421
00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:36.600
Dr Jameson: Yes, there's gonna be there's gonna be other things going on. Yeah, so that's why we are. I am especially, but I think we, in general, as a and in our program are pretty

422
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.880
Dr Jameson: I hesitate to use the word insistent, but it's pretty close to that.

423
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:51.510
Dr Jameson: About people really engaging in some significant you know like

424
00:33:53.790 --> 00:34:08.550
Dr Jameson: One on one counseling with with somebody that can kind of help them sort all that out. Like if you don't already understand why that what it is, where it was coming from figuring that out and then figuring out ways to either heal wounds or

425
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:15.120
Dr Jameson: delve into other idea other ways to to kind of self, self sooth

426
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:17.730
Rhonda shears: Yes, and that

427
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:22.740
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that don't that doesn't involve some sort of mind altering

428
00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.770
Dr Jameson: Product or substance. Right.

429
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:40.230
Dr Jameson: So I hope you'll take advantage of that that opportunity to to work with somebody and really kind of as you're comfortable, you don't have to. It doesn't. They don't throw you in the deep end, all at once. But, um,

430
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:46.470
Dr Jameson: But to, like, you know, as you're able to be comfortable with that kind of peel.

431
00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:52.920
Dr Jameson: Peel that can that the top off the can of worms and get in there and figure that all out.

432
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.910
Dr Jameson: Which I think is the hardest part of this whole thing.

433
00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:58.830
If I'm being yeah

434
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:17.940
Dr Jameson: But we have some really great counselors and and I know a lot of lot of the patients I I observe seemingly quite reluctant to go there and meet with like, you know, I keep missing appointments and it's like really hard to get people to like get there.

435
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:32.490
Dr Jameson: Yet I haven't met someone yet we you know we twist the arm you know kind of hard if we have to. But once we get once people start meeting with the counselor I they always say, oh, it's really helpful. I'm glad I'm drinking but but it's sometimes it's scary to

436
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.800
Dr Jameson: Get their

437
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.960
Start the process.

438
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.490
Dr Jameson: Since you've been meeting with the counselor already. Hopefully it's not a completely

439
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.880
Dr Jameson: Foreign an idea.

440
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.700
Rhonda shears: No, I'm kind of used to it.

441
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.300
Yeah.

442
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.700
Dr Jameson: Were you finding it helpful. Do you think

443
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.250
Rhonda shears: Yeah yeah day

444
00:35:53.550 --> 00:36:00.270
Dr Jameson: And then do you do you meet with somebody now locally and you. I mean, the other thing is, it doesn't have to be with us if you have a counselor already that

445
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.460
Rhonda shears: There's one. You could probably get a

446
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:18.180
Dr Jameson: Mean, you're welcome to come to us. I'm just saying, like, we don't insist that you somebody already has a relationship in a working, you know, they're working with someone, we're not going to like we're, you know, insist that you stopped meeting with that person and come meet with us.

447
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.190
Rhonda shears: So yeah, and

448
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.730
Rhonda shears: Now there's not one and yeah I'm looking

449
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:33.030
Dr Jameson: Yeah so well. Okay, so we'll plan on doing our usual thing and then it sometimes there's insurance things and people kind of have to use somebody local and mobile and okay

450
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:38.970
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Okay. So let me ask you a couple more weird questions like How tall are you,

451
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:41.070
Rhonda shears: And

452
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.720
Dr Jameson: And you know how much you were approximately these days.

453
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.920
140

454
00:36:52.410 --> 00:37:03.360
Dr Jameson: So I don't know if they've gone over the general structure of our program with you too much. It doesn't seem usually like people have heard too much about it.

455
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:15.240
Dr Jameson: It's not a nothing fancy just. We do weekly meetings with we have a group, it's, it's our program is mainly centered around group counseling.

456
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.400
Dr Jameson: And meeting and then

457
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:37.500
Dr Jameson: So after this visit with me and it's fairly straightforward, since you already on the medicine. We don't have to like do any type trading of, you know, inductions or type trading of doses or anything. Right, so that makes it easy and then going forward. We meet you and i mean

458
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:45.090
Dr Jameson: Weekly in the group and we start out weekly over time as people are

459
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:47.460
Dr Jameson: You know,

460
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.070
Dr Jameson: Following up and keeping appointments and, you know,

461
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:51.690
Dr Jameson: Doing they're

462
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.180
Dr Jameson: Participating as we

463
00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:00.150
Dr Jameson: Backed we will eventually like after a couple months, a

464
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:09.090
Dr Jameson: Sort of reward you with. Okay, now you get a two week supply at a time in the pharmacy and then ultimately the month.

465
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:22.020
Dr Jameson: I'm in the process of looking you up in the database from Tennessee. I just had to look up your make sure that your the spelling of your name right, we sometimes extend the courtesy for people that have been in treatment and

466
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:30.150
Dr Jameson: You know, doing this a while to start at the two weeks since you're, you're not brand new to the treatment.

467
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.970
Dr Jameson: 618 68. So let me just see what

468
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:44.790
Dr Jameson: Comes up if if if they they were not you're getting in at the same pharmacy that you're going to go to with me with us or

469
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.200
Dr Jameson: Yes. Okay, so you should be in there. Sometimes the private places are not

470
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:54.480
Dr Jameson: Recording all this into the system.

471
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:55.920
Yeah.

472
00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:15.870
Dr Jameson: And then so we do the week we meet meetings with groups. And then what that looks like, is there's a counselor. In this case it will be, Rochelle. Who's, who's one of our concerts in Tennessee and then myself. And we usually try to meet limits of eight to 10 patients so

473
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.320
Dr Jameson: And then, and it's it's

474
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.870
Dr Jameson: Informal i mean

475
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.380
Dr Jameson: It's me.

476
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:32.280
Dr Jameson: So when's the last time that you, you still have some medication left

477
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.300
Okay.

478
00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.990
Dr Jameson: Looks like they're going

479
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.730
Dr Jameson: To eat and then

480
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.730
Dr Jameson: We just increased you look like maybe because of lack of the office.

481
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:54.570
Dr Jameson: coven 18 stuff that they need longer

482
00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:01.350
Dr Jameson: So looks like they did the same thing, a week and then two weeks and then

483
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.030
Rhonda shears: Mm hmm. Yeah.

484
00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:03.420
Yeah.

485
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.000
Dr Jameson: And then there

486
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:12.840
Rhonda shears: Was I just had to pay will be and sometimes we you know monthly just

487
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.240
Rhonda shears: depend on how much money.

488
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:24.480
Rhonda shears: That is that if I paid weekly then I was able to pay more.

489
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:25.920
Rhonda shears: Because he was

490
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:37.470
Rhonda shears: Like 175 and then two weeks, was to 50 that month was 375 so so let's get ripped off. I'll go wants to wait then

491
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:44.610
Rhonda shears: When they made us when I first started actor pay weekly, and I would

492
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:53.370
Rhonda shears: Just be charged 375 when I first started out, because they said paid for mountain. These can mean lately. And that's what I would do.

493
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.980
Dr Jameson: Nothing. Okay.

494
00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:57.780
Dr Jameson: So,

495
00:40:58.860 --> 00:40:59.940
Dr Jameson: You last

496
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:06.390
Dr Jameson: Filled your prescription last last week or the week before

497
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.120
Rhonda shears: And the 20 seats. Okay.

498
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.820
Dr Jameson: And that's about a so we're number 50

499
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:17.340
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

500
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.860
Rhonda shears: That's all day.

501
00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:28.350
Rhonda shears: As me for $30 for 60 bit academically. I only have $400 left to get. Yep. Yeah.

502
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.000
Rhonda shears: Okay, there's

503
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.200
Rhonda shears: Enough farms.

504
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:32.250
Uh huh.

505
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.380
Dr Jameson: Okay, so you still have more that you can pick up

506
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.730
Rhonda shears: Yes.

507
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:43.320
Dr Jameson: But now that we're writing a prescription and it'll be covered by your insurance.

508
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.060
Dr Jameson: Me. Okay.

509
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.520
Dr Jameson: Well, so I should read you a new one. Instead of using that last resale. I guess.

510
00:41:52.530 --> 00:42:00.810
Dr Jameson: Yeah, let's see. So 714 21 but you won't need a refill now. So even so you won't need to refill until

511
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.280
Dr Jameson: At least another week and a half.

512
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.250
Rhonda shears: Anyway. Oh, yeah, yeah.

513
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:21.870
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I hate to tell you this. Now, I don't know if that pharmacy accepts it but there's also a coupon. You can use a good Rx coupon to get a discount on the cash price. But anyway, that won't be necessary. I guess going forward.

514
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:30.000
Dr Jameson: Okay. Um, so we have the weekly groups. The Tennessee my Tennessee group is that are you Eastern or central

515
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:31.560
Rhonda shears: Eastern

516
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:37.200
Dr Jameson: Okay, at noon on Wednesdays. Is that going to be okay for you.

517
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.060
Rhonda shears: Yeah.

518
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.430
Dr Jameson: So I'll add you to that group. So will we can play in on you starting this Wednesday.

519
00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.600
Dr Jameson: Do you have a copay or do you have to it.

520
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:50.880
Rhonda shears: And

521
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:52.890
Rhonda shears: No, I don't have no copay okay

522
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:58.410
Dr Jameson: All right, so it's no difference to either way you're going to save, you're going to be saving a lot of money here.

523
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.180
Rhonda shears: Yeah.

524
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.460
Dr Jameson: I'm okay.

525
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.460
Dr Jameson: Now, if we can get you to quit smoking, and you have even more money.

526
00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.080
Rhonda shears: To do so, I know.

527
00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.440
Dr Jameson: Okay.

528
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.240
Dr Jameson: So let me assign you to that group. Now before I

529
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:29.460
Dr Jameson: lose my train of thoughts. Okay, so I don't need to send you my name is Chris prescriptions today. Do you have any questions about how the medicine works like where what it does and you're bringing in all this and

530
00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.120
Rhonda shears: And now they discussed it with me whenever started taking

531
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:45.810
Dr Jameson: And you had, you mentioned that you had some relapses after you, which is okay that's unfortunately part of your generally that's the right that's the

532
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.710
Dr Jameson: Typical I guess the norm almost

533
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:59.700
Dr Jameson: So I'm not. I'm not. You know, I'm getting trouble for it. It's just part of the part of the process. And I'm but that was most recently, you said five months ago.

534
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.710
Rhonda shears: Mm hmm. Okay.

535
00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:02.490
Dr Jameson: And were you

536
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.630
Dr Jameson: Did you stop your Suboxone and then start using what, how did that what

537
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:07.590
Dr Jameson: What did that look like

538
00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:13.860
Rhonda shears: At weight to them mad and everyone knows it.

539
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:18.600
Dr Jameson: Okay, and so you you last use math five months ago or more recently.

540
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.470
Dr Jameson: Okay. And how long did you use it for when you relax.

541
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.930
Rhonda shears: And awake.

542
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.410
Dr Jameson: And just just

543
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:41.220
Dr Jameson: The way I approached these things as well. Let's talk about it. Well, what were you looking for. Did it give you what you were looking for, like, what, what was the trigger, like, what, what

544
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:47.130
Rhonda shears: Works for me knew it. I went to pain medicine. I probably wouldn't wait

545
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.110
So I chose that.

546
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.650
Dr Jameson: And we're, you know,

547
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.040
Oh,

548
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:54.450
Rhonda shears: Sorry.

549
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:54.960
Go ahead.

550
00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:05.250
Rhonda shears: I said no way I'd started depending on you know I made it better maybe stop whatever I was feeling you mean

551
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.920
Rhonda shears: I don't know. It seemed like that.

552
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:17.910
Rhonda shears: I got into it with my son and feeling sorry for myself, I guess. And that's when I went and did it so

553
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.030
Rhonda shears: Now is it for about a week.

554
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:31.230
Rhonda shears: That actually it and then say to myself, and never do that again as it was wrong. Anyway, we get an argument. I can't remember that it

555
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:33.540
Rhonda shears: Is not right.

556
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.830
Dr Jameson: Well, you could, but it's better not to. Yeah.

557
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:38.460
Rhonda shears: But I don't

558
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:39.450
Rhonda shears: Shoot it.

559
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.350
Dr Jameson: Did it. Did you like it. I mean, did it.

560
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.400
Rhonda shears: Now, now it seems like it made things worse.

561
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:58.350
Rhonda shears: And I didn't. And I didn't feel a bit different. I mean, I feel worse if anything

562
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:02.010
Dr Jameson: Uh huh, give you energy or did it make you paranoid, or what

563
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.040
Rhonda shears: Energy. Yeah.

564
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.350
Dr Jameson: But you didn't like that.

565
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:14.940
Rhonda shears: You know, I mean, I've never injected anything I see people on with a nice crazy and I

566
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:16.680
Rhonda shears: Think that way, whenever I was

567
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:17.310
Rhonda shears: In it.

568
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.610
Rhonda shears: Was only I have never did anything

569
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:26.610
Rhonda shears: Every man or. LAUGH And I never would have you used it before was that the first time you tried. Yeah.

570
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.900
Rhonda shears: Now I've used it before.

571
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:28.470
Okay.

572
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.090
Okay.

573
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:44.790
Dr Jameson: Okay, and then any other while we're on that subject. Any other drug use in the past booking, those are, I guess you had prescriptions for all frazzle him at one point I saw on your

574
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:52.680
Rhonda shears: Yes, I was like in that in my split whenever they told me that it wasn't good to take it with this book.

575
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.680
Rhonda shears: So as I quit taking that

576
00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:00.840
Dr Jameson: What was that, I mean, I know it's an anxiety for both that first leap, or what was that for

577
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.640
Rhonda shears: Tip for sleep.

578
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:04.470
Dr Jameson: How are you sleeping now.

579
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.600
Rhonda shears: I'm sleeping. Good.

580
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.540
Rhonda shears: good manners, you know, was when I first got my image.

581
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.130
Dr Jameson: Well, you know,

582
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:23.640
Dr Jameson: Yeah, well, you know that right. So one of the, I think that's the most common and the first thing that happens when people are withdrawing yes I can't sleep.

583
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.020
Dr Jameson: Yes. Right. Yeah.

584
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:25.680
Yeah.

585
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:35.460
Dr Jameson: And I guess we should document that too. So when you're not in withdrawal. Now, but when you have in the past, then what are the symptoms that you suffer with with that.

586
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:44.700
Rhonda shears: And leg cramps throwing in and and not. Am I sweat and constantly and I'm unable to sleep. Yeah.

587
00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:55.770
Rhonda shears: Not doing any of those now. I mean, you get leg cramps at that as part of me having that rate. But other than that, I'm not doing any of the other

588
00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:56.910
Good, yeah.

589
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:04.290
Dr Jameson: Have you ever had to skip Suboxone for a period of time for whatever reason.

590
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:05.580
And

591
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:17.730
Dr Jameson: So, you know, I think, just to remind you that it is also an opiate. So in a sense, you know, you're, you're dependent on this now instead of the other stuff.

592
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:36.900
Dr Jameson: It's a little different in that it's, I mean the same withdrawal would eventually will happen, it's just it's slower to get started and then it's a more gradual because it's a longer acting drug than others are so

593
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:43.920
Rhonda shears: I heard people come off of it and it lasted a lot longer. So

594
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.880
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

595
00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:52.050
Rhonda shears: Well, say it's worse. But, I mean, I don't know how bad it is. I hope I don't have to either

596
00:48:52.080 --> 00:49:03.000
Dr Jameson: No, I mean generally the, the goal is to taper so gradually that it's sort of a very minimally noticeable.

597
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:04.560
Rhonda shears: Yeah.

598
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.460
Dr Jameson: You know thing.

599
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.480
Yeah.

600
00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:13.110
Dr Jameson: I, how do I say this in a way that doesn't seem wrong.

601
00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:29.760
Dr Jameson: I think also one of the. Okay. One of the skills that I think our patients will benefit greatly from is sort of building up kind of the, the muscle of being able to tolerate discomfort.

602
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:41.460
Dr Jameson: Does that make sense. Like some people can, like, you know, you know, grit their teeth and get through things and other people are, you know, instantly looking for something to make it go away.

603
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:43.980
Dr Jameson: And I see that that

604
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.230
Dr Jameson: That is also a factor here, you know, to a large extent, so

605
00:49:50.820 --> 00:50:04.890
Dr Jameson: Part of this is sort of becoming more psychologically prepared to be able to cope if one were to have to suffer through withdrawal symptoms. Now, we don't want to, like, make that have to happen, but

606
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.450
Dr Jameson: I think that also does sort of end up sort of being a

607
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.640
Dr Jameson: You know, the point at which whether people fly or flop, you know,

608
00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:32.190
Dr Jameson: Not even if it's related to the this particular like okay we're gonna take you off. But what if you get in another car wreck or and unfortunately in life, like some other terrible thing is probably going to happen at some point, whether we like it or not. So are we going to be able to

609
00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:37.380
Dr Jameson: You know tolerate the grief or whatever fear.

610
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:42.210
Dr Jameson: Natural or are we going to be

611
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:54.750
Dr Jameson: Ready to find something to make it all go away again. So that's where I think the counseling and, you know, that's part of how this where we help you know kind of changed the way we approach.

612
00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:55.050
The

613
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:59.730
Dr Jameson: Adversity whether it's a physical painter and emotional one

614
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.090
Dr Jameson: Okay, so

615
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:11.850
Dr Jameson: Anyway, so we're not we're not not necessarily planning any tapering anytime soon. But, but, in general, I just was curious because sometimes

616
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:21.330
Dr Jameson: People, I don't know, make you know you miss your appointment, you couldn't get you couldn't afford them. But, you know, I'm just curious if this happened for you in the past. Okay.

617
00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.980
Dr Jameson: Okay, so I kind of interrupted myself, we do the weekly groups.

618
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:34.260
Dr Jameson: Eventually, sometimes, although I really, if you, if you're not especially if it's not any different cost wise you don't have a copay or anything. I'm

619
00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:42.120
Dr Jameson: Just as happy to have people continue coming every week, no matter what, whether we're sending you a month of prescription that time or not just, just for the

620
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:50.310
Dr Jameson: Kind of the support and the and the community which, I hope, hope you will find that it provides as you get to know people.

621
00:51:51.570 --> 00:52:03.600
Dr Jameson: And then sometimes down the road you become sort of the, the, what the words of wisdom and the end the mentor in a way for some of the people that are newer you know as you get to as people become more sort of

622
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:21.540
Dr Jameson: veteran of the program me that that that's part of the process is actually, you know, being able to encourage and give experience and to the newer people, which also helps you. Oops, which will help you too, because you

623
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:26.520
Dr Jameson: Kind of give you a boost of confidence and self, you know, self esteem. So

624
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:41.040
Dr Jameson: You will have a minimum, but I hope it's only the beginning of a ongoing meetings with a counselor, but we do at least one initial evaluation. So for somebody that sees a counselor outside

625
00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:55.440
Dr Jameson: And we're not, you know, we still have to do at least one initial evaluation and then at that point they hopefully will develop a treatment plan with her. Okay, we're going to meet every other week we're gonna we meet twice a week, whatever it is.

626
00:52:56.610 --> 00:53:05.400
Dr Jameson: Going forward with the counselor, you have a set of labs that you're going to do now. Right. Did they give you a place to get that done.

627
00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:11.940
Rhonda shears: Now because the hospital or anything isn't doing any labs right now. Okay. I mean,

628
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.660
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Have you had any labs done recently anywhere.

629
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:27.330
Rhonda shears: And now I'm a hard stick and the hospital know sit and they don't like to even try because I can't be stuck. I mean, and

630
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:35.880
Rhonda shears: I've had some lab work then and then a couple maybe a couple months ago. Okay.

631
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:40.890
Dr Jameson: What am I be work. That's probably so that's reason enough, I think.

632
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:51.120
Dr Jameson: I was gonna say, you know, even when you were in the hospital that was that was over a year ago, but just to see like what your kidney function and your liver function and your you know music kind of stuff like that.

633
00:53:51.930 --> 00:54:06.120
Dr Jameson: Well, so yeah. Maybe can you instead of going to the lab, which I was wondering if that's what you're saying maybe see where if you remember where you had that done, if it was at the hospital, maybe. See if you can request copies of the labs that you've had in the last six

634
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:06.360
Rhonda shears: Months.

635
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:11.820
Dr Jameson: And if you ask them to send it to you, then you'll know when they've sent them that

636
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.190
Dr Jameson: And then you can send us an email.

637
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:18.270
Dr Jameson: Okay, with the copies included, so we can just put those up in your chart and

638
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:34.560
Dr Jameson: That sense of faith and then we normally do a drug screen initially with at the lab when you're having your blood work them anyway and then subsequent after that we do monthly drug screens we mail you a cup. I don't know if they explain that to you.

639
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.970
Rhonda shears: Know they didn't

640
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:41.100
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we can just skip the initial ones at the local lab. Oh, I guess.

641
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:45.120
Dr Jameson: I think what you said the lab is completely closed.

642
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.040
Rhonda shears: Yes.

643
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.140
Rhonda shears: Okay, if you're not doing anything in

644
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:50.190
Rhonda shears: The hospital.

645
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:57.990
Dr Jameson: Say if you just went for the year, in part, but if they're if they're closed. They're closed. Okay. So then I'll ask our care navigator to

646
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:10.350
Dr Jameson: mail you a cup and instead of doing that, after the first month, we can just do that. Okay. Initially, I'd also like to get copies of records from the previous treatment place. I don't know.

647
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:12.600
Rhonda shears: Their release form and they

648
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.970
Dr Jameson: Did they say they were going to submit that already.

649
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:16.260
Yes.

650
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:26.820
Dr Jameson: Okay, so we might see your drug screens that you've had done with them anyway. Okay. So yeah, we're kind of making some weird adjustments that because of this whole

651
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:36.420
Dr Jameson: Thing. So, okay. So normally we do a set of initial labs. I'm not as worried about it since you as you said yourself having injected yourself with anything we sometimes diagnose

652
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.850
Dr Jameson: Various things for

653
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.330
Dr Jameson: People

654
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.400
Dr Jameson: That have had that history.

655
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:43.770
Dr Jameson: And then

656
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:48.870
Dr Jameson: They be email you surveys. They like their

657
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:51.900
Dr Jameson: Their into data collection, which I think is good, but it does

658
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:55.440
Dr Jameson: require me to give you homework to do every week there's

659
00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:57.870
Dr Jameson: A base, they asked you to fill out every week.

660
00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:13.770
Dr Jameson: And whether they're trying to like learn really what what are some of the fun people start checking off the answering this question this way, we noticed that they end up falling out of treatment or relaxing or, you know, it's a way for us to kind of learn where we need to

661
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.840
Dr Jameson: start knocking and phone making phone calls, how what's going on.

662
00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:19.680
And

663
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:27.660
Dr Jameson: So that's what it's about. But it does require 1520 minutes of your time every week to get those done and

664
00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:33.570
Dr Jameson: Time. So I think that's pretty much the the summary of how the how the

665
00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:40.890
Dr Jameson: Treatment goes, we did just bring on us a new counselor out she's in California, I think, but she can

666
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:54.750
Dr Jameson: See people anywhere in the country, for we have a lot of patients who have a trauma history. And I don't know if that's relevant to you or not, but if so she's, she's able to do a certain type of treatment that tends to help people kind of

667
00:56:56.070 --> 00:57:04.500
Dr Jameson: reprocess basically is the way it's actually what they call it a memories. Anyway, so that they stopped triggering the same emotional reaction that they had before.

668
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:16.230
Dr Jameson: And that can be really life changing for a lot of people. So if that turns out to be something that's relevant to you your counselor can help coordinate that, when when they feel like you're

669
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:17.610
Dr Jameson: emotionally ready for it.

670
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:23.580
Dr Jameson: That's really a very unique offering. So I think that's

671
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.260
Dr Jameson: Exciting.

672
00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:27.630
Dr Jameson: As well and then

673
00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:42.960
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so and if and when we decide we're gonna start tapering we talked about that. It's, it's gonna be you know you want it. I think it's a good idea and your counselor thinks you're ready and then we can then we can talk about it.

674
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:45.450
Rhonda shears: Okay, so it's definitely

675
00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:49.320
Dr Jameson: An option. I just no reason to read it. Okay.

676
00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:55.350
Dr Jameson: Alright, so I have another person. So I guess I gotta stop talking. Do you have any questions before we go.

677
00:57:55.530 --> 00:58:00.930
Rhonda shears: And only, and do they make me a scheduled me appointment with the counselor.

678
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.390
Dr Jameson: They should. But I don't know if they have yet.

679
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.700
Dr Jameson: I'm going, OK, I can see

680
00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:09.360
Dr Jameson: You're gonna see

681
00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:15.600
Dr Jameson: Today's Monday. So Wednesday, which is the day after tomorrow if you can

682
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:21.960
Dr Jameson: Set, you're always going to check into the virtual clinic, which is where you went today to start so

683
00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:31.890
Dr Jameson: Around 11th. We asked people to start checking in. For group, no less than 30 minutes before it starts because everyone is checking in at the same time.

684
00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.990
Dr Jameson: And there can be a little bit of

685
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.450
Dr Jameson: Yeah, you don't have any appointments other appointments yet.

686
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.400
Dr Jameson: So,

687
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:45.990
Dr Jameson: So for now, we can just all you need to remember is 1130 on Wednesdays, you want

688
00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:52.650
Dr Jameson: To head to the virtual clinic and then they'll if you can have already filled out any surveys that you've gotten an email.

689
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:55.710
Rhonda shears: Now me, she made it that I will get some yeah

690
00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:02.460
Dr Jameson: I'm saying, like, going forward, one of the things that slows down the checking in process is people that haven't filled their surveys out

691
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:15.090
Dr Jameson: Do that, before they can get their email so but code to the meeting. So if you can try to have done that already. And then in the first week is kind of weird because everything's new but

692
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.470
Dr Jameson: Going forward, that's one of the biggest things I think that mix it up.

693
00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:27.990
Dr Jameson: And then if you're due for a drug screen. They might have you do it right then. So that's another thing if you know I have group on Wednesday, and I'm due for my drug

694
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:35.640
Dr Jameson: Screen and I have my cup maybe sign in Monday or Tuesday and try to get that done, so it's it's out of the way for the time by the time group.

695
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:37.200
Okay.

696
00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:46.770
Dr Jameson: Okay. But yeah, if you want to go back to virtual clinic and ask them to schedule the counseling appointment, you can or they might be able to do that when you're checking in on Wednesday.

697
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.590
Dr Jameson: But usually within the first few weeks, we like to try to get that scheduled but

698
00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:57.420
Dr Jameson: We've had a lot of new patients coming in as you can.

699
00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:02.280
Rhonda shears: I just, I mean just standing in about 11 o'clock and just wait.

700
01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:13.890
Dr Jameson: Yeah, and you can sign in, or you can check in early so you know if you're, if you call it 11 they can make sure everything's all set. They'll email you the zoom meeting ID for the week for the weekly group.

701
01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:20.160
Dr Jameson: And then you can go about your business and do something else. And then just sign into the group at at at 12 so

702
01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.060
Rhonda shears: Yeah, okay.

703
01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.220
Rhonda shears: perfectly okay

704
01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.360
Dr Jameson: I'm okay. Any other questions.

705
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:30.810
Rhonda shears: No, I don't think so. Okay.

706
01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:34.560
Dr Jameson: You don't get any side effects from the Suboxone that you notice

707
01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:40.560
Dr Jameson: Yeah, concentration or anything. Okay, all right, all right, well,

708
01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.120
Dr Jameson: It was very nice to meet you.

709
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:45.900
Dr Jameson: YouTube. I look forward to working with you. So we'll see you on Wednesday.

710
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:48.810
Dr Jameson: Okay. Okay, bye.

711
01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:53.160
Dr Jameson: You know how to get out.

712
01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.360
Rhonda shears: Say lead okay you

713
01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:57.900
Dr Jameson: Found it.

714
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:10.080
Dr Jameson: Well, this is wrong. This year's here for her initial history and physical chief complaint.

715
01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:16.470
Dr Jameson: Like to switch to new program API.

716
01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.220
Dr Jameson: RHONDA IS

717
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:41.820
Dr Jameson: 51 years old she started originally with prescription pain medication, but ultimately that clinic closed and she resorted to purchasing medication on the street, period.

718
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:53.940
Dr Jameson: She was using upwards of 200 milligrams of oxy coat on an oxymoron per day. She did have a couple overdoses a second, which was very significant and

719
01:01:55.500 --> 01:02:05.580
Dr Jameson: landed her in the ICU for five plus days period ultimately her son gave her an ultimatum and offered to pay for her first few visits.

720
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:18.030
Dr Jameson: And she entered treatment and now local Suboxone clinic in June of 2019 it's been going fairly well though it's quite expensive. So she's eager to transfer into our program, which is covered by her insurance.

721
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.350
Dr Jameson: I filled in her

722
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:27.540
Dr Jameson: past medical history fairly extensively in her meds and everything.

723
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:36.930
Dr Jameson: Visible physical exam is normal her mental status is normal assessment opioid use disorder severe

724
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:38.970
Dr Jameson: Plan.

725
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:44.730
Dr Jameson: She's already

726
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:56.430
Dr Jameson: In a medication assisted therapy treatment plant program doing well for cost and convenience reasons.

727
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:16.290
Dr Jameson: She's interested in transitioning to our program, which seems a very appropriate. She's tolerating buprenorphine currently very well on 60 milligrams per day period. She still has medication available from her previous clinic period, we will obtain old records as well as recent lab results.

728
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.380
Dr Jameson: And she's going to begin treatment.

729
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.570
Dr Jameson: She's gonna join our Wednesday Tennessee group beginning

730
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:34.710
Dr Jameson: This week, so we'll get her bio psychosocial scheduled and begin individual counseling once once we get up and running.

731
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:42.390
Dr Jameson: She's already familiar with the mechanism of action does not have any side effects.

732
01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:56.910
Jennífer castro: Okay, there we go.

733

Dr Jameson: Well, tell me about it.

Dr Jameson: This depends what type of music you like but i would i would explore because you might be able to find

777
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:24.510
Dr Jameson: All sorts of things you wouldn't expect necessarily that are now available for free.

778
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:27.660
Dr Jameson: And then also meetings, I don't. I mean, support.

779
01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:28.890
Dr Jameson: Groups and that's what

780
01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:31.470
Jennífer castro: I that I have. That's not good.

781
01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:35.940
Dr Jameson: What kind of steps would you like to do for fun. If you could do anything.

782
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:37.320
Jennífer castro: No, no.

783
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.830
Jennífer castro: Something that would keep my mind off everything

784
01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:41.490
Yeah.

785
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.590
Dr Jameson: Do you read

786
01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:44.370
No.

787
01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:46.680
Dr Jameson: Is it hard for you to read

788
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.210
Jennífer castro: It is it is

789
01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.260
Jennífer castro: I care about my mind.

790
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.720
Dr Jameson: What about like a listening to a book on tape.

791
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:56.400
Jennífer castro: I might be able to do is to listen to one car in my car.

792
01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.500
Jennífer castro: Yeah, like, stuff like that. But

793
01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.940
Dr Jameson: Yeah, so, because that might be

794
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:01.230
Jennífer castro: Headed somewhere.

795
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.530
Dr Jameson: You have a x is the library closed.

796
01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:07.320
Jennífer castro: I'm not sure I haven't been to the library.

797
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:12.090
Dr Jameson: So sometimes you can take out audible like library books.

798
01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:25.440
Dr Jameson: And I don't know. I mean, you have to pay for books, sometimes. So I don't know how, if that's going to be doable or not. But yeah, that might be another another thing to try and learn, you know, sometimes, and you can like do something so semi educational to if you

799
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:27.240
Dr Jameson: Want to we

800
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:31.710
Dr Jameson: Talked about that book, the body keeps the score last week that might be well

801
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:35.040
Jennífer castro: Yeah, I think I wrote that down to. Yeah.

802
01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:42.630
Dr Jameson: If you can maybe find that on. I know they have it audible book because I was trying to buy it. One night last week when I couldn't fall asleep, but I couldn't get it to work on my

803
01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:45.810
Jennífer castro: There's a thing about Amazon.

804
01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:48.510
Dr Jameson: The way you do. Do you have it you don't have Amazon Prime. You

805
01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.670
Jennífer castro: Have Kindle. Yeah, I have Amazon Prime.

806
01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.980
Dr Jameson: So you probably can buy it through that, then

807
01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:53.760
Jennífer castro: Perfect.

808
01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:56.760
Dr Jameson: So you have access to tons and tons of books that way then.

809
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:59.460
Jennífer castro: Yeah, but I have like no money so

810
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:04.020
Dr Jameson: Right. But if you have Amazon Prime. There's a bunch that are included in that I think

811
01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:05.220
Jennífer castro: Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.

812
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:05.850
So,

813
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:08.940
Jennífer castro: Okay. What else did I just saw before.

814
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:10.410
Dr Jameson: That's it. What else

815
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.360
Dr Jameson: Might you have tested positive for

816
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:17.910
Jennífer castro: I don't know cuz last time there was five and I was like what the hell that was might have been something in here.

817
01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:20.100
Jennífer castro: Maybe. Okay.

818
01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.410
Dr Jameson: Yeah, okay.

819
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:23.850
Dr Jameson: So I guess. Do you have

820
01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:31.560
Dr Jameson: Do you have like a sort of a schedule it all in mind as far as continuing to lean or taper or not.

821
01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:39.570
Jennífer castro: I mean I, it gets easier almost easier. Do I stay away from everybody you know

822
01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:47.040
Jennífer castro: So, but I like don't seem to want to get out of bed without it. I think that's a mental thing so

823
01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:56.670
Dr Jameson: Well, yes. I mean, it's also it can be a chemical thing too, but where we able to get that other psychiatric appointment reschedule.

824
01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:00.330
Jennífer castro: Well, I have one tomorrow. And I have one on Thursday with two different people.

825
01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.590
Dr Jameson: So, okay, okay.

826
01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.460
Jennífer castro: Now, one of them is my counselor and then I want to see that one lady again.

827
01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:07.080
Dr Jameson: Because I know

828
01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:11.040
Jennífer castro: When I talked to her when I use gave me to her last week or the week before that.

829
01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:15.960
Jennífer castro: We didn't talk about none of that stuff. Nothing that she does. It's none of that.

830
01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.220
Dr Jameson: She just loves

831
01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:20.760
Jennífer castro: Me about my friends dying or the people that in your dying around me.

832
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.910
Dr Jameson: Well, I think that was kind of a, yeah. Well, there's

833
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:26.580
Jennífer castro: I didn't know we get so much I

834
01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:30.330
Dr Jameson: Know you can only get to so much in in a certain amount of time, but I think

835
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:45.360
Dr Jameson: We also do like an initial evaluation to see sort of where you're at in general terms, and then you had this kind of crisis, neither my crisis, but it was an acute sort of sudden yeah issue that was happening. So that may be why they focus more on that.

836
01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.170
Dr Jameson: But I think we talked about bipolar right

837
01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.490
Jennífer castro: Yes. Yes. Yeah.

838
01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:58.320
Dr Jameson: So we can get you on some treatment for that it might help with some of your, you know, feeling like getting out of bed. I don't know. But, you know, yeah, I think it's worth

839
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:59.370
Jennífer castro: We're kind of trying to get

840
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:01.260
Dr Jameson: That sort of cleared.

841
01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.690
Dr Jameson: So that you have that you're not self medicating on top of every

842
01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:14.730
Dr Jameson: Right else. Right. Yes. Yeah. Okay, so just keep make sure you've got alarm set and all that. So you keep those appointments, but yeah.

843
01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.910
Jennífer castro: My mom is an early riser and early sleeper so

844
01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.790
Jennífer castro: Like her schedule sucks. I've been almost on it.

845
01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.560
Dr Jameson: Okay. All right, so then. Yeah, so I mean I don't, I think.

846
01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.990
Dr Jameson: Yes, if we can contain if you can continue, I shouldn't say weeks I'm doing nothing.

847
01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:37.350
Dr Jameson: To try you know maybe cut back to once a day, or I don't know how many

848
01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.880
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, you're

849
01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:43.620
Dr Jameson: On or whatever. But if we can keep on working moving

850
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:45.720
Dr Jameson: In that direction. Yes. Okay.

851
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:49.620
Dr Jameson: Yeah, unless you think stopping all of a sudden is better.

852
01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:51.600
Jennífer castro: Well, no, I don't.

853
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:52.770
Dr Jameson: Because you would have already done.

854
01:10:56.190 --> 01:11:04.170
Dr Jameson: Okay, well, um, yeah. I think if we can just keep moving. And then I appreciate your being open about it and and

855
01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.200
Dr Jameson: We'll just kind of keep on moving forward and hopefully these other

856
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:14.430
Dr Jameson: Appointments and getting going with counting all that will kind of help.

857
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.570
Jennífer castro: Okay. I hope so too, because I feel like I'm making a lot of progress, but

858
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:19.530
Jennífer castro: Yeah.

859
01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.650
Jennífer castro: I don't know, I guess, only that my drug tests will tell right

860
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:29.310
Dr Jameson: Well, but you know how you're feeling and how are you having cravings, like what's

861
01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:33.540
Jennífer castro: Um, no, not really, not at all like I have a lot of pain. No, I mean, but

862
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:37.320
Jennífer castro: Like my shoulders really been bothering me lately.

863
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:41.460
Jennífer castro: Because my to use that to me because I heard it when I will be because I'm massage therapist.

864
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.070
Jennífer castro: I heard it a long time ago.

865
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.550
Jennífer castro: But I kept pushing through it. And I think that's what helped me push through it, though.

866
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.380
Dr Jameson: Does it seem muscular to you or

867
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:50.910
Jennífer castro: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

868
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.470
Dr Jameson: So you do have some stretches or balls are saying you can

869
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.990
Jennífer castro: Yeah yeah yeah I do do that.

870
01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:01.260
Dr Jameson: Okay, if anybody is equipped to be able to

871
01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.800
Jennífer castro: So now we can't touch each other. So I can't even call one

872
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:07.410
Dr Jameson: Know what I'm saying we're nowhere you probably can.

873
01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:08.640
Jennífer castro: Do. You're right. Right.

874
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.850
Jennífer castro: No, but what I'm saying is I would normally I would have called one of my

875
01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:14.850
Jennífer castro: co workers and had them like just massage me, but I can't do that.

876
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:15.630
Dr Jameson: Yeah.

877
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.220
Jennífer castro: You know, so right.

878
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.750
Dr Jameson: Now it's frustrating.

879
01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:24.540
Dr Jameson: Okay, but that should also, at least that's also a

880
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:29.640
Dr Jameson: It's a reversible thing like it's not a

881
01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:34.920
Dr Jameson: You know, there's nothing you don't have a ripped rotator cuff or something.

882
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.970
Jennífer castro: Now, we don't have any

883
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:37.200
Jennífer castro: Though yeah I don't

884
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.730
Dr Jameson: I would doubt it, it might

885
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:43.620
Jennífer castro: Never went to the doctor for it, but I do know that. I mean, it hurts a lot

886
01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:51.930
Jennífer castro: hasn't really been like, hurting. Like when I, when I first heard it. I mean, it was all the way down my arm, my fingertips.

887
01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:52.920
Dr Jameson: Okay.

888
01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:55.290
Jennífer castro: But now it just stays in my shoulder. Okay.

889
01:12:55.350 --> 01:13:03.480
Dr Jameson: So that's improving them. So yeah, so maybe try to put yourself on a schedule of at least a couple of times a day, stretching and rolling

890
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:10.170
Dr Jameson: Whatever, at least, and then hopefully that will continue to work itself out.

891
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:18.840
Dr Jameson: When you smoke. I mean, I, I'm so naive. I don't know. Is it there's like so many hits you can take or I mean

892
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:25.980
Jennífer castro: Every like I'll smoke a bowl, whatever, like a ball to me like between three people will laugh, like, No, I don't know.

893
01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.450
Jennífer castro: Okay, but it'll go around.

894
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:29.880
Dr Jameson: Do you see your serious this is a

895
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:30.720
Dr Jameson: Group.

896
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:32.850
Dr Jameson: A social social event.

897
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:33.600
Dr Jameson: Okay, yeah.

898
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.190
Jennífer castro: Everybody wakes up, that's kind

899
01:13:35.190 --> 01:13:36.780
Jennífer castro: Of like everybody migrate.

900
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.660
Dr Jameson: And, um,

901
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:41.760
Dr Jameson: Well, I mean,

902
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.770
Jennífer castro: Maybe I maybe I need to change that.

903
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.500
Dr Jameson: But well, right. So I think there's

904
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:47.700
Dr Jameson: There's multiple

905
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.940
Dr Jameson: You know factors involved. So yeah, I think.

906
01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:57.450
Dr Jameson: Or have a social visit without that do that by yourself or something. So it's not

907
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:59.430
Dr Jameson: One in the same

908
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:00.570
Yeah.

909
01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:04.830
Jennífer castro: Well, I'm pretty happy with my progress.

910
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.770
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no, I think you're doing. I think you're doing great.

911
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:09.660
Dr Jameson: I'm just sort of brainstorming if

912
01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.830
Dr Jameson: You smoke cigarettes to

913
01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.410
Jennífer castro: Yes, but I've cut way down on. Oh.

914
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:18.180
Jennífer castro: Good.

915
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:24.990
Dr Jameson: Well, I, the reason I was thinking about that is that healing your body tissues is very difficult when there's

916
01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.270
Dr Jameson: less oxygen and

917
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:30.510
Dr Jameson: Smoking affects the blood vessels so

918
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:35.910
Dr Jameson: Getting your shoulder to feel completely better will be easier.

919
01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:40.470
Dr Jameson: With less smoking and smoking, of all things, not just

920
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.520
Jennífer castro: Right, that's what I am a smoker smokers. Yeah.

921
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:45.390
So,

922
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:50.040
Dr Jameson: I know they're probably more expensive but like patches or

923
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.720
Dr Jameson: Nicotine

924
01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.370
Jennífer castro: I can get them for free.

925
01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:54.630
Dr Jameson: Oh, okay.

926
01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.480
Jennífer castro: Well, because I'm Indian side, just go to that reservation.

927
01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.300
Jennífer castro: Everything I get there. Almost anything and everything for free so

928
01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:04.050
Okay.

929
01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.720
Dr Jameson: Good and bad. I got your travel card. So, and I do have that

930
01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:10.560
Cool.

931
01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:17.490
Dr Jameson: Because that would be another way to at least keep the the tar and all that stuff out of your lungs.

932
01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:21.570
Jennífer castro: Just

933
01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.040
Dr Jameson: Just another thought. Okay.

934
01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:26.070
Dr Jameson: Anything else you need

935
01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:32.010
Jennífer castro: From. You know, I think I've gotten all my appointment order right now. As long as I don't miss them.

936
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:35.190
Jennífer castro: I'll be fine. And I'll see you Wednesday.

937
01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:38.670
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I guess so. You have you have lots of appointments. This almost every day.

938
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:40.440
Jennífer castro: Do I do

939
01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:41.940
Dr Jameson: Well,

940
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:45.360
Dr Jameson: But that's a meeting. Yeah. You can't say we weren't paying attention.

941
01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:49.110
Jennífer castro: Okay.

942
01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:59.700
Dr Jameson: Okay, well good i mean i i think yeah i'm i'm not i'm not displeased either is just we like to kind of, I kind of left them a standing standing

943
01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:04.080
Dr Jameson: Request that when somebody has something that's not supposed to be in their drug

944
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.450
Dr Jameson: Screen that just set up an appointment with me so

945
01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:06.900
Jennífer castro: Uh huh.

946
01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:07.980
Dr Jameson: I think that's what happened.

947
01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:20.190
Jennífer castro: No, yeah, no, for sure. I had asked to when I did the drug test. If I was going to have to have a meeting with you because she's. Oh yeah, I'll just put it into her secretary and I'm pretty sure you'll get a call for Monday, so

948
01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:25.830
Jennífer castro: So, I mean, it's no big deal. I appreciate it, though.

949
01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:34.290
Dr Jameson: Yeah, no, I am I'm yeah I know there's this. This is a challenging environment in which to try to

950
01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:41.100
Dr Jameson: Can you can you exercise like kids are aware somewhere, you can go for a walk or ride a bike.

951
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:44.610
Jennífer castro: Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now. I do that all the time. That's really all I do.

952
01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.310
Jennífer castro: When I'm outside that that's really all I do. Take a look.

953
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.720
Jennífer castro: Good.

954
01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.550
Jennífer castro: Well that's good for you. Yeah.

955
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:52.170
Dr Jameson: Okay.

956
01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:53.610
Dr Jameson: Um,

957
01:16:53.760 --> 01:17:00.180
Dr Jameson: I guess the other thing was, I'm trying to think, what else you can. I don't know how much you have as far as kitchen, but like

958
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:03.390
Dr Jameson: If you like to cook or i don't i don't know but

959
01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:03.960
Dr Jameson: Trying to watch

960
01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:09.450
Jennífer castro: The trailer. So propane is like limited sometimes so like I can't just experiment going there.

961
01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:10.620
Dr Jameson: You know what

962
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.380
Dr Jameson: I do another recipes that involve knock

963
01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:14.550
Dr Jameson: Cooking, then I don't know.

964
01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:16.080
Jennífer castro: Very true. Doesn't have to

965
01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.870
Dr Jameson: Be heat, heat related, I suppose.

966
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:20.520
Jennífer castro: Very true. That's very true.

967
01:17:20.610 --> 01:17:22.410
Dr Jameson: Vegetables are. I know.

968
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.530
Dr Jameson: Yeah, I'm just trying to think of things to

969
01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:26.130
Occupy

970
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:35.070
Dr Jameson: Do you have any interest or what did you talk. I can't remember anymore about going back to school.

971
01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.700
Jennífer castro: Oh, I have some I have like massage therapy under my belt.

972
01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:41.580
Jennífer castro: I'm Tech under my belt.

973
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:46.230
Jennífer castro: I kind of wanted to do something with medical but right now I don't think that's

974
01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:53.430
Jennífer castro: In my future, but my medical system. I was recovering addict to my mother.

975
01:17:56.850 --> 01:17:57.690
Jennífer castro: That's what they try

976
01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:04.410
Dr Jameson: Yeah. Well, I was just thinking of things to occupy time that you can do from home that are, you know,

977
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.750
Jennífer castro: Constructive

978
01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:14.790
Dr Jameson: Do music and I'll do sing or play you don't

979
01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.850
Jennífer castro: Know, I don't do nothing like I have no talent like that at all.

980
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:20.490
Dr Jameson: Lately,

981
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.510
Yeah.

982
01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:25.320
Dr Jameson: I'm only half kidding.

983
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:30.270
Dr Jameson: The record harmonica. I don't know.

984
01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.860
Jennífer castro: Yeah, I think I drive everybody crazy with that they'd want to do drugs.

985
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:37.410
Dr Jameson: Or they'd love it.

986
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:38.520
Jennífer castro: You don't know. Yeah.

987
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:42.030
Dr Jameson: Maybe you have to start far away when

988
01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:46.980
Dr Jameson: I hear you. Anyway, I don't know, just ideas of things that might be

989
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:52.830
Jennífer castro: Well, those are so forth. I mean, I'll make a list. How about that. I'm like,

990
01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.420
Jennífer castro: Yeah, like, you know, we'll talk

991
01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:54.870
Jennífer castro: About that.

992
01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:56.730
Dr Jameson: Your ideas are probably better than mine.

993
01:18:57.090 --> 01:18:57.300
Yeah.

994
01:19:00.090 --> 01:19:04.830

01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:09.630
NUU A7L: I'm okay my tablet was crashing and I am in my little phone here with work because it didn't last time. But thankful that it did.

1014
01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:10.860
Okay.

1015
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:15.600
Dr Jameson: So you're scratching just today or you mean last week.

1016
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:22.260
Dr Jameson: Now you're muted. We think happened.

1017
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.810
Dr Jameson: Somehow you got muted.

1018
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.120
Dr Jameson: Can you unmute yourself.

1019
01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:29.430
Dr Jameson: I don't know how you got muted.

1020
01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.350
Dr Jameson: There. Oh.

1021
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.900
NUU A7L: Frustrating with this phone. That's why I don't like to use it.

1022
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:38.700
Dr Jameson: Oh, I don't know how you can

1023
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:39.780
NUU A7L: Put it on. Sorry.

1024
01:20:39.810 --> 01:20:41.220
Dr Jameson: to disturb or something. That's okay.

1025
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:45.840
Dr Jameson: I'm okay. So you what happened last week with group.

1026
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.390
NUU A7L: On my aunt. I had a major stroke and I'm

1027
01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:52.680
Dr Jameson: Very, very close

1028
01:20:53.430 --> 01:21:13.890
NUU A7L: And and so what they did was they found her unresponsive and she is in a convalescent home and but it was just, it was just very, all of a sudden she ended up having TI and a stroke, and she's already had a couple of them, but

1029
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.730
NUU A7L: She's a little bit better. But if they were just thinking that she wasn't going to make it so it was just a crazy day

1030
01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:21.930
Dr Jameson: So I bet I'm

1031
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:23.490
Dr Jameson: Did

1032
01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:28.200
Dr Jameson: You get your did they call in the medicine for you.

1033
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.330
NUU A7L: Yes, they did.

1034
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.650
NUU A7L: Thank you so much. It was

1035
01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:34.440
NUU A7L: A fiasco, but it ended up

1036
01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.910
NUU A7L: Working out and

1037
01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:39.060
Dr Jameson: And I appreciate ya know, it's, it's hard.

1038
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:48.660
Dr Jameson: Yeah, that's right. I didn't get a message about this now that now that you said that, like, oh yeah, we had a bunch of people missing last week, so I forgot. At first, who was what, but

1039
01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:59.970
Dr Jameson: It gets tricky. BECAUSE I WORK. I WORK hospice, actually. So I'm out of the house and also in convalescing both on Thursdays and Fridays. I'm not around. So if you miss. It's kind of hard to

1040
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:05.400
Dr Jameson: Oh, I think that's what the delay was about is that, you know, it gets harder to get

1041
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:06.720
NUU A7L: A hold of me.

1042
01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.110
NUU A7L: Yeah.

1043
01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:13.170
Dr Jameson: I understand. So I'm sorry to hear about your on tonight, I hope, I hope he continues to

1044
01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:19.290
Dr Jameson: Move towards her towards her previous baseline. Now, that's scary.

1045
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:23.580
Dr Jameson: How are things going. Otherwise, are you

1046
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:25.470
Dr Jameson: hanging in there.

1047
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:40.080
Dr Jameson: Hello.

1048
01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:05.610
Dr Jameson: So this is Natalie Gomez. I'll just start dictating here for follow up after she missed her group last week.

1049
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:09.840
Dr Jameson: She reports that her aunt had a

1050
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:15.210
Dr Jameson: Sudden stroke that day and was rushed to the hospital and

1051
01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.760
Dr Jameson: Given that

1052
01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:26.490
Dr Jameson: anxiety related to that. And in the middle of it all happening, she she wasn't able to get to group. She did call

1053
01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.100
Dr Jameson: I think the next day.

1054
01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:35.280
Dr Jameson: And there was some delay, but we ultimately were able to get her bridge for this week.

1055
01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.070
Dr Jameson: Mental Status physicals normal odd severe

1056
01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:43.020

01:23:57.570 --> 01:23:58.680
Dr Jameson: Two and a half a day.

Dr Jameson: Continue with weekly group. The Arctic Doug screen and individual counseling.

1060
01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:10.500
Dr Jameson: BEFORE THAT WE HAD JENNIFER Castro.

1061
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.970
