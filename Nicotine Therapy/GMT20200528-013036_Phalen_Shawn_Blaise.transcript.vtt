Shawn Lewis: Okay. Excellent. All right. Thank you. Nice meeting you, which we did you have a good day. Bye.

215
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.400
Shawn Phalen: Hey,

216
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.320
Shawn Phalen: How are you

217
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.470
C210AE: I'm alive. How about you.

218
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.570
I'm good.

219
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.120
Shawn Phalen: Tommy. Tommy, Ben.

220
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:49.110
C210AE: I'm always the same, for I mean pretty much every day. I'm a I act normal, but I don't feel normal on the inside.

221
00:22:51.030 --> 00:23:06.360
C210AE: Okay, always acting or no matter what I'm going through or what how I feel. I always act appropriate and normal and nobody ever would have a clue. You know how I feel. I mean, even when I tell them they don't have a clue. So that's unfortunate but

222
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.020
Shawn Phalen: Hey, are you still living in your car.

223
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.790
C210AE: Oh, yes.

224
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.950
C210AE: Yeah, that's going to be that way for a long time.

225
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:24.540
C210AE: I'm sorry, I was looking for a snack. I just bought. Anyways, yeah that's been that way for a long time. It's called again stay that way for a while. Okay. And by choice.

226
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:32.730
C210AE: Well yeah, I guess so. Because I'm not going to go to, um, I don't want, I don't want to go to no shelter. I don't do that.

227
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.370
C210AE: I'll just say by choice.

228
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.200
Okay, how was

229
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.640
C210AE: The last time we talked

230
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.360
Shawn Phalen: You said that you were. Are you still using when you get

231
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.330
C210AE: Yeah yeah

232
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.980
C210AE: Okay.

233
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.320
Shawn Phalen: You're still getting the Suboxone to

234
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:04.110
C210AE: Yeah.

235
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.500
C210AE: Okay.

236
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:12.270
C210AE: So,

237
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.060
Shawn Phalen: Do you have any desire to stop using

238
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.140
C210AE: I'm now.

239
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:31.920
C210AE: It's all so to me it's still only thing that's on the only thing there for me and I try. I, I, probably, you know, I feel like

240
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:41.100
C210AE: I should have. I should have just lied to you guys given fake because it would have been very easy. I've done it a million times before as our places and

241
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:50.100
C210AE: I wanted to be honest with you guys and I can tell already that's only going to screw me because that's all anybody cares about and that's that's the least issue.

242
00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:51.480
C210AE: So,

243
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:58.830
C210AE: I came because I just don't understand why, like why people are the way they are, but um

244
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:06.540
C210AE: Yes. I mean, yeah, no, no, no, I'm not gonna look like because it's all, it's only thing there for me. Yeah.

245
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.960
C210AE: That's the only thing they're really interesting like things. It's just a straight up only thing that's the only thing that helps me

246
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:21.240
C210AE: Seems like people sure as hell don't and therapies and all that shit doesn't either. So at least this thing has to stay alive.

247
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:32.400
C210AE: I mean, it helped me stay alive, but it helps me. It helps me. That's how I make my money and everything is by exception with energy, I'm always had the pound of fame. I gotta work my ass off just to make my music 20 bucks.

248
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.610
C210AE: Recently, just a recycle or I'm always doing the hard work but

249
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:47.010
C210AE: If, if that if you think that would be the main issue for all of our situations and

250
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:53.460
C210AE: I should just, I don't know. I should do. I should i don't i shouldn't waste my time when you shouldn't waste your time, I guess.

251
00:25:53.940 --> 00:26:06.030
C210AE: Because I just don't even understand any of this. I don't know how you guys are even supposed to get to know many of us as I'm watching group. You can tell them that they're not everyone's really nice that works with your companies, but

252
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:18.030
C210AE: Nobody. I don't think anyone's really making any connection, you know, they see all of the people the same, even though they also different. So I don't. I just don't understand what this is what this is.

253
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:26.910
C210AE: Well, like you don't understand the group or you don't and I don't I don't understand what's helpful about any of this.

254
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:43.290
C210AE: Yes, I'm on this like 30 so hard and like me every time I call into this group, I have, I get. I've never even had anxiety attacks and I'm getting major anxiety attacks every time I call this place because

255
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:50.490
C210AE: And they advertise themselves as being convenient stuff and it's so the opposite of that and

256
00:26:51.750 --> 00:27:08.670
C210AE: Even at times the group's 1111 in the afternoon or seven. Those are like the two, you're too busy times how strange that they would. I thought they wanted you to have a life. But now, but now he kind of camp, because you got to have group 11 or seven. I'm just, I just don't understand whether

257
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.400
C210AE: I just wish there was someone that wanted to truly help, you know, and I just haven't found that yet.

258
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:20.760
C210AE: So I'm just so totally discouraged and I'm having this is a bad day. Because typically, I don't even let

259
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:33.210
C210AE: People know how I feel so bad days, or when I actually do tell people how I feel. So I'm discouraged and I feel like I don't like dealing with humans at all. Every time I have two major let down at

260
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:40.380
C210AE: Least disappointment and I'm less than satisfying and what doesn't says how, what would you like

261
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:49.860
C210AE: Me to me. I'd like up with the problems that matter the farms that I fuckin got destroyed.

262
00:27:50.340 --> 00:28:03.390
C210AE: On my insides. I do crank because I'm devastated and no one seems to give a shit about that based want to talk about the crank. It's like I walked away from crank easily and I could do it again if I have if I ever had a reason to, you know,

263
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:24.300
C210AE: I think I have PTSD. I think I got off bad things happened when I went on like I felt when I was at the height of my heartache. I felt like allowed I heard about snap like in my mind in my head and my eyes kind of shook and I felt dizzy and I felt nervous. Same sense and I

264
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.210
C210AE: Think that would make me think that

265
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:40.020
C210AE: I all I all I could do with abandoning my whole life and move into my car that because that's all I could handle things that you think that would be an issue that would want to try to get help with her.

266
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.450
Do you want to talk about

267
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.470
C210AE: I mean that when I did just now and

268
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.810
C210AE: It's. I mean, it would be nice to be able to talk about something and have somebody actually

269
00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:01.710
C210AE: Understand, I know it's really, I can only imagine it must be so hard that try to understand people if you haven't gone through it yourself. I understand that. But, um,

270
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.010
C210AE: So I guess, I guess. There's just, there's no way around it. People can never really understand

271
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.620
C210AE: Um, I used to have a normal life. I did amazing things for myself.

272
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.990
C210AE: I didn't

273
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:24.060
C210AE: Just like there was a guy on group yesterday. He kept he kept telling them, look, I don't have issues with that of God's healing takes being healed because he has pain.

274
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.370
C210AE: And just like every other painkillers and they end up taking too much so that he can answer box on and

275
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:38.070
C210AE: So talking about relapse with him is ridiculous because it's not about relapse. The whole different situation. That's how I feel about myself.

276
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:46.050
C210AE: I'm not like the, the average person who sits in games and hawed, and you know, gets a boner for their drugs and stay. I mean, I

277
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:58.200
C210AE: I can easily walked away when it was time and I made a life myself. I never looked back. And this time I chose to do it and thank God, because I sure as hell didn't have anybody or anything else that would have been there for me.

278
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.970
C210AE: I mean I feel like it stayed in my life. And now I'm just homeless and I'm

279
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:10.680
C210AE: Getting plan. I would be sitting in my car all day every day. I couldn't even imagine how horrific. That would be

280
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:23.790
C210AE: Just sitting in it for two hours. I'm already in so much pain, your stamp your feet are swollen. I just don't understand. No, no, I'm just, I hate life right now says, I have a conference call.

281
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:34.200
C210AE: I hate life. It's mostly because of everybody that I speak to, I guess, that sounds Nina router arrogant or something. But I just fucking

282
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:48.870
C210AE: I'm allowed to do really I I know how to act and go get a job. I already have a job as a fact. But I don't have to do the normal things. But I don't know how to do is feel right on the inside, about humans and our, our

283
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:56.820
C210AE: Or rules or anything else, like I can't stand any of it. I wish it to me. I can't society.

284
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:02.580
C210AE: All of it. I don't even. I don't know what to the longer I'm homeless them harder that's getting because

285
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:12.120
C210AE: The more you are your opposites like Thomas. People are like, on this side and societies on the side and and then the longer you're homeless, you just start

286
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:16.650
C210AE: I can't stand anything about the people I've walked around daily with

287
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:30.480
C210AE: I that's something that I could maybe I would need help with one of my only goals when I told you last time was I wanted to make call my son. And that's something that has happened since I've talked to you. So we're talking every night.

288
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.640
Shawn Phalen: Really wow that's

289
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.040
Shawn Phalen: Because I don't think you knew where he was, was that

290
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:45.960
C210AE: Yeah, I wasn't sure what happened or where I was. But I found them. And we've been talking every night and I always let them know you know how wrong I am and I'm

291
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:55.650
C210AE: How much he deserves better now. Sorry, I am and I always think that's important to let your kids know that you you're wrong, you know that you're wrong and ask him for forgiveness, you know,

292
00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:08.640
C210AE: And he always he always tells me how he's not even tripping on any of that. And, um, and, um, I guess I just start believing him because he's always said that, but I've always felt so much guilt, you know, right.

293
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.480
Shawn Phalen: Where is he,

294
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.650
Did you find him.

295
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:25.740
C210AE: And I finally got my was my mother's name number and I texted her and she always I knew she would know where it is, because she always stays by his side.

296
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:27.150
So,

297
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.640
Shawn Phalen: So you got you got the number you got his however from your mom.

298
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:41.610
C210AE: Well, I contacted my mom and told her how at college and feeling about my son and out concerned, I am and how the love I feel for him and

299
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:51.780
C210AE: I was letting her know that I have over. I'm not being there for him and stuff, but I, I didn't. I still didn't get his number or column or anything, and

300
00:32:53.250 --> 00:33:01.020
C210AE: And she wasn't trying to push this subject and I guess just in a couple few days later she told me right what I said. And then he asked my friend number and he called me.

301
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.420
C210AE: Now because

302
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.340
Really

303
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:17.040
C210AE: When it does that to me with a kid. It's just there's nothing you can do. Sometimes it is too late on some things you learn your lesson is too late.

304
00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:33.330
C210AE: The damage is done, or whatever. And I just wish that nobody should have to feel that kind of regret with a child, you know. Too bad it. I wish that we learned our lessons from other people, but we all have to learn our own heart lessons that sucks you know

305
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.900
Shawn Phalen: Well, it sounds like you still have

306
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.690
C210AE: Killed even though he said to that.

307
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:43.890
C210AE: He's okay.

308
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:45.960
He believes

309
00:33:47.580 --> 00:34:05.730
C210AE: That he said no, he's not he's okay he's not okay, he's my son severely mentally ill, and he doesn't believe he is. Yeah. And then right when you get to stop this medication, but I it's hard not to feel. I know I feel guilt because I'm honest with myself.

310
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.920
C210AE: And

311
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.950
Shawn Phalen: So where's who knows Hannah facility. Do you know

312
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:19.170
C210AE: Yeah, yeah. He's back. He's got he went back, he was out for five months at a group home and he not do a back. Okay, so he's in a group.

313
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.790
C210AE: Yeah, he was. But then he doesn't know back to another place.

314
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:36.420
C210AE: And I'm whatever institution or something and it's so it's so awful. I mean, it's not like the kind of awful. You see, when I'm movies where they're getting butts lift and shift, but

315
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:45.450
C210AE: To me, it's awful because they could, they could be using this time. Some people are there for years. And not only does Medicaid on them in front of a TV.

316
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:56.550
C210AE: They don't, they don't get the there's so much I could be doing for these people. They could have they should have gyms, they should have a gym in there, they should have stuff trying to teach them how to give them self respect teach them how to fucking

317
00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:05.340
C210AE: succeed in life and nobody will ever care about those people and nobody will ever do anything about it. It's heart wrenching

318
00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.500
Shawn Phalen: So how was it when you talk

319
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.630
C210AE: To him every night you feel better.

320
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:29.010
C210AE: Yeah, yeah. I feel better. I might I feel bad, sometimes because um when he likes to talk about his new beliefs is new beliefs that all his experiences that he had during his breakdown or whatever are

321
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:40.500
C210AE: I mean, I've never he has so much detail about all the stuff he. I mean, it's a whole made up. It's like a. It's like the Illuminati. It's all about the Illuminati.

322
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:48.990
C210AE: Illuminati is a big thing. It's like an hour and rules, his whole life. All he wanted decorations to be that he wants his clothing to be that and and

323
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:58.020
C210AE: I've never heard such detail. I'M IN THE DETAIL HE CAN GO BACK major detail all these, you know, hundreds and thousands a year is from the beginning of time and

324
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:07.410
C210AE: Or even before people were born and he has all the details you to come up with to tell some sort of make a movie like that you know he has all the major details, it's like, wow, I just

325
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:16.380
C210AE: And he wants, he, he feels bad that I don't believe him. And I tell him it's not that I don't believe you. I know that you're not lying to me. I know that.

326
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:26.670
C210AE: You believe that but I just can't. I'm not going to act like I think he's right. I told him I know what I what I saw was mental illness, you know,

327
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:36.360
C210AE: And I'm sticking to it. I'm not going to pretend like it's not just for him. I don't know what, maybe, I don't know what the right way to do it, but I'm, I'm, if

328
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:47.190
C210AE: I guess I don't even know how to have relationship with my son right now. Really, because I'm sure there's ways to what you're supposed to do when someone's mentally ill some, you know, certain ways to be supportive and

329
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.770
Shawn Phalen: Stuff. Well, I mean, do you just do just listen. I mean,

330
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.330
C210AE: Can you just tell me

331
00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:02.550
C210AE: When he tells me he wants to talk when he talks about all the details and everything. Yeah, yeah. I listened to. I just, I listened to him, but

332
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:18.300
C210AE: He wants me to he wants conversation out of it, you know, or it gets to the point, it gets to a point where I have to say something and I'm not going to say, Oh, that's nice. I'm glad you know you you've had that experience. I'm not gonna say that.

333
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.820
C210AE: I can't say that I mean this. Take that experience was the most devastating.

334
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.000
C210AE: thing ever. Yeah.

335
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:36.540
C210AE: That's his reality right now people he has his. He used to be into God and stuff. And now he's more into Satan and

336
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:42.360
C210AE: He asked me if I would wanted to live with them because he's gonna have his own place on suits doing I tell them

337
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:53.580
C210AE: I said I will do one live with you, but I can't have state and stuff all around me. I my whole life. I made sure it's not. I haven't even gotten same room was a leaderboard as a kid.

338
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.670
C210AE: Not doing anything satanic I stayed away from because I know it's real. And I have I have gotten my heart and I

339
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:10.980
C210AE: I know how real same is, you know, I just didn't want no part of it. And I told them I i for the hard times. I would go and do I can be vulnerable right now and it's not even smart to put myself in

340
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:16.650
C210AE: Around demonic shit. You know, I just don't. I mean, if he wants. So I'm and

341
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:25.530
C210AE: Then he said, yeah, then I guess you don't want to live with me because he just going to he wants to. That's what makes it seem so fake. To me, like, you know, kids when kids.

342
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.970
C210AE: Are trying to bug their parents or something or when they're young, you know, it's like all about wearing the black nail polish and the black hair and

343
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:40.830
C210AE: I mean, if I told him, if you're really all about it. You don't have to talk about it and where it and for your decorations everywhere because you're you already that you

344
00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:51.150
C210AE: You believe it already. You don't have to prove it to the world you know it's it's like your own thing. You don't have that we all, everybody believed in something doesn't mean they were it and have it all, all the decorations that and

345
00:38:51.810 --> 00:39:01.470
C210AE: It doesn't have to be so extreme with it makes me that proves mental illness that's just not normal. Yeah. He sounds very normal dinis race.

346
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.950
C210AE: He sounds like my son, and he's smart and

347
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:17.580
C210AE: He's not having an episode or anything, it's, it's just, if he tells you what he believes, then you go, okay. There has to be something wrong, you know, but he doesn't act like that or look like that or talk like that. It seems very normal.

348
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:29.340
C210AE: So it sounds like the medication that he's taking his work. Would you say that i guess i thought that i thought that he doesn't know he's mentally ill, though.

349
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.430
C210AE: So does. I thought that meant to me. It's not working.

350
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:45.030
C210AE: He's made some medicine. It makes them. It makes them gain weight. They don't today is, in my opinion, they just don't do shit for them there no shame on them, you know,

351
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:58.800
C210AE: I mean, God, I wish I would have known back when, when what I know now about myself. I could have, I would have loved to been an attorney or something and bought for those any any downtrodden.

352
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.950
C210AE: Didn't feel like it. I just wouldn't go to school. Now it's time for that. I think I could have been good at it.

353
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.290
Shawn Phalen: And were so year. By Sacramento. Right.

354
00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:18.240
C210AE: No. Well, I guess I mean I'm not that I'm a couple hours for it. I'm by San Francisco. I'm an hour from Sam. So.

355
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.190
C210AE: Where's your son now he is in Yuba City.

356
00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.390
Shawn Phalen: Where's the

357
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:29.820
C210AE: Yuba City, which I think that's two hours for me, but I'm not sure.

358
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:43.800
C210AE: Okay, you know what i've been i've been saying my son's 23 for the longest time, and he said that he's 25 so and that would that sticks out is ever since I came to Santa Rosa.

359
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:58.710
C210AE: I've pretty much lost. I lost time because I this let none of this was the plan that I didn't come down here. Just fucking be abandoned and have to learn how to survive in this crazy fucked up smelly city that was not the plan at all.

360
00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:07.170
C210AE: So I did my time just keeps going on. It took me many, many months just to get a grasp of even how to drive around the city. I've never been in the city, you know,

361
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.060
C210AE: I just didn't realize started been, like, a year and a half. I've been here. That's crazy.

362
00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.300
Shawn Phalen: Where's your mom or to Sheila.

363
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.740
C210AE: These um

364
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:27.270
C210AE: I forget my, my son said she was she's in our. I don't think you remember she's not where she normally as you normally either in my life where I'm from.

365
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:35.040
C210AE: Or next to him, I guess she's nice she's like half hour away from them, or an hour away or something, I don't know. I don't talk to my mom. Okay.

366
00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:45.450
C210AE: I mean, we're, we don't we don't we like each other and love each other, but we're just both we're both the same type of person that we just don't stay in touch again. Okay.

367
00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.300
Shawn Phalen: Okay.

368
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:52.170
Shawn Phalen: So,

369
00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:56.580
C210AE: Why don't we, we'd be we'd be open to sending

370
00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.630
Shawn Phalen: Another appointment.

371
00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.130
Yeah.

372
00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:07.830
C210AE: Okay, I do. I know I need I've known for a long time that I obviously need counseling because

373
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:17.850
C210AE: Because I just, I can like, though, it's hard to let go of all the bad things when you when you live the consequences of them daily

374
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.540
C210AE: Employees saying, trying to get over it. Well, it's hard when I'm fucking

375
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:36.510
C210AE: Suffering, day in and day out of the consequences from that you don't get over it. When you can't even stop. It just doesn't make sense. So, but maybe it's maybe it's normal that I'm not over things, but every day. I see things

376
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:42.900
C210AE: That it just feels like it's just kicking me so hard just things that I had in my home or

377
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.090
C210AE: In my last

378
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:50.520
C210AE: Things that happened well so many things happened that should never happen.

379
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:59.130
C210AE: And there wasn't the only explanation for happening. Was it it was meant to be, I guess, because I didn't deserve it and

380
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:13.170
C210AE: I didn't know shouldn't happen, it would, it was a lot of times it was someone else's actions that took things through me and I just haven't too hard of a time getting over that.

381
00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:14.820
Shawn Phalen: Okay.

382
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.620
