Curt McDonald: Personalization from a doctor online than I do actually face to face.

93
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.720
Well,

94
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.760
It's just

95
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:52.800
Curt McDonald: Yeah, just making any. But yeah, like I said, I don't do good in in crowds are out being out and and you know with a bunch of people and meeting.

96
00:27:53.310 --> 00:28:00.510
Magalie Marcellus: This is perfect. But that's how it works. So you study, but I'll put this debate in the group meeting and that doesn't

Magalie Marcellus: Everybody, which is unfortunate.

400
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.620
Curt McDonald: IT'S NOT PILL, it's

401
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:14.970

Curt McDonald: Yeah, and that's a

407
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:30.990
Curt McDonald: dangerous thing to do. So once you know people get on that.

408
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.310
Magalie Marcellus: It's hard to

409
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.720

417
00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:05.760

423
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.560
Curt McDonald: talking back and forth and licking their lip.

424
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:28.080
Magalie Marcellus: The end you're not as I

425
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.980

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:36.360

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.340
Curt McDonald: 20 minutes and I'm ready to go sit in the vein and wait for her.

437
00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.320

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:42.330
Magalie Marcellus: I got a bunch of

443
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:45.120

445
00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.660
Curt McDonald: She'll be happy. Oh, yes.

446
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.550
Magalie Marcellus: You're not okay.

451
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:09.930
Magalie Marcellus: Yeah.

452
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.050
Curt McDonald: I guess that's one of my stress reliever to, you know,

453
00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:15.660
Magalie Marcellus: I guess that's something I'm thinking, okay,

454
00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:19.260
Curt McDonald: Yeah, but I'm not since I've been staying

455
00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.590
Curt McDonald: At home more often. I haven't been cooking, very much. I don't know why.

456
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:26.550
Curt McDonald: I would

457
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.590
Curt McDonald: Know when I go to my house. That's my cook.

458
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:32.490
Curt McDonald: Okay.

459
00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.060
Magalie Marcellus: So you could

460
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.400
Curt McDonald: Yeah, well, if I cook here. If I have to cook for an army.

461
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.050
Magalie Marcellus: Oh, there's more people

462
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.180
Curt McDonald: Okay.

463
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.530
Magalie Marcellus: Well that makes sense.

464
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.360
Curt McDonald: For me and her

465
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:54.000
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, I can understand that because the, you know, you can't just cook for one if there's more than one person in the household.

466
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.000
Magalie Marcellus: Right, right.

467
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.660
Magalie Marcellus: So any other goals that you need to work on.

468
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.870
Magalie Marcellus: In the near future.

469
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:15.270
Curt McDonald: Oh, just, I'm going to stay focused, one thing at a time. And I think that's going to have to be my license.

470
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:21.930
Magalie Marcellus: Okay so continue the work then and working game license.

471
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.470
Magalie Marcellus: Are you seeing that one golden

472
00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:29.610
Curt McDonald: easier that way.

473
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:37.230
Magalie Marcellus: Right, so you don't get or anything like that any medical condition that you need to see

474
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.840
Magalie Marcellus: Your primary doctor for

475
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:41.880
Curt McDonald: Nope.

476
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:44.550
Curt McDonald: Not now that I know.

477
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:54.810
Magalie Marcellus: There's no medical issues that you need any ongoing care for anything like that. We said what you just had

478
00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:55.380
No.

479
00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:57.600
Curt McDonald: Right. No.

480
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.960
Curt McDonald: No. So far so good.

481
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:10.230
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, that's good. I know it's when you're healthy when you sick. That's when you know important it is to be healthy.

482
00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:12.630
Magalie Marcellus: So I'm sure you know after

483
00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:16.200
Magalie Marcellus: It's happened to you. Oh yes, you do what you need to do to stay healthy.

484
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.090
Curt McDonald: Oh yes, for sure.

485
00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:25.680
Magalie Marcellus: And, you know, taking anything for sleeping any pills, anything like that.

486
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.890
Curt McDonald: Tries to do

487
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:30.660
Magalie Marcellus: So you do

488
00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:32.040
Magalie Marcellus: Okay, that's

489
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:34.020
Curt McDonald: What I'll take a track on if I need it.

490
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:39.180
Magalie Marcellus: So that was prescribed by Dr. Jamison, yes.

491
00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:44.400
Magalie Marcellus: Just as needed.

492
00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:55.320
Magalie Marcellus: Right. So since you've been with the program any events that happened that, you know, was a concern for that might have

493
00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:03.780
Magalie Marcellus: Either impacted your recovery at all. Anything in the recent past.

494
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:09.510
