43
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.560

47
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:13.440
LIsa Anderson: Yeah, okay. Um, but the Gabba Penton kind of helps just you get sleepy right away and you're able to go to sleep pretty quick.

51
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.370
Place.

65
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:31.290

Amber Romero: Yeah, I do.

67

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.720
LIsa Anderson: Like how really poor sleep just affects everything like you're thinking your concentration, you know, higher

69
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.330
LIsa Anderson: Just emotionally things are

70
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.680
Harder.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.680
LIsa Anderson: hoping she'll call back

88
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:33.810

90
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.470
LIsa Anderson: Session her phone might have died.
