Galaxy A50: Yeah, she she she called me.

6
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.490
Shawn Phalen: And then what I said to her was to email me

7
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.850
What she wanted me to ask her.

8
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.740
Shawn Phalen: Or sorry,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.770
Galaxy A50: Email which he wanted to ask you, yeah.

10
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.700
Shawn Phalen: So here's, here's what she what she wants.

11
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.910
It's pretty standard and

12
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.470
Shawn Phalen: The date that you started working with me.

13
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.100
Shawn Phalen: The presenting problem.

14
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.030
Shawn Phalen: How often, I see you

15
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.110
Shawn Phalen: What type of services you're engaged in which is individual and group.

16
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.870
Often you participate

17
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.250
Shawn Phalen: How do we verify sobriety.

18
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.530
Shawn Phalen: And then just my role and my credentials.

19
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:56.130
Galaxy A50: Okay, sounds like the exact same thing that Dr. Jamison was writing and the letter I thought he was more about, like, if you think that I'm not psychotic but ok

20
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.410
Shawn Phalen: So did Dr. Jamison present something turned this lady to

21
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.500
Galaxy A50: Not to this lady, but to the Court.

22
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.880
Okay.

23
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.300
Shawn Phalen: So, um, what do you want me to put it for the presenting problem.

24
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.550
Galaxy A50: One person presenting of what

25
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.020
Shawn Phalen: The presenting problem, like why why you're here.

26
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:41.490
Galaxy A50: Well, my anxiety, just kind of went through the roof. And that's, that's pretty much it. I've, I knew this was going to happen to in a way like not to that extent, but I know please don't mention that. But I everybody always knew that

27
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:52.620
Galaxy A50: I was always like, I hear below blowing up right and I just did. And I'm sorry but

28
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.520
Galaxy A50: Under the circumstances that I was in.

29
00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.490
Galaxy A50: I don't know.

30
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:12.240
Galaxy A50: So I'm learning coping skills, you know, so I for sure. Much better. I learned

31
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.220
Galaxy A50: To really like take a step back.

32
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.920
Galaxy A50: And be like, whoa, whoa, this is not where this is supposed to go. Hold on. Come back to me is very often.

33
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:35.940
Galaxy A50: In a way, like the police officer. He was the one who was flying off the handle, way more than me. It just, he was doing his dog so

34
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:53.490
Galaxy A50: I should be able to identify when somebody else's having a cycle day and maybe not not go up on that level, and just kind of be like no you come down to me instead. So I've been working on that.

35
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:16.350
Galaxy A50: And yeah, in fact, my ex husband, he kept trying to reach out to me to like get a rise out of me and he's like, you know, our, our son like Hayden is always afraid of making you mad. So he lies to you. It was so insulting. I was like, Bullshit, I said, I don't even get mad these days. Yeah.

36
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:33.060
Galaxy A50: So I've been more assertive also this way. I'm like, no, that did not happen instead of being like, Oh, you, you know, and I'm talking to the world like you are you know you're unfair and I for me. I don't like that. Okay.

37
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.460
Shawn Phalen: What other coping skills are you using

38
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.510
Galaxy A50: Well, so I do have a fleet of meditation for sure.

39
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:56.850
Galaxy A50: I do this breathing thing where I actually learned a long time ago when I was a stripper because I would work. One night, and then not work the other and not be able to fall asleep.

40
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:11.430
Galaxy A50: So I actually learned how to get my breathing so much look like deeper and so much more spaced out that I really could like pass out. If I helped him. So I started using that again.

41
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:24.300
Galaxy A50: And then distractions. So I downloaded amazon music. Yeah, and made several different types of mixes for specific mood.

42
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:34.830
Galaxy A50: And also I really love my job. So as soon as we open that also is going to be a great source of very positive.

43
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.360
Okay.

44
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.810
Shawn Phalen: How often are you meditating.

45
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.540
Galaxy A50: You know as needed.

46
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.150
Galaxy A50: To be honest, I haven't done it in a, in a few weeks.

47
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.720
Galaxy A50: It's hard to do when it's hot.

48
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.150
Galaxy A50: But I do like sit outside and

49
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:16.080
Galaxy A50: Quietly every night. Oh, and also, I don't know if did I ever mentioned. So back in the day, you know, I have a sponsor and back in the day, we would call each other. And once it was a once a day, I would have to report to her and then we would see each other in meetings and stuff.

50
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:29.010
Galaxy A50: Now that there's really no meetings, except in the rooms we actually meet up every day. So either in the morning or in the evening we kind of like get together and

51
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:42.330
Galaxy A50: It's been very various what we do. We don't necessarily talk about our problems, every time. But we give each other about an hour of our attention and just catch up with one in a little bit.

52
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.830
Shawn Phalen: Okay.

53
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.500
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I mean, this is really, really basic.

54
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:16.620
Galaxy A50: Show up. I also just trying to be more aware of my health, because what happened on the airplane. I should have. I should have known that something would happen. I just didn't think about it, because to me, I'm still a 19 year old girl.

55
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:18.570
Shawn Phalen: Right.

56
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.290
Shawn Phalen: So what are some ways you're taking care of your health.

57
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:31.590
Galaxy A50: Well, well, I guess I. It's not that I'm better taking well the whole not drinking not smoking thing.

58
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.310
Galaxy A50: But I'm just more

59
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:44.940
Galaxy A50: How can I say this, I'm finally agreeing with my age, I am not feeling good know

60
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:53.310
Galaxy A50: jilted or whatever, if my backlog sup on me because then I'm like, Whoa, it's the if anything look at it as

61
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.040
Galaxy A50: You waited until 43 to start

62
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.530
Galaxy A50: Getting back problems, which is pretty good.

63
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:06.510
Galaxy A50: You know, just certain things I've, I've made peace with certain things like that. I probably won't have another baby.

64
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:20.160
Galaxy A50: And that was really devastating because I, my son really wanted to simply and i mean i wanted to kid. Finally, when I wanted one instead of somebody pushing one on me as much as I love my child.

65
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:42.210
Galaxy A50: So yeah, and I've just been really not like feeling. I'm not going to say, oh, I don't feel sorry for myself anymore. I'm just more like aware if I'm a little depressed or whatever, what to do, you know, drink a Kombucha, for example, like alkaline really helps me settle and makes me happier.

66
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.250
Galaxy A50: Oh, I forgot the lady who I look with

67
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.450
Galaxy A50: Don't say lady, though they think I live with a guy.

68
00:11:52.410 --> 00:12:11.490
Galaxy A50: She's a huge gardener. So, and she's a little people. So I've been actually what I'm, I'm just, I'm just the labor person. She's gardening can use be a my hands. So I've been doing that. And she's really smart. So I think like nice conversation is really, really peaceful for me. Okay.

69
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.280
Shawn Phalen: When's your court date again.

70
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.110
Galaxy A50: When is no idea

71
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.890
Shawn Phalen: Well, it must be. It must be

72
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.560
Shawn Phalen: Well, there's a must be thinking about it if she's contacting me, you know,

73
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:39.120
Galaxy A50: No, no. So the courts are open, but they're not going in chronological order, where they stopped, they're going

74
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:48.630
Galaxy A50: By importance. So all the violent cases first, then it's going to be custody, then it's going to be divorced, then it's going to be property so

75
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:59.220
Galaxy A50: She's just back to work, is what she's doing. But so my ex husband is a huge liar, and it used to cost me so much distress.

76
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:12.450
Galaxy A50: Because he could lie without blinking and he's so convincing about it that people actually believe him. So I wanted to do family therapy with my son and

77
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:24.630
Galaxy A50: Oh, and so is his attorney. By the way, if you. I mean, that would have been a huge weight off my shoulders. If my son and I, we've been pretty good at communicating, but at first. We weren't

78
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:33.330
Galaxy A50: So if my son and I could do that would be great. So I actually figured it all out and it was supposed to be free through my son's

79
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:53.820
Galaxy A50: Aid like he has helped aid. My ex husband, apparently, and I don't know. They think my attorney doesn't know or what but they said he doesn't want to pay, and you need a court order, but there's nothing to pay. So like, stuff like that would have really pissed me off back in the day.

80
00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:01.530
Galaxy A50: Now, I mean it's I'm I guess I'm more okay with things not being in my control little

81
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.780
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, that's good.

82
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.730
Galaxy A50: And I've been spending time with animals. So that's been very peaceful

83
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.740
Shawn Phalen: How's your anxiety been

84
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.340
Galaxy A50: My anxieties than actually pretty good. I haven't been anxious, except

85
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:34.410
Galaxy A50: Like last week I was a little bit because I was more feeling sorry for myself and that caused more of anger than anything because that was just like

86
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:57.150
Galaxy A50: Every time there's an opportunity for me to finally shine the light on how well I'm doing something happens. So this lady from child support really kind of hurt my feelings last week and and she was just an idiot. But I was just so upset by

87
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.990
Galaxy A50: It's like there's no

88
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:09.180
Galaxy A50: There's no such thing as unsolvable situation if if you're a part of some sort of business, no matter what it is.

89
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:24.360
Galaxy A50: You know how to override something you know who to send a special message to so it's it's a loop. It's a loop. So they took my stimulus. They won't give it to anybody because they can't figure out who it belongs to

90
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.260
Galaxy A50: Child Support Services things that I all this humongous amount of money which I don't

91
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:38.760
Galaxy A50: He also went ahead and filed in Idaho. So, Idaho things I'm not giving him anything

92
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:50.070
Galaxy A50: They were starting to come out for me. Luckily, I was presentable enough and called. You know, cool, calm, collected explain what happened explained that he's a son of a bitch.

93
00:15:50.820 --> 00:16:10.080
Galaxy A50: They said, Okay, we totally believe you. We just need a verification from your textbook case worker is in the wind. I cannot find him. He will not return calls, he will not email, as I call the people they're just like people who pick up the phone.

94
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:17.910
Galaxy A50: They say he's employed. I even asked if I could have a different tastes manager, because he clearly doesn't care.

95
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:27.660
Galaxy A50: They said there's nobody else because right now. It's pretty much what it is, is what it is. But then she goes, well, this is my fourth time CALLING, BY THE WAY,

96
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:46.590
Galaxy A50: And she says, Well, there's nothing that he can actually do about stopping the disbursement of the check and she had the audacity to say the reason why he's called not calling you is because he's you have an attorney to your attorney should be talking to him and not you

97
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:58.200
Galaxy A50: Right. So yeah, but should be at least tell people this right but also on everything that I emailed him. I see see her.

98
00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:08.340
Galaxy A50: So if he really cared, he would have either written me like, hey, Dina have your attorney directly one on one or he would have had her

99
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:18.330
Galaxy A50: But then this lady actually says, well, there's nothing you can do about stopping any of this because we go by what we go by.

100
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:27.180
Galaxy A50: And you Oh, another like three grand, which I don't. And anybody who lives in California right now knows that we're still

101
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:41.550
Galaxy A50: You know, so you would think that I really wanted to be like lady. This is your job. I know you know what to do in this teeny tiny situation to get a human to override the computer. Of course I did not say that.

102
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.550
Galaxy A50: A more came out as laughter

103
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.870
Galaxy A50: But it's just this kind of stuff.

104
00:17:49.890 --> 00:18:12.000
Galaxy A50: I the old me would have said something really abductions. Right. Yeah. So there was a tiny bit of anxiety, but it came out more like laughter and I'm more like nostalgic. I'm a little not depressed. I'm not a depressed person I've been a little sad. I really miss my boss. I know it's stupid.

105
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.480
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, isn't that kind of a weird

106
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:38.640
Galaxy A50: Didn't you guys have a falling. Oh, well, he fired me yes but I don't. I think that there's more to the story. And part of why I miss him so much. And it's not romantic. I just missed him. He was such a big part of my life and I was such a big part of his

107
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:51.300
Galaxy A50: I wish he would just tell me what it is that made him do this I if he would have just said, hey, my wife just didn't want you around me anymore. I would have at least been like

108
00:18:52.440 --> 00:19:09.270
Galaxy A50: Okay, because it ended up being almost like it was my same basically issues that caused me to lose Hayden but but he knew that about me. So, the situation was almost like a little bit played

109
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.260
Galaxy A50: In that direction.

110
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.700
Galaxy A50: That

111
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:26.370
Galaxy A50: Like it was almost like, well, if she gets pissed off enough then she'll leave. Oh, I'm just thinking in my own head, if his wife and him were having problems because of me because him and I were very close but completely platonic

112
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:39.000
Galaxy A50: If he was like, well, I can't just be like, Dina, you're fired. Well, I have to create a situation where she'll either quit or she'll freak out and then I will fire.

113
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:46.770
Galaxy A50: Then I don't know if that's what happened, but just in general, not having him around. He was just a great guy.

114
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:50.220
Shawn Phalen: Yeah.

115
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.250
Shawn Phalen: Are you feeling lonely.

116
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.850
Galaxy A50: Yeah. A little bit, yeah.

117
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:16.950
Galaxy A50: My place gets really hot. And I don't deal with heat very well, which is why I keep coming to work like seven o'clock. My room is still scolding so it's 550 our time and I've been at work since like the moment the sun goes to the west of the house. I have to get the hell out of there.

118
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.620
Shawn Phalen: How hot is it there right now.

119
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:41.460
Galaxy A50: I'm not sure, to be honest. But, uh, my window space West and where I am like the best part of town. It's a little further from the ocean that I'm used to. Yeah, it just very, very warm. Wow. That's crazy. And then, like, people have said.

120
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:58.260
Galaxy A50: You know, close your blinds, or like lower your blinds, then I get not claustrophobic. But then I just get really depressed like because I'm been hiding from sunlight. Yeah. And I just need my own place. Yeah, right.

121
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:00.720
Galaxy A50: Life.

122
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.130
Shawn Phalen: Though, are you working like what's going on. If you guys opened up yet.

123
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.280
Galaxy A50: I'm working on the download because

124
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:15.180
Galaxy A50: I'm inside a hair salon. Okay, I have my own business, but it's inside a hair place.

125
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:36.900
Galaxy A50: So, and we're all very, very, it's not a strip mall. It's like an office building, kind of thing. Like, it's so there's not a lot of traffic and no potential really for issues and we take people's temperature. Okay, so I see like one person a day if back for like one or two services.

126
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:46.140
Galaxy A50: Okay, it's nothing like what I used to do. It was just back to back. People I missed that. Yeah, but you guys should be opening up soon.

127
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.210
Galaxy A50: I will the hair salons are now we'll see ya.

128
00:21:52.860 --> 00:22:04.200
Galaxy A50: My I really want the schools to open. So I could say in court. Hey, we're opening my kid could be here instead

129
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.600
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, and do they have any idea how they're going to structure that yet.

130
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:10.860
No.

131
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:19.050
Galaxy A50: Because social distancing in in frickin recess situation is not possible.

132
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.700
Galaxy A50: I have no idea what's gonna happen. I don't even

133
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:37.140
Galaxy A50: I don't even like if they, I don't think I'll catch a plane there. I think I'll take my car to pick up my kid just because would not be some frickin damn irony.

134
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:44.790
Galaxy A50: If I spent two months now telling my kid how to not catch coronavirus and then they shove them into the airplane.

135
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:50.130
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, that's i agree i wouldn't take an airplane. I would drive whenever you're going to go

136
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.660
Shawn Phalen: Whenever you get the green light. Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't risk.

137
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.130
Taking

138
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:06.300
Galaxy A50: My son and I have been getting along very well. I know, it kind of annoys my ex husband, he's been he's been more

139
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:13.770
Galaxy A50: He's been trying to create more problems, but it's a little bit funny.

140
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:24.030
Galaxy A50: So unfortunately, he's not smart enough to understand it. So it would be great. Like sometimes I do say like

141
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:42.450
Galaxy A50: Do you realize how sad. This is like how clear it is that you have no life or you wouldn't be wasting your time doing this, he doesn't appreciate the gravity of what I'm saying. So that particular philosophy is just lost on him. But you know what it is what it is.

142
00:23:45.780 --> 00:24:06.030
Galaxy A50: I'm, I'm a little upset because I don't understand what my parents are thinking and why, even though we're not friends. Like why they're acting the way that they're acting. They could have at least not helped me but they could have not been hurting me. But they are, um,

143
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:24.210
Galaxy A50: So that will come bite me in the ass later but it is what it is. And they they they did. I don't know if it's an immigrant mentality, or it's a wealthy person mentality. Or maybe it's just a family love the show their love with money. Yeah.

144
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:38.070
Galaxy A50: His family doesn't do that. And they don't understand it. So when my parents show any kind of financial love or help then

145
00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:45.300
Galaxy A50: Then he started screwing with my money he doesn't. They don't understand that it's costing me so much more like

146
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:55.020
Galaxy A50: He ruined my credit in 2017 because his approach to this was all your dad's wealthy. Why are you keep. Why do you keep asking me for money.

147
00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:03.780
Galaxy A50: He doesn't understand that I'm not this kind of handout kind of person he is. He told my family that I don't pay child support, for example.

148
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:13.890
Galaxy A50: He told the state of Idaho that I don't pay child support. It's just one thing after another, with this guy and I have out before, by the way.

149
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:34.950
Galaxy A50: I have told them that I am at my wit's end here, I need help, and he says he wrote me the switch back in text when we were somewhat phone social, he replied. Did you mean to send this to me or did you mean to send that to somebody else, because obviously I'm in Idaho and I can't help

150
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:47.460
Galaxy A50: By so like this kind of out of sight, out of mind is, I just want to, we were we really were fine one he was here, he was

151
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.130
Galaxy A50: A good co parent

152
00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:07.170
Galaxy A50: Oh, so there's one thing that really up so I did have a panic attack when I was talking to Liliana, you do it. Yes, and

153
00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:19.590
Galaxy A50: It was really bad, but I do this thing. Oh, another coping thing that I do, but it has to be really, really bad. So if I feel like I'm hyperventilating because I'm just so upset.

154
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:32.790
Galaxy A50: There's a little voice somewhere in there in the only way I can describe it is. It says if I float out of my own self, and like somehow right above my head.

155
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:47.070
Galaxy A50: I tell myself. Hey, stop it. This is, this is not going to end well. So I've been number in Mexico, my son said something and it triggered a terrible memory in my head. We were on vacation.

156
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:58.380
Galaxy A50: And I just couldn't. I got so upset by this and I asked him to walk out of the room because my breathing was really shallow and I must have sounded really crazy

157
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:10.320
Galaxy A50: So, and I was just like, leaning on the wall, and I could not get this weird weirdness to stop. So then all he hears from the other room is like this. So I

158
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:20.220
Galaxy A50: I did. I was like, if you don't stop right now, you will pass out and your kid in Mexico will have to call 911

159
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:37.740
Galaxy A50: And that little voice made me stop. So with Liliana, I couldn't breathe at all. There was not a sound coming out of me. All of a sudden something just like jammed. And I took a breath and I couldn't exhale

160
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:48.780
Galaxy A50: And it just everything locked on me, so I I somehow I just remember, and she kind of looked at me, thank goodness. My ex husband was over the phone.

161
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:59.700
Galaxy A50: And she was just like, are you okay and I thought if I don't fix this right now. This is going to be up. I'm only going to be further away from

162
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:10.440
Galaxy A50: Seeing my kids and I just said myself Brooklyn Brewery and and I did. I don't know how it took me a moment to be able to speak again after

163
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:27.840
Galaxy A50: That I was able to breathe. There's something that he said at that moment that really upset me so I know that it's we're grownups. It's not a blame game we should be responsible for what we're saying. But the conversation was about him threatening me

164
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.720
Galaxy A50: And he says that I provoked

165
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:55.620
Galaxy A50: Oh yeah, I remember. Yeah, but. But see, I could not say out loud. Well, I didn't insult him he insulted me. So then I insulted him back because it just sounds so stupid, right. So instead I just felt like my grace with her was like slipping away and it just made me not handle it well.

166
00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.000
Shawn Phalen: Yeah, I think you did tell me that you did. Tell me about that.

167
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.460
Shawn Phalen: That was a little bit ago

168
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:11.970
Galaxy A50: Yeah, yeah. But my talk with Liliana was in end of like right before we shut down. It was the week prior to us shutting down

169
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:25.140
Galaxy A50: I just felt like. It's so unfair that he could say, well, no, she didn't express condolences to to me for losing my grandpa she she insulted. She like made fun of me.

170
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:43.740
Galaxy A50: Well, I said nothing wrong to him at all. I was just asking about services and his reply was, no you're not welcome, you're not family well but there was no sense. It didn't say family only or maybe it did, but all it said was for inquiries called the family.

171
00:29:45.180 --> 00:30:00.480
Galaxy A50: Right. So, and when he said you're not family. Well, first off, there was no such thing. And second of all, you married a complete stranger and I'm the one that family who gives a shit. So I was like, Oh, I'm not family. Well, I guess you and Amanda have a lot going on.

172
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:02.580
Yeah.

173
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:09.870
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so I'm gonna get this to her of get this to her by the weekend. Okay.

174
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:20.220
Galaxy A50: Could you if you could just somehow mentioned Dr Khan's name just name drop for me somewhere in there. Yeah.

175
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:37.830
Galaxy A50: And the way I test. I don't know if you know you know how bright heart tests, right, is I just showed them my bathroom and then I usually just put them down. But I talked to them the whole time. As I'm holding the cup under me. Okay.

176
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.170
Shawn Phalen: So up

177
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:42.060

181
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:20.040

197
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:02.460
Shawn Phalen: Hang on.

198
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.020
Bethany Piche: Hello, how are you

199
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.020
Bethany Piche: How's it going, right.

200
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.130
Yeah.

201
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.070
Shawn Phalen: Tell me what's

202
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.080
Shawn Phalen: What's been going on.

203
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:17.580
Bethany Piche: So,

204
00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.710
Bethany Piche: This last week.

205
00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:33.600
Bethany Piche: I got in with those psychiatrists, so that's good. And things have been okay with my husband and I, we haven't thought no faith and

206
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.520
Bethany Piche: I

207
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:51.180
Bethany Piche: had kind of an issue with one of the medication, she put me on and she switched one of my medications which I had a very bad adverse reaction to which made me like really shaky. Yeah.

208
00:33:51.660 --> 00:34:14.100
Bethany Piche: And and I actually tried to reach out to bright heart how and get her an urgent message and I never heard back from her, and apparently she never got the message. So hello frustrated with by her right now. And I also found out that I can't do her group the mental health group and my

209
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:27.600
Bethany Piche: Group with Dr. Damon on the same day, and they're both on the same day. So it's a little frustrating because I feel like I need both groups each week. And so now I'm having to kind of alternate

210
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:43.080
Bethany Piche: And I just feel like I'm getting less of what I need doing it that way. But my insurance won't pay for to visit them one day, basically. So yeah, it's double billing and one day. Yeah, yeah.

211
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:45.210
Bethany Piche: Okay.

212
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:50.400
Shawn Phalen: So what okay so it's the medication. Okay, now

213
00:34:51.720 --> 00:35:01.290
Bethany Piche: Yeah, she's switched to switch the medication and I'm feeling better now. She also put me on a new medication and got rid of another one and

214
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:17.670
Bethany Piche: The new one has to build up in my system, though it hasn't taken any effect yet. Um, but I haven't felt any adverse reactions to it. So I'm pretty sensitive to new medication. So we're she's building me up slowly.

215
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.140
Need depression.

216
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.270
Bethany Piche: No, no, depression, I'm just

217
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:37.560
Bethany Piche: I've just been having a lot of like panic attacks and, you know, waking up in the middle and I nightmares.

218
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:57.450
Bethany Piche: Sometimes the nightmares aren't even specific like last night and I was having a nightmare about giant ants and we've been having them problem in the house. And last night I was having a dream that the ants were so big they were like attacking us and

219
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:04.590
Bethany Piche: I was yelling out in my sleep to my husband about 3am to kill the ants.

220
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:14.490
Bethany Piche: And so he did wake me up and I after that because the dream was so vivid. It took me a while to go back to sleep.

221
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:23.460
Bethany Piche: And I woke up again at 5am and so if I can. That kind of happens to me. It's been happening to me at night where

222
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:39.420
Bethany Piche: I'll go to sleep around 1030 or 11 and then I'll wake up at one or 130 and then again at three and then again at five. So all long I'm getting enough sleep, but I'm not getting those solid, you know, full night of rest.

223
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.280
Bethany Piche: And

224
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:53.760
Bethany Piche: So then to switch me back to my medication, I feel a little bit more normal able, I was able to do like the laundry and get caught up on things help my daughter with her school

225
00:36:54.330 --> 00:37:02.790
Bethany Piche: And I felt a lot more normal like last week I felt like a zombie. I guess is the best way to put it. I couldn't function.

226
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:12.180
Bethany Piche: And so, yeah, it was really, really, really hard and then to not hear back when I was struggling so much was hard and

227
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:26.550
Bethany Piche: Yeah, when I talked to Mary about it. I was crying. I was just like, it was so awful and you know it's trying to get ahold of somebody. And I don't know what you guys have going on in the front office right now, but that was, you know, really difficult. So

228
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.980
Shawn Phalen: For us to marry about that so she can pass that along to

229
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:41.460
Bethany Piche: Yeah, she felt bad she and she said that. Also, when I was signing in for her mental health group. They didn't have the meeting ID.

230
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:53.100
Bethany Piche: So all of the people in the group. I think there was two or three or three other people. None of us had the meeting ID until 15 minutes after the group was supposed to start. And she was like,

231
00:37:53.670 --> 00:38:06.480
Bethany Piche: You know, I gave them the meeting ID. I don't know why they're so I guess it's not meet you know there's issues going on. So she said that, um, it's not just me. I mean not problems. So right, yeah.

232
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.370
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so what do you do, how do you calm yourself down when you're having a panic attack.

233
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.590
Bethany Piche: So when I'm having a panic attack and

234
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:24.840
Bethany Piche: It's more of a physical reaction.

235
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:29.370
Bethany Piche: And I get like a fever I my heart rate goes really high.

236
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.270
Bethany Piche: And I feel like I can't breathe and

237
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:43.950
Bethany Piche: Sometimes it's the opposite where I get really cold and and I have a little bit of autonomic dysfunction. So my autonomic system kind of

238
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:52.710
Bethany Piche: misfires and anxiety attacks can exacerbate that I guess is the best way to put it, and

239
00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:08.010
Bethany Piche: So I for a long time. I was on a medication called pro plan and all, but it got to the point where my blood pressure was getting so low that I was thinking, yeah. So they were having a hard time trying to find the right dose and

240
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:18.360
Bethany Piche: Yeah it since I've been off that medication. I haven't had that issue when my blood pressure got so low that I felt like I was going to pass out.

241
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.610
Hmm.

242
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:30.750
Shawn Phalen: So is there any when you're feeling like that. Is there anything that you can do that.

243
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.320
The panic attack or

244
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.880
Bethany Piche: I mean, I'm

245
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:49.710
Bethany Piche: A couple things that I do on a regular basis I disease essential oils and I'm really big on the central oils. They're very calming

246
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:57.540
Bethany Piche: And I also into my spirituality. So I do try to make that a priority, but

247
00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:13.170
Bethany Piche: You know, I have three kids so when they're very demanding or there's a lot going on. It's hard to kind of step away and take the time to focus on myself to do that. And so everything happening at once, then I guess that's when things are kind of the worst.

248
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:15.780
Yeah.

249
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.480
Shawn Phalen: Okay. Have you ever considered

250
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.160
Meditation.

251
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.920
Bethany Piche: Yeah, I do meditation I do it at night, which helps me sleep. And that's pretty much

252
00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.990
Bethany Piche: The main time that I don't have the kids.

253
00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:57.690
Bethany Piche: So by three year old, she just she was sleeping in our bed until about four months ago. So it was a really hard time getting her out of her bed. She would sleep. She would fall asleep in her bed, but then always end up back in our bed and so

254
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:16.860
Bethany Piche: Lately I've been spending more time at night during the meditation, which has helped me get to sleep. So I don't lay there awake with anxiety anymore. And now it's more just the waking up and when I have those really vivid dreams. Getting back to sleep.

255
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.650
Bethany Piche: Is a challenge and

256
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:21.450
Bethany Piche: Good.

257
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.250
Have you ever tried yoga.

258
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.750
Bethany Piche: Uh huh. Yeah. And I do some yoga. I used to do it weren't often

259
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:33.390
Bethany Piche: Lately,

260
00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:44.310
Bethany Piche: And this was kind of personal but lately, even just basic intimacy with my husband has been really painful on my joint

261
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:56.310
Bethany Piche: Yeah, so being able to do the yoga, the amount of yoga or the amount of minutes I've used to be able to do. I'm not able to do right now because of the flare and having and

262
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.470
Bethany Piche: So, it

263
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:06.420
Bethany Piche: It's a little discouraging because I used to be able to go to yoga classes, and I used to be very into it and

264
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:12.330
Bethany Piche: You know, felt like I was advancing in it and really progressing in

265
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:26.670
Bethany Piche: My ability and the you know the benefit of it. And now I'm at the point where you know very little stretches are hurting so much there and difficult to do, where those stresses

266
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:35.790
Bethany Piche: The, you know, six months ago weren't difficult to do. So when I'm in the middle of a flare like this with my autoimmune disease. It's discouraging to try and

267
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:42.210
Shawn Phalen: How often, or how long do your flare ups last

268
00:42:43.470 --> 00:43:03.420
Bethany Piche: Um, it depends. This flare up with cars after co bed so it kind of happened directly after I started to feel better from my and and this has definitely been the worst flare that I've had because it also

269
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:11.790
Bethany Piche: I had ulcerative colitis flare up with it, which I've never been officially diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and

270
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:23.850
Bethany Piche: Before this, it was like, well, you're having digestive problems. But, you know, we don't know exactly what's going on and this time it got so bad that I had to go to the ER and

271
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:44.610
Bethany Piche: They did a CAT scan and they could see just inflammation, all in my lower colon. So the this flare has been particularly worse than any of my previous flares, I would say. And the only other time. I had a flare. That was kind of close to this side was went right after my third was born.

272
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:52.830
Bethany Piche: She came seven and a half weeks early. And I had a C section and then I got postpartum preeclampsia.

273
00:43:53.490 --> 00:44:00.150
Bethany Piche: So I was in the hospital for almost two weeks, and she was also in the nick you at the same time.

274
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:16.680
Bethany Piche: So all of the stress and then having the baby and then as soon as I got home, I had this really bad flare, kind of like this, but I didn't have this, you know, ulcerative colitis, along with but ankylosing spondylitis joint pain. So this has been

275
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:28.590
Bethany Piche: More tough on my body for sure when it was also maybe it's from, you know, from yeah having that could possibly be.

276
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.620
Shawn Phalen: Why, it's you know, so

277
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:39.000
Bethany Piche: Yeah, that's what they said is they they're having a lot of patients that are having immune reactions.

278
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:53.970
Bethany Piche: That don't even have autoimmune diseases. So when you have an autoimmune disease, and then you get those fires is like, it can be a lot harder on the autoimmune or your immune system. So yeah, that's kind of when I'm going through

279
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.580
Shawn Phalen: Those your appetites through all of this, are you able to

280
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.870
Eat enough to get energy and nutrition.

281
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.960
Bethany Piche: I feel like I can eat, but I can't make myself food.

282
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:27.450
Bethany Piche: Interesting. Yeah. So, and I never felt that way before because I've always been able to like if I'm hungry, I make myself something, but I'm if my make food. I feel like I no longer have that appetite to eat it. Yeah.

283
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:32.370
Bethany Piche: Unusual the is, if that makes sense.

284
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:36.270
Yeah, no, I do it does. I get it. Yeah.

285
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:55.860
Bethany Piche: Um, any weight loss like are you, how's your weight. I lost about 20 pounds in total over the last three months and I gained back a couple pounds but I'm back to almost my normal way.

286
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:11.910
Bethany Piche: And I've always been between like 125 and 135 when I'm healthy and fit and but I dropped down to 125 losing all my muscle mass was

287
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:20.910
Bethany Piche: You know the worst of it when I just was so sick. And I couldn't go to bed and just getting up to go the bathroom. I was out of breath and exhausted and

288
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:35.460
Bethany Piche: And you know it, that it took a lot out of my body and my body had to fight for weeks to get over that. And then, now I've got these flare ups going on so

289
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:57.090
Bethany Piche: Yeah, I think my body is just, it's fighting really hard and it's exhausted and then I've got all these other things that were already kind of happening and the fam family dynamic that I'm also dealing with. So there's some days where I just feel overwhelmed and

290
00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.990
Shawn Phalen: Have the family dynamics, calm down a little bit.

291
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:08.220
Bethany Piche: I know lost him a little bit and I you know I haven't heard from my sister or my niece.

292
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:14.370
Bethany Piche: Since everything happened. I am just kind of giving them space.

293
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:24.270
Bethany Piche: My husband did book A THREE NIGHT vacation to Tahoe for us and our anniversary is coming up so

294
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:33.300
Bethany Piche: After last year and our separation everything we went through and he surprised me with that. So that kind of cheered me up to something to look

295
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.050
Bethany Piche: Forward to

296
00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:46.710
Bethany Piche: You know I'm three days kind of away from everything. So we'll probably do that sometime in July or anniversaries on the 30th of June. Okay. All right. Nice.

297
00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:48.330
Bethany Piche: Yeah.

298
00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.680
Bethany Piche: gonna break. Yeah, little break.

299
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:59.130
Shawn Phalen: Okay, so it sounds like I'm

300
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:09.930
Shawn Phalen: You know, it sounds like what the family issues, just to kind of do what you just do what you're doing, you know,

301
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.700
You know limit you limit the amount of stress that

302
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:16.800
You're having to do

303
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.330
Bethany Piche: Yeah.

304
00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:30.930
Bethany Piche: My daughter. Luckily, is out of school on the fifth of June. So the homeschooling wall. I'll get a break from that. And that's been a lot. She's already

305
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:48.720
Bethany Piche: She had a speech delay so she has an IIT, and she requires a lot more attention to do her homework and do her schoolwork, and she requires basically needs sitting there the entire time in order to make sure she's doing it, or she gets off task.

306
00:48:50.220 --> 00:49:03.900
Bethany Piche: Or she gets frustrated because she doesn't know how to do what she's doing. And so that that's been hard and my husband has been busy with, you know, whatever he's doing so it's all fallen on me.

307
00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:19.830
Bethany Piche: And then the toddler's I feel like at times. I'm with Lily and Lily has to do you know either her online class or she has to do this project, and it has to get done and we have to stay on schedule of what the teacher gave us

308
00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.360
Bethany Piche: And they're just kind of

309
00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:32.400
Bethany Piche: Running all around and you know they're kind of missing out on learning in their own way too because I'm so focused on Lily.

310
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:34.020
Bethany Piche: But I'm

311
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.320
Bethany Piche: Can't do it all. Yeah, exactly.

312
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.350
Shawn Phalen: You know, it's like you just do what you can to

313
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:43.140
Bethany Piche: Yeah, at least they have each other.

314
00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:48.030
Shawn Phalen: Just let him go.

315
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.150
Shawn Phalen: It's

316
00:49:54.270 --> 00:50:01.080
Shawn Phalen: Yeah and this you know cuz you guys should be opening up pretty soon to rate what's happening. Are you gonna

317
00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:12.900
Bethany Piche: Yeah, they're talking about June 16th right now but um we we've had an unusual sudden spiking cases so

318
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:22.230
Bethany Piche: I don't know exactly what's going to happen. I know what they're saying that the mandatory math, like we can't go into anywhere without a mosque right now where we live.

319
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:30.810
Bethany Piche: And that's going to stay as it is for a while, all the beaches all the parts, everything's going to stay closed for a little while longer to

320
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.810
Bethany Piche: And the only thing they opened up with golf.

321
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:37.980
Bethany Piche: So, yeah.

322
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:41.160

327
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:06.840
Bethany Piche: See it you know yeah I did feel like last week when I was the the meds were switched. And I was just

328
00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:18.150
Bethany Piche: not feeling well. The whole week like my husband really did show compassion and he you know stepped up as much as he could even with everything he has on his plate and

329
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:30.060
Bethany Piche: Yeah, and meant a lot to me that he was able to do that for me because he could see that I was not well and he felt for me. So yeah, so that was good.

330
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.540
Shawn Phalen: And remind me. Is he working from home.

331
00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.730

343
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.450
Shawn Phalen: You know, just utilizing all that stuff and

344
00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.980
You know, your body will just work through this flare up you know there's nothing

345
00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.270
Bethany Piche: Yeah. Now, unfortunately.

346
00:52:49.470 --> 00:53:02.040
Bethany Piche: Yeah, they're probably going to put me back on the immune suppressants but they just want to give my body a little bit more time to recover because you know i just i just got over that.

347
00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:14.550
Bethany Piche: I mean I feel like I still even have shortness of breath lasting and it's been, you know, two and a half months it yeah so

348
00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:30.360
Bethany Piche: They're probably going to do that here in the next few months. Once at once. Everything calmed down a little bit, but they put me on other medications that hopefully will start to take effect. So I had appointments

349
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:47.550
Bethany Piche: An appointment yesterday and appointment on Friday to with both my GI and rheumatologists so I feel like you know every I'm getting all the the help that I need set up and it's just going to take some time for everything to get better.

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.470
Alright.

351
00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.780
