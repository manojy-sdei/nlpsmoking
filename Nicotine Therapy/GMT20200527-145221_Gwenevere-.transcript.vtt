00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.550
Erica Valdez: This I haven't done anything because I can't get ahold of

28
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.290
Erica Valdez: When I was like I don't have that problem. Thank God I try to keep my appointment so to to not have that problem. So,

29
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, no it's it's it's it's unique to everybody's particular so you don't have a

30
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.470
Erica Valdez: Half. Yeah.

31
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: It's very unique to each person.

32
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.200
Gwenevere Abriel: And and so it will be okay. It's just, I was in an airplane unexpectedly on Monday.

Erica Valdez: I do have an iPhone.

42
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe that's why

43
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:41.910
Erica Valdez: Yeah, maybe when i mean i think i phones are pretty common these days. You know what my husband just left to work and for some reason his phone keeps blowing up. Let me see who it is. Sorry.

44
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.860
Erica Valdez: Of course,

45
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.150
Erica Valdez: I don't even know who it is. They called my phone three times.

47
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.850

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, so I'm out here. So it's just going to change a little bit. There may not be as much like I do these courtesy texts, the night

49
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.850
Before

50
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just happened to be dropping someone off in the airport yesterday and I pulled over and I opened up my agenda and I real quick, as best I could.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.230
Gwenevere Abriel: People while I actually had

53
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:29.010
Erica Valdez: Okay, yeah. I mean, if people don't understand. I mean, they just they're on a different level. You know, they mean I just, I try to understand, everybody.

54
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:43.260
Erica Valdez: Accidents happen things happen. You know, we don't plan for what's going to happen today or tomorrow, just like I said, when they call me and I do they have Maria yesterday and they called me today. I'm like, What the heck you know so stuff happens fast. I totally understand.

55
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so right now I'm opening up a note, I'm having a

56
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.300
Erica Valdez: Hard

57
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.310
Gwenevere Abriel: time doing it.

58
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.880
Gwenevere Abriel: I just don't think this is the right one. I'm going to get out of here.

59
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.480
Erica Valdez: I decreased Monday.

60
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Really

61
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.940
Erica Valdez: I am I still I I feel it already like

62
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I

63
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:22.380
Erica Valdez: Feel like a little shaky, I feel like. And it was just, it's not a lot. So I was taking one in one half. Now I'm taking one and

64
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:38.670
Erica Valdez: I cut the half down and then I cut just a little tiny piece off but God that little piece, you can feel a difference. I'm like, oh my god, I might just irritable, I might. I don't know if it's because everything that's going on are what it is. But yes, my I feel it in my body.

65
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Interesting. So sometimes it's what you just said. Like, it happens to line up with

66
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.350
Gwenevere Abriel: A stressful period in our life. Other

67
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Actually cutting more than we think we are, you might be taking off more

68
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we really only want people pulling

69
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Back either a milligram or half a milligram

70
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: I hope you're not accidentally taking off more than that.

71
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.170
Erica Valdez: You know what I might have took off a milligram. I don't know if Dr wanting me to take off.

72
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.580
Erica Valdez: Let me

73
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do a little research here and try and see what that is. Because you really shouldn't feel much at all.

74
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:24.330
Erica Valdez: If I fail it, I might. I had a hard time sleeping. I had, like, I feel constantly like I just want to throw up. It's

75
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.560
Gwenevere Abriel: something's off.

76
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.750
Erica Valdez: I feel it. I think something because normally you're at like 12 right

77
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.270
Erica Valdez: Yes, uh huh, uh huh.

78
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:46.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Well yeah right there you ideally, this is how it would present, you might say to me, I feel a little sweaty like a level three. A 10 is a full kick

79
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.460
Erica Valdez: All right, Bill.

80
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, something's off. I think maybe too much is coming off. We're gonna

81
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.280
Erica Valdez: I just but. And you know what, I didn't take the commodity.

82
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.580
Erica Valdez: Because I am so I don't want to take something and then be like oh shoot my body now needs that

83
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean. So, okay, can let me tell you about. Let me tell you about quantity. So there are certain substances.

84
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.260
Erica Valdez: Okay.

85
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.670
Erica Valdez: Okay.

86
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So you don't even have to worry if let's say you were prescribed

87
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.120
Hold on.

88
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: If you were on like 1100 milligrams

89
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Of having to tie tracked you down off of that, but you're not on that.

90
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Wanted. He is literally it's a blood pressure medication.

91
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.340
Erica Valdez: Okay.

92
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:48.000
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's, it's the side effect of that blood pressure, pressure medication. It's the this sort of off label benefit of it.

93
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.560
Gwenevere Abriel: is so awesome.

94
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: That helps with what you're describing that the cold sweats.

95
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: And it also people take it right before they go to bed, and it makes them tired and then they sleep.

96
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.200
Erica Valdez: Um,

97
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:01.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Why were you

98
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:12.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Doing it the way you're doing it, that's fine. But here's what I see people do, because they don't want the fatigue in the middle of the day, what they do is they take a half a mil half of the tablet.

99
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.960
Gwenevere Abriel: To address the the cold sweats.

100
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:24.420
Gwenevere Abriel: When they read, they take one of the tablets, and then they benefit from it. The drowsiness, then they go to sleep and then

101
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: They don't have to stop. So I'm really. I mean, I can't believe that. I just feel so lucky to even know that it exists to help people through this and not don't get a chemical dependence on it.

102
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:48.720
Erica Valdez: Okay, so then I'm gonna try that. And then let's see how it goes from there until because what I had Dr. Do was I had him bridge me for one week to see how I felt on the medication.

103
00:08:48.990 --> 00:09:02.070
Erica Valdez: But I might dang from Monday till now. I'm like, Oh, I just, I feel it, you know, especially in the night, I might. I do like I want to throw up I so hot. I feel cold. I don't know if I want to get in the shower. I don't know if I want to get them to think it's like it's

104
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.730
Erica Valdez: I think it's

105
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Really like the Clonidine, I mean,

106
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: My I've been here almost three years and this is what they say. You got to see it. You might get a group of just a bunch of new people.

107
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:19.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you don't have. I don't have a nice mix of people that are down 2.25 milligrams boo boo.

108
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not. Yeah, so I don't have a kind of the balance in there. I like to have this nice sort of

109
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Recipe for for so that perfect cake group where there's lots of different ingredients to it where we're all at different levels.

110
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:45.000
Gwenevere Abriel: In in the taper process and you can hear other people say, Oh yeah, this is what I went through. Oh yes, because I think y'all are all right kind of early, early phase.

111
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, but I have clients that are at point two five.

112
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.030
Erica Valdez: Wow, that's where I'm going to get watch

113
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.530

116
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, you know, it takes a lot longer to taper down takes a lot

117
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:28.380
Erica Valdez: Like I get sometimes sick with just the piece that I take on my God, I feel like I'm just so tired and drained and I'm like, well, my body's needing it because I'm going to either get sick. I'm gonna throw up all day. I'm going to feel fatigue, you know, so it's. Yeah, it's crazy.

118
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:29.910

132
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Something I heard I had been doing the zoom meetings with sort of friends and family and some of them are doctors and and they had said.

133
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Gwenevere Abriel: That it's it's requiring an order to get this such basically a sneeze like this junk. And I thought, Good grief. So you're telling me all the food of him, wiping down from Costco all of this stuff. The little bit on my shoes I make sure every takes shoes. I said, all of this that I'm doing.

134
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.540
Gwenevere Abriel: It's, I kind of unnecessary and so they read about people on airplanes and. And I said, well,

135
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:43.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to go for it. So I got on an airplane. I've all the people do on an airplane. I am not the one to have done it but I

136
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.050
Erica Valdez: I do everything going on you.

137
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: I why

138
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I did it.

139
00:12:48.990 --> 00:13:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: I wore masks and people I was with for mass I wiped down all the seats everything I had hand wipes with me I wiped everything down. And then they would sit. I say paws up they have gloves paws up

140
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:08.820
Gwenevere Abriel: I wipe everything down for them and then okay then take the gloves off and you gotta clean surface, but if I'm right.

141
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:18.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, maybe I'm going to end up being sick. I don't know. But it sounds like the viral load. How much of that virus, you need in order to get it seems like

142
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: It gives me the sense of safety that it's okay to go out into the world.

143
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.940
Erica Valdez: So,

144
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:24.780
Erica Valdez: The rice.

145
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Milk it through as I really have messed up. If that's not the case.

146
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But I got for my family.

147
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:42.150
Erica Valdez: Okay, you did it very properly gloves. You've been wiping everything down your, your mask, you know, as long as you do that, and you're not fully face to face in contact with people you should be okay.

148
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I think so.

149
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.950
Erica Valdez: Is there you know I have them throughout my whole so

150
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:58.230
Gwenevere Abriel: It's been so much more fun. I have gone out and driven around and shopping and I actually let my kids out and it's been so much more fun. We feel like people again.

151
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.040
Erica Valdez: A little bit. A little bit of a stress reliever. Correct.

152
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, goodness.

153
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:03.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Update.

154
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:09.450
Erica Valdez: Most reliever. My husband while we bought our house. I told you in November. November, so

155
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:26.190
Erica Valdez: My husband built a fence was built our fans higher in the back. And we've been doing stuff to our house and he finally put up the pool so the kids are all Yay, we can swim. Now they've been home to because my daughter was born 23 weeks and weigh two pounds. She was to say she's her less

156
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:36.840
Erica Valdez: Capable to handle any cold, so I'm like, nope, you're staying home you're staying home and she's all mad at me. But 13 I don't care because it's yeah it's scary.

157
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, because the kids not going to take the precautions that an adult will, they're just, you know, they might forget so way.

158
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.140
Erica Valdez: They just do touch everything

159
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I touch base on a on a couple of your goals, just write a little something. See how you're doing.

160
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so first one is

161
00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Followed by heart health physicians medication prescription dose for for 30 days. So we were originating with 12. That's what I wanted to do. Let me just go see what your dose is over here.

162
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: What are your last trip was

163
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Medication

164
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:29.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Was a one in three eight. So it's 11 milligrams one and 3838. So here's an 8138

165
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.560
Erica Valdez: Can you please my, my group.

166
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:44.580
Erica Valdez: Thank you.

167
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.660
Okay.

168
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:52.320
Gwenevere Abriel: So I think I've got an idea. Let me just see if we're doing this right. I'm going to draw a picture.

169
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.640
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if

170
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.310
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm getting right

171
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.120
Gwenevere Abriel: You're strapped

172
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.220
Erica Valdez: Yes, yes.

173
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:30.840
Erica Valdez: Like it's weird. I've even like lost a little bit of like my appetite. Like, I don't want to eat like before I'd be able to eat a yogurt in the morning, and now I'm like I don't even want to eat until like later.

174
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.660
Gwenevere Abriel: I think I might be

175
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.770
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know that you can see anything. I don't think

176
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:38.730
Erica Valdez: You can see

177
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:59.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so if this is an eight milligram strip obviously right down the middle, it would be four and four and then if you cut these right further cut that one and cut when it's 2468. And so what Dr. Solomon saying is you take you ingest 246

178
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:11.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Mm hmm lattice, just a little strip and you put that in a contact lens case and you tuck it away. Is that what you're doing. You're taking watch you take a whole one and then you go to your second strip and you

179
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: You only take this piece, this basically you just love this one off and put that in the context lens.

180
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:24.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you only describe how do I say not taking I just say it again, not taking this trip.

181
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.220
Erica Valdez: You know, like

182
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.320
Erica Valdez: A little bit more than what you have on that paper.

183
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so that's why you're having the symptoms, I bet. So really it's so let's say you have your strength.

184
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: This is I'm only right now. I'm only referring to your second one. Okay.

185
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:41.610
Erica Valdez: So you

186
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:46.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Take it, you'll cut it down the middle, then you cut each of each of those half in half.

187
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.550
Erica Valdez: Uh huh.

188
00:17:47.790 --> 00:18:00.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And you take 123 you take the larger portion and you take the just a tiny little bit this one. This is the one you talk in in your storage.

189
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:11.250
Gwenevere Abriel: This yes do you stick on your tongue, the larger of it one so favor, do me a favor. Do me a favor, just them will all the way through it color in the part

190
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That you actually take

191
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:24.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Coloring the rectangle. So I'm really positive that you're getting exactly what you need to not have these withdrawal symptoms color and what you're actually ingesting under your tongue.

192
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.340
Erica Valdez: Let me see if I can turn the camera.

193
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.200
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not great when you had it before.

194
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.300
Gwenevere Abriel: No all my. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

195
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:39.210
Erica Valdez: So there is, there would be 1234

196
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're ingesting

197
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me start over.

198
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.660
Erica Valdez: Eric. I'm just taking this piece.

199
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in withdrawal because you're doing it the opposite.

200
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.480
Erica Valdez: So then I have to take this whole thing.

201
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.190
Gwenevere Abriel: So let me do it again. You ready

202
00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:04.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah well using your visual and I'm going to go check with with another doctor real quick to make sure I'm telling you the right information that because it says three eighths. I think you're supposed to be taking on your picture.

203
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:16.110
Gwenevere Abriel: 1234 and that colored in peace, you take that tiny piece. Don't take it a big exhale or or blow off the table and you put it in a contact lens.

204
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.650
Gwenevere Abriel: So you can kind of see that

205
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:26.850
Erica Valdez: So I take more of the one that I've been taking and then I put that extra piece in the contact lens.

206
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Yet the tiny piece you're storing away. You're doing the opposite. It just looks like you just deprive yourself of a massive dose.

207
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: You just pride yourself Erica have let me tell you you if you only took this and you were supposed to take six

208
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:50.940
Gwenevere Abriel: six milligrams. Wait a minute. Oh, now I'm confused. Hold on a second. I'm gonna go get myself straight. You're supposed to be.

209
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.130
Erica Valdez: One in one half, okay.

210
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me go find out.

211
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.080
Okay.

212
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.130
Erica Valdez: Oh,

213
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:24.900
Erica Valdez: Now,

214
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.860
Erica Valdez: Yeah, but he but she bites so

215
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I think I miss I miss informed you so we're going to do this again.

216
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:47.190
Erica Valdez: So Mike, I have. I'm going to show you what exactly. I've been taking because I just got it out of my I want because I'm so sad. And I don't want to be taking it wrong, or I don't want to be taking two left. So I'm going to show you

217
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.540
Erica Valdez: Exactly how it's been okay

218
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:00.480
Gwenevere Abriel: But does it look like this, though, because it's you take a whole strip. Here it is.

219
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:01.080
Erica Valdez: Uh huh.

220
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And then here's your second one you divided into eight pieces.

221
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, and then you only take these three

222
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:18.240
Erica Valdez: No, no, no, no. So I been fucking myself, excuse my language. Okay, that's what it is. So I'm and I

223
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Forget the other one or

224
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Two years old one.

225
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.980
Erica Valdez: And here's the half one that I would take

226
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.390
Erica Valdez: I been cutting it down right there.

227
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.380
Erica Valdez: So, okay, just

228
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Making enough

229
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.960
Erica Valdez: Okay, so do I take this much instead of this much, or do I take

230
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:41.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Huh.

231
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:43.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I

232
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Think i think i think i'm getting it 123

233
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:52.350
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. So, okay, I'm sorry, I can't quite tell, but this is going to help Erica, forget that. I'm here for you had

234
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Go get it. Yes, you're going to draw, then you're going to get it.

235
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:56.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Tomorrow, right.

236
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:09.180
Erica Valdez: Away because they have any kids, but they will my box, box, sorry I have to come in and get my lock box and see what the heck is going on and

237
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:13.560
Erica Valdez: Okay.

238
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.210
Erica Valdez: So,

239
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: So just put a nice will get the one so we got the, the one eight

240
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:19.710
Milligrams

241
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.610
Erica Valdez: Watch her quality TV.

242
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.070
Erica Valdez: Okay, so I have a piece of paper.

243
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we've got the one. So draw your one rectangle that's good to go. But right eight milligrams, because it'll change once you eventually get to four. And of course, things will change. But for now, that that's a single eight milligrams

244
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:53.520
Gwenevere Abriel: That one. We're not divided then. So here's how we start just draw cut this one in half just draw that first line right down the middle of the second rectangle

245
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.360
Gwenevere Abriel: And then each of those haves in half.

246
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:59.310
Erica Valdez: Okay.

247
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.680
Erica Valdez: So I should have four

248
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: And now, each one in half and then you'll have eight rectangles. So do them have again.

249
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Should have a total of eight at that point.

250
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.520
Erica Valdez: Yes.

251
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.300
Gwenevere Abriel: Got it. Now colleran wait. Here we go. You see where I call it in three

252
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:22.980
Erica Valdez: Uh huh.

253
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:29.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Those three, that's three eight right now. That makes sense. I mean, I'm not a big fan of math, but that does make sense.

254
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.060
Erica Valdez: It's 380 yes yes yes so

255
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.040
Erica Valdez: The three and leave that little tiny piece.

256
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: We leave this

257
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You leave. Yes. You take the gray. The gray. See the grey.

258
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.240
Erica Valdez: Yes, I'm not taking yet I messed myself up. Oh my god.

259
00:24:48.780 --> 00:25:05.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't know how much more I can't tell by visually, we're looking at, at what you have right there. But I'd like to get your blood level up today so that you're back to 11 and I don't know how to do it because I don't know what what you did. If you need to go.

260
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.900
Erica Valdez: I took one and

261
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:14.700
Gwenevere Abriel: 180 so just take two eight right now.

262
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.240
Erica Valdez: Because I cook. I just need to take two more of those little tiny piece.

263
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.520
Erica Valdez: Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

264
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:21.840
Erica Valdez: Too much

265
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just want to eat dining

266
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:26.430
Erica Valdez: At it real quick.

267
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:27.420
Good.

268
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.760
Erica Valdez: Okay, let's see how this goes.

269
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, so I'm glad we took the time to do this. Erica. It's we can't skip over this part. This is literally probably why you're here right you're here so that you don't have to go through this misery.

270
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You can address whatever's going on in your life and not have to go through this, this really uncomfortable withdrawal.

271
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Because yeah, wow.

272
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.880
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, that I was noticing you just seem to in distress for what Eric

273
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:43.260
Erica Valdez: I'm like, What the heck is going on. And that's exactly what it was. I wasn't taking the right amount of the dosage so cool. I'm glad I got on. And I'm glad I didn't miss and I'm glad we were able to connect cuz I

274
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Know Me too. Okay, so that's the key with this communication don't minimize what you're going through, because then all here and then the doc will hear and will be because it's subtle stuff. It's like, well, yeah, we, we expect a little bit

275
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Here and there, but not like what I was hearing from you so

276
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:15.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah and if you are willing, I have a feeling you're about to feel pretty good because with the quantity and because now we've bypassed sort of the fear thought of. I don't want to have another chemical dependence. You won't, not with quantity

277
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's just, it's just a heart medication. So some medications develop what's called a tolerance and

278
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:35.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you need more and more of something, and that that's not with Clonidine is the same way you don't, same way every single time you use toggle know it works the same way. Think of it like like a Tylenol.

279
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.360
Erica Valdez: Okay, yeah.

280
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't feel tolerance to it or

281
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:49.380
Erica Valdez: What about met for me. And I know that I like a lot of people mentioned metformin like those tools are the pills. Do you think those would work.

282
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:50.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Um,

283
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know anything about it or

284
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:59.820
Erica Valdez: I'm sorry not metformin metformin was something else, or I took for polycystic I'm, I'm a mom, I'm

285
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:08.670
Erica Valdez: Promoting not only God. I mean, every type of medication, but

286
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Look at it. Yeah, take

287
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.380
Gwenevere Abriel: melatonin. Melatonin

288
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so melatonin people enjoy some people benefit from it, others don't. If you happen to benefit by falling asleep. That would be great.

289
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:32.490
Gwenevere Abriel: It's as far as I know, again, I don't want to act outside my lane. I'm not a doctor, but I've not heard that. What have you been taking it and for how many months or years

290
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:41.130
Erica Valdez: No, no, no, no, I don't take melatonin I, my God. Kids mom actually gave that to me because my daughter was having a hard time falling asleep.

291
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:48.000
Erica Valdez: And I tried it on her and it takes like seven literally seven minutes. She's

292
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.010
Erica Valdez: So I'm like that would kind of do the same, but

293
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.520
Okay.

294
00:28:54.870 --> 00:29:03.210
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's a couple of things caveats. I'm not giving medical advice and that's sort of over the counter stuff melatonin. It's a naturally occurring.

295
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:11.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing in your body. Anyway, you're already making melatonin. So it is a naturally occurring thing. If your question is am I going to get my daughter chemically dependent. No.

296
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:17.730
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't, it's not a you for it doesn't create euphoria doesn't create chemical dependence, you're not going to then need it. No.

297
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:25.740
Gwenevere Abriel: And but but I will say what I've heard. Let's say it starts working with her really well for a few months, and it stops working.

298
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:41.790
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a possibility. She needs to continue, I would talk to your physician about it and you can talk to Dr. Solomon and say, Hey, I'm experimenting with this. Hey, it's working, it's working now. It's not he may give you other ideas of what to do, but it might work for you to do.

299
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.320
Erica Valdez: Okay, yeah.

300
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.590
Okay.

301
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:44.820
Erica Valdez: All

302
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. It's a naturally occurring thing in our bodies.

303
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:59.610
Erica Valdez: Cool. Yeah, I'm gonna try both. I mean, I'm going to try the kolata Dean first cuz I I honestly think maybe I just wasn't taking the right and that's why I am hot and I've been not

304
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.430
Erica Valdez: I just haven't been filling the 100

305
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:10.980
Erica Valdez: I think was because I was taking less than what I was supposed to. So the colored part I was taking just this little not colored part

306
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:22.860
Erica Valdez: I was taking two less of it, I messed myself up so yeah hopefully with this taking this little bit by by this nice to go a little bit better, you know,

307
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So again, this part here.

308
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.280
Gwenevere Abriel: This is what you take

309
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.360
Erica Valdez: Yeah, the three colors.

310
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. Yeah. Good, good.

311
00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:44.640
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let's let's shift gears over to a couple of goals. I want to check in on them. Okay, I know you have a lot on your plate. You're ready to focus on your son today.

312
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:52.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And I have a feeling you're going to feel better over the coming weeks. But, but when the doc asked you about tapering, I would say.

313
00:30:52.320 --> 00:31:06.180
Gwenevere Abriel: No, I had, I kind of got off. I think I was under by accident. I want to feel good for another week or two. So when he asked or you or I asked her something, um, you may. It's your choice, how fast you want to taper but

314
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: You may I want you guys to succeed. Remember how. Oh, this was okay. Oh, I'm wanting to do it again and you haven't quite gotten that experience yet and I really want that for you.

315
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.000
Erica Valdez: Okay.

316
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so push back at us.

317
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:21.780
Yeah.

318
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:28.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. So here we go. I want to check on a couple things I want to see. Okay, so be outside more talking with people.

319
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:37.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me see. I want to go once, twice a week to work or that's a goal is kind of to go to work in six, eight months. That's

320
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:50.160
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not something really pressing on you right now, but kind of identify challenges and variants currently to communication and having consistent engagement with people. How do you feel like you're doing around people these days. Aside from this recent irritability from the medication.

321
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:57.810
Erica Valdez: I actually been doing pretty good. I'm like I said, I've been making mass for the central workers and

322
00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:05.070
Erica Valdez: My husband wears his to work and then people ask him, and then they asked. He calls me and he's like, people want to order mask or

323
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:14.340
Erica Valdez: You know, so I finally got clientele. And then he works. So I have to meet them and I've been okay meeting them sometimes little bit like

324
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:22.050
Erica Valdez: butterflies in my stomach where I'm like, I don't want to go, but I'm like hey, I have to go. I don't know them. They need these mask. You know what I mean. I might

325
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:33.690
Erica Valdez: They're ordering them for a reason. Obviously, they have to. So then I get out there and I pushed myself and I go out there and I talked to them, but it's it's been okay it's been getting them a little bit better.

326
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:40.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, Erica, you know I you present confident

327
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Did you know that

328
00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:44.520
Erica Valdez: Yeah.

329
00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah you present confident, tell me what it is about your gut.

330
00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: It's those butterflies happened. What is it about meeting people you don't know maybe is it that

331
00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.700
Erica Valdez: No, it's just

332
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:11.940
Erica Valdez: I guess I've learned not to through my anxiety and depression and me being on my pills and stuff. I think I just learned not to like people are be around them, or just feel like

333
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:19.680
Erica Valdez: You know, I'm like, what in the heck are those people staring at our you know pictures are for free if you need one like you, they just

334
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:27.360
Erica Valdez: I don't know. I get very, very irritable with people. So I'm trying. I've been trying. Like I said, I go out there. I've been selling the mass

335
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:32.250
Erica Valdez: Yesterday, I had to wait in a parking lot for like 15 minutes because this lady didn't answer her phone.

336
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:50.190
Erica Valdez: I feel bad. She was at work, you know, but I'm like, Come on, lady, like I have things today. So, but I sat there, I just did my breathing, like you said, and I sat there and then I'll say, Oh, look. Here she comes. So it just, it takes the breathing and stuff to have to be out there you know

337
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's, let's spend just a couple more minutes on this. Let's not move off at this I think this is important, what you just said.

338
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:12.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If we slow down a little bit. That's kind of what therapy does is it takes just a simple little conversation like what you just did. And it's, it takes one piece of it and really looks at it that that you just said about

339
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Take a picture last longer.

340
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, that one. You said it differently, but I like how you said it. They're free or something, right.

341
00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:26.370
Yeah.

342
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.780
Gwenevere Abriel: So tell me about when people see you

343
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:37.500
Gwenevere Abriel: How does it feel when your eyes are on you like what goes on for you when people are looking at you.

344
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:45.840
Erica Valdez: I don't know because they just stare. I'm like, what in the heck are you staring at like

345
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.900
Erica Valdez: I don't know if they're staring at the tattoos. I don't know what the heck. There's dirty now, but I'm like, if you

346
00:34:52.230 --> 00:35:01.350
Erica Valdez: Want to stare at least see Hi, you know, like, and you can feel when they're staring at you like, I could be cashing out and they're just staring. So I look back, and I'm like,

347
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:16.230
Erica Valdez: How can I help you, you know, so I don't know it's just I hate for people. I think it's because my mom always taught us not to stare. I've taught my kids not to stare. I'm like that shoots through don't stare at people.

348
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:25.140
Erica Valdez: So I think maybe I think it's rude. So don't stare, you know, but I don't know. This makes me very, like, what are you looking at

349
00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that or is that mad makes me

350
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.710
Erica Valdez: Kind of yes and no. Because some people do it too much, you know,

351
00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like

352
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:37.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Makes me a little mad.

353
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.570
Erica Valdez: Yeah, okay.

354
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:48.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I got a picture of it now. Just curious. Just imagine for a moment.

355
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.180
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you think they're thinking

356
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.970
Erica Valdez: Who knows what people are asking, give me days.

357
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.010
Erica Valdez: I don't know. I have no idea what they're thinking.

358
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.560
Erica Valdez: Sometimes I think people are staring at my tattoos. Sometimes I think people are

359
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.610
Erica Valdez: Staring but

360
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.890
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what their eyes so

361
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:22.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Where do I don't know. What do you think they're thinking after they get the data through their eyes they see you with the tattoos. What do they do with the data from their eyes. They see tattooing.

362
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.240
Erica Valdez: Or men or something.

363
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:24.720
Like

364
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:27.930
Gwenevere Abriel: That

365
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:44.400
Erica Valdez: Or three times. So if I gym and quarantine and everything happens three times, me and my husband have went to Walmart and we both have tattoos and I'm cashing out at a $200 tab $300 tab sometimes

366
00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:56.040
Erica Valdez: You stop us out the door like we walk in and they're staring at us and we go do what we have to do and I'm cashing out and then all of a sudden at the door, their security and

367
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:11.760
Erica Valdez: Loss Prevention. I'm like, what the hell they're all asking us for our receipts, which I give it to them because I don't steal I have money to buy whatever I need and after they do that. I'm like, You know what, for stereotyping and judging and like, that's how I feel stereotype me

368
00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:12.900
Erica Valdez: Your ideas.

369
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:22.080
Erica Valdez: Stereotype so then I might you know what f you guys I turn my basket around and I go and make them refund it because I might. I'll take my business somewhere else for that.

370
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:39.720
Erica Valdez: To be treated like that. You know what I mean. I'm like, there's no way that I need to steal a $3 or $2 or anything from you people. I'm like, I work for what I what I have in my home. You know, I'm very proud for what we have. So yeah stereotype is what it is. Here we go. Found it. Yeah.

371
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:58.860
Gwenevere Abriel: That makes a lot more sense or can now going out into the community, thinking, I'm going to have to be stereotyped and judged being seen as a criminal and not only just seeing if he one thing if they left it alone. But then all of this people security coming around. It's like, no.

372
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Bears in oh and berra Singh beyond and for us.

373
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.500
Erica Valdez: It.

374
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.420
Erica Valdez: It's the most impressed by

375
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Her on

376
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.360
Erica Valdez: And then like

377
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:22.200
Erica Valdez: About it is one of the securities that stopped us is one of my really good. Well, she didn't stop us. She stood behind all of them. And she was like, after we met. She's like you guys looked at the wrong people.

378
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:23.820
Erica Valdez: Yes.

379
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.340
Gwenevere Abriel: You messed with the wrong lady.

380
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:37.140
Erica Valdez: Okay. Oh my god. Like I even like wanted to hit her like it was so bad, like I wanted to hit the lady with my basket because she kept pulling it from me, like if I was going to walk.

381
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:43.470
Erica Valdez: In there. Yeah, I was so upset. I hate Walmart. I can't wait for everything to open up and everything, settle down and

382
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:55.470
Erica Valdez: Finally, be able to go elsewhere. I've been shopping at Albertsons are Smith, because I might. I will not go to Walmart. I just, I hate it. I like I don't like to feel that energy. Yeah. It's horrible.

383
00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:58.590
Erica Valdez: So it's

384
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.700
Erica Valdez: Like, that's what I feel it is mainly with a lot of people

385
00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:16.890
Gwenevere Abriel: So there's there's some really kind of interesting things that you and I could do not only here in therapy, but also in group because as you can tell. I don't know who all is in your group, but most of my clients have Inc. Yeah.

386
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:26.280
Erica Valdez: No, no. Well, I'm some of them have been dem time in prison, you know, Sean just got out, he said, like I listened to some of them, one of the girl said she just got out like

387
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:38.160
Erica Valdez: I understand, you know, there is some of those people that got out of prison but I'm not that one. You know, maybe I like I love my it's therapeutic work there periodically. So I'm just like, all right, I don't

388
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:47.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Wait let's stay there. Stay there. Thank you for sharing these stories with me. It's really helping me get to know you. So just for a moment. What if it was a Sean

389
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:59.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he still deserve. Watch. Just imagine play it out. Just imagine Sean's about spend and he does, he pays for us $200 shopping cart and goes to the front.

390
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Does he deserve to have security come check. No, he doesn't. He doesn't have anything to do it does nothing to do with it, does it. No, no, no, no, no.

391
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And he

392
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:26.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in her yard. What he shared that he has, has that history. He doesn't deserve that if he sees you know if I, you know, had been taking stuff and clearly of stuffing in a jacket or something. Okay. And, well then you gotta go check me out.

393
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.120
Yeah.

394
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:34.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't deserve it. He doesn't deserve it. That is a reflection of Walmart.

395
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a reflection of ignorant people and bias.

396
00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:52.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And it makes me sad to think that that they won that you are inconvenienced by having to return your stuff.

397
00:40:52.440 --> 00:41:04.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Everything I makes me sad that you have to waste all that time in that store and then return, I get yet how you did it. That makes sense that, you know, like, through you, you don't get my money.

398
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:20.970
Erica Valdez: Ever even comes with my Costco membership because they're men Walmart and Costco Walmart and Sam's are together. So as soon as I found oh I canceled my sounds card. I was like, I'm not taking my business to you guys know more. It's yeah I

399
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:23.820
I get my

400
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:31.860
Erica Valdez: Number and I complain I Mike, I want to make a report, because this is not only one time it's happened, you know,

401
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:41.400
Erica Valdez: I might have family that are addicted to drugs that will come and steal from you guys, but I don't even have them come and do that for me, you know, they mean so I might

402
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:48.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Did advocate you you went through due process and you met you made a complaint to

403
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.290
Erica Valdez: Oh, yeah.

404
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:49.890
Erica Valdez: Yeah.

405
00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:56.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, good, good, good, good. And you know what we, it's kind of like every vote counts. You know, like you're representing

406
00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:08.070
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the neat thing about a democracy is we get we matter, but we can say, I'm not going to spend my money here. My money is power. If I stop spending my money here, it represents my vote doesn't it.

407
00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:09.570
Erica Valdez: Yep, it sure does.

408
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.900
Erica Valdez: Our vote represents their paycheck their income their money that's coming in.

409
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:27.210
Erica Valdez: Has a lot to effect with them. I mean, and then if I was to say hey you know if they're going to treat you like shit when at Walmart, you're gonna be like, Oh, do I really want to go there. You know I told my mom. And she's like,

410
00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.800
Erica Valdez: Oh, yeah. And she's like, I'm in there every day.

411
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:33.630
Erica Valdez: She does.

412
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:50.070
Erica Valdez: I may know my mom just as soon as she walks in. Hi. Boy, you know, my mom's my mom's dresses like you. She's real high class. She my mom would wear high heels every day if she could you not me.

413
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:50.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

414
00:42:51.390 --> 00:43:03.330
Erica Valdez: Her hair and she comes it all cute. She's, she's a pretty lady she you guys resemble each other. She just doesn't have long hair, like you, she has eyes. She's like complex. Yeah, so it's funny.

415
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.950
Gwenevere Abriel: But our treatment.

416
00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:15.390
Gwenevere Abriel: But treatment of people. It doesn't matter whether you've got, you know, what color skin or what what decoration, you have on it, it doesn't matter.

417
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: You're there to buy

418
00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Goods and you have money's just as green as anybody else's and

419
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.020
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it.

420
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:22.830
Erica Valdez: Yeah.

421
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Really proud of you for for speaking up for yourself.

422
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:31.950
Erica Valdez: Oh yeah, I get mad and my husband was me even mad at me. He's on here going to return this I'm I can't

423
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.840
Erica Valdez: Look at the way they just treated us he Amanda cause like a little argument between us, but I was like

424
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:45.360
Erica Valdez: That it was so embarrassing. Like all the thousands of people that walked out with TVs and everything we just had groceries.

425
00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:51.480
Erica Valdez: I think I had like a couple outfits for my newborn baby. I didn't have much but groceries.

426
00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:58.290
Erica Valdez: And people are walking around with TVs, and I'm like, you're not checking my receipts, but you're checking my for groceries. This is ridiculous. So

427
00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:06.120
Erica Valdez: Yeah, he was mad at me, but I was like, well, we'll drive to Albertsons and spend our money there. So when we got to Albertsons we laughed at it. We're like,

428
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:17.550
Erica Valdez: That she was Rhonda them and then we finally got down and we went and got our groceries. But it was so it was. It's embarrassing. That's the most thing about it is it's so embarrassing.

429
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:24.360
Gwenevere Abriel: So stay with that for just a second more. And so just just for a moment.

430
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.050
Gwenevere Abriel: You didn't do anything wrong.

431
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:30.330
Gwenevere Abriel: And

432
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.980
Gwenevere Abriel: The next step after if you choose to do it.

433
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's kind of what this this this stuff can do kind of talking with me is that there are options. Also, not only did you represent yourself with your dollar. You said

434
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:56.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't like how I'm being treated. I will not spend my money here and you made that very clear. That's powerful. But there's another piece to it. If you choose to which is

435
00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To turn toward these people that they just represent whatever they're ignorant. Maybe they decided to be that way. Or it represents management style of that store or the whole organization. I have no idea, but there they are.

436
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:16.350
Gwenevere Abriel: And being able to not go to anger. But instead, you know that thing I talk a lot about

437
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:27.180
Gwenevere Abriel: You all can I just see your puppy. A little bit more. I just, it's so precious. I can hardly stand it. Are you kidding me with that face.

438
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:41.460
Erica Valdez: She's our last one we have left, and she's just so needy right now. She doesn't want to be alone. She doesn't want to be in her case she just wants to be roaming around

439
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Doesn't that just bring a smile to your face. Oh.

440
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:55.050
Erica Valdez: Actually, I didn't want to let none of them go but i think i don't know i have to let her go. Because if not, I'm going to end up keeping her cuz she's like

441
00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.280
Erica Valdez: When you feel anxiety or whatever, you can just pick her up.

442
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.870
Erica Valdez: And smell puppy breath and you're like oh so much better.

443
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.420
Gwenevere Abriel: I call them, I call them hug nuggets.

444
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.890
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah yeah

445
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:11.220
Erica Valdez: Yeah, she's cute. Oh.

446
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Gosh, I can't stand it.

447
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Crushes

448
00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:17.460
So you're about

449
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.560
Gwenevere Abriel: To talk to you, just with a couple minutes that we have left.

450
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.160
Yeah.

451
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:35.370
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a weird thing like it is. It makes sense, yes. Embarrassed yes to angry. You got those, but you didn't do anything wrong.

452
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: So the it was a bit more like this. It looks more like it was humiliated. As in, it was public behavior. You weren't embarrassed of something you did. You were out from outside, people humiliated.

453
00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Most people don't make those distinctions. You didn't trip in the store and then people happen to see you. And that would be a little embarrassing. You see, you feel the difference or

454
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:10.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Other people

455
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Humiliated you

456
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:17.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, that stings like

457
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Few others human public humiliation feeling less than in public is next level unacceptable. I, I really want you to see that you didn't make a mistake in anything wrong. So watch if you go with my theory around that it was that they were humility was coming from outside of you.

458
00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:41.280
Gwenevere Abriel: About your business.

459
00:47:42.720 --> 00:48:01.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside came right on it and people get check receipts, I noticed at Walmart, but it was that security thing that really like what, so that's the part where I want to talk to you about if you use this this little mindset of choosing curiosity over being right.

460
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a real distinct thing that we try on we literally turn it on and we go, Wait a minute. Did I do anything wrong. Oh, wait. No, I didn't. These people watch

461
00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: These people around me boy, they really suspect me of something they think I've done something wrong. Let me

462
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:28.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch. If I'm not worried about being right or wrong. I already know. I didn't do anything wrong. So I don't have to sit with it and justify it. I don't have to be ending. I don't have to be righteous, I can just

463
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:37.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I already know. I was just there to shop. I have my receipt. So I'm going to watch instead of choosing to be right, which gets me kind of angry to, you know, have to prove my point. I'm going to do this instead.

464
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:46.590
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to try to understand what is it about my cart. So listen to my tongue. Watch what happens when I'm choosing curiosity over being right.

465
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Hmm.

466
00:48:49.680 --> 00:49:06.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, did you see something while I was shopping or is it my ink or like, what is it that's kind of drawing you guys around what's making you kind of check check on me versus maybe some other customers. Was there some, something that caught your eye.

467
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:08.160
Erica Valdez: So we

468
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:15.600
Erica Valdez: Them up and she said that she seen something else in my basket and I have scan it

469
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:23.790
Erica Valdez: So if I had something else in my basket, people always have stuck in their basket and they either put it down next to the counter. If they don't want it.

470
00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:34.680
Erica Valdez: Or they put it somewhere. Next to them if they don't want it. They're not going to walk and put it away. You know, so that's what she tried to say that she's seen other stuff in my basket, but

471
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:39.840
Erica Valdez: We didn't pay for it, but there was never nothing in my basket, because we put it down. We didn't want

472
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.630
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Yeah, we

473
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:51.240
Erica Valdez: Asked her, and that's what she said. But it. I think it was just all because she was judgmental. She thought she had somebody. It was just

474
00:49:51.480 --> 00:50:00.480
Erica Valdez: For humiliation and the crazy thing about it is when I called corporate they told me that they weren't even supposed to be checking the seats because of everything that's going on.

475
00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:05.190
Erica Valdez: They did work and this is at the time, we didn't. We have to wear masks. We didn't have to wear them.

476
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:20.730
Erica Valdez: And so we were face to face. You know, so they were mad about that. Yeah, it was just a whole thing, but it was the humiliation. It was the the just being embarrassed. Part I. She didn't she thought she had someone you know

477
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.130
Gwenevere Abriel: That hold that for a second.

478
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where if you want relief from it. Some people can do this and it's hard to remember in the moment, but if you can pull it off. And I'm not saying you can do it right away, but in a month, you know, if you practice this, this thing where you recognize

479
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:52.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This is another one. Is this a me problem are you problem these little phrases. They get handy in moments of stress like this where you go, oh, this woman is just trying

480
00:50:52.890 --> 00:51:05.880
Gwenevere Abriel: To do a job. She's trying to catch a customer having stolen, it's probably like she gets her kicks from it or maybe she gets accolade or she gets money. I don't know, but she wants to catch someone in the act.

481
00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:16.530
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's her job. It has nothing. She's going to be like that to the next hundred customers, nothing to do with Erica, and I know that doesn't make any sense. But

482
00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: She's going to continue being ignorant. She's going to continue to make assumptions or maybe she genuinely may have seen something

483
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So the tricky bit is distinguishing how you feel, which is humiliated and embarrassed from

484
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:50.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Her perspective, she may have been actually trying to do her job and she didn't do it well it's unfortunate because she just damaged her own company because now she lost customer to to two locations. She, she didn't do it well.

485
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: But that's a deficit in her

486
00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not a deficit in you.

487
00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:11.910
Gwenevere Abriel: So it's like, Hmm, I wonder, you know, the, the thought process is, I wonder, I wonder what you saw. I wonder if there was a camera. They didn't see me. Put it down. That's interesting. I guess maybe this place needs a few more cameras. You see it like

488
00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.530
Erica Valdez: Our whoever was following us me to be her

489
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:24.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Their problem to solve. It has nothing to do with you when we have this. This is the reason why I'm bothering to say it.

490
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: When we have the mindset that I'm kind of throwing out she was curiosity overbreeding right. Is that a knee problem or you probably I've got another new with me. You're going to be ignorant and stupid and selfish and whatever.

491
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:38.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Nothing I can do about it today when we have that mindset when we use those little Montrose

492
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.140
Erica Valdez: We don't worry

493
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: We just go dumb is going to be done. It's done today is done tomorrow. Again, none of doing me or

494
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.210
Gwenevere Abriel: calms us

495
00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:51.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Down, because we've got enough. There's no threat response from it.

496
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:57.780
Erica Valdez: Yes. Maybe hold her, please. I don't want to hear her crying. I have five minutes left.

497
00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:58.710
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

498
00:52:58.980 --> 00:52:59.490
Erica Valdez: Well, sir,

499
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm gonna let you go because I know you've got things to do and we're pretty much at the top of the hour. Anyway, I just want to review, can you meet on

500
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Can we need June 10

501
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.770
Gwenevere Abriel: At nine

502
00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:11.610
Sure.

503
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:13.950
Gwenevere Abriel: That that is

504
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:23.520
Gwenevere Abriel: June 10 9am now just to remember. I, I may get lucky and be able to reach you on cell, but don't don't expect a reminder

505
00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:24.810
Erica Valdez: Okay.

506
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.700
Erica Valdez: Yeah, I read, I wrote it down.

507
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:27.960
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right.

508
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, listen, it was applause luck with your son.

509
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:37.440
Erica Valdez: Thank you so much, you have a good one. I hope, everything's okay and stays okay while you're in here, the time being in New Mexico.

510
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:39.030
Erica Valdez: Have a good one. Bye.
