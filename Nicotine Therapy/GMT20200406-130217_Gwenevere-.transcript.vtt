Nadine Quintana: Because I don't have my other case that I hadn't. It's like

12
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.180
Nadine Quintana: A little bit.

13

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.400
Yeah.

21
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, we'll just take it easy. Then I'm kind of feeling the same way.

22
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.660
Gwenevere Abriel: It happens. Is there anything that

23
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.770
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, why is asleep was so for

24
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.920
Nadine Quintana: I think it's because I don't have my man.

25
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.470
Nadine Quintana: I've been having a little trouble with the pharmacy every week because they've been reading out of my events or I have to

26
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.440
Nadine Quintana: I I've been having to wait for them to do, but

27
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me make a little note here. So when, when did you last take the buprenorphine.

28
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.260
Nadine Quintana: Or yesterday, but it was just one

29
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't, I wouldn't know how to go back and forth. So, just tell me what that means. I just wanna

30
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.740
Nadine Quintana: I just, sorry, sorry, sorry. Um,

31
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:17.490
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I just have one left 1,000,001 two milligrams ships. That's what I have left for two days because I would have ran out yesterday, but being that the pharmacy.

32
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.850
Nadine Quintana: They haven't been giving it to me, but I'm supposed to get it because they run out of the they've been burning out every week.

33
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.110
Man.

34
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.800
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm writing this down. If that's so, we have yesterday I took two milligrams, is that correct

35
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay. And today, you've taken one

36
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.530
Nadine Quintana: Week. Sorry, I'm so sorry. Good. I'm all out of there.

37
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Yesterday I took one strip which is four milligrams, is that correct

38
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.050
Nadine Quintana: No, I took the two

39
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. So you choose a milligram

40
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm only going to speak and milligrams, I can go back and forth. I don't know what you're taking. I can't. I wouldn't know that. So when you just think about how many milligrams. How many milligrams. Did you take yesterday.

41
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.640
Nadine Quintana: To two

42
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Milligrams and you've taken none this morning.

43
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: And you have two left.

44
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.000
Nadine Quintana: No only have one

45
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.850
Nadine Quintana: Because I already know.

46
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.010
Gwenevere Abriel: One milligram

47
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.930
Nadine Quintana: One ship there. Sorry. The one ship where the two grams.

48
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And thinking today.

49
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Or milligrams

50
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so, and you're you're doing it and you just explained why you attributed to

51
00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:03.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Pharmacy low on supply. Okay. Have you called around two other pharmacies to see where else she could go

52
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.840
Nadine Quintana: Well, the, the only

53
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.980
Nadine Quintana: pharmacies that are left are just Walgreens and Walmart and they

54
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.680
Nadine Quintana: Been giving me a lot of trouble. So I just, that's why I felt this pharmacy that I have

55
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:40.350
Nadine Quintana: And I don't know if it's because of everything that's going on there because I usually don't usually pretty good at giving me my meds. It's just that lately like these last it's happened like every three weeks the past three weeks in

56
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.510
Nadine Quintana: That they've been are

57
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.700
Nadine Quintana: Not giving me their will not. Not that they're doing that they're out

58
00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:03.090
Nadine Quintana: There completely out because you like even if they have one or two, or they have like a couple they'll give me just like even a partial and they have been having any at all.

59
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: So I asked you if you are looking into a backup plan and it doesn't sound like you're looking into a backup plan.

60
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.730
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, because there's not

61
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:24.030
Nadine Quintana: Any pharmacy has done here. There's just Walmart Walgreens, and the one I thought on RD. And then another one. But that when I been to that one, too.

62
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.290
Nadine Quintana: So you don't have that too many options down here.

63
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.680
Gwenevere Abriel: You just listed a few of them. You just listed a few

64
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:47.700
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, I've been through all of them, all of them. And I've had really really bad, bad experiences with them. That's how come I I finally found this one that I'm at now and they're usually really really good. It's just simple

65
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are

66
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Those are people is that right

67
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You're talking about. I had a bad experience with people.

68
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, okay.

69
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.680
Nadine Quintana: I mean, it is not going to change they still work there. It's

70
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: We don't, we don't know that to be an absolute

71
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:15.630
Nadine Quintana: Walmart will give me the generic ones. They say that my insurance doesn't cover for the name brand.

72
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:23.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so that's not people that is generic versus name Brown, that's not an issue that's, that's something else.

73
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And you might also think. So right now what we're doing is I'm trying to, to bring up the fact that what once was inconvenient might seem a whole lot more convenient if it meant zero buprenorphine versus

74
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Generic

75
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.910
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

76
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.500
Nadine Quintana: Right, I'm gonna waste.

77
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.000
Nadine Quintana: My whole

78
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.040
Well, no, it's not.

79
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:59.610
Gwenevere Abriel: I will. What did you, how many milligrams. Did you just take us today. I took two two and what are you actually prescribed

80
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.460
Nadine Quintana: For four and a half.

81
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.620
Gwenevere Abriel: So when you say I just wasted, then why wouldn't you just look at yesterday as a waste.

82
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.620
Gwenevere Abriel: It wasn't a way

83
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: You see, you're dropping too fast.

84
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:36.690
Nadine Quintana: But because I'll get stuck with medicine that doesn't help me for days instead of just waiting for a date to get my medicine, I'll waste that whole week of having something that does not help me at all, instead of just waiting just one day or so.

85
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:52.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay. All right. So, um, I'm just going to back away. You've come to this space through many, many Trials and errors in these different pharmacies and different buprenorphine so

86
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Sounds like you have a handle on and you'll take care of it.

87
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let's see we got

88
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.900
Gwenevere Abriel: We do unless time

89
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:20.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright so open to the AM Dr intervention. Okay, talk to you about it. We did some preparation target mapping out. Okay, so we focused on some different targets.

90
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.710
Gwenevere Abriel: To go guns. Okay, talking about your son.

91
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.640
Gwenevere Abriel: angry, sad, your character. Yeah, Europe's

92
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so we did some target mapping. So let's um

93
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:47.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, good. That's nice. Right there at eye level. So let's keep let's continue kind of the road that we were we were taken before

94
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.680
Gwenevere Abriel: This can be adjusted which you had mentioned before was

95
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What's your son's name that threatened to spit on you.

96
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:57.720
Oh,

97
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah so unbiased was gonna threatening to do it and you felt rage and hatred.

98
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:26.400
Gwenevere Abriel: You had written. You told me then that you were up in distress at about a, I think it was 70. I'm not sure if I put that there. From zero to 100 how distressing was that situation.

99
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.950
Nadine Quintana: That one I would say if I

100
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.610
Nadine Quintana: Really just why would say Tyco

101
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:38.790
Nadine Quintana: We could

102
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.710
Nadine Quintana: Add

103
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:50.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay so we are our numbers in between 70 and 80, you know. Okay, so where do you want me to put it

104
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: At ok ok so Andres threatening to do this.

105
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Lot of rage and hatred.

106
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.830
Gwenevere Abriel: My son incident when he was two years ago. I'm not. Is that the same incident or

107
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.950
Nadine Quintana: That one was to like two years ago.

108
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Ok ok I was beyond angry hatred Jim rage. OK.

109
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:27.150
Gwenevere Abriel: So the difficult part has to do with identifying beliefs and this as, you know, takes takes a little bit of talking through because most people don't realize what they believe about themselves at the time. So just

110
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:38.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Just be kind of just just roll with it. Just say whatever comes to mind. I'll see if I can kind of nudge until we get there so Recalling back to that that incident.

111
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:51.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Just kind of share with me some of your thoughts and beliefs, at the time, and we'll see if we can find the one that is a belief about you.

112
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.690
Nadine Quintana: At the time,

113
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.960
Nadine Quintana: Let's see. I fell like

114
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.560
Nadine Quintana: I believe like he

115
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.160
Nadine Quintana: Like he was grateful and

116
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.180
Nadine Quintana: And

117
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:26.670
Nadine Quintana: She was angry and make something. Something was

118
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.250
Nadine Quintana: Going on with care. That's how I felt.

119
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.280
Nadine Quintana: I don't know. I

120
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: He had me breakfast. When you mean something was going on and what do you mean, something's like

121
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:51.150
Nadine Quintana: I don't know if something was bothering him that he was telling me he was taking it out on me.

122
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.640
Nadine Quintana: That's

123
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.240
Nadine Quintana: How I kind of felt like something

124
00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.250
Nadine Quintana: Something was

125
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.700
Nadine Quintana: Like he maybe he was going through something and you just do

126
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.590
Nadine Quintana: He didn't tell me, and he took it out on me.

127
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And what was that

128
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:17.430
Nadine Quintana: I don't know.

129
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.240
Nadine Quintana: Oh, he has never told me so.

130
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.430
Gwenevere Abriel: How did that day go

131
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.060
Nadine Quintana: Um, I can't really remember. I just know there

132
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.440
Nadine Quintana: He started fighting with me. I can't even remember why we started fighting

133
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:46.500
Nadine Quintana: I can't even remember how that Rick, what really happened that day but

134
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:56.520
Nadine Quintana: He started riding with me for something and it just escalated and got worse and worse.

135
00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:08.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And so let's go back to the thought of, he was being ungrateful. That's what he was doing. Those were thoughts.

136
00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And underneath that

137
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.350
Gwenevere Abriel: There's a belief.

138
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.470
Gwenevere Abriel: About yourself while someone is being ungrateful to you.

139
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.470
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that say about who you are.

140
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I am

141
00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: quiet for a while and you're concentrating really hard, but you're not saying anything. So one of the reasons why it can slow down a little bit, is you're deciding what to say. Instead of letting me do that for you.

142
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:20.610
Gwenevere Abriel: Like weeding them out, like, no. Okay, let's try this one, this one, but if you just say, how about this. How about this. How about this, we can get there, but there's things going on in your head that I don't know you might have just passed by three of them.

143
00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

144
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:24.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I am what

145
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:34.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Just share them there's there's no wrong way to do this. There's just, we're going to run across the one that's the most salient, but I can't. I don't know what you're thinking.

146
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's try one.

147
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.070
I know

148
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.000
Nadine Quintana: I can, I can you think of anything.

149
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Picture your son in front of you.

150
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Close your eyes. I'll do with you. I don't know what it looks like. But I can picture anger familiar with the face. I'm familiar with sort of these tense muscles.

151
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:13.080
Gwenevere Abriel: And he, I don't know how he was about to spit on your you perceive that this was obviously the height of an escalating situation between YouTube and you're thinking

152
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.210
Gwenevere Abriel: I think there's something going on with Andres because

153
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:28.110
Gwenevere Abriel: He's appears to be directing something that's going on for him with him. He's directing it to me and he's not telling me.

154
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.150
Gwenevere Abriel: He's about to spit on me and he is not grateful.

155
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.020
Gwenevere Abriel: And what meaning do you make

156
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Of that

157
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.270
Nadine Quintana: Okay.

Gwenevere Abriel: You're close

166
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.330
Gwenevere Abriel: When you are

167
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: So thoughts and beliefs are usually very closely linked. So I want you to sit with

168
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.040
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm thinking right some he is ungrateful. I see his face.

169
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.440
Gwenevere Abriel: You moving back and forth. It looks like it's like okay he's ungrateful.

170
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:40.890
Gwenevere Abriel: It appears that way to you, but then you also have this thought he appears to be taking out something he's going through on me and then over to his ungrateful. It sort of back and forth. Those are

171
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.550
Gwenevere Abriel: So what does what's going on. What does it say about you. What do you believe about yourself in that moment.

172
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.130
Nadine Quintana: There I am.

173
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.080
Nadine Quintana: Was thinking like I try my best.

174
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.290
Nadine Quintana: I feel like kind of giving up sometimes

175
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Right then.

176
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

177
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.060
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to give up.

Nadine Quintana: Go. Okay.

181
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:36.060
Gwenevere Abriel: So these are thoughts. I know most of the time as therapists, we focus on feelings, but that was a five.

182
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.760
Gwenevere Abriel: So now we're going to will stay in there. So I think we're somewhere important just go into that.

183
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: See what's true for you needing you're going to have to grab it, your pay attention to your body. Because when one of these lands. It'll land like yeah, that's it. Okay, see if it's any of these or one of your own.

184
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:03.090
Gwenevere Abriel: I want to, I want to give up. I want to quit. I can't take this

185
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't deserve this.

186
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.390
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm better than this.

187
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: See where I'm going there. So those are see what just try some of those on and find your own

188
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.430
Nadine Quintana: I can probably

189
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.100
Nadine Quintana: I don't deserve this.

190
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:32.550
Gwenevere Abriel: Now I don't deserve this. Let's see if it's connecting so I don't deserve this.

191
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.790
Gwenevere Abriel: He's an ingrate look at him being ungrateful.

192
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.540
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been trying my best. He's behaving in an ungrateful way.

193
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Because that seemed like underlying it all is. I don't deserve this. And then

194
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.940
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe I want to give up on this kid.

195
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Tell me more about I want to give up on him. Tell me more about that.

196
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:13.890
Nadine Quintana: Like I feel like just not even caring what he does what he says what he

197
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.230
Nadine Quintana: Just

198
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.610
Nadine Quintana: Like I feel like not even paying attention.

199
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.820
Nadine Quintana: I just

200
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.700
Nadine Quintana: If he does something. I don't like

201
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.060
Nadine Quintana: Don't even pay it no mind just let him go on with whatever you're doing, and

202
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.580
Nadine Quintana: That's

203
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.400
Gwenevere Abriel: What her when you say doing typically what are a couple things that he's doing.

204
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.230
Nadine Quintana: He gets it. He gets mad at me, or he gets

205
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:59.970
Nadine Quintana: Frustrated with himself for whatever you know he's having a hard time just about even pay it no mind.

206
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.140
Gwenevere Abriel: And just over what what are the things he's frustrated over

207
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:06.180
Nadine Quintana: I

208
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.880
Nadine Quintana: Don't know.

209
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:17.910
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't talk to your family, you know, I don't know if you know that much, don't talk much about your daughter, your kids.

210
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't really know what's going on. And oftentimes people give you stories.

211
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:31.680
Gwenevere Abriel: More times than not, that's the context that their life that that brings the joy, the stress brings it all right to a four.

212
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: So I don't get to hear much about what's going on with him. I wonder why that is.

213
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:39.330
Nadine Quintana: I

214
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.120
Nadine Quintana: Don't know. Like there was two years ago. So it's kind of hard for me to

215
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.680
Nadine Quintana: Really being war.

216
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.460
Nadine Quintana: Was happening around us, or work.

217
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:58.290
Nadine Quintana: Okay, so I'm trying to think. But I just see like

218
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.290
Nadine Quintana: I remembered the anchor.

219
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.620
Nadine Quintana: Anchor remember but I can't remember what

220
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.810
Nadine Quintana: I can

221
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.510
Nadine Quintana: Make a fake a blur.

222
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:16.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Is this over with. And so different. The relationship is now open harmonious playful.

223
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:18.750
Nadine Quintana: Oh, it's better

224
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.220
Nadine Quintana: I mean we we did have an incident.

225
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.190
Nadine Quintana: A while back.

226
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:36.600
Nadine Quintana: And now I'm starting to see things a little different because I think now like back then. I didn't know maybe

227
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:50.610
Nadine Quintana: I'm getting some place here. But I think a lot has to do because his dad's not around because I got into it with him a while back, and this is like recently.

228
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Can you tell me what that means. I'm so sorry. Recently, and while that knowing, hear me.

229
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.280
Nadine Quintana: Sorry, like

230
00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.460
Nadine Quintana: A couple months ago I got it.

231
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:00.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

232
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:01.890
And

233
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:11.280
Nadine Quintana: He wasn't as bad as he was two years ago. But he was still like pretty disrespectful.

234
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:19.500
Nadine Quintana: And I talked to his dad and I told his dad like I can't do this with him. I can't

235
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.890
Nadine Quintana: I can't go through this with him and

236
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:35.490
Nadine Quintana: You need to talk to him. And you know, I don't. I told my husband. Like, I don't care. You know, if it hurts you. I don't care. But you maybe he needs a male

237
00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:56.160
Nadine Quintana: You know you, your dad. His father to tell him you know don't talk to your mom like that. Don't disrespect her like that. Or, you know, just maybe, if he has that male telling him. Maybe he'll let people change and my husband ended up talking to him and

238
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:06.120
Nadine Quintana: I don't know what happened to my son, or what but he ended up being really different.

239
00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.960
Nadine Quintana: I I know my, my, my husband told me that he told him something like

240
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.210
Nadine Quintana: Um,

241
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:22.860
Nadine Quintana: He had told him not to be talking to me like that, not to be disrespecting me like that. And my son said while

242
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.710
Nadine Quintana: I was there for you that I was there for you a mom left do

243
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.310
Nadine Quintana: And my husband said it but

244
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.740
Nadine Quintana: She's my wife.

245
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.160
Nadine Quintana: And I'm going to choose my wife over anybody

246
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:47.340
Nadine Quintana: And my son. God, like, really, are you going to quit talking to me, are you going to stop talking to me, my, my husband said I would never stopped talking to you.

247
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:54.660
Nadine Quintana: But you need to stop disrespecting your mom because there when it comes to your mom. I'm going to choose your mom's side.

248
00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.240
Nadine Quintana: And after that, my son started acting I grill.

249
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:08.070
Nadine Quintana: Really, really good with me. That tells me I love you mom and he hugs me and he

250
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:18.540
Nadine Quintana: You know if my little ones even being a little bit naughty with me. He'll go in the room. Okay, don't be DON'T BE TALKING TO MOM, my daughter. Don't be misbehaving or

251
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.340
Nadine Quintana: You know, so I noticed I go really, really big difference after my husband, talk to him.

252
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:41.670
Nadine Quintana: So that makes me think that maybe that's what was going on with him. Maybe he misses his dad around because he was used to establish being there and then his dad's not

253
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:55.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So you spent some time thinking about maybe what the cause was you've got got a summary about

254
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.330
Nadine Quintana: Yeah.

255
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: The part that I'm curious about has to do with

256
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I can't do this.

257
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:15.540
Gwenevere Abriel: What's the this. See if you can be a little bit more precise. I can't do this with him. I understand all of the other stuff. He said,

258
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.400
Gwenevere Abriel: When I sit in.

259
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:23.910
Gwenevere Abriel: My client. I'm interested in you around this. What's the this

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:41.760
Nadine Quintana: I kind of like Larry said before, like I can't stress myself out with him. I need to focus on me. I need to make sure I'm okay.

263
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.350
Nadine Quintana: I can

264
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:51.780
Nadine Quintana: I can't stress myself out because he wants to be mad at something he wants to be mad at me and mad about and

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: So for some people they say

291
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: This is how I show my son. I love him.

292
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.470
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're sacrificing

293
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Many things to make that possible.

294
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.220
Gwenevere Abriel: Is it anywhere in there that that's a part of it.

295
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.280
Gwenevere Abriel: There's any of that true

296
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.960
Nadine Quintana: I think maybe I could do something else besides writing stuff.

297
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:40.170
Gwenevere Abriel: You're in your relationship with Andres is buying him things such as particular age. Is that a part of how you show him you love him.

298
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes. Okay.

299
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So when he says

300
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.130
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not doing it.

301
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. What does that say

302
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: About you.

303
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:06.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You're doing something with your mail with true or not true. Whoops. Okay.

304
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:10.440
Nadine Quintana: Yes.

305
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.380
Nadine Quintana: Sorry, my daughter. She

306
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.390
Nadine Quintana: Wanted me to call the school for

307
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.050
Nadine Quintana: Me.

308
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:25.530
Nadine Quintana: I'm

309
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:31.800
Nadine Quintana: Trying to be a good mom. I'm not the best mom but they try

310
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.760
Gwenevere Abriel: What does it say about you're trying

311
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.620
Gwenevere Abriel: To Catch a quick first thought.

312
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.150
Okay.

313
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.580
Nadine Quintana: What do I see

314
00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:09.690
Gwenevere Abriel: I you lost it. So that's why you're doing a lot of thinking it would be really, it works. As soon as you have the thought, when you say it, that's, that's when I actually grab something but you run it through a filter.

315
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: I shouldn't say it should say it maybe this isn't right. You're always right. It's whatever it is, it's coming up, just

316
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Say that, that first thing. Those are the ones that are most likely to be right on.

317
00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay to picture you're

318
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.060
Gwenevere Abriel: buying them $140 shoes right

319
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:38.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Etc example, don't get too caught up in that. So I'm buying him nice shoes. I'm working so hard.

320
00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:45.150
Gwenevere Abriel: I want him to be happy. I'm trying my best to be a good mom and he says,

321
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.580
Gwenevere Abriel: You don't care about me.

322
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.080
Gwenevere Abriel: You broke. Shut up, you stupid.

323
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.650
Gwenevere Abriel: snot like you care what I do.

324
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.080
Gwenevere Abriel: What does that say about you.

325
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Meaning you make about you when he does that.

326
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.590
Nadine Quintana: There I am glad that I

327
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:09.570
Nadine Quintana: try my best.

328
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:14.670
Nadine Quintana: And

329
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:22.050
Nadine Quintana: Good I sorry. I was gonna say that he's wrong thing that popped into my mind.

330
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I am good. And he is wrong.

331
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's fundamental terms I am good.

332
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.610
Gwenevere Abriel: He is

333
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:48.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Bad wrong. You're good, he's bad now you're going to stay away from your good. You can't take it. You're good, he's bad no gray. Just go to real sharp

334
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Opposites

335
00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:03.360
Gwenevere Abriel: But you also said earlier that you were thinking not quite so dichotomous Lee, which is black and white.

336
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:22.080
Gwenevere Abriel: Good, bad, right, wrong, up, down, you were actually thinking my son might be going through something that's that thought right there is the stuff in the middle. That's the I'm not good, bad, he's not good, bad, it's not a fixed thing about our characters. It's wonder if he's going through something

337
00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: So, um,

338
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:42.780
Gwenevere Abriel: How did you end up navigating this thing when he said you don't say it was passive aggressive in his communication. Now you don't like you care what I'm doing. How did that end up going to that one escalate, what did you do in your mind with that passive aggressive statement.

339
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:50.070
Nadine Quintana: I just thought I do care what you're doing. I do care about you.

340
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.980
Nadine Quintana: I wouldn't ask if I didn't

341
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.750
Gwenevere Abriel: And were you talking like that. Is that how it went.

342
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:05.370
Nadine Quintana: Well, I had talked to him, I said, I always call and see how you're doing when you're out or I always ask you where you're going.

343
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Just like that.

344
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.940
Nadine Quintana: Yeah, like I tried. I didn't yell at him this time it wasn't

345
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.110
Nadine Quintana: It wasn't like last time when I was yelling back at him.

346
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:17.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

347
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:23.100
Nadine Quintana: I actually try to explain things to him. So even though he was really, really mad.

348
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.370
Gwenevere Abriel: At the end of it. Did he seem happy.

349
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.470
Nadine Quintana: No.

350
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.840
Nadine Quintana: He just seemed like he was getting more more mad.

351
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.290
Nadine Quintana: Is like us getting angrier.

352
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.740
Nadine Quintana: Have nicer and calmer. I was

353
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:56.760
Yeah.

354
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:10.680
Gwenevere Abriel: So this is if I had to guess, it's probably along the lines of what you were suspecting meaning there's something going on with him.

355
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.280
What

356
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Is typically around I'm loved

357
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:28.440
Gwenevere Abriel: If through all of this, he could during that that discussion. Did you say

358
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:39.810
Gwenevere Abriel: Mom, I love you were going through a rough patch i know i i know everything's gonna be okay. I love you, kid. You seem really upset and I'm here. If you ever want to talk about it.

359
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:59.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But the way you're talking is unacceptable. So I'd like you to and then whatever the discipline is that's that's what I wonder, because he's this this type of communication is typically trying to get you to say something.

360
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:06.690
Gwenevere Abriel: It's really a twisted way of doing it. But most of us engage in this kind of behavior at one point or another. We don't just say

361
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.960
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm concerned, you know,

362
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.850
Gwenevere Abriel: That you care about me. He doesn't just say, Hey, Mom.

363
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:15.300
You

364
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:31.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Even though you're the way you show care. You may mean it with big love. It doesn't mean it's received that way. Everyone has their own language and the way he takes it in might be different.

365
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:40.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Right in that moment, if you were angry he might have thought yeah see she cares. It is a bizarre thing what we people do in our head.

366
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:57.810
Gwenevere Abriel: To finally extract the attention and love that we need. We can twisted around. We don't know. We're doing it. But if somebody gets angry and really fights for us. And I see. Okay, look, they feel like, I feel, oh that's they love me, it can get really twisted quickly.

367
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:08.790
Gwenevere Abriel: So you're staying calm may have been received as a message like see she doesn't care, she's she look

368
00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:21.210
Gwenevere Abriel: And I know that I'm by no means am I saying to change a thing about what you're doing. I'm not even nowhere near that just I WASN'T THERE AT NO IDEA. But that's sometimes what's happening for people

369
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:31.050
Gwenevere Abriel: If you care to be as upset as I am, you would mirror me you'd look like me. I'm so underneath it all. I'm guessing he is going through something

370
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.250
Gwenevere Abriel: But it doesn't mean it's a reflection of you being a good parent

371
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:49.230
Gwenevere Abriel: My concern is right in there. It's like, it's this so I'm not going to be able to do the end yard, but

372
00:39:52.980 --> 00:40:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: If you can sit a little bit longer. So instead of, I can't do this. You see, if you say if a person says, I can't do this and you basically are saying I can't talk to you. Go away. It kind of looks like you don't care if you follow kind of maybe i mean i'm trying to

373
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:18.330
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm trying to understand what you're doing to see his perspective, your perspective and see

374
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.660
Gwenevere Abriel: If you want a close connection with him.

375
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.790
Gwenevere Abriel: If we go to that belief. I can't do this.

376
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: His worst nightmare might be happening like my mom's pulling away when I get really scared because the heart behind all that anger and disrespect is a scared kit.

377
00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:56.580
Gwenevere Abriel: And he is no way, can he say it no way he that's like five levels down too far away. He can identify that. So he's going to show angry and he's going to say to you, you don't care you flip that around and it's like this.

378
00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:08.850
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you care, but I don't know what the heck I'm doing I'm out here, and I don't know what he's doing sign with a group of kids that are telling him to go this way. You're saying that way. And his dad like this way and

379
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You're saying this way that all this pressure going this way. I mean, he is if he's a teenager or in his 20s. This is a tough time

380
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Hard, hard, hard

381
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.950
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'd like to shush, and listen to what you're thinking about

382
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.130
Nadine Quintana: I was just thinking

383
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.170
Nadine Quintana: I don't know i i think things are getting

384
00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:44.520
Nadine Quintana: Like I. Well, at first I was thinking I felt bad for him.

385
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.660
Hmm.

386
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.010
Nadine Quintana: Was

387
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.090
Gwenevere Abriel: To see have pressures, as a young, a young man.

388
00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.900
Nadine Quintana: I mean yeah of course he you know

389
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.320
Nadine Quintana: He has he has questions.

390
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.480
Nadine Quintana: But I was just

391
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.990
Nadine Quintana: I don't know. I was just kind of thinking like I just told

392
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.810
Nadine Quintana: You know, our, our

393
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.810
Nadine Quintana: Well, we're starting to to form of whatever

394
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:30.840
Nadine Quintana: keeps going better and it doesn't make a turn for the worse.

395
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:37.260
Nadine Quintana: You know, and maybe next time. If it does, I could handle it a little differently.

396
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:43.050
Gwenevere Abriel: So you did what, and you're going to do what differently.

397
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:51.570
Nadine Quintana: I'm going to before I didn't, I just kind of shoot him away.

398
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:59.070
Nadine Quintana: And this time I could maybe talk to him.

399
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.520
Nadine Quintana: And ask him, you know, like what's going on or

400
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.810
Nadine Quintana: Let him know you know that I'm here for him. Yeah.

401
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:10.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Let it go. Instead of, I can't do this.

402
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Just because someone

403
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:16.500
Gwenevere Abriel: Says something rude.

404
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:26.640
Gwenevere Abriel: My belief about myself doesn't need to change my love for my child doesn't change if we can hold on to ourselves a little longer.

405
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:34.290
Gwenevere Abriel: And say, Yes, I can. I can do this. And this is be there for my son. I'm okay. I'm not just

406
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:41.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Someone's accusations. I don't care if someone calls me all kinds of names. I'm like, well, my name. True. So, you know,

407
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:51.000
Gwenevere Abriel: I then I can hold space for them. And I can say, you know what you don't normally don't normally talk to me like this. I'm suspecting something else is going on. Let me know if you want to

408
00:43:51.420 --> 00:44:01.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Want to talk to me about what's going on, but you're hurting our relationship. By the way, you're talking to me. So maybe let's let's talk in an hour, because there's both

409
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:11.700
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't want you to damage the relationship by it by saying, you know, if you are however spits on you, however bad. It gets you can do both. We can say that that's going to damage us

410
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:21.330
Gwenevere Abriel: But I love you and I want to hear what's going on. Maybe underneath. So maybe we'll take some will take an hour or so and then I'd love to know what's going on because I care.

411
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.500
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, it can be. You see how it's kind of both

412
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: But none of that is possible if your belief about yourself, is I can't do this.

413
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:41.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's why I was merging in there. So for so long. Really trying to see what was going on in there.

414
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:54.210
Gwenevere Abriel: Not only can you do this you have done it beautifully. So you have a long track record of actually hanging in difficult conversations with your kids. You have done it.

415
00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.870
Gwenevere Abriel: And and maybe we will feel stress. It's part of being

416
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:03.330
Nadine Quintana: There.

417
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.530
Gwenevere Abriel: You know what I mean.

418
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:14.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Again, it's a we're constantly running that line self care peace. Oh, this is a tough one. Okay, I'll be into it. I'll

419
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I'll be in I might feel a little disrespected, a little angry myself. I might feel in patient. Okay, I'll do some breathing. I'll do some drawing. I'll do some journaling. I'll come back. It's not just by

420
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:40.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Can have those feelings. We've got to stay in here. That's what it is to be just sort of this human right there in the middle just constantly trying to get back to center back to this peace and calm life life's Messy. Messy. Messy. Messy.

421
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:41.550
Here.

422
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:52.920
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's process a little bit meeting right here at the end just sort of take some quiet time to reflect on what you noticed

423
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:58.350
