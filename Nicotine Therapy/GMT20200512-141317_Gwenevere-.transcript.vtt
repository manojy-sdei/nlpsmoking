Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

31
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.070
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you guys miss out when you have, you know, when you're stuck in the car when you have these these pieces with the kids. We just can't do any of the

32
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:28.830
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, more psychodynamic approaches, but let me just check in with you and see how you're doing. Now, last time we met you had, I think, a tired feeling tired.

33
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.110
Gwenevere Abriel: This month, and for you.

34
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.320
Rochelle Martinez: And it's been a little bit better but um I've just had this real bad they're stupid already picking my book with last

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:57.450
Rochelle Martinez: Couple of days, it's like everything I want my mother so swollen there. I'm like, even read any of it after image after this very within a couple days.

36
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:12.060
Rochelle Martinez: And they usually just come and go, but I had trouble even seen us and I told him I need to just so at and I just been doing the beginning of the week kind of start

37
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah and now in looking at some of the context of what's going on in your life, what, what

38
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.630
Gwenevere Abriel: What has changed even slightly over this last few weeks.

39
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.990
Rochelle Martinez: I can't think of anything that they really even change like

40
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.760
Rochelle Martinez: Nothing at all like them. I'm still going for a walk and doing all my stuff but like

41
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.870
Rochelle Martinez: Mentally, like I haven't had like

42
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.460
Rochelle Martinez: Any changes like

43
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.870
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

44
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:08.940
Gwenevere Abriel: So no additional stressors no additional pressure to do things. No, no additional responsibilities.

45
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:12.390
Rochelle Martinez: No.

46
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And maybe a little bit about talking about the dynamics.

47
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.270
Rochelle Martinez: Between

48
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:27.780
Gwenevere Abriel: You and your daughter may be checking in on that that kind of comes in waves last time there was an experience. It didn't last very long. But there was a sense of, let me see who

49
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Daughter and I had a thing this weekend. She needed the car and client had already left

50
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:45.420
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't know who said, you're just being selfish told daughter. You knew I was going to do this right, I will talk to you when I get home. Have a nice weekend. Oh.

51
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:05.100
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting better at this. Not making assumptions still have trouble asking question expressing what I want to bite my lip and walk away.

52
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so you I've got your name back. I just don't have audio waiting for that to come back online.

53
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.120
Rochelle Martinez: I have the audio on but if I leave the video on that. It's just going to keep doing that.

54
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:36.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, I can hear him so just want to check in on on you know you had said this piece I'm not afraid of confrontation, just some days I don't want confrontation.

55
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:50.880
Gwenevere Abriel: And kind of want to see how communication is going with your daughter. If there's anything that we could do in here that I could be of service, whether it's role play come up with kind of ways to communicate to do anything.

56
00:07:53.610 --> 00:08:01.350
Rochelle Martinez: Well, like she has a she's, she's going through her own little issues right now she's going through a breakup and um

57
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:12.780
Rochelle Martinez: And this guy had been together for almost two years and I don't know what happened. She hasn't said anything again want to thank me. So she's going to break up and

58
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.470
Rochelle Martinez: You could see that, um, it's affecting her

59
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.670
Rochelle Martinez: And she's just been real quiet and they some

60
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.530
Rochelle Martinez: I don't want to

61
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.330
Rochelle Martinez: Say depressed because I'm not in her head. Do you know what I mean, but

62
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.710
Rochelle Martinez: You can tell she's having problems with it and it hasn't affected.

63
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.800
Rochelle Martinez: How we communicate yet.

64
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.750
Rochelle Martinez: But I'm

65
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:50.790
Rochelle Martinez: Hurting and her and I'm my cousin, where else this last weekend on Friday. And they went for a drive and they hit a deer.

66
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.900
Rochelle Martinez: And the friend end of the car got

67
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:05.310
Rochelle Martinez: messed up. It's not too bad. But today, she has to go meet with insurance and taking drop off the car and pick up a rental and

68
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.100
Rochelle Martinez: Stuff like that. Um,

69
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:09.840
Rochelle Martinez: But

70
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:21.000
Rochelle Martinez: Like I try to be try to be there for her. And I talked to her about

71
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.430
Rochelle Martinez: what she's going to do and

72
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.960
Rochelle Martinez: I guess on her own time show feel comfortable talking to me about it. But right now, she's not doing much of anything.

73
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:50.760
Rochelle Martinez: This is going to drive me crazy going in and out of the video of you. Um, but yeah. Other

74
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.530
Rochelle Martinez: Like

75
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.330
Gwenevere Abriel: You

76
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.770
Rochelle Martinez: I don't, I don't

77
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't sound like

78
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.210
Gwenevere Abriel: You're not. You're not saying you have concerns about communication with your daughter.

79
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.610
Rochelle Martinez: No, I don't. I, I feel like to talk about it and it's just

80
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.100
Rochelle Martinez: Like right now, I'm giving her like be good. I'm

81
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.020
Rochelle Martinez: Trying to figure it out. You know what I mean with Tommy invading her private

82
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

83
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:33.390
Gwenevere Abriel: And I had introduced to this book to you. The Four Agreements, did you decide to kind of investigate it further.

84
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:43.230
Rochelle Martinez: I did and I had my mom ordered it she hasn't said if you got it in yet. I had even forgot about it. I'm going to turn all that we get off and

85
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.810
Rochelle Martinez: She's got in it.

86
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.240
Gwenevere Abriel: And no

87
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:10.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Recent triggers. I'm assuming you're not right. Those the progress that you've made over these years continues to be solid, it doesn't come up under stressors that you're you're thinking of using. Is that right,

88
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.710
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, that's for sure. I, I

89
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:21.720
Rochelle Martinez: I think I have like I'm worried because I was even talking to like my mom and them about it this weekend for Mother's Day, um,

90
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:32.190
Rochelle Martinez: I don't know what brought it up, and I, I, we just were like talking about my recovery. You know the mean and I was a good it feels good this time at all, not to

91
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:48.480
Rochelle Martinez: Still be creating those drugs like fun. Recent times that I relapse, or somebody told me like from all those are the times I still wanted the drugs you know me, like the back of my head I was

92
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:58.530
Rochelle Martinez: Trying to figure out a way to still use close to being clean. They'd be like, Oh, well I could get high now and

93
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.290
Rochelle Martinez: By next week, I'll be good. You know what I mean. And like that kind of stuff. Hasn't like crossed my mind or even when thinking about it like them.

94
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.180
Rochelle Martinez: I feel like them over that part because I don't want that high anymore.

95
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:16.980
Rochelle Martinez: So it's a good it's a

96
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:23.340
Rochelle Martinez: It's a different now than it was in the past. I'm not taking the money.

97
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:34.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, that must make you feel or imagined it makes you feel confident like that you'll be able to do this long term, you'll be able to do this life.

98
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:43.260
Gwenevere Abriel: As life happens not having to use that concept of crutch right not having to lean on something else for your life.

99
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.420
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, and not just competent makes me feel like stronger like

100
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.930
Rochelle Martinez: I could say no. Now, and and it's with your guys's help because I've never

101
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.070
Rochelle Martinez: Done recovery and how to program to have my best. You know what I mean, it was always just

102
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.380
Rochelle Martinez: Here, just the box and I'll see you in a month. So like

103
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.940
Rochelle Martinez: I mean I seem like much worse that I have done with you.

104
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:12.750
Rochelle Martinez: But

105
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:22.320
Rochelle Martinez: I see it as a lot of work, because I'm so hard to get to, and even the little bit that I do get through has just helped so much

106
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:34.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it's true. Rochelle I do struggle with wondering whether I've been of service that you've, you've been able to show me through

107
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:54.570
Gwenevere Abriel: The way your relationships with your family has changed with how open and honest, you are with people, the fact that you've gone out and tested. Some of these theories of yours right who went to an a meeting or two. We did some sort of progressive sort of

108
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.210
Gwenevere Abriel: exposure therapy around this notion of your ex coming back into your life.

109
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:13.110
Gwenevere Abriel: You know you've done. You've done some things that I think really evidence that evidence that you have put into place into action. The things that the therapy has to offer.

110
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:23.160
Gwenevere Abriel: And you've tested yourself you know you've had Xanax in the car you've right I'm assuming you've had people offer you a pill. Right.

111
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. And was it hard to say no, it was it like, no way.

112
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:42.930
Rochelle Martinez: I didn't even think twice about it like before they said I would put it in my pocket and save it for a bad day and not now it's like I don't even want that around.

113
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.720
Rochelle Martinez: At all. So my I feel like stronger that way and

114
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:52.710
Rochelle Martinez: Just

115
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.650
Rochelle Martinez: It will say no, I've always struggled seeing know like

116
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.550
Rochelle Martinez: I wasn't confident. I guess with myself.

117
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:01.500
Rochelle Martinez: And I had

118
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:16.290
Rochelle Martinez: Probably I was probably SELF CLEANSING how we say it because I couldn't tell if people know even at the beginning when we first started I can even tell my brother know when it came to the kids there. I mean, I just

119
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:24.810
Rochelle Martinez: I would just, okay, I would just take them bring them bring them bring them. I always had a trouble telling other people know and and

120
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:40.530
Rochelle Martinez: Now, I don't. I say, no, I need even with my mom and the baby like I know she's had a hard week at work, but share. I've had a hard three weeks because I've had the baby all by myself and I just need

121
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:51.360
Rochelle Martinez: A weekend to myself and I just go drop her off. I don't even ask them like scared scared turn mom like, I'm not struggling with that anymore and

122
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.940
Rochelle Martinez: Like I say, just every everything that you guys have

123
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.950
Rochelle Martinez: Said,

124
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:07.890
Rochelle Martinez: I may not have said much but I took it all in. And I'm I've learned and I'm so grateful for this program at all completely

125
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:20.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, it does. It does come as a surprise because because you're sort of a woman. A few words, it's harder for us to measure right it's hard to

126
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Because we were stuck with words. We can't see all the times that you've been able to set boundaries. So it's helpful that you're saying this right now. It really is.

127
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.520
Gwenevere Abriel: And I'm glad I'm really, I'm thrilled.

128
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It what it says to me is, even though I I may not be able to hear you know right away how somebody being impacted over time it can make a difference. So I've just got to kind of hang in there. You know what I mean, I, I've gotta hang in there too.

129
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:55.920
Rochelle Martinez: I think it's this

130
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:06.480
Rochelle Martinez: Is my persona like I've never, I've never. It's not that I don't have somebody to talk to. It's just everybody's always so busy with their own like that.

131
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.470
Rochelle Martinez: I just, I'm just used to not talking about what's going on in my life. You know what I mean, it just

132
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.170
Rochelle Martinez: It just builds up and

133
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:18.810
Rochelle Martinez: That's just

134
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.770
Rochelle Martinez: That's just how I become it's hard for me to open up

135
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.480
Rochelle Martinez: To anybody like relationship wise like

136
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:44.610
Rochelle Martinez: My grandma's probably the only person I could tell anything to and I don't feel judged. I don't bill. My mom to but not as much as my grandma, but like I could literally sit there and talk to my babble about anything. And I'm not good at not

137
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.510
Rochelle Martinez: Show this listen and then she'll put her two cents in at the end. But yeah.

138
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.640
Rochelle Martinez: Crazy.

139
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:05.910
Gwenevere Abriel: It does make me wonder though sometimes when I asked about communication because because you don't provide a lot of what I would call material.

140
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:16.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, you won't come in and say, Oh my gosh, my mom's off the chain or oh my gosh my daughter's you know she's, she's just ridiculous. Like, you don't get it because you don't

141
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:30.690
Gwenevere Abriel: A lot of content. I don't know whether we've missed opportunities for reviewing really helpful communication skills. I have no idea. But if you're saying that like along the way you

142
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:39.570
Gwenevere Abriel: role plays and things that are done and you're absorbing them and maybe along the way you've picked up on some of the little tricks. I don't know.

143
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:52.440
Gwenevere Abriel: How do you think besides right the assertiveness of setting limits and boundaries with your, your know you know only giving what you have to give without any kind of resentment give what you have to give. And that's it.

144
00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Aside from that boundary setting, where are you noticing the way you communicate, maybe with your daughter. For example, how it has changed.

145
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.030
Rochelle Martinez: Ah,

146
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.690
Rochelle Martinez: More that I'm learning how to

147
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.470
Rochelle Martinez: How to

148
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:44.850
Rochelle Martinez: respect her boundaries and because she is. She's going to be 20 this year, and she's not a little girl, the more and I have to

149
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.610
Rochelle Martinez: Learn those boundaries. You know what I mean. And like going like now with this breakup.

150
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.870
Rochelle Martinez: I could be there to listen and to offer advice.

151
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.730
Rochelle Martinez: When she is ready. I'm not pushing her to

152
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:05.880
To

153
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.400
Rochelle Martinez: To talk about it. I don't know how to. I'm not

154
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.950
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's a boundary Rochelle That's

155
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:27.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Letting you know, instead of pressing your agenda and you sort of saying, Well, you look like somebody who needs to talk and then saying. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me.

156
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:36.900
Gwenevere Abriel: You're giving her the space to recognize in herself that she wants to talk it through. And that is a boundary. That's recognizing someone else's

157
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:47.400
Gwenevere Abriel: And and that is generous of you. A lot of parents have a hard time with that they want to rescue fix their children and they don't sort of let their children learn on their own.

158
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:56.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Their own sense of efficacy, agency and you're doing that, you're letting her on her terms come to you when she's ready

159
00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:57.990
Gwenevere Abriel: That's a boundary

160
00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:58.530
Rochelle Martinez: And I'm not

161
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.450
Rochelle Martinez: I'm not telling her like II.

162
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.940
Rochelle Martinez: Ii Ii told me he was a piece of shared or

163
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.840
Rochelle Martinez: All that

164
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.530
Rochelle Martinez: Kind of stuff, you know, I mean, I'm kind of just like respecting her

165
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

166
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.460
Rochelle Martinez: So yeah, but um

167
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.190
Rochelle Martinez: Our, our relationship. It's always been difficult because of them.

168
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:37.530
Rochelle Martinez: I wasn't there when she needed me and that was mostly her teenagers. Do you have a means for sheet from 12 until 1516 years old and I think it was about 15 so during those years we grew a lot of she grew a lot of resentment.

169
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:48.510
Rochelle Martinez: Because she didn't have me to go to during those problems and it was always my grandma, my grandma has always been there for all of us. You know what I mean. So

170
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.670
Rochelle Martinez: She we worked through a lot of it.

171
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.570
Rochelle Martinez: And she sees the change me and

172
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:15.270
Rochelle Martinez: I think she appreciates me a lot more. Now, especially with the baby didn't really mean. Then she did a whole year and a half ago because I not only picking her responsibilities and made their mind, but um

173
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.580
Rochelle Martinez: I've also been there for her, like, emotionally, not just

174
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.200
Rochelle Martinez: For the baby. Do you know what I mean, like, I'm she knows that I'm just a phone call away now.

175
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.030
Gwenevere Abriel: That's very powerful Michelle what you're doing. That's important.

176
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:50.100
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, and they even if she's having a bad night or whatever, she'll pick that 11 1130 mom. What are you doing, and before we didn't have that it was just

177
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.380
Rochelle Martinez: I talked to her when I see her. Do you know what I mean. Oh, yeah.

178
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.270
Gwenevere Abriel: Wow.

179
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:11.040
Gwenevere Abriel: And one of the pieces that we were doing a little bit of work around had to do with the notion of you trusting again in a romantic relationship.

180
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.020
Gwenevere Abriel: I still have it in my mind that it's something that

181
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:26.550
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess I and I could I could really be wrong and I leave a lot of room that I could be wrong, but I just wonder if it's easier for you to stay focused on the baby.

182
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:42.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I just wonder if still in the background sort of maybe even unconscious. If you're saying to yourself. I'm not strong enough. I'm not ready. I can't do it. Like, I wonder if you have thoughts like that in the background of your mind.

183
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:55.230
Rochelle Martinez: In the back of my mind. It's not that I'm not strong enough. I think it's, I'm not ready to quit put it, what is running to the back of my mind, I'm not ready like

184
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:14.430
Rochelle Martinez: Like the ICL like inside like I'm right now I'm building the relationship with my daughter with the baby and Michael, my family back up again. And at this time, I'm not ready for to add another relationship to my life right now and

185
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.440
Rochelle Martinez: I'm

186
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Sorry, so

187
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:40.950
Rochelle Martinez: I think a lot. I think a lot of it is that I I'm satisfied with what's going on right now. Do you know what I mean that I'm not looking for lover relationship like I was before. Like I have all that love here and right now. That's all I need like to fulfill myself and

188
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:46.440
Rochelle Martinez: I know I'm not like lonely or or anything like that like

189
00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.210
Rochelle Martinez: I don't know, it's just like a whole nother feeling

190
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:53.310
Rochelle Martinez: And then

191
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.610
Rochelle Martinez: Just being sobered. You know what I mean. And

192
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:05.880
Rochelle Martinez: And learning how to live life all over again. And it's just like a whole nother homocysteine

193
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.760
Rochelle Martinez: Something that I'm getting used to. And I would just be true and

194
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.270
Rochelle Martinez: I'm not afraid. No, I just don't think I'm ready yet.

195
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: So,

196
00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:29.280
Gwenevere Abriel: We might be saying the same thing. So part of what could be handy is while you have me

197
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:40.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, while you're here in this program that we take advantage of all that we can that we cover as many topics as many domains of life we touch on each of them, whether it was

198
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:54.840
Gwenevere Abriel: Right. At first it was a little bit around vocation and we played around with a degree idea or going back to school or a train. We played without a little bit. We played a little bit with going into a background of trauma history touched on that a little

199
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.460
Gwenevere Abriel: And a little bit about a sort of communication and boundaries.

200
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: If you could say, let's just take that word ready, just so that I have a better understanding of your, your definition of it.

201
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.070
Gwenevere Abriel: What would you look like

202
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:24.090
Gwenevere Abriel: It doesn't matter. The time just a random time five years from now, just random. What would you look like if you were ready.

203
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.490
Gwenevere Abriel: To today.

204
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.990
Rochelle Martinez: What would I look like

205
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:39.120
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't mean eyes. I mean, what would you be doing like define ready. You see what I'm doing, like, how do you

206
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.340
Rochelle Martinez: Define define ready

207
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:53.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Would you be doing, what would you look like. What would be different. What would be there in your life that you would say, oh, I'm ready.

208
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:56.520
Rochelle Martinez: I think

209
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.530
Rochelle Martinez: If I'm

210
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:12.030
Rochelle Martinez: If my sobriety is going great. You know what I mean. And I'm them already are doing half years.

211
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.610
Rochelle Martinez: Five years and

212
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:26.190
Rochelle Martinez: My life is just, I'm sober and I could put into a relationship where I expect to get out of it and

213
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.510
Rochelle Martinez: And being able to put like my whole heart into it and

214
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.630
Rochelle Martinez: I don't know. I don't know.

215
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.010
Gwenevere Abriel: But yes.

216
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yes, but do you see what taking a minute to define

217
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.030
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, I'm not ready.

218
00:27:52.350 --> 00:28:11.490
Gwenevere Abriel: And you're saying, oh, it's not fear. I'm certainly hearing indeed I'm satisfied that and I'm not pushing it. What I'm doing is trying to say. While we're here together the unconscious is a very tricky thing, it will come up with justifications.

219
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:22.380
Gwenevere Abriel: That seems absolutely true, because you are satisfied. You're getting all the love you need right now that's actually true. Right. That's true, yeah.

220
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.570
Gwenevere Abriel: And

221
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.190
Gwenevere Abriel: I am pressing in, to understand what ready would look like.

222
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.460
Rochelle Martinez: And

223
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.040
Gwenevere Abriel: You said clean

224
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:40.560
Gwenevere Abriel: You said great sobriety. Now, I don't know how you measure. Great. I don't know. Cuz, aren't you great right now.

225
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.340
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I'm great. I'm great. Now,

226
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.780
Rochelle Martinez: I guess what I mean by that is, like, I've had

227
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.750
Rochelle Martinez: I've had years of sobriety before

228
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:07.560
Rochelle Martinez: But I've always relapse in between those. You know what I mean. And I guess what I meant by great is me not relaxing and

229
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.440
Rochelle Martinez: Just building on

230
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.240
Rochelle Martinez: On things over. Do you know what I mean, like,

231
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:23.430
Rochelle Martinez: Like I could look five years and be like, Damn, I'm eight and a half years. I haven't gotten used one and

232
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.370
Rochelle Martinez: I'm ready now. Do you notice any night.

233
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me just

234
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Say right there.

235
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:45.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Is what you're saying to me when I want to be. Oh, f f Suboxone for three years when I want to be off Suboxone for five years and then when I say to my say of hey,

236
00:29:46.320 --> 00:30:06.240
Gwenevere Abriel: I am able to be clean and not relapse. Now I can give to another in a romantic relationship. What I expect back I can give my sober living my lifestyle. I have confidence that I will be able to stay clean you see you and I just did. I'm wondering if there's magic.

237
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:06.480
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah.

238
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I wonder if there's magic numbers in your head, and if it has to do with that you're not. Oh, f f the Suboxone right now. I can't quite tell what it is that will constitute great sobriety. If it's a duration or if it's all the way off everything I have no idea.

239
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.500
Rochelle Martinez: I don't know, because I

240
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:49.710
Rochelle Martinez: Is good to get is getting off. I guess what's really in the back of my mind is, yeah, I'm on 1.75 milligrams, or whatever. And that may not seem like a lot, but like

241
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.420
Rochelle Martinez: Pain wise. That's what's keeping me

242
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.030
Rochelle Martinez: Somewhat I'm

243
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:06.000
Rochelle Martinez: Not paying three books I'm able to manage the pain. You know what I mean. So I don't I'm having

244
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.640
Rochelle Martinez: Not second thoughts, but I'm having trouble in my mind.

245
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.580
Rochelle Martinez: thinking, how am I going to manage the pain when I'm completely off because it's already kicking my ass.

246
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:19.320
Rochelle Martinez: And

247
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: Let's stay there for a second. That's a great. That's great. So

248
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.720
Rochelle Martinez: Let me get. Let me get the baby real quick.

249
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.140
Rochelle Martinez: I'm listening.

250
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.300
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm just gonna wait till you go do that. Look online at something

251
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.550
Rochelle Martinez: God please pick up these blueberries digital them or did you

252
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.280
Rochelle Martinez: Come on, help me out here. I don't want her to step on them pick him up.

253
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.790
Rochelle Martinez: I didn't have a clue was please pick it up.

254
00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.290
Rochelle Martinez: Do it. I'm not gonna say it again.

255
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:03.150
Rochelle Martinez: Okay.

256
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: So the thing is that I know you've already tried, you just, just tell me you've tried steroid medication, you've tried hot, cold.

257
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.290
Gwenevere Abriel: Presses tried

258
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:22.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Have you tied. I'm seeing something about the you know that Vegas nerve stimulation. Has that ever been explored.

259
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:32.220
Rochelle Martinez: Like it hasn't and they the only thing that's been like really talked about between a doctor is

260
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:44.190
Rochelle Martinez: Completely getting off the the embroil and switching to a whole new medicine that was discussing on February gave me the confidence to see if

261
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:53.070
Rochelle Martinez: That other one would be if I'd be interested in moving from Ambrose to the other ones to see if I find more results get better results with it.

262
00:32:54.210 --> 00:33:13.470
Rochelle Martinez: Because I'm I shouldn't be getting as much as flare ups as I'm getting I'm getting them like sometimes two, three times a month and they're lasting more than three, four days like this one that I've had now has been since Tuesday of last week and like I've even

263
00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:20.610
Rochelle Martinez: I've added walking every evening for almost the whole hour and a half, and like I

264
00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:32.790
Rochelle Martinez: Doing yoga, not much yoga, but the stretches every morning like just trying trying like to add a physical every

265
00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:36.870
Rochelle Martinez: Day.

266
00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.540
Rochelle Martinez: Even like

267
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:44.790
Rochelle Martinez: Eating

268
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.030
Rochelle Martinez: For breakfast to have a protein shake.

269
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.060
Rochelle Martinez: For lunch. And then I just

270
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:02.370
Rochelle Martinez: Smaller me not because of the IRA, but it changes in

271
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.530
Rochelle Martinez: What I'm doing

272
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Right now I can't hear you. I'm hoping I'll be able to hear you again.

273
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Can I hear you. Let me see if I got audio back

274
00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:51.090
Rochelle Martinez: I said,

275
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.290
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I'm

276
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.370
Like

277
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.770
Rochelle Martinez: Changes like

278
00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.520
Rochelle Martinez: I'm I'm trying everything that I

279
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.930
Rochelle Martinez: Could think of at the time. Yeah, and

280
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:09.960
Rochelle Martinez: Operating new stuff into my life to try to better it and

281
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:22.650
Rochelle Martinez: Hopefully, get this RA, a little bit under control, because it's it's stuck. Having to um be limited. You know what I mean there's with these flare up to say

282
00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:38.010
Rochelle Martinez: I can't do much on my feet like I tried watching last night and I just, I couldn't do it. My, my toes and the bottom of my my joints were just look for and that it was just so painful squawk

283
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:50.610
Rochelle Martinez: dreamy slept, you know, I mean, and it just felt, and I guess in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, What would I do without the Suboxone. Do you know what I mean, like,

284
00:35:51.570 --> 00:36:03.270
Rochelle Martinez: I'm doing Tylenol and doing everything else. Am I really going to need to be on Suboxone long term to deal with the pain like I guess those are the questions that are running through my mind. You know what I mean, they

285
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.100
Rochelle Martinez: Don't know.

286
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:25.800
Gwenevere Abriel: And I think those are very relevant, especially at this phase of your treatment really trying to understand whether you and I think it's going to be a slow learned experience where let's say you and your physician decide, okay, we want to find out how

287
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:43.410
Gwenevere Abriel: How you feel physically how you meet that pain. What beliefs you have if you have catastrophic thinking right if you dip into that, like, Oh, I can feel it this pain is so awful. Or if you're using things like

288
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Radical acceptance that this is you're going to have pain to right to be human is to have pain, but are you adding suffering and again only, you know, Rochelle where that line is

289
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:07.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Of what you do with the thinking part to find out if coming off completely. We might really be able to see if there's any

290
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:22.800
Gwenevere Abriel: What is the call that sort of that closed loop that might be happening where the pain might still be in that that signaling. That's not actually from the toes, for example, that might not be coming from the joint anymore.

291
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.770
Gwenevere Abriel: really being able to distinguish which is just this old on neurological

292
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Closed loop that's happening, what is a an actual right new injury or what you would say as the flare up now again.

293
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:58.140
Gwenevere Abriel: This is very personal. This is you, and your relationship with pain and no one can know that but you and I don't want to minimize how important it is that you be ready that you be interested in finding out. So at this point, let's just take what you have right now.

294
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: The pain.

295
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.570
Rochelle Martinez: I think I need to just, I think I need to switch

296
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:14.700
Rochelle Martinez: My, my groups and go start doing you with us and you and Dr. Bill, because, like, I'm not getting like that kind of

297
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:22.320
Rochelle Martinez: Like even having like those kind of talks or anything like that with Dr. Elements. You know what I mean, like, it's just

298
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:28.800
Rochelle Martinez: I don't feel like not comfortable, but I do not, I don't know, it's

299
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Like

300
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.930
Gwenevere Abriel: Well you know I want you back. I want you back. Do you want to write down the groups again.

301
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, so let me know when you got pin.

302

Rochelle Martinez: To have group tomorrow.

318
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:11.550
Rochelle Martinez: I know I'm supposed to have group tomorrow, but I'm thinking of all just not go to group and then show up on Tuesday at 7am and deal with you and Dr. Brown.

319
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so you have enough medicine to get you to May 19 at least

320
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:24.060
Gwenevere Abriel: That's nice. Okay, I'm just going to write you down in here. And when I see the doc. I'm going to see her today at noon. I'm just going to love.

321
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:37.860
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm going to expect you may 19 7am putting Rochelle down here and I'll mention that to her. Um, is there anything else you um you want me to talk to her about in preparation for that discussion.

322
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.920
Gwenevere Abriel: Or you want to just have it organically happen.

323
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.060
Rochelle Martinez: I'm gonna have to go to

324
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:59.400
Rochelle Martinez: Look online and look at this way and see if I could order a internet block and see what I could do to because I don't know what's going on here. Um, yeah, okay.

325
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:08.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Well, Michelle, you shared a lot today actually did it feel like that. Did it feel like you were kind of chatty Cathy

326
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.250
Rochelle Martinez: Yeah, I did.

327
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:17.040
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Oh, it was nice to hear you actually was nice to hear

328
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:27.750
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, to be let in into your mind and to know how how your thoughts are. Is it feels like a privilege to be let in. Thank you.

329
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.570
Gwenevere Abriel: I think more

330
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: I think more investigation into this concept of I'm not ready to add a relationship. So I would like to set at some point, a goal.

331
00:41:42.120 --> 00:42:01.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Of defining if you're open to it to defining what ready would look like. Specifically, what does putting my whole heart into a relationship look like what does what what I expect to get back into ship. And what does great sobriety look like are you open to that.

332
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:07.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, okay. And like maybe also looking at

333
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:20.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Specifically meeting pain in a pain management goal really we're doing some interventions, specifically the doctor physically with many

334
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:38.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Around meeting the pain. What you do in your mind. What you do physically when you are literally making contact with that pain. And that's kind of that only will we stuff, but I think it might have a positive impact are those things we could work on over the next

335
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:40.770
Rochelle Martinez: Year.

336
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:46.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Or out alright so I wrote down next Tuesday. And then for us.

337
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.360

Gwenevere Abriel: We need June.

340
00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:58.950
Certain you

341
00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.140
Rochelle Martinez: Do we have something that we could do at seven because they're

342
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:08.460
