00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.660

9
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.160

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. So, um,

19
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:35.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me do just a little tech testing. OK. OK. I wanna show this share my screen with you and and watch your eyes. There's a lot of preparation is still need to do, but I just want to see the tech part

20
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.070
Okay, so there's this

21
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.340
Gwenevere Abriel: So what I want to do is I want to watch my balls.

22
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.630
Gwenevere Abriel: Open. Alright.

23
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.600
Gwenevere Abriel: So let's take a look at mine, and I'm going to show you kind of the ideal.

24
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.580
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm looking for

25
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.090
Okay, sorry.

26
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.600
Gwenevere Abriel: That's what I'm looking for is your, your eyes would be moving about, I don't know 15 inches so it

27
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.990
Cynthia We: It varies inches. Yeah, if

28
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Watch my eyes are moving 15 inches right now look at see moving

29
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.450
Cynthia We: Oh, yeah.

30
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.500
Gwenevere Abriel: That's all. Oh, which means I'm

31
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.550
Gwenevere Abriel: There'll be moving. See, my hands are about shoulder width. So put your

32
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Hands up in there about shoulder width.

33
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.920
Cynthia We: Right.

34
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.070
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, yeah. And now that distance is out here. If your arms extended it's out here in front of you right

35
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.500
Gwenevere Abriel: With the laptop.

36
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.090
Gwenevere Abriel: isn't about that with

37
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.440
Gwenevere Abriel: The width of your laptop is about that with

38
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.130
Cynthia We: I'm not sure what you're saying I'm taught you lost me. Okay, so, oh 15 inches.

39
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.560
Gwenevere Abriel: That's okay. Let me start off

40
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.970
Cynthia We: I have no idea. Sorry.

41
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.950
Gwenevere Abriel: You're looking at the screen.

42
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.240
Cynthia We: Correct. No.

43
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Look from the left corner of the screen to the right corner of the screen.

44
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.670
Cynthia We: Oh, OK.

45
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:29.250
Gwenevere Abriel: OK, yeah, that's a nice, that's a nice distance. So, for example, is that straining on the eyes. Does it hurt your eyes. Does it feel like, yeah, so it would be straining if you had to look way over, and that would

46
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.140
Cynthia We: Be maybe I should even be closer

47
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.980
Or

48
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.230
Gwenevere Abriel: So if you were closer, you probably be straining your eyes.

49
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Wasn't forced you to be looking wider and I don't. Yeah.

50
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.730
Cynthia We: I didn't understand that. But I understand now.

51
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.610
Gwenevere Abriel: And I don't want to be uncomfortable and straining but it does have to have the effect of bilateral movement.

52
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.120
Gwenevere Abriel: It's the only thing I've got at this point. I don't have the buzzers, because you're not here with me. I don't have the ear.

53
00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, bilateral sounds because you're not here and I tried to do the audio. It takes it's too clunky too many steps for the client to have to do this is the only thing that I've been able to kind of work out.

54
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: But if it ever comes to the point where you happen to only have your phone. We've been able to make it work by setting up two objects, right next

55
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:29.730
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, outside of the phone. We've been able to make it work, because then you're just looking at these two objects. So we've been able to make it work. Okay, so we're like this. There's no reason why we can't

56
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:38.280
Gwenevere Abriel: As long as you're logging in. We can we can make it happen. Okay, so don't get hung up on the on the laptop. If something catastrophic happens to it.

57
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.540
Cynthia We: Okay, cool.

58
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:52.470
Gwenevere Abriel: Beautiful. So the other thing that I do and in here is I change the speed. So there might be times when I've changed the speed and it's slower or faster, but right now it is set at

59
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:09.600
Gwenevere Abriel: A slow speed. So just check in and just take a look at the light moving left and right. This is just to check and see comfort level. You don't have to look at it in the middle, as long as those eyes land to left and right, and we're good.

60
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that unpleasant.

61
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:20.220
Gwenevere Abriel: No. Okay. Beautiful. And then let's speed it up a little bit. You might also find it at this speed.

62
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.140
Gwenevere Abriel: It is more intense. It's true.

63
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.910
Gwenevere Abriel: But are you able to do

64
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.080
Okay.

65
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Great.

66
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.620
Gwenevere Abriel: We're cooking with gas here site.

67
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Alright, so I did a little tech work there. Let me pull up a note.

68
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.980
Gwenevere Abriel: My ears about today. So I'm gonna look weird.

69
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.030
Huh.

70
00:08:52.710 --> 00:09:07.740
Gwenevere Abriel: What, how are you doing right because we've been meeting with Scott you're going into group you're hearing things, you know, I sent me an email. You've texted me back. I sent you something from right there's been little bits of contact right CONTACT, CONTACT, CONTACT. How are you doing,

71
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.650
Cynthia We: I'm doing okay. Yeah.

72
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.090
Cynthia We: Yeah.

73
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:20.160
Cynthia We: Yeah. Scott night we got our taxes or tax returns. So I feel like I can breathe again.

74
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.270
Cynthia We: And he got that job. I don't know if I told you that

75
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.960
Cynthia We: He had the interview and they hired him on the spot.

76
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.180
Cynthia We: Fantastic orders rate. So, that's awesome. You know, they didn't give them any shit about it.

77
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.900
Cynthia We: It wasn't with Jay Z, though.

78
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.900
Cynthia We: Which is a bar. I mean, Jay Z will be there shooting the movie, but he he's not the one that hired Scott. It was the director

79
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.790
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, and

80
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:59.850
Cynthia We: That doesn't start till March 16 though. So in the meantime, I'll tell you what he Teagan are having a hell of a time getting along.

81
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.650
Cynthia We: Really I've just been like

82
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:19.380
Cynthia We: I've been telling him for years that I think you know that I've really really been struggling with him. Yeah, he, I think he didn't believe me because he didn't see it because he always got the nice treatment.

83
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:20.520
Gwenevere Abriel: You've

84
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:36.660
Cynthia We: Been here long enough, this time that Tegan has grown comfortable with him and i think is acting just like he acts with me and it's shocking to Scott shocking. He's really, he's like really really upset and I'm just like,

85
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.490
Cynthia We: I just

86
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:48.360
Cynthia We: I am just so conflicted. I have no idea what to say. I know that I should be supportive. It's really hard. It's really hard. I feel so it mature like I'm

87
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Like I told you so.

88
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.810
Cynthia We: Oh, totally. And I don't want to be like that, but damn it, I told him I told him.

89
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:03.900
Cynthia We: I just want to be a you know a mature adult though and and be supportive be a

90
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: Good partner. Oh, you can

91
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.690
Cynthia We: You hear

92
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.400
Cynthia We: Things his big feelings about being disrespected

93
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:18.330
Cynthia We: I mean, he really I think he thinks something's happening with like like something serious something

94
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:18.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you

95
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.720
Gwenevere Abriel: What are you talking about tickets been missing some

96
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.170
Cynthia We: School like he missed for bullshit reasons.

97
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.840
Gwenevere Abriel: That something's walk

98
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:38.400
Cynthia We: Three weeks ago he missed because he said he threw up a couple days in a row, but he wasn't he didn't seem sick to me last week you fall and hurt his tail bone. So I missed two days.

99
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:57.600
Cynthia We: This week he missed Wednesday, he called yesterday to me, come get him. And then he missed today because he said he threw up. But we're like he's saying he has an accent at all. And usually you can tell if somebody's sick. He's eating everything in the house. He doesn't accept click

100
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:07.020
Cynthia We: And so, you know, we've asked him about 100 times like it's something going on at school, but it's like a really tiny school, nobody

101
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:26.130
Cynthia We: There's no bullying that allowed. So it's not bad but Scott's thinking like, this is how kids act when they're sexually molested, you know, or something terrible like that like he's totally i'm not sure i and i just I'm baffled. I'm totally baffled.

102
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.490
Gwenevere Abriel: Continuing to monitor

103
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.710
Cynthia We: Yes, that was where we are right now.

104
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:38.730
Gwenevere Abriel: So I'm hearing. There is a acknowledgement in real time. Scott gets to see

105
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: It's not Cindy's fault. It's

106
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:42.660
Cynthia We: Not

107
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:54.240
Gwenevere Abriel: An attic going, there's something going on with Tegan and you know he's been a challenge. It's not just the deficit is with Cindy or something going on with T and N Scott gets to register it firsthand.

108
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.100
Gwenevere Abriel: So that filled out dating for you.

109
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.000
Cynthia We: As it does

110
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Now, okay, that's a mature thing to have acknowledgement. I imagine it was frustrating when that wasn't there.

111
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.700
Cynthia We: Was very frustrated

112
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.120
Gwenevere Abriel: That's that, you know, an emotion.

113
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't mature mature, it's

114
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Whoa, yeah.

115
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.170
Cynthia We: No, it's right. Right.

116
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.400
Cynthia We: Reaction to him. I want my reaction to be

117
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:26.130
Cynthia We: Like you know like a loving partner. I'm sorry that you're having these feelings.

118
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.370
Gwenevere Abriel: That's not it, though.

119
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.790
No.

120
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:36.930
Cynthia We: But that's how like I feel like anything I say comes out fake like that because I'm not really sorry and

121
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.220
Cynthia We: Why, yeah.

122
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.720
Cynthia We: Why even say it then.

123
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, then no

124
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.460
Cynthia We: Why would

125
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.780
Cynthia We: Why would you ever

126
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.330
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

127
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.950
Cynthia We: Throw this not just me.

128
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, how about

129
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:56.010
Gwenevere Abriel: My fault. Right. How about something also true, whatever it is for you, but I'm

130
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:04.290
Gwenevere Abriel: I feel relief. Yes, I built seem known and validated that you're going to the same thing. I am

131
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:14.940
Gwenevere Abriel: There was a disconnect between perceptions and I think you and I are getting closer and closer on the same and I feel relief I feel even

132
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:15.390
Cynthia We: What

133
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.850
Gwenevere Abriel: You did to us, Scott. Because of this, and

134
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:26.010
Gwenevere Abriel: We kind of now we're on the same page in our frustration at least we have that. And so let's get to the solution. What have you tried

135
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: To hide in EC.

136
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:29.400
Gwenevere Abriel: It. Yes.

137
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.010
Cynthia We: Still an eye out. I feel like we can work.

138
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:32.670
Cynthia We: Together and

139
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:44.310
Cynthia We: Solution and and it will be together, it won't be something that Cindy as frustrated about and and something's got doesn't feel like needs to happen so

140
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.910
That's good. Yeah. Okay.

141
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:59.940
Gwenevere Abriel: And let me just take a look down here. Okay, so two Yeah two nine have this target date here um

142
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.570
Cynthia We: say one other thing. Sure.

143
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:12.600
Cynthia We: We think that this is really abnormal this this this behavior from Teagan and level of disrespect and I don't

144
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.630
Cynthia We: I feel like it's very normal for

145
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Me give me what he heard as disrespect. Let me hear it.

146
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh here it

147
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.790
Cynthia We: Just the talking back like what are these me last night that was so

148
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.880
Cynthia We: Frustrating Scott said something about

149
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.000
Cynthia We: You

150
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:40.410
Cynthia We: You ever. Well, it was just arguing and I can't, I can't think of exactly what he said.

151
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:47.100
Cynthia We: It's just talking back it's talking back and it's taken testing his boundaries.

152
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:59.280
Cynthia We: About how far can I push this, how far can I say it. Can I, can I really say what I feel, or are they going to freak out and he's testing with Scott Scott's not used to being tested like that.

153
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.040
Gwenevere Abriel: So what do you think isn't the normal range.

154
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:10.410
Cynthia We: I feel very normal because I feel like he needs to express himself.

155
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.050
Cynthia We: If somebody is

156
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.740
Cynthia We: Trying to control him which is what's what this is about anything. Um,

157
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:26.490
Cynthia We: He pushes back. Of course he does, he's rebel he he rebels, you know, a little bit.

158
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.380
Gwenevere Abriel: What do you mean by Scott

159
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:34.650
Cynthia We: Yeah, so, so they have this thing at their school about homework that they should be responsible for their homework and that

160
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.710
Cynthia We: You shouldn't have your parents talking to you about homework, like you're in seventh grade, you can handle your homework.

161
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.890
Cynthia We: So this whole argument was going on. Last night because I just kind of bad, you know I backed off in sixth grade I

162
00:16:47.550 --> 00:17:00.600
Cynthia We: And and turned out that was not the right thing to do because he didn't turn any homework in sixth grade. However, the seventh grade thing. I think he's actually turning it in Scott keeps asking him so to get your homework done tonight.

163
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:21.270
Cynthia We: You can is like you can't ask me, it's just annoying and um and Scott's like well what just asking the question is annoying. Like, I just want you know I'm just reminding you take is like, I don't need to be reminded, if I am having trouble. I will come to you, but

164
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:33.000
Cynthia We: Well, but I don't need you to always ask me, it's just annoying and Scott just really had a hard time understanding that even asking about it as annoying.

165
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.130
Cynthia We: Is not sure where I stand on it.

166
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.040
Gwenevere Abriel: His teacher you labeled it controlling a second ago.

167
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.320
Cynthia We: Yeah, well, I'm because I feel that taking us perceiving it as controlling

168
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:53.370
Cynthia We: Chicken is feeling like just asking the question, is trying to make sure he's finished his homework, you know, like

169
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.500
Gwenevere Abriel: It's a dad's job.

170
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:01.080
Cynthia We: First of all, yes. That's what we said. Yeah. Um, but I do

171
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:18.540
Cynthia We: I do. I think there's just a disconnect between what the teachers are explained to him and what we are expected to do like of course we can ask, you should be able to ask and not just wait until he is falling behind, before we

172
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:28.020
Cynthia We: Before we do anything. And that's what he's asking us to do. I'll come to you when I have a project or when I when I'm having trouble.

173
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that doesn't work.

174
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.410
Cynthia We: Not that

175
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.530
Gwenevere Abriel: That would be fine if he if he was getting straight A's.

176
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.290
Cynthia We: If you had us, which is

177
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, then what that may be about is Scott, not having a norm.

178
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.640
Cynthia We: Yeah.

179
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:58.830
Gwenevere Abriel: I've been here with this progressive change he would recognize there are times when something's need more of our monitoring. Once we see people have the skills to handle it on their own, we step back

180
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:04.680
Gwenevere Abriel: Right treat this you know 15 year old, the same way I treated my five year old that's not

181
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.820
Cynthia We: Right, right.

182
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:20.460
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, he's just hasn't been there for the progressive the new norm is well he's doing fine. He's demonstrating evidence and grades are good way to measure it, that he is following through. So all Scott is doing is what he thought is the right thing. He

183
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.820
Cynthia We: Said,

184
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.260
He's being supportive

185
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.200
Gwenevere Abriel: This doesn't seem like a real, this seems like an easy thing to clarify and wonder why

186
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.340
Cynthia We: Well, he

187
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:36.600
Cynthia We: Was very, very adamant and very stubborn and believes that his way is the right way.

188
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.730
Cynthia We: And

189
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:50.850
Cynthia We: He has always been like that with me, but I don't think he's always been like that with Scott. I think he's back down with Scott before and he's just

190
00:19:52.830 --> 00:20:04.590
Cynthia We: He had some trouble with Spanish like he wasn't handling is working. And so we found out about that last session and or last quarter and you know it was only three assignments, but he had to stay after and finish them.

191
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:11.640
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you know how to advocate and assist your young child on how to speak. His truth.

192
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.540
Cynthia We: No, I don't. But that would be a great lesson to teach him.

193
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.120
Cynthia We: How to do Cindy, do. Yes, you do.

194
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.730
Cynthia We: I feel like I've fallen apart with to you and I feel like I've got no skills dealer.

195
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:34.770
Gwenevere Abriel: But I've watched you you have all of this information in your head. You do know what to do.

196
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:40.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Because you do it yourself when you do it in a graceful way yourself.

197
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:48.420
Gwenevere Abriel: We empower the people around us to do what works, we give this as an option. This is how I do it. So just slow down a little bit.

198
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:50.610
And go inside.

199
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:58.290
And and check and see. Do I know how to communicate my preference for something

200
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:11.820
Gwenevere Abriel: Outside of me. It's going this way. I know what I prefer I know my skills. I know my capabilities. This person outside doesn't seem to recognize my skills.

201
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:23.730
Gwenevere Abriel: I can explain educate and clarify my preference, based on my known skills and my capabilities. You don't seem to see it. I can clarify it.

202
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Just stay there until you get real clear

203
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.430
Gwenevere Abriel: When you get that clarity, sort of, just imagine that you're Tegan

204
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:59.310
Gwenevere Abriel: And what might you say with the skills that you embody Sunday with the confidence.

205
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: That there's a misunderstanding happening so

206
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.460
Cynthia We: Well, I think you would say, I just really

207
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.620
Cynthia We: Prefer to handle this on my own and

208
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.060
Cynthia We: And by you asking about it. It makes me feel like I'm

209
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.800
Cynthia We: Not trust him. And I just want to be trusted to handle my ship.

210
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:34.710
Cynthia We: Without a ship because

211
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.650
Gwenevere Abriel: That's it mentally right that's fun. Yeah.

212
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.540
Cynthia We: I want you to trust me.

213
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:56.130
Gwenevere Abriel: And that's a piece of evidence. The same way we want to trust this child and I look for grades. We look for attendance and grades in the absence of referrals.

214
00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, I'm gonna trust you.

215
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:20.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Because I'm seeing the grades. I'm going to demonstrate that that trust and you're going to trust me and and and and feel trusted because I'm going to back up and not be checking in on you, but maybe at a frequency of every Sunday night, we will review Pinnacle

216
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.350
Cynthia We: Whatever your equivalent, they do.

217
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:34.740
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, it's not, you know, because my job doesn't change. Just the job is still there. It's still to monitor because you're not. We don't know when it could change it could change.

218
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:41.970
Gwenevere Abriel: Kids are changing, week to week. Now, there's a whole group of new people as new experience happens and priorities change with kids and

219
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:56.220
Gwenevere Abriel: But my job doesn't change. I need to show you that I trust your developing skills and this is how I can do it all check in. Once a week with respect to your space in your confidence. That's beautiful. I want to reinforce that. But my job to keep an eye on it doesn't change, but

220
00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:56.520
Gwenevere Abriel: I think

221
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.240
We can

222
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:09.840
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, modify it as you your skills improve. I don't have to compensate for them. Okay, I don't have to compensate. So I can do that. And then he gets to be like

223
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:19.860
Gwenevere Abriel: Fine, but in addition on Sunday. What I don't want is, I don't want an attitude in your tone and your face.

224
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:37.950
Gwenevere Abriel: And I will be coming. I'll show you respect. I won't be coming at you with show me your work or no. So how would you feel respected in my inquiry into the status. Do you want to pull it up and bring it to me how the grade report. Do you want me to open it up and call you over.

225
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:45.810
Gwenevere Abriel: But what I don't want is I'll modify how I speak to you, but I also want you to see that I'm your parent

226
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:55.710
Gwenevere Abriel: My job is to make sure that our values in this home continue to be reflected and this is one of them. And so that that attitude.

227
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:06.120
Gwenevere Abriel: If it's there. I'm going to address it. Because then something still off. I need that to go away. Can you do it in a sweet way. The same way you would you would say Can I have a salt.

228
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.320
Gwenevere Abriel: And see if there's fine. Maybe that's

229
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.000
Cynthia We: Yeah, I feel like that would be

230
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Cynthia We: Great. I feel like he would totally be into that and and that would make him feel

231
00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:25.770
Cynthia We: Good make him feel trusted and it would make Scott and I feel okay you know like okay well you know this is

232
00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.800
Cynthia We: This is what's happening and

233
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:38.280
Cynthia We: You know know check in is scary. For us, it's too scary. I don't. I'm like, you're not in college, you

234
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:42.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Your school system if they were going to be the parent

235
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Ah, what they're not so

236
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:46.950
Cynthia We: Right.

237
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.790
Cynthia We: I feel like

238
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:55.080
Cynthia We: They are just trying to instill they still have conferences with the team with their parents. So it's not like they're

239
00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:03.540
Cynthia We: They're just trying to make them understand that it is their job to get their shit together you know to do their stuff.

240
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.190
Gwenevere Abriel: And it's good for the

241
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.410
Cynthia We: Total. It's great. It's great.

242
00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.170
Gwenevere Abriel: But it's not as if the kid is hearing it.

243
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.480
Cynthia We: Yeah, he's hearing it in a different way.

244
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.420
Gwenevere Abriel: To come out. I don't know need anybody I

245
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:20.190
Cynthia We: Know, it doesn't mean. Right. Well, what does that. What does that mean,

246
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.540
Gwenevere Abriel: That means that we felt we can say, that's great. I can see it. But there was a time

247
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:32.760
Gwenevere Abriel: When it wasn't there. And, you know, in some ways, certainly more so for Scott because he hasn't been here for the progression dad hasn't been here for the progression of your

248
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:45.570
Gwenevere Abriel: Independent accountability hasn't been here for this new normal. I have. So just don't give him a hard time about that. He doesn't know. So let's just let's educate each other and find our companies on

249
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:59.100
Gwenevere Abriel: And if something changes on that Sunday check in. I may go back to every day we agree that's what's going to happen. Okay, fine then. Let's just do it, see if this works and you move on. Yeah.

250
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.630
Cynthia We: I feel like this is a very good solution. I feel like everybody should

251
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:26.940
Cynthia We: Have told me yesterday that she um she was really scared to put her manuscript together, but that she then thought of my story and my brazenness in telling it and it made her feel better and able to put her story together.

252
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.150
Cynthia We: Which I thought was a lovely compliment

253
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.360
Gwenevere Abriel: You've inspired someone

254
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:34.140
Yes.

255
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:36.900
That's amazing.

256
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.930
Gwenevere Abriel: You have a lightness about you today have a sort of

257
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.180
Gwenevere Abriel: I don't know, something just seemed

258
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.400
Like start know

259
00:27:52.170 --> 00:28:01.980
Gwenevere Abriel: What has it been like after you've left meeting with Scott president and meet President and that what what do you, what's the reverberation after those encounters.

260
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.620
Cynthia We: I feel like I'm

261
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.770
Cynthia We: Fine. I don't really feel like

262
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:25.320
Cynthia We: I feel like like I understand him a little bit more. I have a really, we have a really hard time talking to each other.

263
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.250
Cynthia We: Uh huh it without getting you know all emotional and

264
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.040
Cynthia We: I feel like

265
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:39.750
Cynthia We: I have a different understanding and I'm able to deal with him a little bit easier. After meeting with you.

266
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.140
Gwenevere Abriel: Isn't that amazing and I'm not even doing like

267
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.250
Cynthia We: I know it's

268
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.090
Cynthia We: Here.

269
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:55.980
Gwenevere Abriel: We're just doing Schubert but that's, first of all, that's fantastic that's the neat thing a tiny little change can have this big fat. We love it. That's cool.

270
00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.350
Gwenevere Abriel: What about

271
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.320
Gwenevere Abriel: The big piece for you around.

272
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting small

273
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Are you have you caught yourself in moments where that was the option to go to shame to collapse and then maybe get mad at someone right for not seeing your strength. Um, but have you instead played a different kind of I call them games not saying they're conscious, but

274
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.730
Yeah, I'm actually

275
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.040
Cynthia We: Yeah, I mean, this whole thing around Teagan um

276
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.990
Cynthia We: I have just kind of remain silent and disconnected.

277
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.970
Cynthia We: Because I'm so uncomfortable with the

278
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:56.370
Cynthia We: With the arguing and the, um, I just hate conflict and I hate being involved in it and I hate it. I hate it and I

279
00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:07.800
Cynthia We: I know that that's not helpful to him, but I have noticed, I think in the past, I might have been a little more engaged. Um, maybe, but

280
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.210
Cynthia We: I'm not sure I'm not sure if it's a change or if it's just that I'm aware that I'm very disconnected.

281
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:22.350
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we may not have found the answer to my question but information useful none.

282
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:22.710
Cynthia We: Yeah.

283
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.380
Cynthia We: Let's go, Okay, what exactly was your question.

284
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.490
Cynthia We: With regard to just got my like when we're talking about money.

285
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:35.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Or let's do that. Let's just there. We got a nice topic. So just right in there because what I watched you do was

286
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:36.990
Cynthia We: Again,

287
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.430
It's small.

288
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And defer power.

289
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.980
Cynthia We: Uh huh. And then get mad at him for not being able not seeing my strength.

290
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.770
Gwenevere Abriel: So that's, that's my impression is that

291
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.160
Cynthia We: Yeah, it's just crazy. Um,

292
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:54.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Is that

293
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.060
Cynthia We: I think it's awesome that you can see

294
00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:06.990
Cynthia We: All of this just from watching people and I'm really impressed because I feel like I've had these patterns forever and i i don't even recognize them.

295
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.460
Um,

296
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:16.080
Gwenevere Abriel: So, and, you know, what's ironic. I think there's so obvious. I think I'm insulting you by even mentioning it

297
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:17.640
Cynthia We: Really

298
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.340
Cynthia We: Uh huh. Yes, because they're so obvious to you. It's totally, totally not obvious to me at all.

299
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.240
Gwenevere Abriel: That's the privilege.

300
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.640
Cynthia We: Because you're in the right job like this.

301
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.930
Cynthia We: Which were meant to do.

302
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.910
Gwenevere Abriel: Maybe, but also a therapist has this we're way out here.

303
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:34.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, we're not triggered.

304
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:35.790
Cynthia We: Right.

305
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.190
Gwenevere Abriel: All the stories of threat and just

306
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.150
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so, so it, it doesn't

307
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:59.400
Gwenevere Abriel: But that'll be common right for for for therapists to say, well, you know, I can see it. And I see it, the second you come in the door, we can see it, but it's not for us to sort of say, here you go. That's better. That there's little, little crumbs that maybe you

308
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Come to it on your own.

309
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So we just got oh

310
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:04.560
Yeah.

311
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:13.710
Cynthia We: So there is some discussion about what what we're how we're going to

312
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.430
Cynthia We: spend this money and you know because we got a lot back for taxes we got enough back to maybe

313
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.830
Cynthia We: Live for a month.

314
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.470
If we're careful

315
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:34.590
Cynthia We: If we're not careful, we will be in a bad situation again in March, right before it goes to work so

316
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:46.710
Cynthia We: Uh, you know, Scott's resume. We gotta be careful with everything. And I want to sit down and have a talk, I want to talk about like what we're going to do with this. And I'm like, that's a really good idea. I think we should plan it

317
00:32:47.490 --> 00:33:03.660
Cynthia We: Because he's talking about getting his teeth done and and getting his you know his stomach. He needs to have his stomach because his thing is scope Barrett's esophagus and it's just let it go for 10 years at a

318
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:15.060
Cynthia We: He needs to go get it checked. So I found a doctor for him and I found out that she's in that work. So I'm going to actually make the appointment for him so that he will do it.

319
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.250
Cynthia We: And I'm

320
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.030
Cynthia We: And I have a cavity. So

321
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:30.810
Cynthia We: I have to get my teeth fixed right so neither one of us is actually can get our implants with it's not enough money to get implants.

322
00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:43.560
Cynthia We: But it is enough to go get my, you know, see the dentist. I don't pay some bills so I you know he's just like we got to be careful. We gotta be careful with that because I'm like, Can we just make a plan, please let's make a plan.

323
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So now you're the one

324
00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.370
Gwenevere Abriel: Pushing the commandment to something in writing.

325
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.560
Cynthia We: Something in writing. Yeah.

326
00:33:50.040 --> 00:34:05.280
Gwenevere Abriel: So right and that's what I've been encouraging this last session was really more about some dynamics between YouTube but it's interesting because I thought for sure. I'll step back and it'll just carry on and you guys put this plan together and look at it, it's still not done.

327
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.500
Cynthia We: I know what's up with that.

328
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:12.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Because he has his own relationship with money and it's might be

329
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.470
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, like again. Remember that whole

330
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.910
Cynthia We: The the

331
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.050
Gwenevere Abriel: Grid.

332
00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.480
Gwenevere Abriel: You guys probably have some really opposing sort of or maybe parallel

333
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.550
Cynthia We: We didn't score.

334
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah.

335
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.340
Cynthia We: Maybe did that but we didn't score them.

336
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.540
Cynthia We: So I should score them.

337
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:43.530
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, again, let me just say we can meet and if my being here and we won't get distracted by the communication piece and we just lay it out. Just get it done because I'm sitting here going,

338
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:51.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, why would you do it now. Like, just so you know I'm going this is still how much money is it is it

339
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.160
Cynthia We: 4000 3000

340
00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:56.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Is six. Yeah, that's going to be gone really fast.

341
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so

342
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:08.250
Cynthia We: Still getting paid from Ali and he's still getting on employment. So, but, but, but it will be gone really fast. If we do anything like anything out of the ordinary really

343
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:10.530
Gwenevere Abriel: What you guys just talked about it.

344
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:11.670
Cynthia We: Is

345
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: Out of the ordinary. So, for

346
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.800
Gwenevere Abriel: Me. It's more like we go look at the list.

347
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.440
Gwenevere Abriel: I haven't here.

348
00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:26.970
Gwenevere Abriel: What did we say is, OK, medical emergency is a car breaks down.

349
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.410
Gwenevere Abriel: Something sent and all you know that a sentinel event.

350
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:44.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, we have, let me see something I gotta see car race. And was there anything else that was emergency I'm only wrote down medical emergency and car breaks down as an emergency.

351
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.750
Cynthia We: Well, I feel like I'm teeth. TEETH or an emergency.

352
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.550
Cynthia We: If you have pain in your teeth, you must go to the dentist ASAP.

353
00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:02.520
Cynthia We: And that does not include getting all the work done that you need to have done at that moment. It's just that you need to get the

354
00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:07.290
Cynthia We: If it's a root canal, you need to have the root canal. If it's a cavity need to have the cavity fix

355
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.510
Gwenevere Abriel: So your emergency

356
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Then why didn't she put all the money towards that last month.

357
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Coach, but your emergency

358
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.140
Cynthia We: I didn't have an emergency. Last one. So,

359
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.450
Gwenevere Abriel: This two thing happened this week.

360
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.340
Cynthia We: Two days ago. Yeah, okay.

361
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:41.310
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Pain is definitely one I would agree. And this medical condition. I couldn't hear through the tele health but something's going on ongoing with Scott that he needs more maintenance and he hasn't been doing it.

362
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.640
Cynthia We: Yeah Barrett's esophagus. Okay.

363
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.480
Gwenevere Abriel: This is where it gets tricky.

364
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.260
Isn't

365
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.930
Cynthia We: His emergency versus my emergency or

366
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.960
Cynthia We: Like, is that really an emergency.

367
00:36:58.650 --> 00:36:58.890
Gwenevere Abriel: If

368
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:07.560
Cynthia We: That's where you it is at this point. It's an emergency. At this point, because it's been so long and he's been neglecting it and he needs to do it when he's off of work.

369
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:09.060
Cynthia We: Oh no, yeah.

370
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:17.280
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah we we wait, no, that you just found it. He's been it was emergent, a month ago. Also, and it needed to wait because you didn't have the money.

371
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, so it's see what i don't know is if it's going to pull from the basic fundamental things that need to be done. You're about to get a regular income.

372
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:29.100
Cynthia We: And

373
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:35.940
Gwenevere Abriel: It turns out that week. You know, you go get it scheduled you go in and it sounds like it's covered anyway. So is your

374
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:44.220
Cynthia We: Percent. It's a 20% co-insurance so last time for some reason that was like $500

375
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.320
Cynthia We: And I'm

376
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.530
Cynthia We: So that's in mind I'm gonna have to pay five. Well, yeah, but they'll bill you look

377
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.800
Cynthia We: Okay, and one of money, then maybe

378
00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:12.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Getting this stuff written down for February getting everything written down for March and it'll start to get really clear into into April this February and March will be a little clunky because you've got uncertain income.

379
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:25.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Coming in and then it should set up some pretty predictable stuff. But right now, you have some emergency things, but I'm assuming they you tell me today, take priority over Teague intuition.

380
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.090
No.

381
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.390
Cynthia We: I'm not sure that that's smart.

382
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.710
Gwenevere Abriel: This is about your shared values, right, and being able to really sit with

383
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.360
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, let me just say

384
00:38:53.550 --> 00:39:00.720
Gwenevere Abriel: Do you guys have any understanding about what your underlying fears about why this thing has not gotten written yet.

385
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.370
No. Okay.

386
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:16.560
Gwenevere Abriel: It could be there might be an explosion right people might you might yell at each other. Michael badly me. It could be any, anything you know but you don't you don't have a get a best guess.

387
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.200
I have no idea.

388
00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:30.090
Cynthia We: I really, I feel, I would like to say, maybe it's just about the fact that we are just surviving right now and trying to like

389
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.970
Cynthia We: But we're not like I feel like we can breathe.

390
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.170
Cynthia We: We breathe as of yesterday, we can breathe. So maybe that's

391
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.400
Cynthia We: Maybe that's what it is because we couldn't even

392
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.910
Cynthia We: Live. I mean we really, really.

393
00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.640
Gwenevere Abriel: really freaking out. So if you want

394
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.850
Gwenevere Abriel: To be president. Let me know.

395
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:51.630
Okay.

396
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.840
Cynthia We: Are you going to, um,

397
00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:02.550
Cynthia We: Oh, are you going to work on any Saturday.

398
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.830
Cynthia We: And that might be an option or

399
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:19.650
Cynthia We: Um, it feels like he was going to take another day off or morning off like next Friday. But that's not a good thing.

400
00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:29.760
Cynthia We: He was gonna take tomorrow off for a conference with two kids, teachers, but I can't get in because conferences, their books.

401
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.970
Cynthia We: So disregard this

402
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:36.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

403
00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:45.540
Cynthia We: I feel like has Oliver situation is not as urgent, it's probably helpful to them to not have to pay him full every week.

404
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:53.700
Gwenevere Abriel: So yeah, I mean, if it was after my last appointment tomorrow is looks like your time would end at 205

405
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.010
Cynthia We: Really Uh huh.

406
00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:06.060
Gwenevere Abriel: And then you welcome to do sort of what we were doing before. And this might be if you guys could put it a little

407
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.410
Gwenevere Abriel: I guess it might be me wanting it more than you guys do to

408
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.910
Cynthia We: Know, I totally what

409
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.060
Cynthia We: I really want it because I can't, I cannot live with this.

410
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.750
Gwenevere Abriel: Be going to be wrong. I'm never going

411
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.860
Cynthia We: I'm never it will be

412
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:28.230
Gwenevere Abriel: Careful. Be careful. Yeah, I just, I would, I, I'm just thinking just that constant. Be careful, it gives

413
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.870
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, and that might you might be able to say

414
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:42.600
Gwenevere Abriel: You know, maybe I don't want to hear much like you know with what's going on with Tegan. It's like, I don't. I'm gonna

415
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:57.540
Gwenevere Abriel: Take ownership for keeping my commitment to this document. I'm going to do it. But if you could maybe just check in with me the same way with the whole school thing maybe let's check in monday wednesday Sunday, but whatever your thing.

416
00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:04.380
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, let's let's pull it back a little, because I'm getting defensive around the. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful, you know,

417
00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:15.060
Gwenevere Abriel: But this having a writing would be a place for both of you to look at. You could be defining what careful looks like. So you guys are right now doing what you always do, which is

418
00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.470
Not and

419
00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:19.590
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so talk with them.

420
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:28.560
Gwenevere Abriel: See, I really want it and then see if you can meet it. What's the time you guys to 10 o'clock. I guess my time noon.

421
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.960
Gwenevere Abriel: See if you can do that. You'd be my only client this Saturday. I'm seeing some

422
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.670
Gwenevere Abriel: Next, next weekend.

423
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:44.580
Gwenevere Abriel: So, talk with them because before it gets busy and then

425
00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:47.190
Cynthia We: Yeah yeah

426
00:42:48.060 --> 00:43:01.260
Gwenevere Abriel: Think about how much of your arguing goes into it and really looking at, look what we're doing. We're putting it off again, we've been saying it, but we do we really mean it. Neither one of us really want to sit down here, look at this.

427
00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:08.880
Gwenevere Abriel: All right. Um, so you have both of his

428
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.610
Cynthia We: Just say Saturday would work for you or

429
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.600
Gwenevere Abriel: I said 10am Mountain Standard would work if you could pull that off.

430
00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:20.820
Cynthia We: Really nice of you. Thank you. I'll see. I'm sure you will agree,

431
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.510
Gwenevere Abriel: And we won't dilly dally we'll just get right

432
00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:29.820
Cynthia We: Maybe we could even start it before we see you well.

433
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.050
Cynthia We: Obviously, wow.

434
00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.850
Cynthia We: I mean that

435
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.970
Gwenevere Abriel: I mean, that would be pretty cool that would

436
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.680
Cynthia We: Be amazing, but that's the

437
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Reason why you're meeting with me is because you guys

438
00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.880
Gwenevere Abriel: Don't want to sit with the discomfort. I'm guessing of just

439
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.510
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so you guys probably have some kind of

440
00:43:50.160 --> 00:44:01.170
Gwenevere Abriel: Some kind of relationship with this money thing going on. It just isn't isn't sort of that you know either opposites and okay well you just do this thing is something, there's a competing need here.

441
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:09.060
Cynthia We: To witness, but we just, I'm so sorry we didn't do this either. Ed, can we do it a little bit, or is it too late.

442
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:22.440
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh yeah, no, we need we need more time a lot more time. That's okay. This is you, got you. You were focused on stuff going on with parenting and dynamics here and there. That's okay.

443
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:28.620
Gwenevere Abriel: Let me, let me see what we already have developed in here, what we can do all review some preparation things along.

444
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:41.550
Gwenevere Abriel: And I mean, check your resources. We got I'm happy, I'm really so glad that I took a chance to to do this. I like this. I'm going to work, but it did.

445
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:44.310
That's cool.

446
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:46.770
Gwenevere Abriel: Right.

447
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:53.070
Gwenevere Abriel: And even in a car I'm having people put a couple things on the side of their dashboard. I'm like, yeah.

448
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.860
Cynthia We: You know it rewires your brain.

449
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.420
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, yeah.

450
00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:02.460
Cynthia We: And, um, what do you talk about while you're moving your eyes.

451
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:05.220
Gwenevere Abriel: That they're

452
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:17.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Ready. Oh, I'll tell you. Um, yeah. So in general, my particular approaches and attachment focused em, Dr. So I interweave things like your

453
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.290
Sorry, I'm doing two things at once here, pulling up your notes.

454
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.270
Gwenevere Abriel: You're

455
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:26.700
Gwenevere Abriel: Protected figure

456
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.070
Cynthia We: You're nurturing and they're

457
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.090
Gwenevere Abriel: Wise figure weeding them in weaving in positive conditions.

458
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:46.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, yeah. So it's very cool. Okay, yeah, now we've got good stuff here. We've got a container. I've got a distancing metaphor. We did a lot of preparation work already. We're ready to go, actually.

459
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:54.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, so next time we need. We can do this. That's what that was. The other night, but you brought up other things today. That's okay.

460
00:45:55.350 --> 00:46:00.660
Gwenevere Abriel: Um, let me see. I think we're at review. Anyway, so let me just check on something.

461
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.460
Gwenevere Abriel: I want my career back. Can you just make a little statement on that.

462
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.170
Cynthia We: Yeah, I feel

463
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:15.480
Cynthia We: I do feel that I have made some progress there. I have been I did my my upward

464
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:27.720
Cynthia We: Profile I I did that. And then I also did some more research and I found some other resources that might be better. There's a lot of like will pay you.

465
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:42.510
Cynthia We: Will pay you $10 for 500 word article. It's a lot of like really really bottom of the barrel. I'm not too good to do it, but I don't want to get stuck, where I'm writing for, you know, no pay that's supposed to

466
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:48.990
Gwenevere Abriel: Be fun to just do it and then you can quit it whenever he wants you but at least you're going to like fill your so

467
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.030
Cynthia We: Yes. Yeah, what

468
00:46:51.330 --> 00:47:08.790
Cynthia We: Did. Yes, I'm very excited about it and I've also found this thing called the writers den, which I feel I'm really good about they I did. I watched some videos and learn how to pitch. I'm companies this

469
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:25.440
Cynthia We: The only thing that has kept me from not doing it is, it's not my talent. I know that I have the talent. I totally do. So it's just fear and not knowing exactly what to do, how to get work. So I'm this writers den. I feel like they've got all the resources.

470
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:36.810
Cynthia We: Just a million different things and I'm really making progress with my deadline that I made for my book I'm Helga is getting the last chunk.

471
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:52.530
Cynthia We: Today, and we're going to review on Tuesday. And then we are going to, again, that's just edit my writing group on Friday. They also have it the whole thing. And they're reading it and they're going to give me some input, um,

472
00:47:53.850 --> 00:48:05.610
Cynthia We: When she's really good about it. I feel really good about it. I feel like her suggestions have been spot on. And I'm, I'm, have a little bit more confidence because she really has responded well to the writing and to the story.

473
00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.010
Gwenevere Abriel: When you deadline for yourself for the string.

474
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:19.080
Cynthia We: On March 15 is when I'm, I'm going to be just done with the whole edit and I'll be ready to go. And before then they'll we're going to sit down and find some agents to query.

475
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:32.040
Cynthia We: Because that I always thought you just sent your manuscript off to the agents, but you don't there's like a different. It's a separate process. You have to ask them if they want to see it. And so you write a query and then

476
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:38.100
Cynthia We: send that to a bunch of agents and there's a whole bunch of agents to take this kind of stuff. Oh boy.

477
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:45.660
Gwenevere Abriel: All right, let me jump over to, um, I want to respond to my husband's accusations with grace.

478
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:58.320
Gwenevere Abriel: Give me an example of where you're cut proud about that you you really, if someone was watching that you respect and admire and you'd be like, See, look at me.

479
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:11.520
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if they were watching you do this and there was an accusation and you registered with yourself. He is welcome to his opinion of me doesn't happen to be the opinion I have with myself and

480
00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:13.200
Gwenevere Abriel: I'm okay.

481
00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:25.140
Cynthia We: Okay, I feel like maybe after we see you I am more able to remember that this is how I should respond or that this is the way I want to respond. So like

482
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:41.370
Cynthia We: I can't give you a specific example. I don't have one. But, but I do know that I have consciously sets in here. You don't need to respond to that. Like you feel like responding deeper us Bruce

483
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:46.230
Cynthia We: I feel like at least maybe I am remind reminding myself to breathe.

484
00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:53.190
Cynthia We: When you are at the forefront of my mind like what I have just met with you.

485
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.570
Cynthia We: That day, and maybe the day

486
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:57.930
Cynthia We: After right so I feel like the next step is to

487
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.780
Cynthia We: Remember all the time.

488
00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:07.230
Gwenevere Abriel: We know you know what could be happening. And this wouldn't be uncommon for people

489
00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:23.760
Gwenevere Abriel: Right, if this therapist type right this one that's, you know, theoretically, got it all together knows what to say. She's emotionally regulated, she's you know can handle all this stuff. She's the adult

490
00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:29.160
Gwenevere Abriel: Versus this rigid right this is the the inner child stuff.

491
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:29.520
Cynthia We: Right.

492
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:46.110
Gwenevere Abriel: Says you better and you're a bad girl this finger wagging parent inside of us. And this shamed small defeated little girl, what could be happening and I invited and I eventually and sooner than later. I want it to be you.

493
00:50:46.170 --> 00:51:00.240
Gwenevere Abriel: As an adult, but for now you borrow this idea of and you're not alone. It's like okay I can hear your voice. I could see you. I can hear that. That thing you said, and I tried it on and I did it, you know. And yeah, and it's borrow

494
00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:03.120
Cynthia We: Quarterly, I could see that. Definitely. Yeah.

495
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:05.250
Gwenevere Abriel: So what great

496
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.010
Cynthia We: Mystery. Yes, that's a nice transition

497
00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:09.900
Cynthia We: Or when it's going to be

498
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:10.980
Cynthia We: My adult

499
00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:16.650
Gwenevere Abriel: And and the truth is, I wasn't there in Santa Fe. It was you. Yeah, you're right.

500
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.160
Gwenevere Abriel: It was, you know, okay.

501
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:26.430
Gwenevere Abriel: And we all pull right. That's why I'm talking about these figures. These protective figures.

502
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:27.210
Cynthia We: Yeah, I love that.

503
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:41.400
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, we pull these experiences from all over the place and are they true for me. Can I embody this, I want to have that too. That's an attribute that feels right for me. Let me do that and see if I get my needs met. That way that wish you

504
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:57.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, good. Yeah. Nice, nice. Okay, next one. We've got here. What did I write for this one. You've been taking a deep breath and then also kind of pulling up this sort of image of what would adult do right now and you can paint a picture, whatever. What would she say what does she do

505
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:06.390
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, the breath and at least you can, you've got that and your brain will function better after you freeze. You'll think of, you know, graceful solutions to something

506
00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:15.930
Gwenevere Abriel: And then get off Suboxone as medically directed. Are you following him the medication as prescribed.

507
00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:22.290
Cynthia We: I am, yes. And I do have a doctor's appointment today at 1245

508
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:26.370
Cynthia We: Because remember, I brought up the

509
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:28.980
Gwenevere Abriel: Thing in group and

510
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.060
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah, that's scary.

511
00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:38.940
Cynthia We: Yeah, but I am going to go and I'm going to tell them my symptoms and and let them do

512
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.010
Gwenevere Abriel: Their job. You don't have to do all the things

513
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.750
Cynthia We: I don't have to do other work for them.

514
00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:44.430
Gwenevere Abriel: Let them.

515
00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:48.060
Cynthia We: Are really don't want to hear my opinion, my Google opinion.

516
00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:49.830
Gwenevere Abriel: Oh, I don't think

517
00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.250
Cynthia We: My Google opinion is that I am just in Munich just

518
00:52:53.760 --> 00:53:00.900
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay but include it because they might be moving too fast. And you might be onto something there for sure and been flying

519
00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:09.270
Gwenevere Abriel: To what else I want to address a relapse prevention plan. Okay, so that's here.

520
00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.200
Cynthia We: We're going to talk about smoking. I think we're going to add smoking to this. Okay.

521
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:13.740
Gwenevere Abriel: Well,

522
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:19.200
Gwenevere Abriel: In your own. Let's do it. I don't have a lot of time. So here we go. What's your goal. Say it in your own words what

523
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:24.690
Gwenevere Abriel: Was my to do I want to quit smoking. Wow, that's exciting. Oh.

524
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:35.190
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, and the objective that will get you there. What is a small achievable goal step that we can measure over the next 30 days. What are you going to do and

525
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:39.180
Cynthia We: I love this, the solution of

526
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:52.920
Cynthia We: Putting off the cigarette like putting off one cigarette a day and I was doing it at night. First, just doing one, but I've been doing it all the time. Like when I want to smoke instead of smoking. I put it off.

527
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.250
Gwenevere Abriel: 90 seconds to me you delay it like that.

528
00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:00.570
Cynthia We: Way. Yeah, but I don't need not 90 seconds. Like, it ends up being hours.

529
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.310
Cynthia We: Oh, great.

530
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:05.130
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay.

531
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.930
Cynthia We: So how about using my add to it to my advantage.

532
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:18.120
Gwenevere Abriel: Exactly why not distract yourself for six you're off doing three other things. That's great. Yeah, he

533
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.780
Gwenevere Abriel: Got when know

534
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:39.180
Gwenevere Abriel: Just take it from there. Okay, so is it that you want to keep that the objective is, I want to use the postpone gratification technique I want to continue to do it daily or is it five times a day. Is it 10 times

535
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:40.080
Gwenevere Abriel: How many

536
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.280
Cynthia We: I want to do it.

537
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.480
Cynthia We: Daily like three times a day.

538
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.880
Gwenevere Abriel: There we go. And how many are you currently doing it.

539
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.300
Cynthia We: I'm at least one

540
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:58.020
Gwenevere Abriel: Okay, so we'll go so measurable is from zero to three times a day, and then we'll be able to see if it's happening. Okay. Yeah.

541
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.590
Cynthia We: Because yeah, because sometimes

542
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.830
Cynthia We: Like yesterday, I probably did it five times.

543
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:11.310
Cynthia We: Um, I only smoke cigarettes a day between five and 10 so

544
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:16.170
Cynthia We: I feel like it's a great way to just keep making it smaller and smaller.

545
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.420
Cynthia We: It's very painless and I like that.

546
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.650
Gwenevere Abriel: Yeah. Okay, very cool. Sorry, get back to me with what you and Scott want to do

547
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.720
Cynthia We: Yes, I will. First, the weekend.
